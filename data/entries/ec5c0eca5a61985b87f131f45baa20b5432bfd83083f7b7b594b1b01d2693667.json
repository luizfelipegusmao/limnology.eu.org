Our study sought to investigate whether abnormal laboratory values were associated with worse outcomes. METHODSThis was a retrospective case-control study from March 2020 to June 2020. Patients with MIS-C were compared to a control group. Laboratory values were compared whether admitted to PICU or not. The Pearson’s Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were conducted for associations.  RESULTSA total of 80 patients were included in the study (41MISC, 39 control). There were significant associations between patients admitted to the PICU and neutrophilia (p = 0.03) and elevated troponin (p = 0.01).  There were no significant associations between having a non-good outcome and obesity, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, or elevated troponin. When MIS-C patients were compared to the control group MISC-C patients had more obesity and elevated troponin.  CONCLUSIONSPatients admitted to the PICU had more neutrophilia and elevated troponin yet had a fairly good outcome.  When compared to control patients, there was a significant association with obesity and elevated troponin in the MIS-C group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec5c0eca5a61985b87f131f45baa20b5432bfd83083f7b7b594b1b01d2693667","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
