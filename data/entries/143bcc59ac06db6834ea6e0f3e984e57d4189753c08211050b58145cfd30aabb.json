{"title":"Yeast cell biocarrier for the encapsulation of ascorbic acid: effect of plasmolysis process, suspension media and ascorbic acid levels on the physicochemical, morphological and bioactive properties of microcapsules","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13919?af=R","date":1727957041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin and shows weak stability against external factors such as heat, oxygen, light etc. Due to its lower stability, encapsulation is an effective process for the preservation of its activity. Although there are a wide variety of encapsulation methods, the technique of encapsulation with yeast cells has been followed with increasing interest in recent years. In this study, encapsulation possibilities of ascorbic acid by yeast cells were investigated. In this context, <i>Saccharomycess cerevisiae</i> yeast cells in plasmolyzed and non-plasmolyzed forms were used in two different suspension media (water and ethanol) and effect of ascorbic acid concentrations (10, 20 and 50 g per 10 g yeast) were studied. A total of 12 different yeast microcapsule samples were produced and some physicochemical, bioactive and structural characterizations were performed.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The ascorbic acid level of yeast microcapsule samples was determined as 206.4–713.9 and 202.8–726.1 mg g<sup>−1</sup> for plasmolyzed and non-plasmolyzed yeast cell types, respectively. ABTS radical scavenging activity increased from 27.23 to 233.04 μg TE g<sup>−1</sup> by increased ascorbic acid levels. Ascorbic acid capsules were used in soft candy processing against free ascorbic acid and it was found that 47.9% ascorbic acid loss was detected for control sample at the 24-day storage while the ascorbic acid loss was approximately 25% for yeast microcapsules.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>It was concluded that yeast cells are capable of preserving ascorbic acid stability during storage and yeast cells can be used effectively and safely for the manufacturing of the ascorbic acid microcapsules. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Gamze Hatip, \nKevser Karaman","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"143bcc59ac06db6834ea6e0f3e984e57d4189753c08211050b58145cfd30aabb","category":"Environment"}
