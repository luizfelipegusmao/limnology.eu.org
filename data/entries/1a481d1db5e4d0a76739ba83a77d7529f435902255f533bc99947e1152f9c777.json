{"title":"On Violations to the Time-of-Flight Assumptions in Atom Probe Tomography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.016/7719426?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Atom probe tomography is based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In this technique, a trigger pulse strikes the tip of a needle shaped sample and causes the time-correlated evaporation of one or more ions. A DC voltage is applied to the specimen that accelerates the evaporated ions toward a two-dimensional detector where the time and position of each ion hit is recorded relative to the time the trigger pulse was incident on the specimen apex. Under the assumption of instantaneous acceleration of the ion, the mass-to-charge (<span>m/z</span>) of the ion(s) can then be calculated using the canonical time-of-flight equation (Figure 1a). For the <span>m/z</span> to be well-defined, the accelerating voltage, flight length, time zero, and ion hit time must all be known [<a href=\"#ozae044.016-B1\">1</a>]. Most of the time these inputs are indeed known, however, in our work we have found cases where one or more of these variables is ill-defined. In this presentation we will discuss three cases where calculation of the ion(s) <span>m/z</span> is difficult due to poorly defined input variables and how that impacts the resulting data.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1a481d1db5e4d0a76739ba83a77d7529f435902255f533bc99947e1152f9c777","category":"Environment"}
