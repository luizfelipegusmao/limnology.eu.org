{"title":"Optimization of Process Parameters for Stir Casting of Tib2 Reinforced In-Situ Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1502/v1","date":1711437946000,"content":"The research paper investigates the synthesis of metal matrix composites (MMCs) through the amalgamation of aluminum and silicon carbide particles, employing a two-step mixing methodology called the stir casting method. Metal matrix composites are materials that enhance the capabilities of a metallic matrix by incorporating another material. This leads to better characteristics such as tensile and shear moduli, fatigue and fracture properties, thermal expansion coefficient, and more. Aluminum-matrix composites are a class of materials that possess distinct characteristics that may be modified by altering factors such as the type of reinforcing material, the amount of reinforcement, and the fabrication technique employed to produce the composite. The concept aims to combine the desirable properties of metals and ceramics by incorporating durable refractory particles into a malleable metal structure. The fabrication process employs the stir casting technique, where reinforcing phases are mechanically stirred into a molten matrix to create cast composites with reinforcement volume percentages of up to 30%. The study utilizes Response Surface Methodology to enhance the mechanical properties of the composites through the optimization of manufacturing parameters, including stirring temperature, time, and speed. The study entails analyzing the correlation between different casting conditions and the resulting changes in hardness and tensile strength.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce67b044ca01e53d8bd7097d551ddced2b15765a85a6987730fb5aa7935073d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
