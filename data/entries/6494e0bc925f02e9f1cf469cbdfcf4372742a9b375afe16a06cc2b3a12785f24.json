It is carried out by ribosomes in conjunction with accessory proteins, including initiation, elongation, and termination factors, as well as transfer RNAs and transfer RNA synthetases. In theory, this process can occur on any RNA molecule with an open reading frame (ORF), a sequence of nucleotides that begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Reliably identifying and annotating ORFs is an important first step in uncovering the biological function of the molecules they encode.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"6494e0bc925f02e9f1cf469cbdfcf4372742a9b375afe16a06cc2b3a12785f24","category":"Environment"}
