{"title":"Role of Inflammation and the NF-&kappa;B Signaling Pathway in Hirschsprung Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1531/v1","date":1718968429000,"content":"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, incidence 1/5000 live births) is caused by failure of neural crest-derived precursors to migrate, survive, proliferate or differentiate during the embryonic development of the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), which could be disrupted by many factors, in-cluding inflammatory processes. The NF-κB family controls several biological processes includ-ing inflammation, neurogenesis and cell migration. With the aim of studying the potential role of NF-κB in HSCR, we have analyzed the expression of the NF-κB main subunits and other NF-κB-related genes by RT-qPCR in HSCR tissue samples (sub-divided in ganglionic and agan-glionic segments). We found a decreased gene expression of the NF-κB main subunit RelA/p65, but also of IkBα, TNF-α, TFGBR2 and ERBB3 in the pathologic distal aganglionic segments com-pared to the proximal ganglionic segments. Moreover, we could also confirm the lower protein expression of RelA/p65 in the aganglionic distal segments by immunofluorescence staining. Fur-ther, we show that the expression of RelA/p65 in the proximal segments concurs with lymphocyte infiltration in the bowel tissue, indicating a pro-inflammatory activation of p65 in the proximal ganglionic HSCR tissue in the patients analyzed. In all, our findings suggest that the modulation of NF-κB signaling in the neuro-enteric system does obviously contribute to the pathological ef-fects in HSCR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aea0e273050baa8872df18b05ca919adf6ffe4febc6a3b93300df7b641a46f1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
