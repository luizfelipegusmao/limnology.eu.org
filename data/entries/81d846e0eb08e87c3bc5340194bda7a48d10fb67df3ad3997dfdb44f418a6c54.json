{"title":"Electrochemical Analysis of Corrosion Resistance of Manga-nese-Coated Annealed Steel: Chronoamperometric and Volta-metric Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0368/v1","date":1722940775000,"content":"Metal corrosion poses a significant challenge for industries by decreasing the lifespan of materials and escalat-ing maintenance and replacement costs. This study is critically important as it assesses the corrosion resistance properties of annealed steel wire electrodes coated with manganese, employing chronoamperometry and linear voltammetry techniques. The electrodes were immersed in an electrolyte solution and subjected to chronoam-perometry at various voltages (-0.55 V, -0.60 V, and -0.70 V) and durations (60 seconds and 1800 seconds). Sub-sequently, linear voltammetry was performed over a potential range from -0.8 V to 0.8 V to generate Tafel plots. The Butler-Volmer equation was applied to the data obtained to determine the corrosion current density. The re-sults indicate that the optimal conditions for forming a highly effective protective manganese layer occur at a potential of -0.70 V for 1800 seconds. Under these conditions, the electrodes exhibited superior corrosion re-sistance. The study also revealed that shorter durations and less negative potentials led to less effective manga-nese coatings, with higher corrosion rates and reduced stability. These findings are significant for developing ef-ficient corrosion protection methods in industrial and research applications, providing clear parameters for op-timizing the manganese electrodeposition process on annealed steel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81d846e0eb08e87c3bc5340194bda7a48d10fb67df3ad3997dfdb44f418a6c54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
