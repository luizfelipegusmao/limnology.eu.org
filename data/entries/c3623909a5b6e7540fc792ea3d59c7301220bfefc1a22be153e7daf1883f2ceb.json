{"title":"Comparing the Ground Reaction Forces, Toe Clearances, and Stride Lengths of Young and Older Adults Using a Novel Shoe Sensor System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0608/v1","date":1725864180000,"content":"In this study, we developed a lightweight shoe sensor system equipped with four high-capacity, compact triaxial force sensors and an inertial measurement unit. Remarkably, this system enabled measurements of localized three-directional ground reaction forces (GRFs) at each sensor position (heel, first and fifth metatarsal heads, and toe) and estimations of stride length and toe clearance during walking. Compared to conventional optical motion analysis systems, the developed sensor system provided relatively accurate results for stride length and minimum toe clearance. To test the performance of the system, 15 older and eight young adults were instructed to walk along a straight-line while wearing the system. The results revealed that compared to the young adults, older adults exhibited lower localized GRF contributions from the heel and greater localized GRF contribution from the toe and fifth metatarsal locations. Furthermore, the older adults exhibited greater variability in their stride length and smaller toe clearance with greater variability compared to the young adults. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed gait analysis system in distinguishing the gait characteristics of young and older adults, potentially replacing traditional motion capture systems and force plates in gait analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3623909a5b6e7540fc792ea3d59c7301220bfefc1a22be153e7daf1883f2ceb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
