{"title":"Disproving Two Widely Accepted Notions Regarding Entropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0655/v2","date":1712925480000,"content":"This article systematically disproves the notion that entropy is a measure of disorder and disproves Schrödinger's notion of negative entropy (negentropy) using multiple novel and compelling arguments. To mathematically describe the second law of thermodynamics, the concept of entropy was created and defined in the 1860s as heat energy divided by thermodynamic temperature, and the entropy of an object increases when it absorbs heat. This is the uncontroversial and fundamental nature of entropy, which is pivotal to current thermodynamics and from which multiple facts are deduced. These facts consistently disprove the above two widely accepted notions. Multiple biological facts (e.g., life orderliness is encoded and provided by inherited genes rather than entropy decline) can also disprove Schrödinger's negentropy notion. This article further elucidates the reasoning errors of the two notions. Moreover, the second law of thermodynamics and the notion that many natural or social systems tend to become more disordered over time result from distinct statistical probabilities and are hence independent of each other.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ec954ff311674759b9279b45aae772ebd29f09f48bdba49220ece1e1dd4e1e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
