{"title":"ERα Coregulator TRIM28 Promotes Breast Cancer Progression by Activating the AKT/GSK3β Pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24373?af=R","date":1723035288000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Estrogen receptor α (ERα) promotes the growth and survival of ER-positive breast cancer (BC) cells. ER regulates ER expression target genes by directly binding to specific estrogen response elements, upon activation by estrogens. In this study, 106 proteins interacting with endogenous chromatin-bound ER in a BC cell line MCF7 were identified using the RIME method. The interactome data showed that the tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is the most significantly enriched ER-associated protein. This study provides evidence that TRIM28 expression improves ER transcriptional activity and promotes the BC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells. The high expression of TRIM28 is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with ER-positive BC. Mechanistic experiments indicate that TRIM28 expression activates the AKT/GSK3β pathway. To conclude, TRIM28 acts as a regulatory protein of ER and AKT signaling; therefore, it can be a target for the therapeutic interventions of BC.</p>","author":"Linlin Fu, \nBaodong Ma, \nLan Zhang, \nHuikang Xu, \nWei Chen, \nDi Wu, \nFeng Gao, \nYanping Huo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"caf158399563f37ef546f06e89020b90137b3d58d34b5fbc0ea066c1b6f2b188","category":"Environment"}
