{"title":"High-Dimensional Spectral Analysis of Natural Killer Cell Alterations Identifies a Subgroup with an Enhanced Daratumumab Treatment Response in Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1516/v1","date":1716460474000,"content":"Objective: Daratumumab (Dara) is the first-in-class human-specific anti-CD38 mAb approved for treating multiple myeloma (MM). However, DARA-induced depletion of CD38high natural killer (NK) cells results in crippled antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which limits its clinical detection and prediction for Dara efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to explore new NK subsets that could predict Dara efficacy and the underlying mechanism in Dara development.\nMethods: Multicolour spectral flow cytometry monitored changes in the immune cells of 13 paired RRMM patients. We used machine learning-driven clustering, FlowSOM (Flow Self-Organizing Maps), and dimensional reduction with tSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) to identify unique cell populations pre- and posttreatment. Then, in vitro, fratricide and proliferation assays were performed to explore the function of new NK subsets against MM under Dara treatment.\nResults: The NK cells were divided into 25 subsets, among which we found that the percentages of KIR-NKP46+ NK cells decreased in paired RRMM patients compared to healthy controls but increased significantly post-Dara treatment. The fold change in KIR-NKP46+ after one dose of Dara treatment can predict whether the best response could be achieved within one month (ROC=0.86, p=0.011). Further in vitro experiments showed that KIR-NKP46+ NK cells are superior to KIR+ NK cells, cooperatively acting with daratumumab to sustainably eradicate MM cells. Meanwhile, apoptosis was significantly decreased, and the proliferation ability was relatively increased post-Dara treatment.\nConclusion: In conclusion, the fold change in KIR-NKP46+ NK cell subsets after one dose of Dara treatment can predict the outcome of the curative effect, indicating a putative role of KIR-NKP46+ subsets against MM cells. The mechanism attributed to a relative expansion of the subset due to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation ability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85197ae0865553c9389552691681006e2f32ec9ab9629a212c313009af5275db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
