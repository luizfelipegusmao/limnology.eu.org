{"title":"Reproductive safety of STING agonists MSA-2 and manganese-MSA-2","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae172/7820072?rss=1","date":1728777600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>MSA-2, as an oral molecule for activating STING signaling pathway to cure the tumor entering clinical trials. The toxicity of MSA-2 has aroused wide concern, especially the reproductive toxicity can not be ignored.<div>Objectives</div>We synthesized the STING agonist (MSA-2) and its derivative manganese-MSA-2 (MSA-2-Mn) and investigated the reproductive toxicity.<div>Methods</div>We evaluated the reproductive effects of MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn in female mice under the administration alone and on the reproductive system of male mice in the presence or absence of combined radiation.<div>Results</div>Results suggested that MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn have negligible reproductive toxicity in healthy adults. Conclusions: This provides new ideas to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, as well as favorable evidence for future systemic dosing in patients of reproductive age and clinical trials of immunotherapy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"76526ea2963b7e6f020380f29338d3c9cc2b36b84488f3ca794823e5c58aa396","category":"Environment"}
