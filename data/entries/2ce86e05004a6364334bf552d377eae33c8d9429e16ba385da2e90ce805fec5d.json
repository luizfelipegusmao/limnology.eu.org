{"title":"Functional support vector machine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/4/1178/7627802?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Linear and generalized linear scalar-on-function modeling have been commonly used to understand the relationship between a scalar response variable (e.g. continuous, binary outcomes) and functional predictors. Such techniques are sensitive to model misspecification when the relationship between the response variable and the functional predictors is complex. On the other hand, support vector machines (SVMs) are among the most robust prediction models but do not take account of the high correlations between repeated measurements and cannot be used for irregular data. In this work, we propose a novel method to integrate functional principal component analysis with SVM techniques for classification and regression to account for the continuous nature of functional data and the nonlinear relationship between the scalar response variable and the functional predictors. We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive simulation experiments and two real data applications: the classification of alcoholics using electroencephalography signals and the prediction of glucobrassicin concentration using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Our methods especially have more advantages when the measurement errors in functional predictors are relatively large.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"2ce86e05004a6364334bf552d377eae33c8d9429e16ba385da2e90ce805fec5d","category":"Environment"}
