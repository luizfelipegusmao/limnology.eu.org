{"title":"Impact of Internet Use on Health Status in China: Evidence Based on A national Longitudinal Survey Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0114/v1","date":1722586936000,"content":"Previous studies have examined the impact of Internet use on health in China, but they have not adequately addressed the issue of reverse causality or conducted a detailed analysis of health status. This study uses three waves of longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies conducted in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to investigate the association between Internet use and health status in China, aiming to address these gaps. The results indicate that Internet use may improve health status, including self-rated health, mental health, and outpatient visits. These effects vary by gender and age group: the positive effect of Internet use on health outcomes is more pronounced for women, and for middle-aged and older generations, compared to men and younger generations. These findings provide new evidence of the beneficial impact of Internet use on health outcomes in China, suggesting that policies promoting Internet utilization could enhance individualsâ€™ health status, particularly among women and middle-aged and older populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04ab44921a89607af356d2580846749b82197848e9a75b1bcda7b2706621bdf9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
