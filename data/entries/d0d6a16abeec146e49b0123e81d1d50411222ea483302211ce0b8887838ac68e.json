{"title":"Long‐term culture system for deep‐sea mussels Gigantidas childressi","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10612?af=R","date":1713433597000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The simulation of deep-sea conditions in laboratories is technically challenging but necessary for experiments that aim at a deeper understanding of physiological mechanisms or host-symbiont interactions of deep-sea organisms. In a proof-of-concept study, we designed a recirculating system for long-term culture (&gt;2 yr) of deep-sea mussels <i>Gigantidas childressi</i> (previously <i>Bathymodiolus childressi</i>). Mussels were automatically (and safely) supplied with a maximum stable level of ~60 <i>μ</i>mol L<sup>−1</sup> methane in seawater using a novel methane–air mixing system. Experimental animals also received daily doses of live microalgae. Condition indices of cultured <i>G. childressi</i> remained high over the years, and low shell growth rates could be detected, too, which is indicative of positive energy budgets. Using stable isotope data, we demonstrate that <i>G. childressi</i> in our culture system gained energy, both, from the digestion of methane-oxidizing endosymbionts and from digesting particulate food (microalgae). Limitations of the system, as well as opportunities for future experimental approaches involving deep-sea mussels, are discussed.</p>","author":"Claas Hiebenthal, \nFinn‐Ole Gehlert, \nMark Schmidt, \nThorsten B.
