{"title":"The Entropy of the Collapsing Molecular Cloud","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2089/v1","date":1717135811000,"content":"The study of the change in entropy during the formation of stars in collapsing molecular clouds is an important area of research in astrophysics. As the cloud decreases in size, the presence of gases leads to an increase in entropy. However, the extent of this change in entropy is influenced by the amount of space available for the gases. In this scientific investigation, I conduct a detailed analysis of entropy on a small scale within the contracting cloud, following the principles of the second law of thermodynamics. Initially, my focus is on a turbulent cloud composed of N particles with a mass of M, which collapses under the force of gravity. It becomes clear that in order for the collapse to occur, gravitational energy must overcome other pressure forces that oppose it. This process results in the rapid movement of particles within the cloud, ultimately leading to a change in entropy","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be57c68e2b7e348b46706e94d5920d519ce1df4b462710a35bd0435a02732bbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
