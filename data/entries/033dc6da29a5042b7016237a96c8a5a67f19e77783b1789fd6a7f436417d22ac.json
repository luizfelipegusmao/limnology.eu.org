{"title":"Spin Phase Space Entropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1590/v1","date":1711459592000,"content":"Quantum physics is intrinsically probabilistic. The entropy of a quantum state quantifies the amount of randomness (or information loss) of such state. The degrees of freedom of a quantum state are position and spin, and upon their specification  Born's rule in phase space defines randomness. We focus on the spin degree of freedom and elucidate the spin entropy. Then, we present some of its properties and show how entanglement increases spin entropy.  Some speculative predictions on the decay of the $Z^0,W^{+,-}$ gauge bosons conclude the paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"033dc6da29a5042b7016237a96c8a5a67f19e77783b1789fd6a7f436417d22ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
