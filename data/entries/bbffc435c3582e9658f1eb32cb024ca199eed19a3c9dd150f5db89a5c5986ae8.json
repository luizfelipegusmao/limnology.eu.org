{"title":"Simple Method to Enhance the Molecular Weight of Polyfurfuryl Alcohol Resin Using A Straightforward Co-Catalytic System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0645/v1","date":1712650863000,"content":"This study represents a significant stride in advancing furan chemistry, presenting the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) resin (Mw = 118,959 g/mol) from furfuryl alcohol (FA) using a co-catalytic system as against the conventional single-catalytic methods. The resulting PFA resin is fully characterised, and we conclude that it exhibits good shelf life and potential in diverse applications, serving as a standalone moulded material or contributing to composites, coatings, adhesives, and nanostructured carbons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbffc435c3582e9658f1eb32cb024ca199eed19a3c9dd150f5db89a5c5986ae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
