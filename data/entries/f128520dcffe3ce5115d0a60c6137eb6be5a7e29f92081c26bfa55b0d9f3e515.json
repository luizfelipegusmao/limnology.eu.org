The ions in the solar wind are dominated by hydrogen (∼96%) and helium (∼4%) with the remaining &lt;1% being other ion species in rough proportionality to their abundance at the Sun’s surface [<a href=\"#ozae044.094-B1\">1</a>]. The radiation-induced physical, chemical, and optical changes, in addition to those caused by micrometeoroid impacts and related processes, are collectively known as space weathering. A significant body of work on space weathering on the Moon has been generated over the 50+ years since the return of the first Apollo lunar samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.094-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.094-B3\">3</a>], and we continue to refine our understanding of these processes on other bodies with returned asteroid samples from the Hayabusa, Hayabusa2, and OSIRIS-REx missions [<a href=\"#ozae044.094-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.094-B5\">5</a>]. However, knowledge of where the volatile solar wind ions are retained in surface materials has been limited, as few techniques have both the necessary spatial and chemical sensitivity to address this question. Work on bulk samples and on individual grains clearly indicates that H and He are both elevated in the very thin surface rim of irradiated grains [<a href=\"#ozae044.094-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.094-B7\">7</a>], with the amount present depending strongly on the specific phases and the length of their exposure. For instance, ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>) contains significantly more He than does silicate phases such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) or pyroxene ((Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub>) [<a href=\"#ozae044.094-B8\">8</a>]. Of particular interest is understanding the role of solar wind H in the lunar hydration cycle and the surface water and ice signals detected using remote sensing techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.094-B9\">9</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f128520dcffe3ce5115d0a60c6137eb6be5a7e29f92081c26bfa55b0d9f3e515","category":"Environment"}
