{"title":"Analysis of Associated Woody and Semi-woody Local Wild Species in Entre R&iacute;os, Argentina: Exploring the Agricultural Potential of Hexachlamys edulis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0304/v1","date":1725444668000,"content":"The loss of native forests in Argentina has been a concern, driven by factors such as agriculture expansion and urbanization. Therefore, understanding the conservation status of sampled populations and their adaptation to different plant communities is essential. This research focused on the heterogeneity analysis of the associated woody and semi-woody vegetation to Hexachlamys edulis (O. Berg) Kausel &amp; D. Legrand, a species commonly known as \"ubajay,\" in Entre RÃ­os, Argentina. The study aimed to record the species present in the populations, explore plant communities associated with H. edulis and identify other potentially useful agroforestry species, compare locations based on the similarity of accompanying species, and explain the conservation status of each population. Results revealed a total of 71 species belonging to 39 families. Myrtaceae family was the most relevant, particularly in terms of native species representation. The analysis of biodiversity indicators, including richness, Shannon index and dominance revealed variations among the studied sites. The anthropic indicator highlighted the impact of human activity, with Concordia showing a higher ratio of native to exotic species. Cluster analysis and ordination techniques revealed groupings of censuses from the same localities, indicating differences in vegetation composition between sites. Significant differences in species composition were found among the sampled populations. Overall, the study can serve as baseline information for future research on the dynamics of vegetation in these areas and on H. edulis studied species. Finally, these findings contribute to understanding how wild species like H. edulis adapt to different plant communities, which might be valuable for developing new agroecological approaches or identifying potential companion planting species in future agricultural systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cab7fe55041b40995d3648f360e0017d9903e8a659262e484d031344ac99d529","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
