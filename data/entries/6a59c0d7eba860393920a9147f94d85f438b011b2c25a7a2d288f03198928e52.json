{"title":"Waterborne Gastrointestinal Diseases and Child Mortality: A Study of Socioeconomic Inequality in Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1960/v1","date":1724759225000,"content":"In Mexico, 1.9% of child mortality among children aged 3 to 15 years is attributed to waterborne gastrointestinal diseases (WGD). This study employs a generalized bivariate logit econometric model to simulate the relationships between mortality risks and seven explanatory variables. Based on the model results and sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters, a set of policies was designed to reduce the likelihood of child mortality. The proposed strategy involves im-plementing the following public policies, primarily targeting communities with extreme and high marginalization: increasing access to drinking water, improving housing conditions, expanding parental basic education coverage, and providing nutrition and healthcare to children from an early age. The findings reveal that children who speak an indigenous language face a mortality risk from WGD that is three times higher than those who do not, while children who receive medical services have a 29% lower risk of mortality compared to those who do not have access to them. It is recommended to offer free medical care in indigenous languages within high-marginalization communities. The combined impact of these policies is expected to signifi-cantly reduce child mortality due to WGD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a59c0d7eba860393920a9147f94d85f438b011b2c25a7a2d288f03198928e52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
