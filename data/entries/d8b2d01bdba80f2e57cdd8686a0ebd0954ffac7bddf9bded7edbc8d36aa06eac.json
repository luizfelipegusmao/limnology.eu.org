{"title":"Small peptide CSF fingerprint of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302280","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Rea Lumi, Susanne Petri, Justyna Siwy, Agnieszka Latosinska, Julia Raad, Petra Zürbig, Thomas Skripuletz, Harald Mischak, Joachim Beige</p>\r\nBackground <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal protein aggregation in the motor neurons. Present and earlier proteomic studies to characterize peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associated with motoneuron pathology did not target low molecular weight proteins and peptides. We hypothesized that specific changes in CSF peptides or low molecular weight proteins are significantly altered in ALS, and that these changes may support deciphering molecular pathophysiology and even guide approaches towards therapeutic interventions.</p> Methods <p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 50 ALS patients and 50 non-ALS controls was collected, centrifuged immediately after collection, aliquoted into polypropylene test tubes, frozen within 30–40 min after the puncture, and stored at −80°C until use. Peptides were sequenced using capillary electrophoresis or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS).</p> Findings <p>In the CSF of 50 patients and 50 non-ALS controls 33 peptides were found, of which 14 could be sequenced using a non-lytic single-pot proteomic detection method, CE/MS. ALS deregulated peptides vs. controls included Integral membrane protein 2B, Neurosecretory protein VGF, Osteopontin, Neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (Secretogranin-V), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, Xylosyltransferase 1 XT-1, Chromogranin-A, Superoxide dismutase SOD-1, Secretogranin-1 (Chromogranin B), NR2F2 Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2 Group F Member 2 and Collagen alpha-1(VII) chain.</p> Interpretation <p>Most striking deregulations in CSF from ALS patients were found in VGF, Osteopontin, SOD-1 and EFEMP1 peptides. No associations of disease severity, duration and region of onset with sequenced peptides were found.</p>","author":"Rea Lumi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d8b2d01bdba80f2e57cdd8686a0ebd0954ffac7bddf9bded7edbc8d36aa06eac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
