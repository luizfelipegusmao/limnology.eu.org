However, little is known about <span>S. polyschides</span> with regard to ecological functioning and population dynamics across its geographical range. Here we examined the population demography of <span>S. polyschides</span> populations in southwest UK, located within the species’ range centre, to address a regional knowledge gap and to provide a baseline against which to detect future changes.<div>Methods</div>Intertidal surveys were conducted during spring low tides at three sites along a gradient of wave exposure in Plymouth Sound (Western English Channel) over a period of 15 months. Density, cover, age, biomass and morphology of <span>S. polyschides</span> were quantified. Additionally, less frequent sampling of shallow subtidal reefs was conducted to compare intertidal and subtidal populations.<div>Key Results</div>We recorded pronounced seasonality, with fairly consistent demographic patterns across sites and depths. By late summer, <span>S. polyschides</span> was a dominant habitat-former on both intertidal and subtidal reefs, with maximum standing stock exceeding 13 000 g wet weight m<sup>−2</sup>.<div>Conclusions</div><span>Saccorhiza polyschides</span> is a conspicuous and abundant member of rocky reef assemblages in the region, providing complex and abundant biogenic habitat for associated organisms and high rates of primary productivity. However, its short-lived pseudo-annual life strategy is in stark contrast to dominant long-lived perennial laminarian kelps. As such, any replacement or reconfiguration of habitat-forming macroalgae due to ocean warming will probably have implications for local biodiversity and community composition. More broadly, our study demonstrates the importance of high-resolution cross-habitat surveys to generate robust baselines of kelp population demography, against which the ecological impacts of climate change and other stressors can be reliably detected.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"53e8099d5aa9b593553e3b46c66dbd80ce81da62aad52f9063d44f1a1d1e2e5c","category":"Environment"}
