{"title":"Cobalt chromite nanoparticle effects on kapok diesel emulsion performance and emission characteristics at various injection pressures","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14385?af=R","date":1722427964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Alternative fuels derived from vegetable oil have great potential as diesel fuel replacements in the transportation and manufacturing sectors. The aim of this study is to use cobalt chromite nanoparticles as a fuel additive with biodiesel in engine and to experimentally investigate the influence of injection pressure on combustion parameters. As an addition, cobalt chromite nanoparticles are used with biodiesel made from kapok oil, which is blended with mineral diesel at a ratio of 20:80. The engine is operated at various injection pressures (200–260 bar) and with an 80 ppm nanoparticle concentration. The results have shown that the increased injection pressure caused by the use of nanoparticles enhances engine combustion properties, such as the peak pressure and the rate of heat release. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of a CoCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + KME20 mix on a CI engine, with the hope of improving engine performance characteristics. This investigation examines the effects of varying test fuel injection pressures. The increased injection pressure of CoCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + KME20 resulted in better performance and combustion. The 240-bar IP was shown to be superior to lower IPs because of its greater penetration length and more uniform formation. The IP rating of 240 bar represented a significant improvement over competing products with respect to emission controls. In addition to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, this also prevents harmful chemicals from being released into the air.</p>","author":"B. Anbarasan, \nK. Muralidharan, \nC. Sakthi Rajan, \nT.
