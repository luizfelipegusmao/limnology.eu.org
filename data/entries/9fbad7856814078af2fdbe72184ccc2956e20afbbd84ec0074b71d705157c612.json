{"title":"A Mitochondria-Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Dual Sensing of Hypochlorite and Viscosity without Signal Crosstalk in Living Cells and Zebrafish","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0443/v1","date":1717741469000,"content":"Hypochlorite (ClO−) and viscosity both affect the physiological state of mitochondria, and their abnormal levels are closely related to many common diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a mitochondria-targeting fluorescent probes for the dual sensing of ClO− and viscosity. Herein, we have explored a new fluorescent probe XTAP−Bn, which responds sensitively to ClO− and viscosity with off-on fluorescence changes at 558 and 765 nm, respectively. Because the emission wavelength gap is more than 200 nm, XTAP−Bn can effectively eliminate the signal crosstalk during the simultaneous detection of ClO− and viscosity. In addition, XTAP−Bn exhibits a series of advantages, including high selectivity, rapid response, good water solubility, low cytotoxicity, and excellent mitochondrial targeting ability. More importantly, probe XTAP−Bn has been successfully employed to monitor the dynamic change of ClO− and viscosity levels in mitochondria of living cells and zebrafish. Taken together, this work not only provides a reliable tool for identifying mitochondrial dysfunction, but also offers a potential approach for the early diagnosis of mitochondrial-related diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fbad7856814078af2fdbe72184ccc2956e20afbbd84ec0074b71d705157c612","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
