{"title":"mRNA-Delivered Transcytosis Enabled Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0802/v1","date":1710400337000,"content":"The recent setbacks in the withdrawal and approval delays of antibody treatments of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) can be attributed to their poor entry across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). While several invasive and noninvasive approaches can be used to make the BBB more permeable, their inconsistency makes them a poor choice; however, if an antibody is chemically modified to attach a transferrin molecule that enhances its permeation across the BBB, this could be the most practical and useful modification that can transform the science of ND treatment. Antibodies can be conjugated with transferrin in vitro, but preferably through mRNA, as we propose to convert current treatments to bring faster treatment options. The mRNA technology yields products at a meager cost, which is a consideration for the affordability of these drugs globally. This paper provides complete details with templates to convert the current medicines and those under development into mRNA delivery systems to ensure clinical success, avoiding the current failures in their efficacy, more specifically the products that have demonstrated efficacy but are being removed from the market.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdbc495745a661be682de9cc78f6e226876b64238b6d5f6ef739b6e5786f8ddf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
