{"title":"Severe Malaria in Angola: Clinical Profile and Disease Outcome among Adults from a Low-Endemic Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0541/v1","date":1709913023000,"content":"Severe malaria is a major public health concern in Angola, particularly among adults, with limited data on clinical outcomes and manifestations. The study therefore assessed the clinical manifestations and outcome of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adult patients admitted to Hospital Central Dr. Ant√≥nio Agostinho Neto of Lubango, Angola. The study retrospectively reviewed the individual records of patients over 14 years old, admitted for severe malaria during the first trimester of 2021 and 2022. World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were used to define severity. A total of 640 patients were recorded into the study, 167 in 2021 and 473 in 2022, distributed across the departments; Intensive Care Unit (ICU; n=81), Medicine (MED; n=458) and Infectiology (INF; n=101). The median age was 26 years and 59.4% were males. The most common manifestation of severe malaria was renal impairment (37.4%). The overall mortality rate was 7% and decreased considerably from 10.2% in 2021 to 5.9% in 2022. The increase in malaria cases during 2022 with increased in prevalence of life-threatening signs like renal impairment, jaundice and impaired conscience, underscores the urgent need for enhanced malaria control and surveillance strategies to mitigate morbidity and mortality, highlighting the potential for antimalarial drug resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c15caab592df59ed3db8ef62b6740417e25286bbc408189130f9c7e6c4807756","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
