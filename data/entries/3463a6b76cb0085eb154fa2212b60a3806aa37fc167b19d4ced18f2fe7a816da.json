{"title":"Assessment of Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Breast Cancer Who Underwent Mastectomy and Immediate Breast Reconstruction with Sparing of the Areola-Nipple Complex &ndash; Single-Center Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0723/v1","date":1728486638000,"content":"Purpose: Despite significant improvements in early detection of breast cancer, some patients still require mastectomy. One clinical problem currently being analyzed is the possibility of preserving the areola-nipple complex (NAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment results of breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction with sparing of the NAC.\nMethods: 335 patients who underwent mastectomy with breast reconstruction – with sparing (group I: 300 patients) or removal of NAC (group II: 35 patients), treated in the period 07.2014-06.2020. In the study groups, the length of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were determined – up to 24 months after the end of treatment (short-term results) and up to 80 months (long-term results). The mean follow-up time of patients was 55.6 ± 19.7 months.\nResults: In 50 patients (14.9%), recurrence of neoplastic disease was observed (in group I: 14.7%, in group II: 17.1%; p=0.6972). It was most often a recurrence of cancer in the scar after mastectomy – in 25 patients (respectively: 7.7% vs 5.7%; p=0.6775) or distant metastases – in 16 patients (4.0% vs 11.4%; p=0.051). A total of 10 deaths were observed (6 – 2.0% vs 4 – 11.4%; p=0.0019). A total of 37 patients (10.7% vs 14.3%) required removal of their implant, mainly due to symptoms of infection – in 24 cases (7.3% vs 5.7%).\nConclusion: Preserving the NAC is a safe therapeutic procedure in patients undergoing mastectomy with the option of reconstructive treatment. In both groups of patients, similar early and late treatment results were obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3463a6b76cb0085eb154fa2212b60a3806aa37fc167b19d4ced18f2fe7a816da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
