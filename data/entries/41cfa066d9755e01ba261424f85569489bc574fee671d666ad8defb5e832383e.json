Recent advancements have enabled these sensors to accurately capture biomechanical parameters while accommodating the body's natural movements. We examine the principles underlying these sensors' design and fabrication techniques, emphasizing their flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility for seamless integration into wearable systems. Through critical evaluation of existing methodologies, we assess the reliability and validity of these sensors in quantifying gait parameters. Furthermore, we discuss this technology's clinical and research implications, highlighting its potential in personalized rehabilitation and sports performance optimization. We provide an overview of flexible strain sensors and their application for analyzing human walking gait, especially for observing walking gait in rehabilitation programs. First, we present the basic working principles of various flexible strain sensors. Second, by the application of flexible strain sensors as walking gait monitoring. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this research area are discussed. By synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions, this review aims to provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage flexible and stretchable strain sensors for comprehensive human gait analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41cfa066d9755e01ba261424f85569489bc574fee671d666ad8defb5e832383e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
