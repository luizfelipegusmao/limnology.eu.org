{"title":"Evaluating The Effect of Hydrogen on The Tensile Properties of Cold Finished Mild Steel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1061/v1","date":1715781595000,"content":"One of the major sources of catastrophic failures and deterioration of the mechanical properties of metals such as ductility, toughness, and strength, of various engineering components during application is hydrogen embrittlement (HE). It occurs as a result of adsorption, diffusion, and interaction of hydrogen with various metal defects like dislocations, voids, grain boundaries and oxide/matrix interfaces due to its small atomic size. Over the years, extensive effort has been dedicated to understanding hydrogen embrittlement sources, effects, and mechanisms. This research aimed at assessing the tensile properties; toughness, ductility, and susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, of cold-finished mild steel. Steel coupons were subjected to electrochemical hydrogen charging in a carefully chosen alkaline solution over a particular time and at various charging current densities. Tensile property tests were conducted immediately post the charging process, and the results were compared with those of uncharged steel. The findings revealed a clear drop in toughness and ductility with increasing hydrogen content. Fracture surfaces were examined to determine failure mechanisms. This evaluation has enabled the prediction of the steel's ability to withstand environments with elevated hydrogen concentrations during practical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f35fdfc0149d6f78a10b09f336c75f67e4b59fece1fe716f76fe8b0867d8b753","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
