{"title":"Angiotensin II alters Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Lipid Metabolism in Rat Colonic Epithelial Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1754/v1","date":1721712704000,"content":"An over-active renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is characterized by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). While Ang II can promote metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction in tissues, little is known about its role in the gastrointestinal system (GI). Here, we treated rat primary colonic epithelial cells to Ang II (1-5000 nM) to better define its role in the GI. We hypothesized that Ang II would negatively affect mitochondrial bioenergetics as these organelles express Ang II receptors. Ang II increased cellular ATP production but reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of colonocytes. However, cells maintained mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis with treatment, reflecting metabolic compensation with impaired MMP. To determine whether lipid dysregulation was evident, untargeted lipidomics were conducted. 1949 lipids were detected in colonocytes spanning 55 distinct (sub)classes. Ang II (1 nM) altered the abundance of some sphingosines [So(d16:1)], ceramides [Cer-AP(t18:0/24:0)], and phosphatidylcholines [OxPC(16:0_20:5(2O)], while 100 nM Ang II altered some triglycerides and phosphatidylserines [PS(19:0_22:1). Ang II did not alter the relative expression of several enzymes in lipid metabolism; however, expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) was increased and PDK2 can be protective against dyslipidemia. This study is the first to investigate the role of Ang II on colonic epithelial cell metabolism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21c2502d2b9b668a7ba32d560df259dffd86161329dbaa567b933466a83d1677","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
