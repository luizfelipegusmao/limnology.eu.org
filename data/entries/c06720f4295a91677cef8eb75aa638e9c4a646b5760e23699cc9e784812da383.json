{"title":"An Investigation on 3D Electron Diffraction and 4-Dimensional Scanning Diffraction Tomography Using a Scanning Electron Microscope","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.317/7720381?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>During the last decade, 3D-Electron Diffraction (3D-ED) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying the structure of sub-micron particles. It is used in a variety of applications, from unit cell and space group determination to the complete solution of the structure similar to X-ray diffraction techniques. So far, this technique has been only implemented in Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEMs). Performing such an experiment in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) can be challenging, mainly due to the lower acceleration voltage. This lower beam energy raises concerns about severe multiple scattering and limited transmissivity of the sample for the weakly accelerated electrons.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c06720f4295a91677cef8eb75aa638e9c4a646b5760e23699cc9e784812da383","category":"Environment"}
