To assess effects of pesticides on farmers’ respiratory health, this study aimed to evaluate the pulmonary function of cotton farmers exposed to synthetic and natural pesticides in the Central-West region of Burkina Faso.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Methods</h3>\n                      <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to July 2022 among 281 conventional and 189 organic cotton farmers. After collecting information on pesticide use conditions, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed on each farmer according to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines, in order to assess chronic respiratory effects among cotton producers. Binary logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with the occurrence of ventilatory changes.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Results</h3>\n                      <p>Both conventional and organic cotton farmers reported similar chronic respiratory symptoms in different proportions. The main reported were rhinitis (54.45% conventional vs. 34.92% organic), chest pains (41.28% conventional vs. 23.81% organic), cough (33.45% conventional, 24.34% organic), breathlessness (31.67% conventional, 4.23% organic) (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05). 16.18% and 27.50% of conventional male and female cotton farmers, respectively, had a restrictive defect. Among organic cotton farmers, 15.85% and 18.69%, respectively, of males and females had a restrictive defect. Furthermore, a significant increase in the predicted average percentage of FEV1/FVC ratio was observed among organic cotton farmers after salbutamol’s use (<em>p</em> = 0.039). The type of cultivated cotton was not associated with ventilatory changes neither in the univariate analysis, nor in the multivariate analysis. Other factors such as farmers’ age, BMI and insecticides use frequency per year were also important. Farmers who used insecticides more than 6 times per season had an increased risk of developing an obstructive defect (OR = 1.603; 95%CI: 0.484–5.309) compared to those who used them 6 times or less.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n                      <p>Chronic respiratory signs and ventilatory impairments were found among conventional and, to our knowledge, for the first time among organic cotton producers. However, these health effects were more prevalent among conventional cotton farmers than organic ones.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"17e8d853e709b10edd9bd5d9fa47eb99d24ff135c31de0e7d6ba410a383461ad","category":"Environment"}
