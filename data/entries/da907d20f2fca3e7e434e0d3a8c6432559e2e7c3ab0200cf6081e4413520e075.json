{"title":"Preliminary comparisons between a point-of-care ketometer and reference method using Steller sea lion pup whole blood and plasma","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coad104/7590388?rss=1","date":1706313600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We evaluated the Precision Xtra™ ketometer as part of a larger study categorizing fasting status of free-ranging Steller sea lion (<span>Eumetopias jubatus</span>; SSL) pups which necessitated the identification of plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations ([β-HBA]) around a threshold of &lt;0.3 and ≥0.3 mmol/l. Whole blood samples mixed with sodium heparin (NaHep) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid liquid anticoagulants were tested &lt;10 minutes after collection (<span>n</span> = 14; triplicate technical replicates). Plasma (stored at −80°C, NaHep, <span>Thaw1</span>) measured via our laboratory’s <span>Reference Assay</span> (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Kit #MAK041) served as the standard [β-HBA] for ketometer comparisons. Our observed β-HBA range (0.0–1.6 mmol/l), consistent with published [β-HBA] of free-ranging Otariid pups, represented the lower 20% of the ketometer’s range (0.0–8.0 mmol/l). The maximal coefficient of variation (%CV) of ketometer technical replicates was 9.1% (NaHep, whole blood). The majority of ketometer technical replicate sets (84%, including all matrices, anticoagulants and thawings) were identical (CV = 0%). We found linear relationships and agreement of ketometer [β-HBA] between whole blood preserved with different anticoagulants and between whole blood and plasma (<span>Thaw1</span>) measurements. The ketometer produced results with linearity to the <span>Reference Assay</span> for both whole blood and plasma (<span>Thaw1</span>). We identified a non-linear relationship between plasma at <span>Thaw1</span> and <span>Thaw2</span> (tested four months apart, NaHep), as only samples with higher SSL [β-HBA] decreased in concentration, and all others remained the same. With respect to categorizing SSL pup fasting in our larger study, the ketometer’s <span>%Accuracy</span>, %<span>Sensitivity</span> and %<span>Specificity</span> for samples with <span>Reference Assay</span> β-HBA &lt;0.2 and &gt;0.4 mmol/l were 100%. We adopted a modified procedure: plasma samples with mean ketometer concentrations ±0.1 mmol/l of 0.3 mmol/l β-HBA were re-evaluated using the <span>Reference Assay</span>, improving measurement precision from tenths (ketometer) to thousandths (assay) mmol/l. The Precision Xtra™ ketometer was valuable to our application over the range of [β-HBA] observed in SSL pup plasma and whole blood samples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"da907d20f2fca3e7e434e0d3a8c6432559e2e7c3ab0200cf6081e4413520e075","category":"Environment"}
