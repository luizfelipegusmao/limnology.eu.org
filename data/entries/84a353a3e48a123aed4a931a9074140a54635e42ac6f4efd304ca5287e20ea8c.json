{"title":"ROS 2 in a Nutshell: A Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1204/v2","date":1729068778000,"content":"This study presents a comprehensive systematic review that addresses the critical transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, spotlighting the significant enhancements and the pressing need for a detailed exploration of ROS 2 within the robotics community. Despite the extensive deployment and adaptations of ROS in varied robotics applications, literature lacks a cohesive synthesis that delineates the advancements, limitations, and broader impacts of ROS 2 compared to its predecessor, ROS 1. Our contribution bridges this gap by assembling the largest database of ROS-related research, encompassing 7,498 articles, with a focused analysis in this survey on 431 ROS2-specific publications. We categorize these into i.) articles that discuss and analyze core ROS 2 concepts, ii.) articles that propose frameworks or tools for ROS 2, and iii.) articles utilizing ROS 2. Furthermore, we summarize literature findings of ROS 2 challenges, advancements, and future direction in the fields of a.) security, b.) real-time, c.) middleware, d.) embedded and distributed systems, e.) communication reliability and QoS, and f.) multi-robot systems. The methodology involved meticulous data collection and categorization from multiple databases, facilitating an in-depth online accessible resource. Results underscore ROS2’s enhancements in modularity, real-time capabilities, and security, extending its applicability across various robotic platforms and industries. However, challenges in scalability and reliability persist, signaling avenues for future enhancements. This review not only deepens the understanding of ROS2’s contributions but also charts a path for ongoing improvements in robotic systems design. The original data presented in the study are openly available in https://www.ros.riotu-lab.org/.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84a353a3e48a123aed4a931a9074140a54635e42ac6f4efd304ca5287e20ea8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
