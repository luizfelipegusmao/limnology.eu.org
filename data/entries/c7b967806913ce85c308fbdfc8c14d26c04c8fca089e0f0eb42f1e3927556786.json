{"title":"Preparation and Characterization of Oxide Nanotubes on Titanium Surface for Use in Controlled Drug Release Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1645/v1","date":1719224701000,"content":"Preventing or treating infections at implantation sites where the risk of bacterial contamination is high requires the development of intelligent drug delivery systems. In this work, honeycomb structures as a potential drug carrier were obtained for the first time in a fast, one-step anodization process of titanium grade 4, lasting only 60 seconds. Fourth generation oxide nanotube layers were obtained from an aqueous solution of 0.5% AgNO3 in the voltage range from 50 to 80 at 15(1) °C. The FE-SEM method showed the length of the oxide nanotubes from 1.02(2) µm at 50 V to 230(8) nm at 80 V. The EDS analysis revealed that during anodizing, silver particles are deposited on the Ti G4 up to 2.2(5) wt.%. Electrochemical measurements by open circuit potential and anodic polarization curves methods proved the improvement of in vitro corrosion resistance as a result of Ti G4 anodizing. Assessment of the anodized Ti G4 as gentamicin sulfate carrier carried out using ATR-FTIR and UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy revealed that the obtained oxide nanotube layers can be used for application of drugs directly to the tissue around the implant. This method of application allows full use of the therapeutic dose of the antibiotic used.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7b967806913ce85c308fbdfc8c14d26c04c8fca089e0f0eb42f1e3927556786","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
