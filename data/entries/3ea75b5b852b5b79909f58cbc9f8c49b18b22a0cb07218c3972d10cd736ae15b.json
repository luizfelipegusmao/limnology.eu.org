{"title":"Optimizing Recurrence Reduction in Central Giant Cell Granuloma: A Comparative Analysis of Treatment Modalities and A Concise Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1695/v1","date":1721633436000,"content":"Treating central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) is challenging due to high recurrence rates and variable therapy responses. This study examines the efficacy of various treatments in reducing CGCG recurrence. A literature review explored outcomes of surgical excision, curettage, intralesional corticosteroid injection, and adjuvant therapy, considering factors like lesion location, size, and histological features. Aggressive surgical techniques such as en bloc resection were found to potentially lower recurrence rates compared to conservative approaches. However, treatment should be tailored to individual patient needs. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and improve treatment strategies. A concise literature review was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, focusing on papers published from 1986 to 2024. Search terms included \"central giant cell granuloma,\" \"recurrence,\" \"treatment modalities,\" and \"surgical excision\". Studies reporting recurrence rates and treatment outcomes for CGCG were analyzed. Twenty-nine studies were reviewed, including six studies on surgical excision and curettage, eight studies on intralesional corticosteroid injections, six studies on calcitonin therapy, five studies on interferon alpha therapy and four studies on the therapy with denosumab. Analysis indicated that aggressive surgical treatments like en bloc resection were associated with lower recurrence rates compared to conservative methods. Predictors of recurrence included lesion size (&amp;gt;3 cm), location (mandible), and aggressive histopathological features. Aggressive surgical excision combined with nonsurgical methods may lower recurrence rates, while conservative techniques remain viable in some cases. Further prospective research is needed to validate these findings and enhance CGCG treatment options.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ea75b5b852b5b79909f58cbc9f8c49b18b22a0cb07218c3972d10cd736ae15b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
