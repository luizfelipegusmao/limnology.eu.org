{"title":"NIN-LIKE PROTEIN3.2 inhibits repressor Aux/IAA14 expression and enhances root biomass in maize seedlings under low nitrogen","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4388/7698913?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants generally enhance their root growth in the form of greater biomass and/or root length to boost nutrient uptake in response to short-term low nitrogen (LN). However, the underlying mechanisms of short-term LN-mediated root growth remain largely elusive. Our genome-wide association study, haplotype analysis, and phenotyping of transgenic plants showed that the crucial nitrate signaling component NIN-LIKE PROTEIN3.2 (ZmNLP3.2), a positive regulator of root biomass, is associated with natural variations in root biomass of maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) seedlings under LN. The monocot-specific gene <span>AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID14</span> (<span>ZmAux/IAA14</span>) exhibited opposite expression patterns to <span>ZmNLP3.2</span> in <span>ZmNLP3.2</span> knockout and overexpression lines, suggesting that <span>ZmNLP3.2</span> hampers <span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> transcription. Importantly, <span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> knockout seedlings showed a greater root dry weight (RDW), whereas <span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> overexpression reduced RDW under LN compared with wild-type plants, indicating that <span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> negatively regulates the RDW of LN-grown seedlings. Moreover, in vitro and vivo assays indicated that AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR19 (ZmARF19) binds to and transcriptionally activates <span>ZmAux/IAA14</span>, which was weakened by the ZmNLP3.2–ZmARF19 interaction. The <span>zmnlp3.2 ZmAux/IAA14-OE</span> seedlings exhibited further reduced RDW compared with <span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> overexpression lines when subjected to LN treatment, corroborating the <span>ZmNLP3.2</span>–<span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> interaction. Thus, our study reveals a ZmNLP3.2–ZmARF19–<span>ZmAux/IAA14</span> module regulating root biomass in response to nitrogen limitation in maize.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"d9ff25b379ca98007faaa4099417a2b7d9554b9577d9f074efa2382e89228622","category":"Environment"}
