{"title":"A calculation method for optical properties of yolk shell based on deep learning","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302262","date":1714658400000,"content":"<p>by Weiming He, Xiangchao Ma, Jianqi Zhang, Kai Xu, Jingzhou Gao, Shuyao Lei, Changheng Zhan</p>\r\n\r\nThe yolk shell is widely used in optoelectronic devices due to its excellent optical properties. Compared to single metal nanostructures, yolk shells have more controllable degrees of freedom, which may make experiments and simulations more complex. Using neural networks can efficiently simplify the computational process of yolk shell. In our work, the relationship between the size and the absorption efficiency of the yolk-shell structure is established using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), significantly simplifying the calculation process while ensuring accuracy equivalent to discrete dipole scattering (DDSCAT). The absorption efficiency of the yolk shell was comprehensively described through the forward and reverse prediction processes. In forward prediction, the absorption spectrum of yolk shell is obtained through its size parameter. In reverse prediction, the size parameters of yolk shells are predicted through absorption spectra. A comparison with the traditional DDSCAT demonstrated the high precision prediction capability and fast computation of this method, with minimal memory consumption.","author":"Weiming He","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d740c771ea11e8128475f9c2f284597ca36a79e306be0d0be7877244177dc323","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
