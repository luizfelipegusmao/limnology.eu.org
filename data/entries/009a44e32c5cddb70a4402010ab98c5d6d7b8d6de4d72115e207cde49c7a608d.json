{"title":"More than Spicy, Moringa oleifera as a Feedstock for Functional biochar@ZnO","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0485/v1","date":1728303649000,"content":"Water treatment is one of the most research-challenging areas, and continuously requires the development of efficient sustainable materials for catalytic total mineralization of organic compounds. Herein, Moringa oleifera biomass was converted to \"black gold\" biochar loaded with ZnO nanoparticles (MOFB@ZnO) by slow pyrolysis, at 500 Â°C under an inert atmosphere, (MOFB@ZnO). This composite catalyst was used for the total degradation of Congo Red, a model organic pollutant. SEM confirmed the uniform distribution of ZnO nanoparticles, while XPS and XRD indicated the presence of ZnO, primarily in the wurtzite crystalline structure. Optimization was conducted using the central composite design (CCD) method and STATISTICA 12.0 software. The composite catalyst was applied in the electrochemical degradation of Congo Red dye, using a platinum anode and a carbon felt cathode to generate H2O2 from O2 reduction. The ZnO-decorated Moringa oleifera biochar catalyst permitted to achieve of 98% removal of total organic carbon in less than 6h. It is 10-fold more efficient than pristine biochar and can be recycled up to 4 times without any significant loss. The process is highly efficient producing sustainable low-cost catalysts for water purification from organics, and contributes to sustainable chemical processes therefore addressing SDGs 6, 9, and 13.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"009a44e32c5cddb70a4402010ab98c5d6d7b8d6de4d72115e207cde49c7a608d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
