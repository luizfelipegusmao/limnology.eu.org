We present a template designed to help practitioners formulate SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) objectives. Through a hypothetical example and real-world applications, we illustrate how this template can streamline the creation of effective management objectives, potentially enhancing outcomes in the field and offering benefits for both current and future generations.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nIn natural resource and environmental management, well-written objectives are critical for effective decision-making and the achievement of desired outcomes. This article aims to improve practitioners' ability to identify and write SMART (<i>S</i>pecific, <i>M</i>easurable, <i>A</i>chievable, <i>R</i>elevant, <i>T</i>ime-bound) objectives for natural resource and environmental management.\n\nWe differentiate between research and management objectives, define each SMART criterion, and introduce a template to help write management objectives. We demonstrate the use of the SMART management objectives template with a hypothetical example and two recent applications.\n\nThe template simplifies the process of writing SMART management objectives. It is applicable to popular management frameworks like management by objectives and structured decision making.\n\nThe implementation of SMART criteria and the provided template can lead to better outcomes in natural resource and environmental management, benefiting current and future generations.\n</p>","author":"Caleb A.
