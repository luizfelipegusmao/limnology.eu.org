{"title":"Progenesis in dicyemids","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ivb.12419?af=R","date":1712127750000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dicyemids (Phylum Dicyemida) are the most common and characteristic endosymbiont living in the renal sac of benthic cephalopod molluscs. Precocious development of a hermaphroditic gonad occurs in the larvae and smaller juveniles of 40 dicyemid species from 17 cephalopod species so far and is the usual phenomenon in dicyemids. Based on the developmental and morphological features of precocious individuals, progenesis (a form of heterochrony) is the appropriate term for such precocious development. In general, progenetic individuals have much lower fecundity than normal ones because of their smaller body size, and therefore, it appears to be a disadvantageous reproductive trait. Nonetheless, the number of progenetic individuals consists of 30%â€“50% of the population, a relatively large proportion suggesting that the presence of progenetic individuals probably plays an important role in life history strategy. Precocious development significantly reduces growth time and enables early maturation. Progenetic individuals are common in short-living cephalopod species, in which precocious development seems appropriate for dicyemids, enabling fast larval release before the end of the host's life span.</p>","author":"Hidetaka Furuya","siteTitle":"Wiley: Invertebrate Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"288dc5c0698e157be6008116ed4a15ccbcde55ff21b19d813cd3a3ab63550757","entryHash":"f27094be9c7425781ae6a4b9aa38b25cad063900033e6d142e9620a6fe26769b","category":"Environment"}
