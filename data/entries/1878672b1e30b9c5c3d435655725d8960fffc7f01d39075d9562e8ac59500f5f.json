{"title":"Identification of suitable extender and cryoprotectant for cryopreservation of Labeo rohita milt","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16053?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different extenders and cryoprotectants for cryopreservation of <i>Labeo rohita</i> milt. Male brood fish (<i>n</i> = 5) reared at fish seed hatchery, Rawal Town Islamabad, Pakistan, were captured from different rearing ponds, and kept in hatchery ponds for acclimatization. After 6 hours, fish were injected with ovaprim at 0.2 ml/kg. After 8 h, milt was collected in a cooled sterilized falcon tube and maintained at 4°C. Spermatozoa were activated and visual motility was observed. Cooled milt was diluted in experimental extenders (Alsever's solution, sugar-based extender and modified Kurokura-2 extender [KE] each with either Me<sub>2</sub>SO or methanol as cryoprotectant). Diluted milt was filled in 0.5 ml straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen vapours. Cryopreserved milt samples were thawed at 25°C and assessed for fertilization rate and post-thaw sperm quality. Sperm motility, motility duration, viability and total antioxidant capacity were higher in KE with Me<sub>2</sub>SO and methanol compared with Alsever's solution and sugar-based extender. Sperm DNA integrity showed a similar trend in all treatments. Moreover, sperm fertilization rate was higher (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in KE + methanol compared with KE+ Me<sub>2</sub>SO. In conclusion, modified KE along with methanol as cryoprotectant proved to be the best diluent for cryopreservation of <i>L. rohita</i> sperm.</p>","author":"Shaista Bibi, \nRabea Ejaz, \nMuhammad Amjad Awan, \nJaveria Arshad, \nBushra Allah Rakha, \nMuhammad Sajjad Ansari, \nIqra Shakir, \nShamim Akhter","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"1878672b1e30b9c5c3d435655725d8960fffc7f01d39075d9562e8ac59500f5f","category":"Environment"}
