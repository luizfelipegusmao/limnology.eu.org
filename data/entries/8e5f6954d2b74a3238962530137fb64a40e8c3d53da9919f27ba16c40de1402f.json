Here, we show that this colonization process needs more than a century to become fully realized in non-native birds, mammals, and even longer in vascular plants, with assemblages in primary vegetation colonized particularly slowly. These results imply that current introductions trigger non-native spread into local assemblages over the entire 21st century and beyond, thus supporting strong regulations on non-native introductions to reduce the long-lasting consequences.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The ecological impact of non-native species arises from their establishment in local assemblages. However, the rates of non-native spread in new regions and their determinants have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we combined global databases documenting the occurrence of non-native species and residence of non-native birds, mammals, and vascular plants at regional and local scales to describe how the likelihood of non-native occurrence and their proportion in local assemblages relate with their residence time and levels of human usage in different ecosystems. Our findings reveal that local non-native occurrence generally increases with residence time. Colonization is most rapid in croplands and urban areas, while it is slower and variable in natural or semi-natural ecosystems. Notably, non-native occurrence continues to rise even 200 years after introduction, especially for birds and vascular plants, and in other land-use types rather than croplands and urban areas. The impact of residence time on non-native proportions is significant only for mammals. We conclude that the continental exchange of biotas requires considerable time for effects to manifest at the local scale across taxa and land-use types. The unpredictability of future impacts, implied by the slow spread of non-native species, strengthens the call for stronger regulations on the exchange of non-native species to reduce the long-lasting invasion debt looming on ecosystems' future.</p>","author":"Daijun Liu, \nFranz Essl, \nBernd Lenzner, \nDietmar Moser, \nPhilipp Semenchuk, \nTim M.
