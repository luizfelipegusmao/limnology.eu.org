RSV generally causes mild cold-like symptoms but can result in serious illness especially in infants and older adults. Vaccines and prophylactic monoclonal antibody treatment are available, but the improvement and development of additional therapeutics is still needed. A better understanding of RSV virion structure and assembly would aid significantly in these efforts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"958c16174d694fc1aa3bb6f0ac5168187303e5485901d3a09415dca22843b6d5","category":"Environment"}
