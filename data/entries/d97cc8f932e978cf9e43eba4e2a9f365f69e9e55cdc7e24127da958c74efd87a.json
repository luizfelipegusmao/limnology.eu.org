{"title":"Spatial variability in size and lipid content of the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus across the Northwest Atlantic continental shelves: implications for North Atlantic right whale prey quality","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/1/25/7457343?rss=1","date":1702080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Copepod size and energy content are influenced by regional and seasonal variation in temperature and food conditions, with implications for planktivorous consumers such as the endangered North Atlantic right whale (<span>Eubalaena glacialis</span>). Historical data (1990â€“2020) on <span>Calanus finmarchicus</span> stage CV copepodite prosome length and oil sac metrics were analyzed to determine the extent of variation in individual body size and estimated lipid and energy content in five regions of the Northwest Atlantic continental shelves [Gulf of Maine (GoM), Scotian Shelf (SS), Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) and Newfoundland Shelf]. Large-scale spatial patterns in size and lipid content were related to latitude, indicating that <span>C. finmarchicus</span> CV in the GSL and SLE were historically larger in body size, and had significantly higher lipid content compared with those in the GoM and the SS. The observed patterns of <span>C. finmarchicus</span> CV size and lipid storage capacity suggest that regional variation in whale prey energy content can play a role in the suitability of current and future whale foraging habitats in the Northwest Atlantic, with the larger lipid-rich individuals in the GSL providing a high-quality diet compared with those in southern areas.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"d97cc8f932e978cf9e43eba4e2a9f365f69e9e55cdc7e24127da958c74efd87a","category":"Environment"}
