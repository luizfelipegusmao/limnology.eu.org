{"title":"Study of Properties of Water-Dispersion Paint and Varnish Compositions with the Content of Modified Mineral Filler","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0404/v1","date":1722929393000,"content":"The article presents the results of research work devoted to improving the characteristics of paint and varnish coatings based on aqueous dispersions of polyacrylates, it is proposed to modify them by introducing mineral raw materials as fillers and hydrated lime with subsequent processing in a vortex layer apparatus. Introduction of activated diatomite does not cause deterioration of covering power, adhesion and increase of porosity of the paint material. Modification of coatings contributes to the increase of their operational properties, which can be associated with the reduction of free volume in the composite, formation of polymer boundary layers with modified physical and chemical properties. The aim of the study is to obtain water-dispersion paint and varnish composition containing modified diatomite on polyacrylate basis and subsequent study of the main physical and mechanical parameters. The work has been carried out by the following method: determination of porosity, adhesion, elasticity, covering power of the control composition; determination of porosity, adhesion, elasticity, and covering power of the obtained composites using modified filler; investigation of the influence of radiation in the infrared spectrum of the paint coating surface using FLIRB620 thermal imager. As a result of research works it was noticed that modification of water dispersions with silica activated diatomite helps to eliminate the main disadvantages of materials and coatings based on acrylate binder - low water resistance and low physical and mechanical characteristics, introduction of modified diatomite into water emulsion paint on acrylate base does not lead to deterioration of the main performance characteristics of paint coatings - porosity, adhesion, elasticity and covering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a024f353f2b74e9853687d449771b91a8d099bbe7d2f7381344427c0327e044b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
