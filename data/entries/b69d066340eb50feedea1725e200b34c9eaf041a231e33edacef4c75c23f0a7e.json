{"title":"The secretory function of adipose tissues in metabolic regulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae003/7584709?rss=1","date":1705708800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In addition to their pivotal roles in energy storage and expenditure, adipose tissues play a crucial part in the secretion of bioactive molecules, including peptides, lipids, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles, in response to physiological stimulation and metabolic stress. These secretory factors, through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, regulate various processes within adipose tissues. These processes include adipogenesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and adaptive thermogenesis, all of which are essential for the maintenance of the balance and functionality of the adipose tissue micro-environment. A subset of these adipose-derived secretory factors can enter the circulation and target the distant tissues to regulate appetite, cognitive function, energy expenditure, insulin secretion and sensitivity, gluconeogenesis, cardiovascular remodeling, and exercise capacity. In this review, we highlight the role of adipose-derived secretory factors and their signaling pathways in modulating metabolic homeostasis. Furthermore, we delve into the alterations in both the content and secretion processes of these factors under various physiological and pathological conditions, shedding light on potential pharmacological treatment strategies for related diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"b69d066340eb50feedea1725e200b34c9eaf041a231e33edacef4c75c23f0a7e","category":"Environment"}
