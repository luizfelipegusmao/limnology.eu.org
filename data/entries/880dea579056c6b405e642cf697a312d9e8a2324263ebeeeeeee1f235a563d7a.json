{"title":"Natural Antioxidants: Sources, Extraction Techniques and Their Use in Livestock Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0404/v1","date":1728280072000,"content":"Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defenses, can negatively impact animal health, welfare, and productivity. In livestock, diseases are often correlated with reduced antioxidant status. To mitigate oxidative stress, natural antioxidants have gained attention as alternatives to synthetic compounds. The growing need for safe and natural animal products has led to the increased use of plant food additives (PFAs) as antioxidants in animal feed. These natural sources include plant extracts, essential oils, and bioactive compounds-rich by-products. Such antioxidants can enhance product quality, oxidative stability, and shelf life in ruminants, swine, and rabbits. Additionally, maintaining a good antioxidant status positively affects meat quality parameters, including vitamin E content and reduced lipid peroxidation. This review explores the properties of natural antioxidants, extraction methods, and their significance in promoting animal welfare, performance, and product quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"880dea579056c6b405e642cf697a312d9e8a2324263ebeeeeeee1f235a563d7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
