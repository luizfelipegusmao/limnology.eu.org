{"title":"Analysis of the Intensity of Energy Consumption in the Transportation Sector of the Oil-Rich Country","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0631/v1","date":1728469238000,"content":"The analysis focuses on the intensity of energy consumption in the transportation sector, of the oil-rich country, Iran. The study emphasizes the importance of reducing energy consumption in transportation and identifies factors that affect energy efficiency. The research explores the impact of population growth, clean fuels, energy prices, and investment in energy efficiency in the transport sector. Using data from 1979 to 2011, the study estimates a model with the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model and emphasizes the significance of clean and renewable energies in reducing energy intensity. It also discusses the theoretical background, energy intensity factors, production technology, and the role of clean energy sources. The model framework includes variables like energy intensity index, relative energy price, number of cars, investment ratio, and clean energy production. The findings suggest an increasing trend in energy consumption in the transportation sector, highlighting the importance of identifying drivers that affect energy consumption in the sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08ba7b929c2c22718dba3bfe4323dd2d4506579acd11bd48a517fb01f772ef92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
