{"title":"Low-CO2-inducible bestrophins outside the pyrenoid sustain high photosynthetic efficacy in diatoms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1432/7628171?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Anion transporters sustain a variety of physiological states in cells. Bestrophins (BSTs) belong to a Cl<sup>−</sup> and/or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> transporter family conserved in bacteria, animals, algae, and plants. Recently, putative BSTs were found in the green alga <span>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span>, where they are upregulated under low CO<sub>2</sub> (LC) conditions and play an essential role in the CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (CCM). The putative BST orthologs are also conserved in diatoms, secondary endosymbiotic algae harboring red-type plastids, but their physiological functions are unknown. Here, we characterized the subcellular localization and expression profile of BSTs in the marine diatoms <span>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</span> (PtBST1 to 4) and <span>Thalassiosira pseudonana</span> (TpBST1 and 2). PtBST1, PtBST2, and PtBST4 were localized at the stroma thylakoid membrane outside of the pyrenoid, and PtBST3 was localized in the pyrenoid. Contrarily, TpBST1 and TpBST2 were both localized in the pyrenoid. These BST proteins accumulated in cells grown in LC but not in 1% CO<sub>2</sub> (high CO<sub>2</sub> [HC]). To assess the physiological functions, we generated knockout mutants for the <span>PtBST1</span> gene by genome editing. The lack of PtBST1 decreased photosynthetic affinity for dissolved inorganic carbon to the level comparable with the HC-grown wild type. Furthermore, non-photochemical quenching in LC-grown cells was 1.5 to 2.0 times higher in the mutants than in the wild type. These data suggest that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> transport at the stroma thylakoid membranes by PtBST1 is a critical part of the CO<sub>2</sub>-evolving machinery of the pyrenoid in the fully induced CCM and that PtBST1 may modulate photoprotection under CO<sub>2</sub>-limited environments in <span>P. tricornutum</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b1e68ee2c9e61cf0c6928f1060735fce07d91b883dad179964b2ef209295621d","category":"Environment"}
