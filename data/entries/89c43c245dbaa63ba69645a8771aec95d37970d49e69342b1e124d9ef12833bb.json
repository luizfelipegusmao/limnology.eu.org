{"title":"Public Health Safeguarding: A Review into Bioactive Molecules and Advanced Technologies for Microorganism Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1113/v1","date":1726300996000,"content":"Context: The advent of new strains of resistant microbes and the concomitant growth in multidrug resistance have made antimicrobial resistance an urgent public health concern. New antimicrobials are desperately needed to boost the success rates of treating infectious diseases and save lives. There are many intriguing biomolecules with antibacterial action, which are mostly unexplored in microorganisms. Objectives: The objective of the present review article is to describe the importance of natural compounds against microorganisms using advanced techniques to protect people from diseases. Method: We have searched and incorporated many online literature to gather information from SCOPUS, SCI, PUBMED, ScienceDirect and Medline. We have discussed several microorganism sources for antimicrobials and antifungal drugs. In addition, describes microculturing techniques and applications of microbial-based microsystems. Results and Conclusion: Every kind of higher trophic life depends on microorganisms for sustenance. The unseen majority is essential to understanding how humans and other living forms can survive anthropogenic climate change. Antimicrobial substances and the latest methods, techniques, and strategies for developing effective treatments have been discussed in this article. Novel model systems and cutting-edge biomolecular and computational methodologies could help researchers enhance antimicrobial resistance by completely capitalizing on lead antimicrobials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89c43c245dbaa63ba69645a8771aec95d37970d49e69342b1e124d9ef12833bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
