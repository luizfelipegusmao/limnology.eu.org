In this study, we show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE–GATED CHANNEL20 (CNGC20) positively regulates freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) by mediating cold-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Moreover, we demonstrate that the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE1 RECEPTOR (PSY1R) is activated by cold, phosphorylating and enhancing the activity of CNGC20. The <span>psy1r</span> mutant exhibits decreased cold-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and freezing tolerance. Conversely, COLD-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (CRPK1), a protein kinase that negatively regulates cold signaling, phosphorylates and facilitates the degradation of CNGC20 under prolonged periods of cold treatment, thereby attenuating freezing tolerance. This study thus identifies PSY1R and CRPK1 kinases that regulate CNGC20 activity and stability, respectively, thereby antagonistically modulating freezing tolerance in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"aba65593f307a31b3c45316787c7c94d3ea0766130934fa6f2bd00768db0f173","category":"Environment"}
