{"title":"Freeze–thaw stability of high‐internal‐phase emulsion stabilized by chickpea protein microgel particles and its application in surimi","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13690?af=R","date":1721129997000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Future applications of high-internal-phase emulsions (HIPEs) are highly regarded, but poor freeze–thaw stability limits their utilization in frozen products. This study aimed to characterize the structure of chickpea protein microgel particles (HCPI) induced by NaCl and to assess its impact on the freeze–thaw stability of HIPEs.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that NaCl induction (0–400 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>) increased the surface hydrophobicity (175.9–278.9) and interfacial adsorbed protein content (84.9%–91.3%) of HCPI. HIPEs prepared with HCPI induced by high concentration of NaCl exhibited superior flocculation index and centrifugal stability, and their freeze–thaw stability was better than that of natural chickpea protein. The increase in NaCl concentration reduced the droplet aggregation and coalescence index of the freeze–thaw emulsions, diminishing the precipitation of oil from the emulsion. Linear and nonlinear rheology showed that the strengthened gel structure (higher <i>G</i>′ values) restricted water flow and counteracted the damage to the interfacial film by ice crystals at 100–400 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, thus improving the viscoelasticity of the freeze–thaw emulsions. Finally, the thawing loss of surimi gel with HCPI-200 HIPE was reduced by 2.04% compared to directly adding oil.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study provided a promising strategy to improve the freeze–thaw stability of HIPEs and reduce the thawing loss of frozen products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiaoyun Xu, \nLiuping Fan, \nJinwei Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a43726c3ca019dbef71c1390a0cad90e3b784ed7587f9f64eb0ec2a0fd3bf700","category":"Environment"}
