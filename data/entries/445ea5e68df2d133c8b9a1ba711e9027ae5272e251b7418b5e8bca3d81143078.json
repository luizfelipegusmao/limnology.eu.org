{"title":"Viability and integrity of Pinus densiflora seeds stored for 20 years at three different temperatures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae046/7709576?rss=1","date":1720483200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Storage temperature is one of the most important factors determining seed longevity in the genebank. This study aimed to investigate the effect of storage temperature on the seed viability and physiological integrity after a 20-year storage period of <span>Pinus densiflora</span>, a tree species of ecological and economic significance in South Korea. To this end, seeds were collected and stored dry for 20 years at −18°C, 4°C and 25°C. Germination tests were conducted to assess seed viability and vigour, electrolyte leakage analysis was performed to assess cell membrane integrity, and carbohydrate analysis was conducted to assess metabolic integrity during germination. The results revealed that over 20 years, seeds stored at −18°C maintained a high germination percentage (GP; 89%), comparable to initial GP (91%), whilst those stored at 4°C exhibited a decline in GP (44%) along with a decrease in vigour. Seeds stored at 25°C lost their viability entirely. Electrical conductivity of the leachate and leakage of inorganic compounds and soluble sugars were higher with elevated storage temperature, indicating increased imbibition damage. Additionally, changes in carbohydrate content during germination revealed that the loss of viability according to storage temperature is associated with reduced storage reserve utilization and altered carbohydrate metabolism during germination. These results enhance our understanding of the effect of seed storage temperature on longevity and physiological changes of aging in the genebank, serving as a reference for establishing conservation strategies for <span>Pinus densiflora</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"445ea5e68df2d133c8b9a1ba711e9027ae5272e251b7418b5e8bca3d81143078","category":"Environment"}
