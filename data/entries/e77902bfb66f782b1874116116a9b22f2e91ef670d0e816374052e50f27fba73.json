{"title":"Generalized Dynamics and Generation Mapping for Collatz-type Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2050/v2","date":1724919413000,"content":"Let an odd integer $\\mathcal{X}$ be represented as $\\sum \\limits_{M &gt; m} 2^M + 2^m - 1$ for $m \\geq 1$, where $2^m - 1$ is called the Governor. The general dynamics is such that applying the Collatz-type function iteratively lead to $\\sum \\limits_{N &gt; 1} 2^N + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1$, where $2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1$ is referred to as the Trivial Governor. For the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the Trivial Governor is $2^1 - 1$, while for the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the Trivial Governors are $2^2 - 1$ and $2^1 - 1$. It is demonstrated that for $\\mathcal{X}$ to reappear in a Collatz-type sequence, its Governor must be the Trivial Governor. Specifically, in the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, ancestor mapping shows that odd integers in a repeating cycle are separated by two even integers. Successor mapping further indicates that there are no auxiliary cycles, as the Trivial Governor is transformed into a Governor with a different index. Similarly, in the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, successor mapping reveals that the smallest odd integers that form an auxiliary cycle are found between $2^2$ and $2^5$. Finally, attempts to construct integers that diverge in the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence suggest that no such integers exist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e77902bfb66f782b1874116116a9b22f2e91ef670d0e816374052e50f27fba73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
