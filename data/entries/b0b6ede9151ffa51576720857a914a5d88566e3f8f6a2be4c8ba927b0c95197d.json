This study was registered in REBEC under Register Number RBR-9q7kvg and approved by the ethics committee under number 32216620.0.0000.5269. The study population was composed of 51 pregnant women between 28 and 40 weeks of gestation, over 18 years of age, allocated in a single group. Pregnancies with multiple fetuses, malformations, premature rupture of the membrane, and active labor were excluded. The procedures evaluated maternal-fetal hemodynamics using three consecutive measures of ultrasound examination with Doppler velocimetry, and three maternal vital signs measured by an electronic blood pressure monitor.</p> Results <p>Most vital signs changed after osteopathic treatment. However, only the systolic blood pressure (109.92 ±14.42 to 110.71±12.8, p = 0.033), diastolic blood pressure (79.8±11.54 to 77.57±9.44, p = 0.018) and heart rate (87.59±11.93 to 81.12±10.26, p = 0.000) in the sitting position, systolic blood pressure (110.75±13.26 to 108.59±13.07; p = 0.034) in the supine, and heart rate (83.22±11.29 to 80.39±11.0; p = 0.013) in left lateral decubitus reached statistical significance. The oximetry measures (98.55±0.64 to 98.67±0.68; p = 0.098) stayed stable during all three positions.All artery values remained stable after treatment, and no statistically significant difference was recorded in the artery results.</p> Conclusion <p>Responses to osteopathic treatment in women in the third trimester of pregnancy did not affect uteroplacental and fetoplacental circulation. However, some maternal vital signs had statistically significant results, with a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, and an increase in systolic blood pressure in the sitting position, a decrease of heart rate in the left lateral decubitus position, and systolic blood pressure in the supine position. All the results observed were maintained in the normal parameters. The study responses attest to the safety of using the osteopathic manipulative treatment for the fetus and for pregnant women with comorbidities.</p>","author":"Maria Luisa Arruda Correia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b0b6ede9151ffa51576720857a914a5d88566e3f8f6a2be4c8ba927b0c95197d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
