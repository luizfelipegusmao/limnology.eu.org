{"title":"Participatory epidemiology on major camel calf health and management problems in pastoral and semi-pastoral zones of Somali region, Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301551","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Hassan Abdi Hussein, Abdifetah Mohamed, Juhar Mohamed Ahmed</p>\r\n\r\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2017 to March 2019. A participatory epidemiological appraisal was used to gain a rapid overview of the range of camel calf health problems and traditional management, a measure of the importance that people place on each of them, and to identify and prioritize economically important diseases in target zones. The most important constraints to camel production were identified to be the widespread prevalence of diseases such as camelpox, contagious ecthyma, calf scour, ticks, and nonspecific pneumonia; poor management and husbandry practices such as restrictive colostrum feeding, lack of concentrate and salt supplementation and inappropriate housing; shortage of feed; and scarce seasonal variation in water. Additionally, the livestock herders not only showed their knowledge of common camel calf diseases for affected organs and symptoms but also indicated the seasonality of disease occurrences with strong agreement (W = 0.899, P&lt; 0.003) among the informants of all focus group discussions. The overall prevalence of mange, tick infestation, and bacteria-induced diarrhea in the study area was found to be 36.3%, 36%, and 74%, respectively. <i>Sarcoptes scabie var</i>. <i>cameli</i> was the only identified mite species from mange-infested calves, while <i>Hyalomma</i>, <i>Rhipicephalus</i>, and <i>Amblyoma</i> were the most commonly identified tick species. Similarly, the overall prevalence of diarrhea was 74% among this about 34.6% was caused by <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> while 38.9% was affected by <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. Therefore, based on these findings, five diseases have been prioritized as the most significant calf diseases in the area (Camelpox, contagious ecthyma, and causes of pneumonia among camel calves). Improving veterinary health infrastructure and capacity, and increasing community awareness on camel health constraints are also recommended to enhance optimal camel calf rearing.","author":"Hassan Abdi Hussein","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7eaa34da5c2fdd5aa1d7243acb8bfb55619aec4a6542e674902e922c11faf217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
