For them, this was a special and particularly emotional moment. It was a dream come true for Eolo-Kometa, the team they built one piece at a time since 2018. They finally arrived at the start line of their first Grand Tour in their history.</p>\n<p>That day, eight riders who would take part in the Giro d'Italia, dressed in blue, were called onto the stage and walked one after the other until they took their places in front of the public. They greeted those present and received the applause that is due to the riders who are about to begin a three-week effort. It was an exciting moment and, for Contador and Basso, it was also a great achievement, before anyone dared dream of Lorenzo Fortunato taking stage victory on the Zoncolan.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tagged/giro-ditalia-2021\">Giro d'Italia 2021</a></strong></em></p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/IMG_1097_copy_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621001545\" />\n<p>Also with them was Stefano Zanatta who participated in Giro d'Italia 28 times, first as an athlete and then in the team car. As sports director, he was preparing to begin a new adventure at the helm of the team, and exactly when we spoke to him about the journey ahead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/MAU_1627_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621947424\" /></p>\n<p><em>Eolo-Kometa DS Stefano Zanatta (middle)</em></p>\n<p><strong>So Stefano, how exciting is this Giro d'Italia?</strong></p>\n<p>It's emotional, because things are just beginning. For me, it's not the same as in 1986, when I took part for the first time as a rider, but it's always a big moment. There are twenty-one days of hard work ahead of us and maximum concentration will be needed to make everything work, from relationships between people to logistics. There will be a lot to do but there is also the special enthusiasm of the first time and the conviction that we have arrived at this race both well prepared and organised.</p>\n<p><strong>How has it been approaching this first Grand Tour?</strong></p>\n<p>On the one hand, there has been the preparation of equipment, means, material and riders, for us it is the first big Giro, and even if we all have great experience, certain things can only be tested in the field. As far as the riders and preparation are concerned, however, we are happy with what has been done. We've collected good results and we've done well in the races we've taken part in, showing that we're racing actively and with a desire to grow and stand out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Si gana Fortunato me voy de Pinto a Milano en bici\"<br /><br />¡Te esperamos, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/albertocontador?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@albertocontador</a>! 💙<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giro</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C6T8VKgS9a\">pic.twitter.com/C6T8VKgS9a</a></p>\n— Giro d'Italia (@giroditalia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giroditalia/status/1396126208816029701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2021</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>High emotions after the Eolo win on the Zoncolan this week (after our interview took place)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Which preparation stage races did you take part in before the Giro?</strong></p>\n<p>Tirreno-Adriatico, Tour of the Alps, Tour of Turkey. In the calendar there were few races this year and therefore we have, like everyone else, fewer days of racing in the legs. But we're happy with the work we've done, we've had a couple of top 5s and a lot of top 10s, we took the GPM jersey at Tirreno-Adriatico, we've always been in the breakaways so it's good. We were hoping for a win which would have given us great morale, but that's fine.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/MAU_2067_copy_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621001633\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it like racing against the WorldTour teams?</strong></p>\n<p>We're a new team with a smaller workforce than the big teams, so you can't make demands on these giants, you have to be patient and interpret the races with common sense, looking for the right opportunities. It's difficult to get results because all the teams now bring riders who are suited to aim for the victory. There are no longer any 'second tier' races, which, up until a few years ago, would have been the primary objectives for teams like ours. In this context, you have to adapt a bit more to the racing that other teams do and it is more difficult to take initiatives or to stand out.<br /><br /><strong>What is the main aim of your season?</strong></p>\n<p>We have the ambition to grow, as a team and with results. We would like to stand out and try to make the race when it is possible, by looking for and creating the right opportunities. Above all, we want to develop our young people well. Eolo-Kometa is not a team that is content with just having a presence, we have identified some specific goals for this Giro and we will try something that is within our capabilities, within our reach, and suitable for our riders. To achieve this we've put together a team with four young riders and four experienced men.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/2021-Giro-Zoncolan-galeria-11-1024x683_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621781916\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Which stages were you be aiming for?</strong></p>\n<p>Together with Ivan Basso and Sean Yates we chose a mix of riders who seem best suited to our objectives. Realistically, if I do the maths, there are 10-15 stages to aim for. By exclusion, putting aside the time trials and the important uphill finishes, where we'll give our all with Ravasi, but we can't expect top results from him, we'll concentrate on the mid-mountain stages in the second and third weeks, where there could be important breakaways. In the sprints, Belletti, who has already won a stage at the Giro in the past, will play his cards right. <br /><br /><strong>How important is it to have good equipment at your disposal?</strong></p>\n<p>Our riders are undoubtedly in a position to give their best. Alberto and Ivan are two maniacs about the product and materials. We have Aurum bikes that are those of their own production, Enve wheels, Prologo saddles, Kask helmets, Gobik clothing. In short, we have first-class materials available. This also means that we don't have any worries and that we are 100% focused on the quality of the performance. The guys are enthusiastic about this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1319491084_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621724738\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Is the Giro a dream come true?</strong></p>\n<p>From the foundation of the team participation in the Grand Tours was the goal of Alberto and his brother Fran. The jump from Continental to Professional is big, but, one step at a time, they got there, thanks to sponsors like Eolo and Kometa and all the other first-class companies we work with who believe in the project. We mustn't forget that behind this team there is a U23 team and a Junior team, so there are the foundations to continue to grow gradually and get results in the near future. We're going to do our best and give it our all.<br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/2021-Giro-Zoncolan-galeria-20-1024x683_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621781878\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Miles Baker-Clarke","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"cc810946c94f1a55e12e4bd513d492da9f8c9f68cfc9630dad7b29931263bcb3","category":"Cycling"}
