{"title":"Experimental Parametric Study on the Primary Efficiency of a Fixed Bottom-Detached Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Converter in Short-Fetch Sea Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0866/v1","date":1728619729000,"content":"The Oscillating Water Column (OWC) represents a highly promising approach for wave energy conversion. This study presents laboratory experiments conducted on a fixed, bottom-detached OWC device to evaluate the impact of various geometric parameters (specifically, turbine damping, front wall draft, and chamber length in the direction of wave propagation) on the device's capture width ratio.\nDespite the extensive research over the past few decades on OWC devices, most studies and field-tested prototypes have been designed for long-fetch sea conditions. Consequently, these devices tend to be larger in size and have higher rated power outputs. In contrast, short-fetch sea conditions necessitate tuning the OWC to the shorter dominant wave frequencies, which calls for the development of smaller devices and specialized turbines, highlighting the need for focused research.\nThis work specifically addresses short-fetch sea conditions, which are representative of moderate wave climates, such as those found in the Central Mediterranean region. The study identifies a maximum capture width ratio of approximately 73%. The experimental dataset generated can serve as a benchmark for numerical models under these specific conditions and assist in the development of air turbines optimized for effective performance in short-fetch wave climates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a04f4a52fb4c10d9f9f931915d1d6f953a1c68f1b5ca33ac44e4f8b71ce8cde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
