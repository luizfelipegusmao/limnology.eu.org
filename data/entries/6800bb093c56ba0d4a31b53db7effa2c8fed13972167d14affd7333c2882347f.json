{"title":"Supercritical microalgae conversion to biofuel and value‐added components (oxygenates, hydrocarbons, and aromatics): A catalyst characterization study","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14326?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The study aimed to investigate the use of SrO/TiO<sub>2</sub> nano-catalysts in the one-pot production of valuable products (such as fatty acid methyl esters, oxygenates, hydrocarbons, and aromatics) from <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> microalgae through a supercritical process. The research focused on examining the impact of the factors, the SrO to TiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, preparation method, and calcination temperature on the catalytic performance. Two calcination temperatures (600°C and 850°C), two Sr:Ti molar ratios (1 and 2), and two catalyst preparation methods (photochemical and impregnation) were considered. The catalysts were characterized using Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, x-ray crystallography, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller techniques. The evaluation of catalyst performance primarily focused on the production of value-added products, particularly fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The results indicated that the catalyst prepared using the photochemical method with a Sr:Ti molar ratio of 2 and calcined at 850°C exhibited superior performance in terms of FAMEs and oxygenates production. It was demonstrated that the catalyst prepared using the photochemical method with higher Sr:Ti ratio had better performances in the production of biodiesel.</p>","author":"Maryam Aghilinategh, \nMohammad Barati, \nMasood Hamadanian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"6800bb093c56ba0d4a31b53db7effa2c8fed13972167d14affd7333c2882347f","category":"Environment"}
