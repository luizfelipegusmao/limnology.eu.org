The research aims to provide nuanced insights into how e-commerce companies navigate the complexities of global supply chains to mitigate operational, financial, and reputational risks associated with supplier relationships. Through semi-structured interviews with 20 key stakeholders in the e-commerce sector, data were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings underscored the foundational role of trust in establishing resilient supplier relationships, facilitated by transparent communication, consistent performance evaluation, and mutual respect for contractual obligations. Effective communication practices, supported by digital platforms and technologies such as AI, blockchain, IoT, and cloud computing, enhanced operational transparency and decision-making capabilities across supply chains. The study identified diverse approaches to risk assessment, from qualitative evaluations to quantitative models utilizing predictive analytics and scenario planning. However, participants highlighted challenges including geopolitical uncertainties, trade disruptions, regulatory changes, and cultural barriers, necessitating adaptive strategies and diversified sourcing options. Innovation initiatives such as joint product development and technology adoption were crucial in enhancing supply chain agility and competitive advantage. Ethical considerations emerged as a critical aspect, influencing supplier selection criteria, CSR initiatives, environmental sustainability practices, and labor standards compliance. Integrating ethical guidelines into supplier contracts reinforced corporate values and enhanced brand reputation. Overall, this study contributes practical implications for e-commerce practitioners seeking to enhance supply chain resilience, mitigate supplier risks, and sustain competitive advantage in a dynamic global marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca555536cd9904c7a235e488aceb5925ad3176cbca3d3c6e8b38e94830bb1876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
