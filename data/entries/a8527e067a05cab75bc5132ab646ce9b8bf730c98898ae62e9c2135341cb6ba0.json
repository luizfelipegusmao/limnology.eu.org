We then apply our results to study the boundedness and the compactness of weighted composition operators between Bers-type spaces on five different domains: generalized Hua domains, Cartan-Hartogs domains, generalized Cartan-Hartogs domains, generalized Cartan-Hartogs domains over different Cartan domains and generalized ellipsoidal-type domains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8527e067a05cab75bc5132ab646ce9b8bf730c98898ae62e9c2135341cb6ba0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
