Patients underwent baseline, interim, and end-of-treatment bone scintigraphy (BS) and 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT (FCH PET/CT) scans, obtaining multiple imaging radiomics as well as clinical and biochemical variables during follow-up and studying their association with the previously defined end-points. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were calculated, and these models were depicted by means of nomograms.\nResults:  Median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for our population were 4 and 14 months (mo), respectively. The variables that showed the most robust independent significant association with therapeutic failure were baseline alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels (p=0.022) and the characteristics of BM on CT portion of PET/CT (p=0.017). In the case of OS, the significant variables were therapeutic failure (p=0.038), the number of lines received after 223Ra (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"582b73ac26cbd828a1fb1f3b1de10bee93c523c877394a8b43598687a91a91a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
