Additionally, the paper investigates Schur inequality and Hermite-Hadamard (H-H) inequalities for this new class of convexity. Also, H-H inequalities are proved within context of Riemann-Liouville integrals and Caputo Fractional derivatives. The efficiency and feasibility of Schur inequality and H-H inequalities are supported by incorporating multiple illustrations, that demonstrate the applicability of strongly modified (<i>p</i>, <i>h</i>)-convex functions. The results contribute to the field of mathematical analysis and provide valuable insights into the properties and applications of strongly modified (<i>p</i>, <i>h</i>)-convex functions.","author":"Ammara Nosheen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"08f06af4bc776b6e182187027e83024d701baf02150b69f31ea65411c3ff92ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
