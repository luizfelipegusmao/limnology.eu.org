{"title":"410 Preparing yourself, or your students, for a career in the animal science industries","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/424/7757494?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Preparing yourself, or your students, for a career in Animal Science related industries may seem to require a crystal ball. As important as the specific knowledge might seem, the animal science students of tomorrow will need skills, perspective, an open mindset, the ability to think critically and a desire to be a problem solver. Careers going forward will reward the polymaths who are adaptable and resilient. Experiential training, a hallmark of animal science teaching in recent decades, should, in future, cross three domains: research, animal management and work. Experience in identifying pertinent research questions, forming hypotheses, a plan to test them and skills to analyze the results will be crucial to solving livestock-related challenges of the future. Living the day-to-day experience of a livestock producer will create graduates who are better grounded in and empathetic to the reality of livestock management. And lastly, internships can provide great insight into the demands of, and varied skills required to succeed in, the workplace. Our curricula for the animal science employee of the future should have depth and a great deal of breadth. Excellent understanding of the basic sciences: chemistry, biology, physiology, microbiology, is a given in order that employees can grasp the ever-deeper level of knowledge we have of animal-based systems. In our view, careers of the future will also require working knowledge of a wide swath of disciplines. Students should recognize the increasing likelihood that they may work in a small, entrepreneurial business at some point in their career. In addition to their animal science expertise, they may be called upon to contribute to initiatives in marketing, finance, innovation, global trade, data analytics, communications, One Health, compliance, sustainability or business ethics, to name a few. At the risk of being labeled as a “jack of all trades and master of none”, the animal science employee of the future will need multiple skillsets, the flexibility to draw on all of them and the willingness to step up and contribute to the success of their employer.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"517ba66c23bd0c3a3e866dc048c97e07b5a9a44d4c9bff23100eb58bee4d427d","category":"Environment"}
