{"title":"Fabrication and Characterisation of Sustainable 3D Printed Parts Using Post-consumer PLA Plastic and Virgin PLA Blends","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1297/v1","date":1711091554000,"content":"Sustainable manufacturing practices are becoming increasingly necessary due to the growing concerns regarding climate change and resource scarcity. Consequently, material recycling technologies have gradually become preferred over conventional processes. This study aimed to recycle waste polylactic acid (PLA) from household-disposed cups and lids to create 3D-printed parts and promote sustainable manufacturing practices. To achieve this, the current study utilised virgin and post-consumer PLA (sourced from household waste) blends. The PC-PLA wastes were shredded and sorted by size with the aid of a washing step, resulting in a filament with a 1.70 ± 0.5 mm diameter without fragmentation or dissolution. A 50:50 wt.% blend of virgin PLA (vPLA) and PC-PLA was selected as the standard recycling percentage based on previous research and resource conservation goals. The study investigated the impact of three 3D printing parameters (layer height (LH), infill density (I), and nozzle temperature (NT))on the quality of 3D-printed parts using a three-level L9 Taguchi orthogonal array. The findings revealed that blending PC-PLA with vPLA led to significant improvements in the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths by 18.40%, 8%, and 9.15%, respectively, compared to those of recycled PLA. This conclusion was supported by the investigation of the fracture surface area, which revealed fractographic features associated with printing parameters, such as plastic deformation and interfilament debonding. An ANOVA analysis revealed a positive influence of larger layer height and high nozzle temperature on the mechanical properties. Subsequently, the optimal printing parameters (LH: 0.3 mm, I: 100%, and NT: 215 °C) were determined using the S/N ratio, and a confirmation test using the optimum printing parameters exhibited a strong correlation with statistically predicted outcomes. Finally, the study used optimum printing parameters to fabricate 100% post-consumer recycled PLA 3D printed parts, demonstrating their potential for low-strength applications. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that virgin and post-consumer recycled PLA blended filament for fabricating 3D printed components is an effective way to support plastic recycling in the context of a circular economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43802ac6803e231fbcc7e572355fda7572bce5970188982775052d7c63235a64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
