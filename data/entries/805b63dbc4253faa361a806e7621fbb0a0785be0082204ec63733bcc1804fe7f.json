Some key examples for nanoelectronics applications include setting and resetting processes in phase change memory, resistive switching, and piezoelectric/ferroelectric switching. In addition, novel metastable states may be electrically accessible in quantum materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.711-B1\">1</a>]. However, few techniques exist that can visualize these dynamic processes at the nanometer and nanosecond space and time scales relevant for nanoelectronics. To this end, we have developed a nanosecond electron microscopy capability at the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne National Laboratory that can visualize electrically triggered phenomena in real and reciprocal space with the required space and time resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.711-B2\">2</a>]. As a first application to materials physics, we recorded the structural dynamics during volatile electrical switching of the room temperature charge density wave state in 1T-TaS<sub>2</sub>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"805b63dbc4253faa361a806e7621fbb0a0785be0082204ec63733bcc1804fe7f","category":"Environment"}
