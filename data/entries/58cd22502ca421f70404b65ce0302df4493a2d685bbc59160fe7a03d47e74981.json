{"title":"Myokines: metabolic regulation in obesity and type 2 diabetes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae006/7618092?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Skeletal muscle plays a vital role in the regulation of systemic metabolism, partly through its secretion of endocrine factors which are collectively known as myokines. Altered myokine levels are associated with metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). The significance of interorgan crosstalk, particularly through myokines, has emerged as a fundamental aspect of nutrient and energy homeostasis. However, a comprehensive understanding of myokine biology in the setting of obesity and T2D remains a major challenge. In this review, we discuss the regulation and biological functions of key myokines that have been extensively studied during the past two decades, namely interleukin 6 (IL-6), irisin, myostatin (MSTN), growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), apelin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), meteorin-like (Metrnl), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), Î²-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), Musclin, and Dickkopf 3 (Dkk3). Related to these, we detail the role of exercise in myokine expression and secretion together with their contributions to metabolic physiology and disease. Despite significant advancements in myokine research, many myokines remain challenging to measure accurately and investigate thoroughly. Hence, new research techniques and detection methods should be developed and rigorously tested. Therefore, developing a comprehensive perspective on myokine biology is crucial, as this will likely offer new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying obesity and T2D and may reveal novel targets for therapeutic interventions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"58cd22502ca421f70404b65ce0302df4493a2d685bbc59160fe7a03d47e74981","category":"Environment"}
