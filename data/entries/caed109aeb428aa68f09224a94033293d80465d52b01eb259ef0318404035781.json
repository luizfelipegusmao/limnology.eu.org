{"title":"Global Disparities in Employability and Business Skill Demand Through a Synthetic Comparative Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1446/v1","date":1729235805000,"content":"This study provides a global comparative analysis of employability and business skill demands across various regions and educational levels, focusing on business studies within tertiary education. By examining data on employment, unemployment, and inactivity rates for individuals with bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees, the paper identifies significant regional and gender disparities in labor market outcomes. Southern Europe and Asia-Pacific exhibit higher unemployment rates among graduates, particularly women and older individuals, while Northern and Western Europe show more favorable employment trends. The study also explores the varying demand for essential business skills, such as administration, financial management and sales/marketing across high and upper-middle-income regions. High-income regions prioritize advanced skills in financial management and marketing, whereas upper-middle-income countries focus on process optimization and administration. Gender disparities persist globally, with women facing higher unemployment rates despite educational attainment. The findings highlight the importance of aligning educational systems with labor market needs and addressing gender inequalities through targeted policies. This analysis informs workforce development, educational planning, and policymaking aimed at improving employment outcomes in diverse economic contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"caed109aeb428aa68f09224a94033293d80465d52b01eb259ef0318404035781","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
