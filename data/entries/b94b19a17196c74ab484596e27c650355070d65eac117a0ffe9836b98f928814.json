{"title":"Real-Time Implementation of Cascade Nonlinear FF-PI Retarted Controller Design for Industrial Process Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0288/v1","date":1722860940000,"content":"This study introduces a cascade nonlinear proportional integral retarded (CNPIR) controller for the first time in the literature, aiming to achieve real-time precise control of a double-tank liquid level system. It begins by outlining the characteristics of de-lay-based systems and detailing the dynamic behavior of the liquid-level system. The study evaluates the system's performance by developing and analyzing the mathe-matical models of both the feedforward proportional-integral (FF-PI) controller and the CNPIR controller. Two different control techniques were employed, with real-time tests conducted to assess the system's axis movement performance. The FF-PI controller was used as the initial control technique, while the CNPIR controller was introduced to enhance system performance during trajectory tracking. Experimental results demon-strated that the CNPIR method significantly improved trajectory tracking response, reduced overshoot, and achieved better steady-state error under external disturbances compared to the FF-PI controller. Thus, the experimental study, highlights the effec-tiveness of the proposed control design and its superiority over some existing classical methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b94b19a17196c74ab484596e27c650355070d65eac117a0ffe9836b98f928814","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
