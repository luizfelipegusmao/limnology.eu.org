{"title":"Musculoskeletal Infection: The Great Mimickers on Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2098/v1","date":1724913547000,"content":"A series of conditions can mimic musculoskeletal infections on imaging, complicating their diagnosis and affecting the treatment. Depending on the anatomical location, different conditions can manifest with clinical and imaging findings that mimic infections. Herein we present a wide spectrum of the musculoskeletal disorders of the axial skeleton, long bones, peripheral joints and soft-tissue which may manifest as an infectious process, besides focusing on the potential mimics of osteomyelitis, septic arthritis and infectious spondylodiscitis that are common in clinical practice. We present the typical imaging characteristics of each musculoskeletal infection, followed by mimicking conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"165e417859ced0d075fa76e666e5db8a40c01f02d67d6293432096c3f85b1803","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
