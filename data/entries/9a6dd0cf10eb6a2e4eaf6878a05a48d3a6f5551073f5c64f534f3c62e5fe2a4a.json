{"title":"Waste management 2.0 leveraging internet of things for an efficient and eco-friendly smart city solution","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307608","date":1722434400000,"content":"<p>by Abdullah Addas, Muhammad Nasir Khan, Fawad Naseer</p>\r\n\r\nWaste management poses a major challenge for cities worldwide, with significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. This paper proposes a novel waste management system leveraging recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), algorithms, and cloud analytics to enable more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly waste collection and processing in smart cities. An ultrasonic sensor prototype is tailored for reliable fill-level monitoring. A LoRaWAN and cellular network architecture provides city-wide connectivity. A cloud platform handles sensor data storage, processing, and analytics. Dynamic route optimization algorithms minimize time, distance, and fuel use based on real-time bin data. Extensive pilot studies in 10 different locations across Lahore, Pakistan, validated the system, processing over 200 million data points. The results showed a 32% improvement in route efficiency, a 29% decrease in fuel consumption and emissions, a 33% increase in waste processing throughput, and 18% vehicle maintenance savings versus conventional practices. This demonstrates quantifiable benefits across operational, economic, and sustainability dimensions. The proposed IoT-enabled waste management system represents a significant advancement towards sustainable and ecologically responsible waste practices in smart cities worldwide. This research provides a replicable model for holistic smart city solutions integrating sensing, algorithms, and analytics to transition civic operations towards data-driven, efficient paradigms. It represents a significant advancement in sustainable waste practices for smart cities worldwide. Further work could apply emerging technologies like automation and artificial intelligence to create waste management 3.0.","author":"Abdullah Addas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9a6dd0cf10eb6a2e4eaf6878a05a48d3a6f5551073f5c64f534f3c62e5fe2a4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
