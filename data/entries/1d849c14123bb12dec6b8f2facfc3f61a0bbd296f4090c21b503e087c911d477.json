{"title":"Comparative study between biliary covered self-expandable metal stent and conventional endoscopic bile drainage treatment in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-related Stapfer type II retroperitoneal perforations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300029","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Jun Heo, Min Kyu Jung, Jieun Lee, Dong wook Lee, Chang Min Cho, Jung Guen Cha</p>\r\nBackground <p>Perforation is one of the most serious complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Conventional nonsurgical endoscopic treatments including intravenous antibiotic administration and plastic endoscopic biliary drainage are generally approved for the treatment of ERCP-related Stapfer type II perforation (perivaterian type). Biliary covered metal stent placement has recently been reported to have favorable outcomes in ERCP-related Stapfer type II perforations. We aimed to compare the outcomes of conventional endoscopic bile drainage and biliary covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) insertion in patients with Stapfer type II perforation.</p> Methods <p>Medical records of patients who underwent ERCP at Kyungpook National University Hospital in Daegu from 2011 to 2022 were retrospectively reviewed.</p> Results <p>A total of 8,402 ERCP procedures were performed in our hospital. Sixty-six ERCP-related perforations (0.78%) were identified. Among them, 37 patients (56.1%) who had Stapfer type II perforations were enrolled. Thirteen and twenty-four patients received biliary covered SEMS insertion and conventional endoscopic bile drainage treatments, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the clinical success rate (92.3% vs. 91.7%, p = 1.000), hospital stay (9.46 ± 5.97 vs. 13.9 ± 13.2 days, p = 0.258), and post-ERCP–related fasting time (5.4 ± 3.4 vs 4.3 ± 3.0 days, p = 0.305). Complications including bleeding, post-ERCP pancreatitis, fever, and death were not significantly different between the two groups. The conventional endoscopic bile drainage group took less time for ERCP than the SEMS group (11.5 ± 5.2 vs. 18.5 ± 11.2 min, p = 0.013).</p> Conclusions <p>Compared with the conventional endoscopic bile drainage treatment method, biliary covered SEMS did not improve patient outcomes in ERCP-related Stapfer type II perforations.</p>","author":"Jun Heo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1d849c14123bb12dec6b8f2facfc3f61a0bbd296f4090c21b503e087c911d477","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
