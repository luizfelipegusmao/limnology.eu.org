{"title":"Theoretical Proof of De Broglie&rsquo;s Wave Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1504/v1","date":1721339021000,"content":"This paper, based on the \"Unified Theory of Forces,\" rigorously proves the formula of de Broglie's wave function. This helps us better understand the following important issues: 1) Theoretically prove and understand the essence of de Broglie's wave function; 2) Prove that when the particle's momentum P is determined, the greater the mass of the particle, the more concentrated its wave function distribution, and the weaker the interference effect; 3) Correct the spatial distribution of the wave function of free particles, proving that the wave function of free particles is strictly constrained within a finite spatial range, which is consistent with the facts we observe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24b08a20cf4645838413ed15167320bebe9e4c44f2484e2732501902d16277bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
