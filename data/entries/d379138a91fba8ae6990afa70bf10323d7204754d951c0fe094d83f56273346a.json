{"title":"Determination of Local Heat Transfer Coefficients and Friction Factors at Variable Temperature and Velocity Boundary Conditions for Complex Flows","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1092/v1","date":1723647490000,"content":"Transient conjugate heat transfer measurements under varying temperature and velocity inlet boundary conditions at incompressible flow conditions were performed for flat plate and ribbed channel geometries. Therefrom local adiabatic wall temperatures and heat transfer coefficients are determined. Those data are analyzed using typical heat transfer correlations, e.g. Nu=CRe^mPr^n determining the local distribution of C and m. It is shown that they are closely linked. A relationship lnC=Aâˆ’mB is observed with A and B as modeling parameters. They could be related to parameters in log law or power law representations for turbulent boundary layer flows. The parameter m is shown to have a close link to local pressure gradients and therewith near wall streamlines as well as friction factor distributions. A normalization of the C parameter allows to derive a Reynolds analogy factor and therefrom local wall shear stresses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d379138a91fba8ae6990afa70bf10323d7204754d951c0fe094d83f56273346a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
