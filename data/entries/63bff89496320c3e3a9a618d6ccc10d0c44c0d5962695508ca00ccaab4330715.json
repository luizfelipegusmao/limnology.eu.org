{"title":"Effect of Computer-Assisted Cognitive Remediation Therapy on Cognition Among Patients With Schizophrenia: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0414/v1","date":1718015545000,"content":"In schizophrenia, cognition is closely linked to social competence and influences long-term prognosis. Thus, treatment should target cognitive improvement to enhance the patients’ societal adaptation. This study evaluated the effects of computer-assisted cognitive remediation therapy (CR) using RehaCom® on cognition in patients with schizophrenia. Thirty patients were randomized, with 15 assigned to the CR group and treatment usual care (TAU) and 15 to the TAU alone groups. Over 12 weeks, patients received CR twice weekly, including two computer sessions and one verbal session. Outcomes measured were cognition using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia and Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale, intrinsic motivation using the Quality of Life Scale and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, psychiatric symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, negative symptoms using Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and functional level using modified Global Assessment of Functioning scale for Functioning. The CR + TAU group demonstrated considerable improvements in cognition, intrinsic motivation, negative symptoms, and functional level compared to the TAU-alone group. These findings indicate that the CR using RehaCom® enhances cognition and other outcomes in schizophrenia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63bff89496320c3e3a9a618d6ccc10d0c44c0d5962695508ca00ccaab4330715","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
