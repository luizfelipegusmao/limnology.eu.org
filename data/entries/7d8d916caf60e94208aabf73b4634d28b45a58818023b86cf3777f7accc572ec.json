{"title":"Evaluation of a Ten Immunodot Antigens Test in Autoimmune Hepatitis and Primary Biliary Cholangitis, Lessons Learned for a Tertiary Care Academic Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2272/v1","date":1722234887000,"content":"Autoimmune diseases of the liver and biliary tract require timely and accurate diagnosis. This study evaluates the D-tek panel (D-Tek, Mons, Belgium) of 10 immunodot antigens for its effectiveness in diagnosing autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). We retrospectively analysed serum samples from 111 patients who had undergone routine testing, including indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), to confirm or exclude autoimmune liver or biliary tract disease. The panel tested for M2/nPDC, M2/OGDC-E2, M2/BCOADC-E2, M2/PDC-E2, gp210, sp100, LKM1, LC1, SLA, and F-actin antigens. Results showed that all positive IIF+ELISA results were confirmed by the immunodot panel, except for two samples from patients never diagnosed with AIH. The immunodot test identified over 20 additional autoantibodies in samples initially negative by IIF, corroborated by laboratory imaging and medical history. The immunodot technique proved to be a quick, sensitive, and specific method with high overall accuracy. This study suggests that the immunodot technique may be an effective screening and confirmatory method for autoimmune liver diseases, potentially improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d8d916caf60e94208aabf73b4634d28b45a58818023b86cf3777f7accc572ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
