{"title":"Polysaccharides from Dendrobium officinale improve obesity‐induced insulin resistance through the gut microbiota and the SOCS3‐mediated insulin receptor substrate‐1 signaling pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13229?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Obesity induces insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, impacting human health. The relationship between obesity, gut microbiota, and regulatory mechanisms has been studied extensively. <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> polysaccharide (DOP), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, potentially reduces insulin resistance. However, the mechanism through which DOP affects gut microbiota and alleviates obesity-induced insulin resistance in rats requires further investigation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The current study aimed to assess the impact of DOP on gut microbiota and insulin resistance in rats on a high-fat diet. The results revealed that DOP effectively reduced blood lipids, glucose disorders, oxidative stress, and inflammatory infiltration in the liver of obese Sprague Dawley rats. This was achieved by downregulating <i>SOCS3</i> expression and upregulating insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) by regulating the JAK/STAT/<i>SOCS3</i> signaling pathway. Notably, DOP intervention enhanced the abundance of beneficial gut microbiota and reduced harmful microbiota. Correlation analysis demonstrated significant associations among intestinal microbiota, <i>SOCS3</i>-mediated IRS-1 expression, and inflammatory factors.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Dendrobium officinale</i> polysaccharide regulated the gut microbiota, enhanced IRS-1 expression, and mitigated liver injury and insulin resistance due to a high-fat diet. These findings depict the potential anti-insulin resistance properties of DOP and offer further evidence for addressing obesity and its complications. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wei Jiang, \nJin Tan, \nJiacheng Zhang, \nXin Deng, \nXinyue He, \nJin Zhang, \nTong Liu, \nRong Sun, \nMengxun Sun, \nKuo Chen, \nTingjia Xu, \nYuling Yan, \nAli Moazzami, \nE‐Jiao Wu, \nJiasui Zhan, \nBinhong Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"71d09dfd20b9884faeb5fe189ddbb2c769e285c7ca36777a4f40d50412c038a0","category":"Environment"}
