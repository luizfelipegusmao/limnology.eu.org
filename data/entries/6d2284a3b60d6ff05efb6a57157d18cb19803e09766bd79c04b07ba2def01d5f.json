The cortical brain waves could have a role in the process of executive function deterioration, increasing dementia symptoms. Objective: To interrogate the effects of physical exercise, and non-invasive brain stimulation, both in electrophysiological behavior of the brain, the executive functions, and dementia symptoms in older adults with AD. Methods: One hundred and sixteen older adults were grouped (n=22 each): GAE (AD, PMED+NIBS), GCP (AD, PMED), GCN (AD, NIBS), GCS (control, no intervention). Binaural beats were used as a non-invasive brain stimulation, physical exercise, or both, were applied during 16 weeks. Pre/post measurements included Alpha Band, and SMR Rhythms, executive functions, and dementia symptoms. Results: GCS showed no significant changes (p&gt;0.05). GCN and GCS slightly enhanced inhibitory control (p&gt;0.05) and working memory (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, GCP and GAE improved executive function (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d2284a3b60d6ff05efb6a57157d18cb19803e09766bd79c04b07ba2def01d5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
