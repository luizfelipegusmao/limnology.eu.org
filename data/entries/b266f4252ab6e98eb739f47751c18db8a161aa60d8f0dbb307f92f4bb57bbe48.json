{"title":"Radiogenomics Pilot Study: Association Between Radiomics and SNP-Based Microarray Copy Number Variation in Diagnosing Renal Oncocytoma and Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1596/v1","date":1729581344000,"content":"Background: RO and ChRCC are kidney tumours with overlapping characteristics, making differentiation between them challenging. Objectives: The objective of this research is to create a radiogenomics map by correlating radiomic features to molecular phenotypes in ChRCC and RO, using resection as the gold standard. Methods: Fourteen patients (6 RO and 8 ChRCC) were included in the study. A total of 1,875 radiomic features were extracted from CT scans, alongside 632 cytobands containing 16,303 genes from the genomic data. Results: Feature selection algorithms applied to the radiomic features resulted in 13 key features. From the genomic data, 24 cytobands highly correlated with histology were selected and cross-correlated with the radiomic features. The analysis identified four radiomic features that were strongly associated with seven genomic features. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating radiomic and genomic data to enhance the differential diagnosis of RO and ChRCC, paving the way for more precise and non-invasive diagnostic tools in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b266f4252ab6e98eb739f47751c18db8a161aa60d8f0dbb307f92f4bb57bbe48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
