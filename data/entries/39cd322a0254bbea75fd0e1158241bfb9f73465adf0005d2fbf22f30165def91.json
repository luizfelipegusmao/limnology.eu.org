{"title":"Diamond Gymnura natalensis and duckbill Aetomylaeus bovinus rays undertake nationwide coastal migrations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15728?af=R","date":1711529660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Migration is a critical aspect of ocean ecosystems, and understanding this phenomenon answers ecological and management questions. Given the difficulty in tracking ocean animals across large distances, the extent to which different ray species perform long-distance movements, such as migrations, remains unknown. This study used passive acoustic telemetry to track the movements of endemic diamond <i>Gymnura natalensis</i> and critically endangered duckbill <i>Aetomylaeus bovinus</i> rays along the South African coastline using a collaborative nationwide network of coastal acoustic receivers for up to 7 years. Duckbill rays were detected significantly more frequently than diamond rays, but both species moved between the south and east coasts of South Africa (traveling up to 1167 km). Tagged individuals were detected significantly more often in their tagging locations during summer months but traveled significantly further distances during winter months. Furthermore, movement models fitted to individual duckbill rays' annual net-squared displacement identified most individual annual movements as migratory. This evidence suggests that both diamond and duckbill rays make eastward winter migrations and return to specific areas along the coastline during the summer months. The exceptions to this were diamond rays tagged on the east coast that were not found to migrate seasonally, which supports previous research that there is intraspecific variability in migrations for ray species. These findings have implications for understanding ray migration not only on a global scale but also locally for spatial management interventions and population delineation.</p>","author":"Chantel Elston, \nTaryn S.
