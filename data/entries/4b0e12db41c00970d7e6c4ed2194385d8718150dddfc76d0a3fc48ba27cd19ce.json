{"title":"Assessment of <i>Vibrionaceae</i> prevalence in seafood from Qidong market and analysis of <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> strains","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309304","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Qinglian Huang, Yiquan Zhang, Miaomiao Zhang, Xue Li, Qinjun Wang, Xianyi Ji, Rongrong Chen, Xi Luo, Shenjie Ji, Renfei Lu</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of <i>Vibrionaceae</i> family in retail seafood products available in the Qidong market during the summer of 2023 and to characterize <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> isolates, given that this bacterium is the leading cause of seafood-associated food poisoning. We successfully isolated a total of 240 <i>Vibrionaceae</i> strains from a pool of 718 seafood samples. The breakdown of the isolates included 146 <i>Photobacterium damselae</i>, 59 <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>, 18 <i>V. campbellii</i>, and 11 <i>V. alginolyticus</i>. Among these, <i>P</i>. <i>damselae</i> and <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> were the predominant species, with respective prevalence rates of 20.3% and 8.2%. Interestingly, all 59 isolates of <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> were identified as non-pathogenic. They demonstrated proficiency in swimming and swarming motility and were capable of forming biofilms across a range of temperatures. In terms of antibiotic resistance, the <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> isolates showed high resistance to ampicillin, intermediate resistance to cefuroxime and cefazolin, and were sensitive to the other antibiotics evaluated. The findings of this study may offer valuable insights and theoretical support for enhancing seafood safety measures in Qidong City.","author":"Qinglian Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4b0e12db41c00970d7e6c4ed2194385d8718150dddfc76d0a3fc48ba27cd19ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
