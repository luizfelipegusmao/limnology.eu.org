{"title":"A rapid and easy-to-use spinal muscular atrophy screening tool based on primers with high specificity and amplification efficiency for <i>SMN1</i> combined with single-stranded tag hybridization assay","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308179","date":1722520800000,"content":"<p>by Masaki Hirano, Kentaro Sahashi, Yuki Ichikawa, Masahisa Katsuno, Atsushi Natsume</p>\r\n\r\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an intractable neuromuscular disorder primarily caused by homozygous deletions in exon 7 of the <i>SMN1</i> gene. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of patients with SMA have a significant impact on prognosis, and several therapies have recently been developed. Current SMA screening tests require a significant turnaround time to identify patients with suspected SMA, due both to the interval between the birth of a newborn and the collection of blood for newborn mass screening and the difficulty in distinguishing between <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i>, a paralog gene that requires testing in specialized laboratories. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a novel SMA screening assay that can be rapidly performed in ordinary hospitals and clinics to overcome these issues. We designed over 100 combinations of forward and reverse primers with 3â€² ends targeting <i>SMN1</i>-specific sites around exon 7, and evaluated their specificity and amplification efficiency by quantitative PCR to identify the best primer pair. Furthermore, we performed a single-stranded tag hybridization assay after PCR. To evaluate the accuracy and practicality of the newly developed assay, we analyzed saliva specimens from five patients with SMA and two SMA carriers collected in an outpatient clinic and DNA specimens from three patients with SMA and four SMA carriers from a biobank, together with those from healthy individuals. DNA and raw saliva specimens from all patients with SMA demonstrated a biallelic loss of <i>SMN1</i>, whereas those from carriers and healthy individuals did not. The results of 50 independent experiments were consistent for all samples. The assay could be completed within one hour. This simple and convenient new screening tool has the potential to allow patients with SMA to receive disease-modifying therapies within a shorter timeframe.","author":"Masaki Hirano","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0065401762692742300c8d21c6567c3b993420424a17c06f9f4c45ef09e94693","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
