{"title":"Predictive Maintenance Technologies in Retail Supply Chain Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2134/v1","date":1722048891000,"content":"Predictive maintenance technologies have emerged as a transformative force in retail supply chain management, offering the potential to significantly enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. This study explores the implementation and impact of predictive maintenance within the retail sector, focusing on its benefits, challenges, technological tools, and future directions. The findings indicate that predictive maintenance enables a proactive approach to equipment management, leading to substantial reductions in downtime and maintenance costs, extended equipment lifespan, and enhanced sustainability through reduced energy consumption and waste. However, the adoption of these technologies is not without challenges. High initial costs, the need for specialized skills in data analytics and IoT, issues with data quality and reliability, organizational resistance, and cybersecurity concerns present significant barriers to successful implementation. Technological tools such as IoT sensors, data analytics platforms, machine learning algorithms, and digital twins are crucial for the effective functioning of predictive maintenance systems, providing real-time data monitoring and analysis that improve decision-making and maintenance planning. The study also highlights promising future trends, including advancements in AI, machine learning, IoT, and blockchain technologies, which are expected to further enhance predictive maintenance capabilities. To fully realize the potential of predictive maintenance, companies must address the identified challenges, invest in workforce development, and implement robust data security measures. Future research should focus on exploring these advancements, understanding the broader environmental impacts, and conducting cross-industry analyses to identify best practices. Overall, while predictive maintenance offers substantial benefits, its successful integration requires a nuanced approach that balances technological innovation with strategic and operational considerations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb895d920d3d823b9541a15e2a413c95c33d9309cdb0f5a13e34cc26a91bb833","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
