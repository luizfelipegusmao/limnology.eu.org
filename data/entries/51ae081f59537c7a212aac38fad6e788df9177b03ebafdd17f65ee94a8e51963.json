{"title":"Effect of heat treatment on microstructure and mechanical properties of selective laser melted Inconel 718 alloy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309156","date":1725544800000,"content":"<p>by Qiuxia Fan, Jianyu Li, Liuwei Zheng, Caiyun Hao, Qianqian Zhang, Yingzhi Wang</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, we conducted two heat treatment processes, namely double aging (DA) and solid solution followed by double aging (SA), on the Inconel 718 alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The aim was to investigate the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 under different heat treatment conditions. To achieve this, we employed advanced techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Tofwerk time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our experimental findings reveal the presence of cellular high-density dislocation substructures in the as-received (AR) specimens, with a significant accumulation of Laves phase precipitates at grain boundaries and subgrain boundaries. After the DA treatment, the cellular substructure persists, with higher concentrations of γ\" and γ’ strengthened phases compared to AR specimen. Conversely, the SA specimen undergoes almost complete recrystallization, resulting in the dissolution of brittle Laves phases and a substantial increase in the content of strengthening phase γ’’ and γ’. As a consequence of the precipitation of the γ’’ and γ’ strengthened phase and the modification of the microstructure, the material exhibits enhanced strength and hardness, albeit at the expense of reduced plasticity. The investigation of the relationship between heat treatment processes and precipitation behavior indicates that the SA heat treatment yields favorable mechanical properties that strike a balance between strength and plasticity.","author":"Qiuxia Fan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"51ae081f59537c7a212aac38fad6e788df9177b03ebafdd17f65ee94a8e51963","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
