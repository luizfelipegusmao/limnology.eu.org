{"title":"The Role of Delays in the Performance of Blasting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0625/v1","date":1715268437000,"content":"When researching rock blasting, the design parameters used for the analysis are usually the ge-ometric and charging ones. This study is based on a different approach, and focuses on the effect of timing, in specific the role of delays in the initiation sequence. The data come from the results of  full-scale blasts. The experimental setting and location allowed to consider all parameter other than the number of delays as a constant. The experimental results are analyzed relating the delay var-iables to fragmentation and KPIs of downstream operations. It is shown how increasing the number of delays per unit of blasted rock and reducing simultaneous adjacent holes produces finer fragmentation, reduces the amount of fines, facilitates the secondary operations and reduces the risk of flyrock.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e66c4dd964e23e66477d0f2771d02e8392d611e73588c1b8dd28deebccff3f5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
