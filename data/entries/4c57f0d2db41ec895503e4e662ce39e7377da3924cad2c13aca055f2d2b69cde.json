{"title":"Cosmic Expansion &ndash; Clues From the Earth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1202/v1","date":1718696578000,"content":"It is generally assumed that the universe expands only on large scales. For some time now, there has also been a well-founded assumption in the literature that cosmic expansion also exists in gravitationally bound systems. In this article we attempt to establish whether cosmic expansion also takes place on scales such as the Earth's sphere of influence. In the examples presented, we find the  expansion rate of the size required by the \"constant\" found by Hubble and Lema√Ætre. This is supported by other examples that also contradict the general assumption mentioned at the beginning. However, this leads to conclusions that also call other cosmological assumptions into question.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c57f0d2db41ec895503e4e662ce39e7377da3924cad2c13aca055f2d2b69cde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
