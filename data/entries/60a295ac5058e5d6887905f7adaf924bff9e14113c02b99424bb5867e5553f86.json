{"title":"Bladder Reconstruction in Cats Using in Body Tissue Architecture (iBTA)-Induced Biosheet","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0095/v1","date":1712020111000,"content":"Urinary tract diseases are common in cats, and often require surgical reconstruction. Here, to explore the possibility of urinary tract reconstruction in cats using in-vivo tissue architecture (iBTA), biosheets fabricated using iBTA technology were implanted into the feline bladder and the regeneration process was histologically evaluated. The biosheets were prepared by embedding molds into the dorsal subcutaneous pouches of six cats for 2 months. A section of the bladder wall was removed, and the biosheets were sutured to the excision site. After 1 and 3 months of implantation, the biosheets were harvested and evaluated histologically. Implantable biosheets were formed with a success rate of 67%. There were no major complications following implantation, including tissue rejection, severe inflammation, or infection. Urinary incontinence was also not observed. Histological evaluation revealed the bladder lumen was almost entirely covered by urothelium after 1 month, with myofibroblast infiltration into the biosheets. After 3 months, the urothelium became multilayered, and mature myocytes and nerve fibers were observed at the implantation site. In conclusion, this study showed that tissue reconstruction using iBTA can be applied to cats, and that biosheets have the potential to be useful in both the structural and functional regeneration of the feline urinary tract.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60a295ac5058e5d6887905f7adaf924bff9e14113c02b99424bb5867e5553f86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
