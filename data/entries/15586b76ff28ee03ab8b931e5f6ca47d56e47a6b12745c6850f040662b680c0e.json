{"title":"The scale of zebrafish pectoral fin buds is determined by intercellular K<sup>+</sup> levels and consequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling via retinoic acid regulation of Rcan2 and Kcnk5b","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002565","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Xiaowen Jiang, Kun Zhao, Yi Sun, Xinyue Song, Chao Yi, Tianlong Xiong, Sen Wang, Yi Yu, Xiduo Chen, Run Liu, Xin Yan, Christopher L. Antos</p>\r\n\r\nK<sup>+</sup> channels regulate morphogens to scale adult fins, but little is known about what regulates the channels and how they control morphogen expression. Using the zebrafish pectoral fin bud as a model for early vertebrate fin/limb development, we found that K<sup>+</sup> channels also scale this anatomical structure, and we determined how one K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel, Kcnk5b, integrates into its developmental program. From FLIM measurements of a FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based K<sup>+</sup> sensor, we observed coordinated decreases in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> levels during bud growth, and overexpression of K<sup>+</sup>-leak channels in vivo coordinately increased bud proportions. Retinoic acid, which can enhance fin/limb bud growth, decreased K<sup>+</sup> in bud tissues and up-regulated <i>regulator of calcineurin</i> (<i>rcan2</i>). <i>rcan2</i> overexpression increased bud growth and decreased K<sup>+</sup>, while CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of <i>rcan2</i> decreased growth and increased K<sup>+</sup>. We observed similar results in the adult caudal fins. Moreover, CRISPR targeting of Kcnk5b revealed that Rcan2-mediated growth was dependent on the Kcnk5b. We also found that Kcnk5b enhanced depolarization in fin bud cells via Na<sup>+</sup> channels and that this enhanced depolarization was required for Kcnk5b-enhanced growth. Lastly, Kcnk5b-induced <i>shha</i> transcription and bud growth required IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and CaMKK activity. Thus, we provide a mechanism for how retinoic acid via <i>rcan2</i> can regulate K<sup>+</sup>-channel activity to scale a vertebrate appendage via intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.","author":"Xiaowen Jiang","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"15586b76ff28ee03ab8b931e5f6ca47d56e47a6b12745c6850f040662b680c0e","category":"Environment"}
