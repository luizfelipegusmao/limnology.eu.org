{"title":"Conceptual Design of an Unmanned Electrical Amphibious Vehicle for Ocean and Land Surveillance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0145/v1","date":1712047519000,"content":"Unmanned vehicles (UVs) have become increasingly important in various scenarios of civil and military operations. The present work aims at the conceptual design of a modular Amphibious Unmanned Ground Vehicle (A-UGV), that can be easily adapted for different types of land and/or water missions, with low monetary cost (&amp;lt;5k€, without sensors). Basing the design on the needs highlighted in the 2021 review of the Strategic Directive of the Portuguese Navy, the necessary specifications and requirements are established for two mission scenarios. Then a market research analysis focused on vehicles currently available, and their technological advances, is conducted to identify existing UVs solutions and respective characteristics/capabilities of interest to the current work. To study and define the geometry of the hull and the configuration of the A-UGV itself, preliminary computational structural and fluid analyses are carried out to ensure it complies with the specifications initially established. As a result, one obtains a fully electric vehicle, with approximate dimensions of 1050×670×450mm (length-width-height), enabled with 6×6 traction capable of reaching 20km/h in land, possesses amphibious capabilities of independent propulsion in water up to 8kts, and with an estimated autonomy of over 60 minutes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"527cbfc29b22122c1ed6f00b018382b850daa0f218761ded59a94c3b112fa8fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
