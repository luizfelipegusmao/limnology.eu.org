As such, FA has been proposed, and extensively used, as a trait indicating stress for many organisms with bilateral structures and many types of stress. However, while this concept may apply to animals, the evidence for plants' main vegetative structures, that is, leaves, remains equivocal, and a comprehensive synthesis on this topic is still missing.\n\nWe designed observational field and controlled greenhouse studies, combining different growth and leaf forms across multiple stress gradients, comprising 21 species and 80 populations. We measured FA as the difference between the left and right area of the leaf, an approach that accommodates diverse leaf forms. We used high-precision, blind, single-person measurements and tested for other forms of symmetry and the effect of leaf size. We further complemented our study with a systematic literature review of FA in plant leaves, compiling 51 studies comprising 72 species, 23 stress types and 131 unique entries (species × stress type).\n\nWe consistently found no effect of stress on leaf FA in any of the studied species in both our field and experimental gradients. In the systematic literature review, only 39% of the unique entries showed the expected increase in FA with stress, 53% showed no effect, 9% showed an opposite trend of a decrease in FA with stress and 1% showed a unimodal relationship. Importantly, only 40% of all entries fulfilled the crucial step of controlling for a high-precision measurement, and of these 49% reported the expected increase in FA with stress.\n\nBoth the results of our observational and experimental approaches and the systematic literature review failed to support a clear relationship between stress and FA in plant leaves. These results clearly show that FA in plant leaves cannot be used as a reliable trait indicating stress during development.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/04/10/leaf-fluctuating-asymmetry-is-not-a-reliable-indicator-of-stress/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Maria Májeková, \nBettina Springer, \nViktoria Ferenc, \nMichal Gruntman, \nKatja Tielbörger","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"702e23191c4eb6c9ba5695f7360eddbd95cb8c798e873f9e70447f5ac62effb1","category":"Environment"}
