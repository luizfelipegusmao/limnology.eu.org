{"title":"Malnutrition in Nepal: A Comprehensive Analysis of Micronutrient Deficiencies, Health Impacts, and Intervention Strategies\"","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0417/v1","date":1728280279000,"content":"Malnutrition, particularly micronutrient deficiencies, remains a significant public health challenge in Nepal, affecting vulnerable populations such as children under five, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. This thesis examines the complex landscape of malnutrition in Nepal, focusing on the causes, health impacts, and socio-economic consequences of nutrient deficiencies. The research highlights the severe effects of malnutrition, including stunting, anemia, and developmental delays, which contribute to broader social and economic disparities. A detailed analysis of the most affected populations and regions, based on national surveys and studies, underscores the critical need for targeted interventions. This study also evaluates existing nutrition programs in Nepal, assessing their effectiveness and identifying gaps in coverage, particularly in remote and rural areas. The findings emphasize the importance of a multi-sectoral approach that integrates nutrition-specific interventions with broader efforts to improve food security, healthcare access, and economic opportunities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c322901c0361130116265a436f639eef34579cbd3928a4420f3339256d460fa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
