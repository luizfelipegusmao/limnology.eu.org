Accurate characterization of solder ball composition is important because the chemical composition can impact critical properties such as mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Since solder balls are used to fit within limited spaces in microelectronic devices, a non-destructive microanalytical technique such as Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) is preferred, as it can offer spatially resolved elemental analysis of materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.077-B1\">1-3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c644870cab1a99e697fa2b33f144ff0204507a243496b951f86762916caedb83","category":"Environment"}
