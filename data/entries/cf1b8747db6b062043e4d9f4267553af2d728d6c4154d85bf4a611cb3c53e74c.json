{"title":"A Review on Biobutanol: Eco-Friendly Fuel of the Future, History, Current Advances, and Trends","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2094/v1","date":1727346019000,"content":"Biobutanol is becoming more relevant as a promising alternative biofuel, primarily due to its advantageous characteristics. These include a higher energy content and density compared to traditional biofuels, as well as its ability to mix effectively with gasoline, further enhancing its viability as a potential replacement. A viable strategy for attaining carbon neutrality, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and utilizing sustainable and renewable resources is the use of biomass to produce biobutanol. Lignocellulosic materials have gained widespread recognition as highly suitable feedstocks for the synthesis of butanol, together with various value-added byproducts. The successful generation of biobutanol hinges on three crucial factors: effective feedstock pretreatment, the choice of fermentation techniques, and the subsequent enhancement of the produced butanol. While biobutanol holds promise as an alternative biofuel, it is important to acknowledge certain drawbacks associated with its production and utilization. One significant limitation is the relatively high cost of production compared to other biofuels, additionally, the current reliance on lignocellulosic feedstocks necessitates significant advancements in pretreatment and bioconversion technologies to enhance overall process efficiency. Furthermore, the limited availability of biobutanol-compatible infrastructure, such as distribution and storage systems, poses a barrier to its widespread adoption. Addressing these drawbacks is crucial for maximizing the potential benefits of biobutanol as a sustainable fuel source. This document presents an extensive review encompassing the historical development of biobutanol production and explores emerging trends in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf1b8747db6b062043e4d9f4267553af2d728d6c4154d85bf4a611cb3c53e74c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
