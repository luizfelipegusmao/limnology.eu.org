This intricate harmonization of plant developmental processes and adaptability hinges on significant alterations within their epigenetic landscapes. In this review, we first delve into recent strides made in comprehending underpinning the dynamics of histones, driven by both internal and external cues. We encapsulate the prevailing working models through which <span>cis</span>/<span>trans</span> elements navigate the acquisition and removal of histone modifications, as well as the substitution of histone variants. As we look ahead, we anticipate that delving deeper into the dynamics of epigenetic regulation at the level of individual cells or specific cell types will significantly enrich our comprehension of how plant development unfolds under the influence of internal and external cues. Such exploration holds the potential to provide unprecedented resolution in understanding the orchestration of plant growth and development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"57f3c0312cec79a82e6cfd6ea6ba8eb18fe1afe5df21f8ab2a6d587e6c4bdd37","category":"Environment"}
