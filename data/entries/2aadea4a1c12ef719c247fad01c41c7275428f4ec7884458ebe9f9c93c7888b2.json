Shows including <em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1512839/ted-lasso-season-3-premiere-date-episodes-final.html\">Ted Lasso</a></em> and <em>For All Mankind</em>, as well as movies like <em>Greyhound</em>, staring Tom Hanks. You can even watch a couple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/630083/how-to-watch-major-league-baseball-games-apple-tv.html\" target=\"_blank\">MLB games every Friday night</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple TV+ costs $6.99/£6.99 (until October 2022 it was $4.99/£4.99 a month). This is still less than other streaming services, but it also offers less content than many other streaming services, lacking the huge back-catalogues of films and TV shows on offer from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO, or Disney+.

Wondering how you can get Apple TV+ for free? We’ll run through your options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers a free seven-day trial in some countries, including the U.S. but that free trial has ceased in the U.K. does that mean that Apple will stop the free trial? Read on to find out how to watch Apple TV for free.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such option is the various companies are bundling a free Apple TV+ subscription with their services. For example, there is the option to get a free year subscription to Apple TV+ with T-Mobile (if you live in the US), you can also get six months <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/apple-tv-playstation-offers/&amp;xcust=1-1-673723-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">free Apple TV+ with a PlayStation 5</a> or three months with PlayStation 4. Find out more about these deals below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch episodes on Apple TV+ for free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of ways in which you can watch shows on Apple TV+ for free. Apple offers limited-time trials (discussed below), and the service also allows you to watch the first episode of many shows for free. In fact there are several dozen episodes available to watch for free including the first episodes of <em>Ted Lasso</em>, <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>See</em>, <em>Trying</em>, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675793/what-is-free-on-apple-tv.html\" target=\"_blank\">What is free on Apple TV+?</a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3777103/free_apple_tv_shows.jpg\" alt=\"Free Apple TV Shows\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers various trials so that you can try out Apple TV+ before you subscribe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, none of these offers are available if you or your Family have previously accepted an Apple TV+ 1 year free offer from when the service first launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the trial period is up the $6.99/£6.99/month subscription will start immediately – but you can cancel this. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231231/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-ios.html\">How to cancel an Apple subscription</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get 7 days of Apple TV+ free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to watch a show, and have plenty of time in the immediate future, you could activate your free seven-day trial and binge-watch it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: 7-day free trials are no longer available in the U.K. and South Africa, but should be available in all other regions.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to Apple TV+ on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://tv.apple.com&amp;xcust=1-1-673723-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s website here</a>, or via the Apple TV app on your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7-day trial will automatically auto-renew into a monthly subscription though, so you will need to be prepared to cancel within the week if you don’t want to be out of pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7-day trial might sound attractive if you think you can watch a whole series in a week. But make sure the series is complete, as Apple typically adds new episodes on a weekly basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to cancel a subscription go to <em>Settings</em> and click on the <em>Apple ID</em> section on your iPhone. Tap on <em>Subscriptions</em>. Locate Apple TV+ in the <em>Active</em> list and then <em>Cancel Subscription</em>. More details on how to cancel your subscription below. Note that you won’t find Apple TV+ in the Active list until the trial ends.

That trial will also include free one month trials for Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and iCloud+. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the month’s trial the subscription starts at $16.95/£16.95 a month as an individual, but there are different plans available and crucially you can cancel at any time.

Apple Watch, HomePod, AirPods, and other Apple devices do not qualify. In short, your device qualifies if it’s a new Apple device that can actually run the TV app and watch Apple TV+ content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the three months is up the $6.99/£6.99/month subscription will start immediately. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is necessary to claim the deal within 90 days of setting up your new device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Apple TV+ free with an Apple Music student subscription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to get Apple TV+ for free is to sign up for a student subscription to Apple Music. If you qualify as a student in Higher Education you will be able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\" target=\"_blank\">get Apple Music for half price,</a> and as an added benefit Apple is bundling free Apple TV+ subscriptions with student subscriptions to Apple Music. You qualify for free Apple TV+ for as long as you subscribe as a student. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A student subscription to Apple Music costs $5.99/£5.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928&amp;xcust=1-1-673723-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">this Apple page</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-673723-7-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple TV+ free with a Student Apple Music subscription</a></p>\n\n\n<h2>Get 12 months Apple TV+ for the price of 10 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to save money is to pay Apple for the year up-front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sign up for the service rather than choosing to pay monthly (which has the benefit of being able to cancel at any time) opt to pay yearly. That will cost you $69.99/£69.99 up-front, which works out at $5.83/£5.83 a month, rather than the standard $6.99/£6.99 a month. Or $6.99/£6.99 a month for 10 months instead of 12. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only Apple that offers free Apple TV+ trials. Some third parties offer even longer deals than Apple does. You’ll find U.S. and U.K deals below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember that at the end of the trial you may need to cancel with Apple if you don’t want the subscription to start. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>U.S. deals </em></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Apple TV+ for free with T-Mobile and Spirit </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>T-Mobile offers Apple TV+ free to Magenta MAX smartphone customers, which is normally $185 a month for three phone lines (but is currently $140 a month).

If you want to cancel the subscription you can do so.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You have 90 days from buying a new device to start the free year’s subscription, so as long as you purchased your new Apple product recently then you should be ok to activate your trial. Also, if you stop the free trial before it ends you can’t restart it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you are thinking of buying a new Apple device later? Will you be able to switch from a subscription to the free trial? We think that the way to do this would be to cancel your subscription before signing up again via the three-month trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to share an Apple TV+ subscription with your family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also share a subscription to TV+ with six family members—yourself and five others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this you all need to be part of the same Family Sharing group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By linking your Apple accounts together under the Family Sharing group you will all be able to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Share music purchased from the iTunes Store</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share access to Apple Music (as long as you have a family Apple Music subscription)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share apps bought from the App Store (in app purchases can’t be shared though)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share Apple Books</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access games on Apple’s Arcade gaming platform (with a subscription)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share a News+ subscription</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share an iCloud storage plan</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of your family members will need to be the family organizer, who basically chooses who joins the group, and has to put up their bank details to pay for any purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s supposed to be family members in the same household. While you could set this up with other ‘family’ members we think the frustration of having all the payments for everything going through the ‘organiser’s’ bank account could make this a hard sell. However, if does at least mean that you and your partner don’t both have to subscribe to the service in order to watch shows on both of your iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to cancel an Apple TV+ subscription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s a few ways to get Apple TV+ for free, at least for a short time, or by sharing a subscription with a family member.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we think the best way to get access to Apple TV+ is to subscribe as usual but just cancel at any time. You could watch everything you want this month and then stop subscribing next month and it would only cost you £6.99/$6.99. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://tv.apple.com/?ign-itscg=80122&amp;ign-itsct=atvp_tvplussupport_gen_gen&amp;xcust=1-1-673723-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Apple TV+ here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To cancel your Apple TV+ subscription follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app on your iPhone or iPad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on the Apple ID section at the top with your name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on <em>Subscriptions</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now tap on any subscription you wish to cancel (in this case Apple TV+).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the next page tap on <em>Cancel Subscription</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\nApple TV, Streaming Media</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2aadea4a1c12ef719c247fad01c41c7275428f4ec7884458ebe9f9c93c7888b2","category":"Apple"}
