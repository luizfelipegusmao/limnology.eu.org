Thanks to the fact that at the critical point both, liquid and gaseous states can coexist, their densities are equal and the surface tension between them is zero, we can transfer molecules from the liquid state to the gaseous state without penalty of changing the appearance of the sample. Its structure will remain intact and thanks to that we can observe samples in Electron Microscopy in the way they appear in their natural state.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2227c52f0fb6599df1f3cbe47112f8e04353b69fd4b7b073bf713d4be5e5b51e","category":"Environment"}
