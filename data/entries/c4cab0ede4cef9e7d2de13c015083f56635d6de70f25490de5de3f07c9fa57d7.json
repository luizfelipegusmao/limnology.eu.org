{"title":"Ticks as Vectors of Trypanosomatidae with Medical or Veterinary Interest: Insights and Implications from a Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1630/v1","date":1721393714000,"content":"Since the 20th century, numerous studies have detected or isolated parasites from the Trypanosomatidae family in various tick species. However, the status of ticks as vectors of medically or veterinary important Trypanosoma and Leishmania remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to pro-vide new insights into the potential vector status of Leishmania and Trypanosoma, which have medical and veterinary significance. We searched three databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) from 1912 to June 30, 2023, resulting in 94 and 86 papers included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. All identified field studies were conducted in endemic areas and investigated the presence of Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasite, DNA, or antigen in ticks. We recorded a pooled prevalence of Trypa-nosomatidae detection in ticks at 15.48% [7.99-24.61%], with significant variations depending on the year, detection method, and geographical area. Most of positive tick species belonged to the genera Amblyomma, Hyalomma, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus. Experimental laboratory work on transmission routes proved potential vector competence in both the Argasidae and Ixodidae tick families. Although our systematic review and meta-analysis provide unambiguous evidence of the natural infection of ticks by Trypanosomatidae para-sites with some evidence of non-traditional transmission routes, it does not provide conclusive evidence on the role of ticks as biological or mechanical vectors for veterinary and medically interest protozoan Trypa-nosomatidae species. All these unambiguously demonstrates the need of additional investigations to address this point.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4cab0ede4cef9e7d2de13c015083f56635d6de70f25490de5de3f07c9fa57d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
