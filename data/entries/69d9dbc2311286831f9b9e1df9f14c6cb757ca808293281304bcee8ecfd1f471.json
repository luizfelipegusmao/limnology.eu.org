{"title":"Analysis of the Laboratory and In-Competition Characteristics of Adolescent Motocross (Mx) Riders (an In Situ Case Study)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1441/v1","date":1724143333000,"content":"Many amateur and professional players start racing at an early age. The aim is to explore the characteristics of heart rate and speed patterns recorded during competition. We investigated the body composition and cardiorespiratory characteristics of three elite adolescent athletes, their heart rate, and speed patterns in the laboratory and competition. There is no difference between the three riders' anthropometric and body composition values, except for training age (TA), where rider (b) started riding three years ago. The intra-race heart rate patterns of the three riders showed similarities in several places and differences in several places. This was also true for the speed patterns. The differences between races were more pronounced in the heart rate pattern.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69d9dbc2311286831f9b9e1df9f14c6cb757ca808293281304bcee8ecfd1f471","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
