{"title":"Characterization and applications of iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized from <i>Phyllanthus emblica</i> fruit extract","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310728","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Easha Fatima, Iqra Arooj, Hamna Shahid, Abida Aziz</p>\r\n\r\nNanotechnology is a treasure trove of diversified themes which are endowed with broad applications. Herein, iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) nanoparticles were synthesized using <i>Phyllanthus emblica</i> aqueous fruit extract. The UV-Visible spectrum exhibited a surface plasmon resonance peak at 295nm. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy provided insight into the functional groups responsible for capping. X-ray diffraction analysis authenticated the crystalline nature of nanoparticles, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy divulged that iron and oxygen comprised 54% of the nanoparticles’ weight. Scanning electron microscopy established irregular morphology and agglomeration of nanoparticles. The Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles validated potent antimicrobial activity against 11 bacterial and 1 fungal isolates. The biggest zone of inhibition (23mm) was measured against <i>S</i>. <i>enterica</i>, whereas the smallest zone of inhibition (12mm) was documented against <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. The values for minimum inhibitory concentration ranged between 10 and 15μg/ml for all microbes. Nevertheless, no synergy was exhibited by the nanoparticles with any of the selected antibiotics (Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index &gt; 1). The photocatalytic dye degradation capability of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles was assessed and the observations implied a significant increase in degradation of methyl red although, not of methylene blue. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were in possession of substantial antioxidant (34–38%) and anti-inflammatory (31–38%) capacities. Consequent upon the robust activities of <i>P</i>. <i>emblica</i>-mediated nanoparticles, these can be scrutinized for biomedical and environmental implementations in future.","author":"Easha Fatima","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4862542291d43edb10a0286f3976a695dda1834d25a7713be4363a26cba00339","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
