{"title":"Assessing the Impact of Climate Changes, Building Characteristics and HVAC Control on Energy Requirements Under a Mediterranean Climate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1267/v1","date":1713513246000,"content":"Buildings’ thermal energy needs are inherently linked to climate conditions. Consequently, it is crucial to evaluate how climate changes affect these energy demands. Despite extensive analysis, a comprehensive assessment involving a diverse range of building types has not been consistently conducted. The primary objective of this research is to perform a coherent evaluation of the influence of climate changes, construction element properties, and the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system type of control on the energy requirements of six buildings (residential, services, and commercial).\nThe buildings are considered located in a temperate Mediterranean climate. Our focus is on the year 2070, considering three distinct climatic scenarios: (i) maintaining the current climate without further changes, (ii) moderate climate changes, and (iii) extreme climate changes. The buildings are distributed across three different locations, each characterized by unique climatic conditions. Buildings’ envelope features a traditional External Thermal Insulation Composite System (ETICS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) serves as thermal insulation material. Two critical design factors are explored: EPS thickness ranging from 0 (no insulation) to 12 cm; and horizontal external fixed shading elements varying lengths from 0 (absence) to 150 cm.  Six alternative setpoint ranges are assessed for the HVAC system control: three based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and three based on indoor air temperature (Tair).\nResults were obtained with a validated in-home software tool. They show that, even under extreme climate conditions, the application of thermal insulation remains energetically favorable, however its relative importance diminishes as climate severity increases. Then, proper insulation design remains important for energy efficiency. The use of external shading elements for glazing (e.g., overhangs, louvers) proves beneficial in specific cases. As climate changes intensify, the significance of shading elements grows. Thus, strategic placement and design are necessary for good results. The HVAC system’s energy consumption depends on the level of thermal comfort requirements, on the climate characteristics and on the building’s type of use. As climate change severity intensifies, energy demands for cooling increase, while energy needs for heating decrease. However, it’s essential to recognize that the impact of climate changes on HVAC system energy consumption significantly depends on the type of building.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45dd11492acc96a0841c321123b157b703507a2400f941b376af315db310cdcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
