{"title":"Imprecision in Yield Estimates Using Timber Volume in Forest Management Plans in the Amazon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1564/v2","date":1728533769000,"content":"The evaluation of logging in a forest management area using only the volume variable is not sufficient to assess the effectiveness of the harvest. The objective was to evaluate harvested volume using different logging variables to point out possible divergences between what was planned and what was actually carried out, in order to indicate adjustments to next annual operating plans (AOPs). The database comes from a community forest management area in the Tapaj√≥s National Forest, considering three sources: forest inventory, AOP planning and the post-exploration report. The yield considering the number of trees felled and the effective volume were compared with the AOP planning. The volume estimated by the generic equation was compared with the cubed volume and the commercial height variable was evaluated. Of the 6,267 trees selected, 5,090 trees were harvested (3.2 trees ha-1), indicating a yield of 85% of the estimated volume. Of the 25 commercial species logged, the most representative were: Manilkara huberi, Vochysia maxima, Lecythis lurida, Couratari guianensis and Hymenaea courbaril. It can be concluded that the number of trees, cubed volume and commercial height are post-exploration yield response variables and not just volume, as is currently used in Sustainable Forest Management Plans (SFMPs).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94c175980196b30ed1f7b9763bd8cb0a7f31732d7d695c081b985a09b1ee8a56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
