{"title":"Cross-cultural adaptation and reliability of the European Portuguese version of the Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire: A methodological study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308623","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Hermínia Ribeiro, Eduardo Brazete Cruz, Ana Castro, Ana Rodrigues, Bruno Heleno, Teresa L. Dias, Diogo Pires</p>\r\nPurpose <p>To culturally adapt the Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) to European Portuguese and evaluate its reliability in individuals with musculoskeletal conditions.</p> Materials and methods <p>The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the MSK-HQ was translated and culturally adapted. In the second phase, a longitudinal observational study was carried out with a convenience sample of participants with musculoskeletal conditions. Data collection began at the start of physiotherapy treatments by filling in the MSK-HQ and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). After 4–7 days, the participants were asked to fill out the MSK-HQ once again, as well as the Patient Global Improvement Change (PGIC) scale. The data collected was used to study internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and measurement error. Floor and ceiling effects were also analysed.</p> Results <p>The MSK-HQ was successfully translated and adapted into European Portuguese. The second phase of the study had a sample of 191 participants. This study demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.885) and excellent test-retest reliability (ICC<sub>(2,1)</sub> = 0.908). The analysis of measurement error resulted in an SEM of 2.818 and an SDC at 7.811. No floor or ceiling effect was observed.</p> Conclusions <p>The MSK-HQ-PT is a reliable instrument for measuring musculoskeletal health. Further studies on its validity and responsiveness are needed.</p>","author":"Hermínia Ribeiro","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f6e31ad8ceff151e207dc99c5f3a260c143bdcaa3e86d226daa9e31e051a00b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
