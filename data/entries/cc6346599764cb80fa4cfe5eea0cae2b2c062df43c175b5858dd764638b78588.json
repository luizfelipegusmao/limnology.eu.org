{"title":"Fishes of the Alitash National Park: Taxonomic Accounts with Identification Keys of Fish in Floodplain Rivers of Abbay and Tekeze Basins, Ethiopia","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/8886730?af=R","date":1709193600000,"content":"<p>Ethiopia has considerable freshwater potential. Currently, the recognized fish diversity in the country’s freshwater ecosystem is more than 200. Despite the presence of such high fish diversity with considerable economic returns, ichthyofaunal studies on Ethiopian rivers are scarce. Thus, this study aimed to identify and compare ichthyofaunal diversity and distribution in floodplain rivers of the Abbay and Tekeze Basins, Ethiopia. Fish were collected using gillnets, cast nets, hooks, electrofishing, and mosquito nets and identified to the species level. Gillnets had stretched mesh sizes of 4–14 cm with a panel length of 25–75 m and a width of 1.5–2 m per mesh size. They were set in the afternoon (5:00 p.m.) and lifted the following morning (7:30 a.m.). Immediately after capture, fish were preliminary identified in the field and tagged with proper information (e.g., sampling locality and date of collection). Similar fishing efforts were applied at all sampling sites for two dry and two wet months over a period of two years (2018-2019). In the present study, both alpha and beta diversity indices were also examined. Identification keys and an annotated checklist of species were generated for easy naming of the entire fish species in the basins. In the ichthyological collection, 43 fish species with 11 new records from the Ayima, Gelegu, and Shinfa Rivers were identified. The first two rivers in the Abbay Basin were the richest in species and number of individuals. Gelegu River had the highest abundance as well. Generally, this study was conducted in areas where no fish biodiversity studies have been undertaken, and the results obtained from this study could be important for fish biodiversity conservation.</p>","author":"Alamrew Eyayu, \nAbebe Getahun, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"cc6346599764cb80fa4cfe5eea0cae2b2c062df43c175b5858dd764638b78588","category":"Environment"}
