{"title":"High-Resolution Focused-Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy Reveals Differentially Organized F-actin Compartments in Cochlear Hair Cell Stereocilia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.479/7720080?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Inner ear auditory hair cells have projections on their apical surface known as stereocilia, which transduce sound vibrations into electrical signals. The stereocilia form a highly organized staircase, or “hair bundle”, that must be maintained over a lifetime of sound exposure. When the hair cells become damaged and die, they cannot regenerate. Decades ago, it was discovered that the stereocilium core consists of a semicrystalline array of unidirectional actin filaments [<a href=\"#ozae044.479-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.479-B2\">2</a>]. However, in mature mammalian hair cells, filamentous actin in the stereocilia core is extremely stable; there is only a short region at the stereocilia tips (∼500nm) where dynamic actin turnover occurs [<a href=\"#ozae044.479-B3\">3-5</a>]. Therefore, ultrastructural organization of F-actin at the tips of stereocilia is likely to be different from the paracrystal actin core in the stereocilia shafts. However, these hypothesized differences in F-actin organization have never been observed experimentally.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1c6d968d0dfc4a58e0d3a562b0a655e357da638d8c0e7f6b0191a367b5022bee","category":"Environment"}
