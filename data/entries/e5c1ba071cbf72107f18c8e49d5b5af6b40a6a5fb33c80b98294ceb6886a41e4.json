{"title":"Hydrogel membrane composite reduces fouling and retains ammonium efficiently","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-024-01713-7","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The recovery of pure water and valuable substances from wastewater is a major challenge in the context of the circular economy, requiring advanced separation methods. However, actual membrane separation techniques such as forward osmosis are limited by membrane fouling and selectivity. Here, we synthesized composite membranes by crosslinking polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, using both glutaraldehyde and borax as crosslinking agents, on top of cellulose ester membranes. We tested these composite membranes on model and real wastewater. Results show that the composite membranes retain ammonium effectively, maintain surface electroneutrality, and exhibit remarkable resistance to fouling by organic and biological contaminants. This is explained by the high hydrophilicity of the membrane surface after application of a hydrogel layer.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"e5c1ba071cbf72107f18c8e49d5b5af6b40a6a5fb33c80b98294ceb6886a41e4","category":"Environment"}
