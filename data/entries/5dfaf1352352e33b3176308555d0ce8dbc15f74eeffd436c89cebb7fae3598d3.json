{"title":"ERNet: A Rapid Road Cracks Detection Method from Low-Altitude UAV Remote Sensing Image","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0217/v1","date":1712061211000,"content":"Rapid and accurate detection of road cracks is of great significance for road health monitoring, but currently this work is mainly completed through manual site surveys. Low-altitude UAV remote sensing can obtain images with centimeter or even subcentimeter ground resolution, which provides a new efficient and economical approach for rapid crack detection. Nevertheless, crack detection networks face challenges such as edge blurring and misidentification due to the heterogeneity of road cracks and the complexity of the background. To address these issues, we propose a real-time edge reconstruction crack detection network (ERNet) which adopts multi-level information aggregation to reconstruct crack edges and improve the accuracy of segmentation between the target and background. To capture global dependencies across spatial and channel levels, we propose an efficient bilateral decomposed convolutional attention module (BDAM) that combines depth separable convolution and dilated convolution to capture global dependencies across spatial and channel levels. To enhance the accuracy of crack detection, we use a coordinate-based fusion module that integrates spatial, semantic, and edge reconstruction information. In addition, we propose an automatic measurement of crack information for extracting the crack trunk and its corresponding length and width. Experimental results demonstrate that our network achieves the best balance between accuracy and inference speed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5dfaf1352352e33b3176308555d0ce8dbc15f74eeffd436c89cebb7fae3598d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
