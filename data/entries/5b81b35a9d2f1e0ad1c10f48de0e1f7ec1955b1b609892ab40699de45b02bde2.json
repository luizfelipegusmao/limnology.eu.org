They result from more extensive plastic materials breakdown due to natural processes (weathering) or human activities (such as commercial use.) Because microplastics are found in an aquatic ecosystem, it is essential to have accurate detection methods. Detecting microplastics is crucial for understanding their impact on ecosystems and human health. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines Digital Image Processing (DIP), Fractal Dimension Analysis (FDA) and Polynomial Approximation to identify microplastic robustly.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5b81b35a9d2f1e0ad1c10f48de0e1f7ec1955b1b609892ab40699de45b02bde2","category":"Environment"}
