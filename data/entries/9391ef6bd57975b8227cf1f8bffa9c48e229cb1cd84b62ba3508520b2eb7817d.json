{"title":"Enhancing Food Resilience in the Age of Geoeconomics by Applying Biomimetic Principles in Urban Agriculture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2407/v1","date":1727697250000,"content":"Biomimicry, though still emerging within the social sciences, offers promising insights for improving food security by drawing analogies from natural ecosystems and re-exploring traditional ecological knowledge. This paper argues that adopting nature-inspired strategies in urban agriculture can significantly enhance resilience against geoeconomic pressures, logistical disruptions, and disasters. As geopolitical tensions intensify, exacerbated by climate change, pandemics, and urbanization, the strategic use of food power is likely to become increasingly relevant, particularly impacting urban areas due to their high dependence on external food supplies. Urban agroecology, which inherently embodies biomimetic principles, is presented as a viable pillar for building more resilient and self-sustaining food systems. The paper explores how an urban agriculture approach grounded in biomimicry can serve as a critical mechanism for food security, especially in urbanized regions vulnerable to potential food power dynamics. Additionally, it examines current methods by which states and cities prepare for food supply challenges and highlights the untapped potential of urban food production as a strategic response to these vulnerabilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9391ef6bd57975b8227cf1f8bffa9c48e229cb1cd84b62ba3508520b2eb7817d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
