Thanks to progress in the field of electronics, a large-scale 4D STEM experiments heave become possible using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The 4D STEM denomination refers to techniqueÂ´s principle: on a specimen, the probe is scanning in a two-dimensional (2D) array while the detector records 2D diffraction pattern at each probe position. Therefore, the resulting datasets are 4D [<a href=\"#ozae044.928-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"33ba9529c1709af72ace6b7152681df5002d64ebfb0a24c501b4dd5acdd5088d","category":"Environment"}
