{"title":"Extracellular Matrix as a Target in Melanoma Therapy: From Hypothesis to Clinical Trials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1515/v1","date":1729492455000,"content":"Melanoma is a malignant, highly metastatic neoplasm showing increasing morbidity and mortality. Tumor invasion and angiogenesis are based on remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Selective inhibition of functional components of cell-ECM interaction, such as hyaluronic acid (HA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and integrins, may inhibit tumor progression and enhance the efficacy of combination treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (ICBs), chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. In this review, we have combined the results of different approaches targeting extracellular matrix elements in melanoma in preclinical and clinical studies. The identified limitations of many approaches, including side effects, low selectivity and toxicity, indicate the need for further studies to optimize therapy. Nevertheless, significant progress in expanding our understanding of tumor biology and the development of targeted therapies holds great promise for the early approaches developed several decades ago to inhibit metastasis through ECM targeting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51db481ac6d77c9775d25797a7f4f678333643307fa2ea4f6f7646141f44c028","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
