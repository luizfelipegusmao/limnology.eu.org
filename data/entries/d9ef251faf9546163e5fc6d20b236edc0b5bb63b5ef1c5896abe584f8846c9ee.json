{"title":"Routine Use of Styletubation for Oro-Tracheal Intubation in Obese Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgeries-A Case Series Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0708/v1","date":1718152243000,"content":"The aim of this case-series report article is to provide a new topical view of the styletubation (video intubating stylet technique) in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgeries. In contrast to various conventional direct laryngoscopes (DLs), videolaryngoscopes (VLs) have been applied in such obese population with potentially difficult airway populations. The safety and effectiveness of VLs have been repeatedly studied and the superiority of VLs then has been observed and is advocated as a routine use. In this article, among our vast use experiences of the styletubation (more than 54,998 patients since 2016) for routine tracheal intubation, we present such unique experience to apply such intubating technique in obese patient undergoing bariatric surgery. Consistent with the experiences applied in other patient populations, we found the styletubation technique to be swift (the time to intubate from 5 s to 24 s), smooth (first-attempt success rate: 100%), safe (no airway complications), and easy (high subjective satisfaction). The learning curve can be steep but is easily overcome if technical pitfalls are avoided. We, therefore, propose that the styletubation technique can be feasibly applied for tracheal intubation in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9ef251faf9546163e5fc6d20b236edc0b5bb63b5ef1c5896abe584f8846c9ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
