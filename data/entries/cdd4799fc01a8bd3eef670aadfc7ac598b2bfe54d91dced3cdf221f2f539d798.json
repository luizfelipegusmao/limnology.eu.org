{"title":"Comprehensive Representations of Subpixel Land Use and Cover Shares by Fusing Multiple Geospatial Datasets and Statistical Data with Machine-Learning Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0344/v1","date":1728043384000,"content":"Land use and cover change (LUCC) is a key factor influencing global environmental and socio-economic systems. Many long-term geospatial LUCC datasets have been developed at various scales during the recent decades owing to the availability of long-term satellite data, statistical data and computational techniques. However, most existing LUCC products can not accurately reflect the spatiotemporal change patterns of LUCC at regional scale in China. Based on these geospatial LUCC products, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), socioeconomic data, and statistical data, we developed multiple procedures to represent both spatial and temporal changes of the major LUC types by applying machine-learning, regular decision tree and hierarchical assignment methods using the northeastern China (NEC) as a case study. In this approach, each individual LUC type was developed in sequence under different schemes and methods. The accuracy evaluation using sampling plots indicated that our approach can accurately reflect the actual spatiotemporal patterns of LUC shares in the NEC, with an overall accuracy of 0.82, Kappa coefficient of 0.77 and regression coefficient of 0.82. Further comparisons with existing LUCC datasets and statistical data also indicated our approach and dataset can more accurately and comprehensively represent the spatiotemporal patterns of all LUC types at subpixel level. Our approach unfolded the mixed pixel issue and integrated the strengths of all LUCC products through the fusion process. The analysis based on our developed dataset indicated that forest, cropland and built-up land area increased by 17.11×104 km2, 15.19×104 km2 and 2.85×104 km2, respectively during 1980-2020, while grassland, wetland, shrubland and bareland decreased by 26.06×104 km2, 4.24×104 km2, 3.97×104 km2, and 0.92×104 km2, respectively. The temporal change patterns of all these LUC types were consistent with the provincial inventory data. Our developed approach can be widely applied in the entire China and worldwide, and our data products can provide accurate data supports for studying the LUCC consequences and making effective land use policies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdd4799fc01a8bd3eef670aadfc7ac598b2bfe54d91dced3cdf221f2f539d798","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
