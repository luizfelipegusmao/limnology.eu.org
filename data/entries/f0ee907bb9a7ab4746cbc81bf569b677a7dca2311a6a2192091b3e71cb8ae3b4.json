Thus, understanding connectivity among distinct management units is of considerable importance, particularly for harvested species, where quotas set in ignorance of connectivity may fail to meet management goals.\n\nWe constructed an individual-based model (IBM) to better understand wild turkey movements at large scales, benefiting from multiple data sources that are often available for harvested species.\n\nWe built an IBM from spring seasonal movements of wild turkey, using data from ringed, radio-, and GPS-marked turkeys captured in Maine, USA. Our IBM accommodated variation in individual turkey response to landscape connectivity metrics and identified emergent migratory connectivity dynamics among harvest management regions.\n\nWe calculated a low degree of connectivity among wildlife management districts (WMD) which, in combination with the substantial number of boundary crossings observed, indicated a more diffuse distribution of turkeys among WMDs.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: Estimates of turkeys moving between districts provided a clear delineation of where immigration was strongest, identifying which WMDs should be managed as singular population units. This approach has widespread utility for any species or system where harvest management decisions are made at finer spatial scales than the movement dynamics affecting population processes.\n</p>","author":"Matthew Gonnerman, \nStephanie A.
