However, intensified cultivation has made high-yielding rice varieties susceptible to various biotic stresses, notably sheath blight caused by <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, which inflicts significant yield losses annually. Traditional fungicides, though effective, pose environmental and health risks. To address this, nanotechnology emerges as a promising avenue, leveraging the antimicrobial properties of nanoparticles like silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). This study explored the green synthesis of AgNPs using <i>Ipomoea carnea</i> leaf extract and silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>), and also examined their efficacy against sheath blight disease in rice. The biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized through various analytical techniques such as UV-vis spectrophotometer, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Particle size analyzer, Zeta potential, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) for confirming their successful production and crystalline nature of nanoparticles. The results of UV-visible spectrophotometers revealed an absorption peak ranging from 421 to 434 nm, validated the synthesis of AgNPs in the solution. XRD, DLS, and TEM estimated AgNPs sizes were ~45 nm, 66.2nm, and 46.38 to 73.81 nm, respectively. SEM and FESEM demonstrated that the synthesized AgNPs were spherical in shape. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrated the significant inhibitory effects of AgNPs on mycelial growth of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, particularly at higher concentrations and pH levels. Further greenhouse and field experiments validated the antifungal efficacy of AgNPs against sheath blight disease in rice, exhibiting comparable effectiveness to commercial fungicides. The findings highlight the potential of AgNPs as a sustainable and effective alternative for managing rice sheath blight disease, offering a safer solution amidst environmental concerns associated with conventional fungicides.","author":"A.
