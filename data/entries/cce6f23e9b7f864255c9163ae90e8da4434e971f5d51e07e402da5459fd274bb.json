Although genotypic differences in rose rooting ability are well known, the causal factors are not well understood. The rooting of two contrasting genotypes, ‘Herzogin Friederike’ and ‘Mariatheresia’, was compared following a multiscale approach. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we non-invasively monitored the inner structure of stem cuttings during initiation and progression of AR formation for the first time. Spatially resolved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy characterized the chemical composition of the tissues involved in AR formation. The results were validated through light microscopy and complemented by immunolabelling. The outcome demonstrated similarity of both genotypes in root primordia formation, which did not result in root protrusion through the shoot cortex in the difficult-to-root genotype ‘Mariatheresia’. The biochemical composition of the contrasting genotypes highlighted main differences in cell wall-associated components. Further spectroscopic analysis of 15 contrasting rose genotypes confirmed the biochemical differences between easy- and difficult-to-root groups. Collectively, our data indicate that it is not the lack of root primordia limiting AR formation in these rose genotypes, but the firmness of the outer stem tissue and/or cell wall modifications that pose a mechanical barrier and prevent root extension and protrusion.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"cce6f23e9b7f864255c9163ae90e8da4434e971f5d51e07e402da5459fd274bb","category":"Environment"}
