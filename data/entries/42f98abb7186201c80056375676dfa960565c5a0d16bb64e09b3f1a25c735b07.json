{"title":"Experimental Study on Scouring and Deposition Characteristics of Riprap at Embankment Toe Due to Overflow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0879/v1","date":1718272304000,"content":"In this study, the effects of grain size and gradation of riprap, overtopping flow depth and downstream slope of embankment on scouring and deposition characteristics at the downstream toe of the embankment was investigated. For the experiment, three different downstream slopes (1:2, 1:3, and 1:4), three different overflow depths (1, 2, and 3 cm), and three different sizes (d50 of 16.41 mm, 8.48 mm, and 3.39 mm herein referred as No.5, 6 and 7 respectively) of riprap particles, respectively, were used in the laboratory. The experimental results demonstrated that the scour depth and deposition height increased with increasing energy head for each downstream slope condition. Among the three particle sizes, for No. 5 size particle shows the lowest scour depth and highest deposition height. For the 1:2 slope, the No. 5 particle size could resist scour 62% and 75% less than that of the No. 6 and No. 7 particles, respectively. For the 1:3 slope case, this was 31% and 46%, and for the 1:4 slope case, this was 39% and 49% less than the No. 6 and No. 7 size particles, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42f98abb7186201c80056375676dfa960565c5a0d16bb64e09b3f1a25c735b07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
