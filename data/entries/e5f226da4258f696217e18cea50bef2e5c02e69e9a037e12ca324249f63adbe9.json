{"title":"Understanding Belief - A Mindset Agency Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0909/v1","date":1726061188000,"content":"This paper explores the concept of agency behaviour within complex adaptive systems, leveraging the Mindset Agency Theory (MAT) framework. The connection between agents within an agency population reveal a remarkable capacity for adaptation. MAT can help one understand the \"why\" behind adaptability through the key dualities: affect-cognition and tangible-intangible. The affect-cognition duality acknowledges the interplay between emotions and rational thought, enabling understanding of how internal states like emotions influence behaviour and shape the social structures that agents inhabit. Similarly, the tangible-intangible duality illuminates how agencies interact with their environment, recognising that observable behaviours are just one piece of the puzzle. Are also important, and previously missing from MAT are beliefs, both core beliefs and self-efficacy beliefs. These can be formalised as traits, taking value states from within a spectrum ranging between tangible and intangible poles. This becomes relevant in the digital age, where navigating information complexities requires acknowledging the dynamics of beliefs and values. With respect to environmental influences on agency, technology is special since it acts as an amplifier with the potential to intensify both positive and negative aspects of the proposed dualities by elaborating emotional responses (affect) while simultaneously creating echo chambers that limit exposure to diverse viewpoints (cognition). By understanding how core beliefs and self-efficacy beliefs interact, strategies can develop to navigate these complexities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5f226da4258f696217e18cea50bef2e5c02e69e9a037e12ca324249f63adbe9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
