{"title":"Fabric tearing performance state perception and classification driven by multi-source data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302037","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Jianmin Huang, Qingchun Jiao, Yifan Zhang, Gaoqing Xu, Lijun Wang, Dong Yue</p>\r\n\r\nThe tear strength of textiles is a crucial characteristic of product quality. However, during the laboratory testing of this indicator, factors such as equipment operation, human intervention, and test environment can significantly influence the results. Currently, there is a lack of traceable records for the influencing factors during the testing process, and effective classification of testing activities is not achieved. Therefore, this study proposes a state-awareness and classification approach for fabric tear performance testing based on multi-source data. A systematic design is employed for fabric tear performance testing activities, which can real-time monitor electrical parameters, operational environment, and operator behavior. The data are collected, preprocessed, and a Decision Tree Support Vector Machine (DTSVM) is utilized for classifying various working states, and introducing ten-fold cross-validation to enhance the performance of the classifier, forming a comprehensive awareness of the testing activities. Experimental results demonstrate that the system effectively perceives fabric tear performance testing processes, exhibiting high accuracy in the classification of different fabric testing states, surpassing 98.73%. The widespread application of this system contributes to continuous improvement in the workflow and traceability of fabric tear performance testing processes.","author":"Jianmin Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8fd7f8e16240ba576bd7c8b7b239fced9cb96b7f9bae5325ebdc351408b23737","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
