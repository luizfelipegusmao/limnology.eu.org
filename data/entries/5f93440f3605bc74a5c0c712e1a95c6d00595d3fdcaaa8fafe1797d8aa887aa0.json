Using this technique, vitrified cells can be thinned down and cellular components can be directly visualized in their native context at near-atomic resolution. In recent years several solutions have been proposed to simplify the technique by integrating fluorescent microscopes (FLM) in the cryo-FIB [<a href=\"#ozae044.1033-B1\">1-4</a>]. However, it remains challenging to precisely and accurately target the region of interest (ROI). Here we present a high-quality integrated fluorescent microscope, called METEOR, that allows precise and accurate targeting of the ROI.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5f93440f3605bc74a5c0c712e1a95c6d00595d3fdcaaa8fafe1797d8aa887aa0","category":"Environment"}
