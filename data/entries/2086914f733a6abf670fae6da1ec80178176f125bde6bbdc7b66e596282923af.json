{"title":"Mitochondrial diversity and phylogenetic structure of Yellowcheek (Elopichthys bambusa) in the Yangtze River","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jai.14362?af=R","date":1668241696000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The immense hydrological changes in the Yangtze River basin during the last decades have had drastic effects on the Yellowcheek <i>Elopichthys bambusa</i> migration rate and its population structure. As a consequence, the declining population size of the <i>E. bambusa</i> populations raises concern in terms of sustainability of their genetic integrity and conservation management. The <i>E. bambusa</i> is described as data-deficient by IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In this research, the species demographic structure and molecular phylogeny were examined from five populations in the Yangtze River basin's center and lower parts. A total of 73 individuals were collected, sequenced and analyzed for the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) variation. Three distinct mitochondrial lineages of <i>E. bambusa</i> were revealed, with 39 different haplotypes which nucleotide divergence ranged from 0.87â€“0.98. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) suggested the existence of historically limited gene flow among the lineages. The stocks of Dongting Lake (DTL), Poyang Lake (PYL) and Donghu lake Wuhan (WHN) belong to the same lineage while, the samples collected from Danjiang Reservoir (DJR) and Taihu Lake (THL) appeared as separate lineages. The results suggest an underestimated genetic diversity of <i>Elopichthys</i> species which may refer to each of the mtDNA lineages in three different groups. Future studies should add more information on this species genetic and conservation status.</p>","author":"Khalid Abbas, \nXiaoyun Zhou, \nWeimin Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"2086914f733a6abf670fae6da1ec80178176f125bde6bbdc7b66e596282923af","category":"Environment"}
