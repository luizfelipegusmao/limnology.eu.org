An anti-tick assay was conducted on adult female <i>H</i>. <i>longicornis</i> ticks. Plant extract solutions were prepared at concentrations of 50, 25, and 10 mg/mL. Tick survival and mortality were assessed by counting the number of dead and live ticks at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h posttreatment. Out of 11 plant extracts screened, <i>Artemisia judaica</i> extract exhibited the highest potency with 100% mortality (5/5) at 48 h when applied at high and moderate concentrations (50 and 25 mg/mL). Similar results were observed at 96 h for the 10 mg/mL group compared to the untreated ticks. <i>Cleome droserifolia</i> extract demonstrated partial activity with 60% (3/5) and 20% (1/5) mortality at 96 h posttreatment at concentrations of 50 and 25 mg/mL, respectively. <i>Forsskaolea tenacissima</i> extract showed a weak effect with 100% tick mortality (5/5) only at the highest treatment concentration after 96 h. To confirm the activity of <i>A</i>. <i>judaica</i>, trial 2 was conducted. <i>A</i>. <i>judaica</i> demonstrated potency within 48 h in high dose and 72 h in moderate dose, with 100% mortality (15/15) at 96 h posttreatment compared to untreated ticks. The median lethal time 50 (LT<sub>50</sub>) values were 30.37 h for the high and 55.08 h for the moderate doses. Liquid chromatographyâ€’mass spectrometry was performed on the most potent candidate (<i>A</i>. <i>judaica</i>) to identify its phytochemical components. The results revealed the presence of 9 compounds identified through manual annotation and 74 compounds from the Global Natural Products Social library. These compounds included terpenoids, steroids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoid glycosides, flavonoids, and benzenoids. Camphor was identified as the major component via both approaches. These findings suggest the potential use of <i>A</i>. <i>judaica</i> extract in the future development of acaricidal therapeutics.","author":"Ahmed M.
