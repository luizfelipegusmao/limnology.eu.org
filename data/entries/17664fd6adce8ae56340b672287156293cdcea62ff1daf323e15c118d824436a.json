{"title":"Comprehensive Bio-Screening of Phytochemistry and Biological Capacity of Oregano (Origanum vulgare) and Salvia triloba Extracts against Oral Cariogenic and Food-Origin Pathogenic Bacteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0246/v1","date":1714978546000,"content":"This study utilized phytochemical screening to conduct qualitative analysis of plant extracts, aiming to identify various classes of secondary metabolites. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of different types of O. vulgare and S. triloba extracts was determined. To achieve the aim of the study, aqueous, ethanolic, and enzymatic extracts were prepared and screened for phytochemical capacity and antioxidant activities. Determination of the antibacterial activity included phenotypic screening of antibiotic susceptibility pattern of oral and food pathogenic bacterial strains, determination of Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration - Microdilution broth test and in vitro valuation of antibacterial efficacies - anti-biofilm properties of the studied herbal extractions. Results: Our study evaluated the phytochemical composition and the antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-biofilm properties of O. vulgare and S. triloba extracts. The analyzed samples contained bioactive compounds, such as phenolics and flavonoids, contributing to the observed strong antioxidant effect. Furthermore, they exhibited notable activity against oral biofilm formation and demonstrated significant antibacterial efficacy against dental caries microorganisms as well as food pathogens. Despite methodological variations, all extracts showed significant antioxidant capacity and promising antibacterial activity against various pathogens, including resistant strains, while also inhibiting biofilm formation. Although limited to two plant species and facing methodological constraints, the study lays a groundwork for future research, indicating the therapeutic potential of O. vulgare and S. triloba extracts. Further exploration is needed to report on underlying mechanisms and validate efficacy through clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17664fd6adce8ae56340b672287156293cdcea62ff1daf323e15c118d824436a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
