{"title":"Potential Impact of Metabolic Syndrome Control on Cardiovascular Risk in Elderly Patients with Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0709/v1","date":1715353068000,"content":"Metabolic syndrome (MS), a complex pathology with features like abnormal body fat distribution, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia, contributes to higher cardiovascular (CV) risk. A cross-sectional study including 87 individuals, assessed CV risk in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and MS in Algarve, Portugal. The 10-year CV risk was estimated using the ADVANCE risk score calculator. The reductions in CV risk were estimated by adjusting the data inputted on the online tool to achieve systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;130 or &lt;120 mmHg, and LDL-cholesterol &lt;70 mg/dL.  Beyond waist circumference, the mean number of clinical features of MS was 3.14Â±0.84, without significant sex differences. The mean CV risk was 22.5% (CI: 20.3-24.7). Sex-specific analysis showed higher risk in males (24.2%, CI: 21.3-27.0) vs. females (19.7%, CI: 16.2-23.3; p=0.028). Hypothetical risk reductions show that lowering SBP to &lt;130 mmHg could significantly lower the risk by an average of 9.2% (CI: 7.7-10.7), whereas 34.5% of the participants would be out of the diagnostic criteria for MS. When comparing each potential intervention with current risk, all interventions significantly reduce the 10-years CV risk. The study highlights the potential of blood pressure control in reducing CV risk and the importance of multifaceted risk reduction strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c2485f90fdc8b258db330db6a93ce3b3310c99eef570e3473277cddb99a9aee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
