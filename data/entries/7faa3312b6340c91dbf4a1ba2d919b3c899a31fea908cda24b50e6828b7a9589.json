Of course you are – all cyclists have an eye out for their next bike – but how do you find the right one when you can’t test them all? If only you could tell how a bike is going to ride before you sling a leg over its top tube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will it be racy and reactive or stable and stately? Will it inspire confidence on technical descents or require wrestling like a rodeo bull?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the answers to these questions lie in the numbers on the geometry charts that can be found on the websites of every bike brand. An extra millimetre of tube length here or an extra degree of angle there can affect the way a bike handles, and so it should be possible to divine the character of a bike from the figures on its chart. We just need the right guides to explain what those numbers mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we talk about when we talk about handling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/03121040/bespoked2022_sturdy3-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"bespoked2022_sturdy3\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘How a bike works is more subtly complicated than people expect because it’s a dynamic balancing system,’ says Tom Sturdy, owner of UK-based custom titanium bike builder Sturdy Cycles and former tutor at the Bicycle Academy. ‘So when we talk about bike handling, we’re trying to describe the experience the rider is going to have and how they’re going to interact with the bike.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Craig Calfee, the name behind US-based custom carbon framebuilder Calfee Design, asks, ‘What do we mean by handling? Really it’s the steering and the ability to manoeuvre. If we want to define handling strictly on steering dynamics, we can get most of it from a geometry chart; if we want to expand the definition of handling to include how it absorbs shock and how it behaves on rougher terrain, then other factors start to become more important.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aidan Duff, founder of Irish custom carbon framebuilder FiftyOne Bikes, adds, ‘Handling defines how quickly the bike corners, how nimble it is. We tend to have two categories of riders: those who are very confident – the speed demons – and those who are not so confident. But I’ve never met anybody who doesn’t like a bike that corners or descends well, and I’ve never met anyone who can’t benefit from more confidence while doing so.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\">What is a road bike?

Will it respond quickly to inputs and corner sharply even at slow speeds, or will it turn more slowly but be stable at high speeds? The former is preferable for racers and those aforementioned ‘speed demons’; the latter is perhaps better for less confident bike handlers and those doing more touring or off-road riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what numbers on a geometry chart will give away how a bike might steer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Assuming that you’ve got the right size frame, my instinct is to look at the wheelbase and the bottom bracket height first of all,’ says Sturdy. ‘The wheelbase [the distance between the points where both wheels touch the ground] controls how quickly you can change direction, so the further the wheels are apart, the larger the turning circle. Then bottom bracket height will affect how sensitive you are to that. So, if you’re really high from the ground, it could in some situations make you less stable.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"calfee_luna_pro_7_riding\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03055633/calfee_luna_pro_7_riding.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Calfee’s eye is also drawn to the lower part of the bike, but with a slightly different emphasis to Sturdy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t look at wheelbase very much,’ says Calfee, ‘because chainstay length is often dictated by tyre size, so more important for me is the front-centre.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Front-centre is the distance from the centre of the bottom bracket to the centre of the front wheel hub. ‘It’s what really influences weight distribution on the bike,’ says Calfee, ‘so I’d love it if people forgot about top tube length and looked at front-centre.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both bottom bracket height and front-centre will affect how a rider sits on a bike and where their centre of mass lies, and thus how well they can control the bike, but those numbers don’t really dictate how the bike itself steers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Trail is the biggest indicator of how a bike will ride,’ says Duff. ‘This is the distance between the centre of the front tyre’s contact patch and the point where the bike’s steering axis intersects the ground. A simple analogy is the difference between a Harley motorbike and a sports bike. The front wheel on the Harley sits way out in front of the handlebars; it makes them very stable and suited to cruising long, straight roads but they would be terrible at cornering on a track. A sports bike has the front wheel tucked in much closer to the rider, making it corner very quickly.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"fiftyone_assassin_review_01\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/02233434/fiftyone_assassin_review_01.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Trail length is determined by three factors: head tube angle, fork offset and tyre size. The shorter the trail, the more nimble the steering, and the easiest way for a manufacturer to affect trail is by adjusting the head tube angle – a steeper head tube equals shorter trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Sturdy and Calfee also accept the importance of trail in determining how a bike handles, but point out that most brands now have trail figures that sit within a fairly narrow range, such that there won’t be wild differences to how similar types of bikes are going to handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sturdy says, ‘If you look at a geometry chart you’ll see that a lot of brands converge on very similar numbers. And that’s because they can be fairly confident that it’s not going to be a Marmite handling choice; it’s going to work for most people.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calfee adds, ‘Road bikes have all settled into a very narrow band of road racing geometry. When you’re talking about a few millimetres’ variance in trail between brands, the majority of people won’t be able to tell the difference.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Duff disagrees: ‘A 2mm difference in wheelbase isn’t noticeable, but a 2mm difference in trail is like trying to sleep with a rock under your pillow; a 6mm difference is very significant.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So what numbers are you looking for?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube-970x950.jpg\" alt=\"chelsini_head_tube\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube-970x950.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube-300x294.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube-768x752.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube-750x734.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube-1140x1116.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175651/chelsini_head_tube.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I really wouldn’t want to see anything less than a 71.5° head angle,’ says Calfee. ‘That just starts to get really floppy and not very agile. I’d expect a race bike to have a trail around 54mm to 58mm. If I’m making a bike for a casual rider who wants a really stable ride, I’ll give them 60mm of trail, maybe even a little more, especially if they’re doing any loaded touring.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sturdy says, ‘A middle-of-the-road trail value for a road bike is somewhere between 58mm and 61mm – that’s pretty safe. If the wheelbase starts to be more than 15mm different to what you’re used to, then it’s going to feel very different. If the Trek you’re riding now has a wheelbase of 970mm, and the Specialized you’re about to buy is over a metre, you’re going to notice that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duff says, ‘With mainstream bikes having to suit a large variety of riders, 58mm of trail seems to be the sweet spot whereby steering isn’t sluggish but is also not too twitchy. When it comes to our custom builds, it’s not uncommon for us to build bikes with trail figures of 51-54mm for confident bike handlers who love racing and descending fast. For customers who want something comfortable and easy to ride for hours, we tend to push the trail out closer to 60mm while lengthening the chainstays to 420mm and having a wheelbase over 1,000mm.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your perfect match</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Serra da Estrela\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/big-ride-serra-da-estrela-16.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that these discussions about sizes and angles are focussed on medium-sized road bikes. The numbers would change at the extreme ends of the size range, especially as figures such as front-centre and trail can be determined by the need to avoid toe overlap or the limited availability of different fork rakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, all three experts agree that it is almost impossible to ascertain precisely how a bike will ride simply from the numbers, as there are so many variables that affect each other: rider size and weight, rider ability, stem length and bar width, saddle setback, frame construction materials, tyre choice and pressure – the list goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you find a bike you’ll love to ride by examining the geometry chart? The answer, it seems, is to think about bikes you have liked in the past and then compare their geometry figures to the bike you’re considering buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If I’m building a bike for someone, I’ll get as much bike fit data as I can to make that comparison,’ says Sturdy. ‘I get them to look back through bikes they have or haven’t liked and try to understand why a bike felt a particular way. They might remember that they got pins and needles in their hands, so we look at what that seat angle was, and maybe look to slacken it on the next one.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calfee agrees: ‘Most of our clients are experienced riders, so they already have a bike they can refer to as the bike they’ve loved the most. Referencing something you know works is the best way to find your match.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shopping for your next ride?
