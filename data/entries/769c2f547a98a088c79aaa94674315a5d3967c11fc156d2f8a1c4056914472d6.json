{"title":"New Horizons of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0586/v1","date":1710189105000,"content":"Ideas about Artificial Intelligence appeared about half a century ago, but only now is it becoming an essential element of everyday life. The data provided is getting bigger and bigger and, in this case, we need artificial intelligence that helps us with superhuman powers. The interaction with medicine is getting closer and closer, medicine being a field that continues to be perfected. Machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, computer vision are some of the mechanisms that are already applied in medicine, becoming a trend in healthcare worldwide. Artificial intelligence will be the thing that will change contemporary medicine. Developed countries such as Japan, France, Germany have already implemented artificial intelligence in their medical systems. The help is in medical diagnosis, patient monitoring, personalized therapy, and workflow optimization. Artificial intelligence will help surgeons to perfect their skills, to standardize techniques, to choose the best surgical technique. The goal is to predict complications, reduce diagnostic time, diagnose complex pathologies, guide the surgeon intraoperatively and reduce medical errors. We are at the beginning but the potential is enormous.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"769c2f547a98a088c79aaa94674315a5d3967c11fc156d2f8a1c4056914472d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
