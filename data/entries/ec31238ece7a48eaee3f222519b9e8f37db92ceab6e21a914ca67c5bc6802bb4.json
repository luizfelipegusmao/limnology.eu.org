{"title":"Fast Screening Algorithm for Satellites Based on Multi‚ÄêConstellation System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0916/v1","date":1718273292000,"content":"The number of visible navigation satellites in a multi-constellation system increases exponentially compared to a single constellation, significantly increasing the complexity of the system state equations in the data fusion algorithm of a tightly coupled navigation system. This results in an exponential increase in the computation volume for navigation and positioning, seriously affecting real-time performance. To address this, a low-cost, low-computation satellite screening algorithm is proposed. It adaptively changes the number of constellation satellites by setting different screening thresholds and adjusting the number of remaining satellites. The algorithm then sorts and differentiates the azimuth and elevation angles of the screened satellites to form a selection strategy that divides the space region multiple times, enabling fast satellite selection. This approach greatly reduces the calculation amount while ensuring positioning accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm maintains positioning differences within 5 meters compared to traditional satellite selection algorithms, and the time consumed for selecting a single epoch is greatly reduced. This indicates that the algorithm is suitable for low-cost multi-constellation satellite positioning systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec31238ece7a48eaee3f222519b9e8f37db92ceab6e21a914ca67c5bc6802bb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
