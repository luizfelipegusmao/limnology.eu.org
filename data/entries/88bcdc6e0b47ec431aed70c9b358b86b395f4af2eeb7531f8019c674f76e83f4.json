{"title":"Progress in Precision Medicine for Head and Neck Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2042/v1","date":1727276856000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of head and neck cancer (HNC) biomarkers, a prevalent but molecularly diverse malignancy. We detail the roles of key proteins and genes in tumorigenesis and progression, emphasizing their diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance. Our bioinformatic validation reveals crucial genes such as AURKA, HMGA2, MMP1, PLAU, and SERPINE1, along with microRNAs (miRNA) linked to HNC progression. OncomiRs, including hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-196a-5p, and hsa-miR-200c-3p, drive tumorigenesis, while tumour-suppressive miRNAs like hsa-miR-375 and hsa-miR-145-5p inhibit it. Notably, hsa-miR-155-3p correlates with survival outcomes in addition to genes RAI14, S1PR5, OSBPL10, and METTL6, highlighting its prognostic potential. Future directions focus on leveraging precision medicine, novel therapeutics, and AI integration to advance personalized treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes in HNC care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88bcdc6e0b47ec431aed70c9b358b86b395f4af2eeb7531f8019c674f76e83f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
