Adult People living with HIV (PLWHs) face health complications, including metabolic syndrome (MS), which heightens the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and cardiovascular problems. WHO and UNAIDS advocate for the integration of NCDs into primary healthcare, yet addressing MS remains a significant challenge in Africa. The WHO’s Global Action Plan aims to reduce chronic diseases by managing risk factors and promoting healthy lifestyles within this population. However, effectively promoting healthy lifestyles necessitates an understanding of the sociocultural contexts that influence behaviors related to MS. Therefore, this study investigates how sociocultural contexts influences on knowledge, attitudes, and practices of PLWHs in Ethiopia regarding MS prevention and associated lifestyle risks, utilizing the PEN-3 model as a sociocultural framework.</p> Methods <p>The study utilized a deductive descriptive phenomenological approach, involving 32 voluntarily selected PLWHs who sought routine care at public health institutions from December 29, 2017, to January 22, 2018. Data collection was facilitated by experienced research and task teams using standardized guidelines for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews tailored to the research context. The collected text and survey data were managed with Atlas.ti and SPSS software and analyzed through thematic content analysis. Results were reported in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist.</p> Results <p>A study of 32 HIV-positive adults found that knowledge, attitudes, and health-related behaviors were key factors in their health. Participants learned about metabolic syndrome (MS) risks through mass media, peer discussions, and family education. However, there was a lack of awareness about the impact of HIV medications on MS and limited understanding of lifestyle factors for disease prevention. Attitudes reflect complex challenges for PLWHs in perceiving MS and its management. Health-related behaviors varied, with positive practices like fruit and vegetable consumption, regular exercise, and avoidance of harmful substances. Negative practices included sedentary lifestyles, raw meat consumption, alcohol, smoking, and ’Khat’ use, which could negatively affect health outcomes. Addressing these culturally preferred behaviors is crucial for improving health among PLWHs.</p> Conclusion <p>The study revealed a notable knowledge gap regarding metabolic syndrome (MS) and its risk factors, leading to inadequate health attitudes and practices. Sociocultural factors—such as beliefs, values, family dynamics, and community support—are crucial in shaping the knowledge, attitudes and practice of PLWHs toward the prevention and management of chronic diseases like MS. The finding suggested that addressing the sociocultural factors affecting HIV-positive individuals’ knowledge and practices regarding metabolic syndrome requires a comprehensive, inclusive approach that emphasizes education, community involvement, policy reform, and a focus on reducing stigma.</p>","author":"Girma Tenkolu Bune","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"93c791c489e58db5421984d80a7011588c6739fe13fcbc548c83fde0ef3bf589","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
