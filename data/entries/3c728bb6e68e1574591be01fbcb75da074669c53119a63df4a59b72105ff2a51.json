{"title":"Combined application of hot water and hexanal‐based formulations preserves the postharvest quality of mango fruits","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13695?af=R","date":1728660030000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Mango fruits undergo numerous postharvest quality losses during storage. Hence, the present study aimed to increase the shelf life of mango fruits by applying hexanal-based enhanced freshness formulations (EFF) in combination with hot water treatment (HWT).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The findings revealed that, among all the tested applications, the combination of EFF 1.0% + HWT reduced the weight loss, decay incidence, and activity of cell wall degrading enzymes of mango fruits. Also, the combined treatment was effective in maintaining the fruit quality parameters such as soluble solid contents, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and activity of antioxidant compounds.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study concludes that the postharvest application of EEF 1.0% in combination with HWT can be used in extending the shelf life of mango cv. ‘Langra,’ fruits stored at 12° C and 85–90% relative humidity for 35 days. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Devi Darshan, \nKaran Bir Singh Gill, \nParmpal Singh Gill, \nRajbir Singh Boora, \nKashish Bajaj, \nMandeep Singh Gill, \nHarpreet Singh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3c728bb6e68e1574591be01fbcb75da074669c53119a63df4a59b72105ff2a51","category":"Environment"}
