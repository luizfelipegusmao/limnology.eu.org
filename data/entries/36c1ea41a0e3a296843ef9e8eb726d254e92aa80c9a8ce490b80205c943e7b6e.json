{"title":"Integrating Circular Supply Chains into Experiential Learning: Enhancing Learning Experiences in Higher Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1993/v1","date":1727259168000,"content":"This work aims to integrate the circular economy (CE) into learning experiences to enhance learning outcome development in Higher Education (HE). Building on existing active learning research, this work aligns CE initiatives—particularly waste reduction and elimination— with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study proposes an experiential learning framework to cultivate citizenship commitment, sustainability impact, and engineering learning outcomes through realistic problem-solving in the supply chains of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Using the ADDIE instructional design model and Kolb’s experiential learning cycle, the approach is illustrated in a case study within an undergraduate industrial engineering module. Based on student opinion surveys and achievement metrics, results indicate that the experience significantly enhanced student engagement and motivation. This research contributes to the broader dissem-ination of CE concepts in HE and supports the advancement of SDG #4 Quality Education and #12 Sustainable Consumption and Production. Future research will explore the application of this learning experience across diverse industries and assess its impact on student learning outcomes in various educational contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36c1ea41a0e3a296843ef9e8eb726d254e92aa80c9a8ce490b80205c943e7b6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
