{"title":"488 Evaluation of the newly developed value-added blended fat stimulated feed product (BFSFP): Comparison with commercial protein and energy feeds on invitro fermentation characteristics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/165/7757007?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study aimed to compare the nutritional fractions of a newly developed blended fat stimulated feed product (BFSFP) with traditional feed sources as barley grain and canola meal in terms of DM digestibility, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) using the in vitro batch culture method. Data were analyzed using “Mixed Procedure” of SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., 2004) using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The CRD model assumption test was carried out using Proc Univariate with Normal and Plot option. Multi treatment comparison was carried out using Tukey’s method. Significance was declared at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 and tendency at 0.05 &lt; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.10. In terms of NDF digestibility, the newly developed BFSFP was not significantly different from the commercial protein feed [i.e., canola meal and energy feeds (barley)]. At 6 h of incubation the NDF digestibility was 4.98% while the NDF digestibility of barley was 15.32% and canola meal was 9.70%. Similarly at 48 h of incubation NDF digestibility of BPSFP was 45.95% which was not significantly different from barley feed having digestibility 47.22% and canola meal 45.68%. Moreover, in terms of dry matter digestibility (DMD) the BFSFP was significantly different from commercial barley and canola meal. At 6 h of incubation the dry matter digestibility of BFSFP was 46.31% which was greater than canola meal (42.13%) but less than barley (55.19%) at <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05. However, at 48 h of incubation the BFSFP (73.98%) was significantly less from both canola meal (80.04) and barely (90%) at <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05. In terms of VFA, BFSF had an intermediate acetate proportion (48.89 mol/100 mol) compared with canola meal and barley feed (50.35 and 45.90 mol/100 mol), respectively <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05. Propionate was greater for barley feed (29.39 mol/100 mol) than BFSF and canola meal (25.43 and 23.19), respectively <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05. Butyrate was similar for BFSFP and barley feed (13.00 mol/100 mol) and greater than canola meal (10.97 mol/100 mol) at <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05. BFSFP showed an intermediate total VFA concentration (60.12 mMol/L) compared with barley feed (65.69 mMol/L) and canola meal (56.15 mMol/L) at <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4b7a791becccb7f28ba735a6036c4254692bc1e2dac1f0fe8058fffcf115d62b","category":"Environment"}
