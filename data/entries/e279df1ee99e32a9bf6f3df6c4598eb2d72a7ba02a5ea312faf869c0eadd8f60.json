{"title":"Orchestration of Photosynthesis-Associated Gene Expression and Galactolipid Biosynthesis during Chloroplast Differentiation in Plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/1014/7658690?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The chloroplast thylakoid membrane is composed of membrane lipids and photosynthetic protein complexes, and the orchestration of thylakoid lipid biosynthesis and photosynthesis-associated protein accumulation is considered important for thylakoid development. Galactolipids consist of ∼80% of the thylakoid lipids, and their biosynthesis is fundamental for chloroplast development. We previously reported that the suppression of galactolipid biosynthesis decreased the expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear-encoded genes (<strong>PhAPGs</strong>) and photosynthesis-associated plastid-encoded genes (<strong>PhAPGs</strong>). However, the mechanism for coordinative regulation between galactolipid biosynthesis in plastids and the expression of PhANGs and PhAPGs remains largely unknown. To elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the gene expression patterns in galactolipid-deficient <span>Arabidopsis</span> seedlings during the de-etiolation process. We found that galactolipids are crucial for inducing both the transcript accumulation of PhANGs and PhAPGs and the accumulation of plastid-encoded photosynthesis-associated proteins in developing chloroplasts. Genetic analysis indicates the contribution of the GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1)–mediated plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway to PhANG regulation in response to galactolipid levels. Previous studies suggested that the accumulation of GUN1 reflects the state of protein homeostasis in plastids and alters the PhANG expression level. Thus, we propose a model that galactolipid biosynthesis determines the protein homeostasis in plastids in the initial phase of de-etiolation and optimizes GUN1-dependent signaling to regulate the PhANG expression. This mechanism might contribute to orchestrating the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins for the biogenesis of functional chloroplasts in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"e279df1ee99e32a9bf6f3df6c4598eb2d72a7ba02a5ea312faf869c0eadd8f60","category":"Environment"}
