Manuel, Andrew Tomita</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Relapse among individuals with serious mental illnesses in resource-limited contexts, including South Africa, is a significant concern. To date, the risks for relapse among this population is well documented, but little is known about prevention strategies to reduce its occurrence in these resource-limited settings. Therefore, this qualitative study explores the risk factors and strategies for relapse prevention from the patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives.</p> Methods <p>We conducted audio-recorded face-to-face in-depth interviews to capture the lived experience of relapse of inpatient study participants with serious mental illness (N = 24) at a public specialized psychiatry hospital in South Africa and their caregivers (N = 6). We conducted an inductive thematic analysis with two pre-specified themes (risk factors for relapse and strategies for prevention), with the codes devised from the data.</p> Results <p>Six sub-themes were identified from the analysis within the two pre-specified themes(Risk factors and strategies for relapse prevention): personal-related, family-related, and health system-related risk factors and strategies for preventing relapse, respectively. To highlight some essential findings, the importance of motivation for drug adherence, family involvement, and availability of anti-psychotic drugs in public health care were noted. More importantly, this study identified important cultural complexities where traditional healers play a significant role in some cultural understanding and treatment of mental illness, affecting medication adherence.</p> Conclusion <p>This study calls for people-centered mental health care delivery in a public health system that listens to the voice of concern, including cultural challenges, and implements meaningful support that matters most to the patient and their family/caregivers.</p>","author":"Joyce Protas Mlay","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7ba7b7e676bcd8e9efa16b30d7502be1731af7e7b9f2643742c2a4917d28f8c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
