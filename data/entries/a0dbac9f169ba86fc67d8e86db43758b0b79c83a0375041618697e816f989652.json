{"title":"Transmission Electron Microscopy of Crystalline Nanorods of Molecules in Ammonium Urates","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.610/7719651?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The molecular structure of Amonium Urate crystals (NH<sub>4</sub>HU) is here investigated with transmission electron microscopy. These crystals show an extremely high sensitivity to the electron beam and thus the electron dose of the beam becomes an important parameter in the observation. There has been a need to develop a new technique to preserve the sample integrity. The results are partially given here and have been used in previous publications [<a href=\"#ozae044.610-B1\">1</a>]. This new technique allows a more complete and extensive electron microscopy characterization of the different forms and geometrical shapes of these nanorods. Different shapes of the crystalline arrangements are described here together with image analysis and including crystal defects of these organic materials. Aside from the low dose mode, an aberration corrected electron microscope allows achieving atomic resolution and a good spatial resolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a0dbac9f169ba86fc67d8e86db43758b0b79c83a0375041618697e816f989652","category":"Environment"}
