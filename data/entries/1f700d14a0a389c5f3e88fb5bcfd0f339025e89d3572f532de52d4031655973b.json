{"title":"In vivo viscoelastic properties of cetacean integument: an experimental characterization","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13153?af=R","date":1720242310000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Suction cups are commonly used to attach biologging tags to cetaceans, and interact mechanically with compliant integument, an organ primarily composed of skin and blubber. However, the impact of compliance on suction cup performance is difficult to predict because knowledge about in vivo integument mechanics is lacking. Here, an experimental approach is used to investigate the mechanical properties of common bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) integument using a custom instrument, the static suction cup (SSCup), to collect data from both trained dolphins and wild individuals (<i>n</i> = 17) during a static pose. Three loading profiles were applied at three sites to quantify nonlinear stiffness, hysteresis, and creep. The site at the dorsal fin insertion exhibited the highest stiffness, while sites posterior to the blowhole and above the pectoral fin showed greater energy dissipation during cyclic loading. Viscoelastic behavior was observed across all sites. Suction cup performance on a surrogate material with broadly similar compliance showed reduced performance compared to cups on rigid acrylic: the maximum applied force at detachment on acrylic (50 N) was twice as large as the compliant substrate (25 N). Site-dependent compliance of integument may lead to varying performance of suction cups as an attachment method for tags.</p>","author":"Dory Y. Yang, \nK.
