{"title":"Transcription of the Antisense Long Non-Coding RNA, SUPPRESSOR OF FEMINIZATION, Represses Expression of the Female-Promoting Gene FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE MYB in the Liverwort Marchantia polymorpha","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/3/338/7510582?rss=1","date":1704326400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sexual differentiation is a fundamental process in the life cycles of land plants, ensuring successful sexual reproduction and thereby contributing to species diversity and survival. In the dioicous liverwort <span>Marchantia polymorpha</span>, this process is governed by an autosomal sex-differentiation locus comprising <span>FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE MYB</span> (<span>FGMYB</span>), a female-promoting gene, and <span>SUPPRESSOR OF FEMINIZATION</span> (<span>SUF</span>), an antisense strand-encoded long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). <span>SUF</span> is specifically transcribed in male plants and suppresses the expression of <span>FGMYB</span>, leading to male differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we show that <span>SUF</span> acts through its transcription to suppress <span>FGMYB</span> expression. Transgene complementation analysis using CRISPR/Cas9<sup>D10A</sup>-based large-deletion mutants identified a genomic region sufficient for the sex differentiation switch function in the <span>FGMYB-SUF</span> locus. Inserting a transcriptional terminator sequence into the <span>SUF-</span>transcribed region resulted in the loss of <span>SUF</span> function and allowed expression of <span>FGMYB</span> in genetically male plants, leading to conversion of the sex phenotype from male to female. Partial deletions of <span>SUF</span> had no obvious impact on its function. Replacement of the <span>FGMYB</span> sequence with that of an unrelated gene did not affect the ability of <span>SUF</span> transcription to suppress sense-strand expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that the process of <span>SUF</span> transcription, rather than the resulting transcripts, is required for controlling sex differentiation in <span>M. polymorpha</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"48aae0db2a99c7b0b4285c65e38d08ee0ffe017731d6b9318b14ed54b7dfe72c","category":"Environment"}
