{"title":"Factors Influencing Consumer Adoption of On-Demand Social Media Platforms.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0969/v1","date":1726120246000,"content":"This study examines the factors influencing consumer adoption of on-demand social media platforms characterized by ephemeral content. As these platforms rapidly gain popularity, understanding adoption drivers is crucial for researchers and practitioners. The study develops and tests a comprehensive model integrating traditional technology acceptance factors with platform-specific constructs. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling on data from 180 social media users in Kerala, India, the research reveals that convenience is the strongest predictor of adoption intention, followed by perceived usefulness, interpersonal influence, and enjoyment. Surprisingly, factors like perceived ease of use, social influence, and platform-specific features such as ephemerality and visual focus did not significantly impact adoption directly. Age showed a marginal negative effect, while gender had no significant impact. The findings challenge some prevailing assumptions about on-demand social media adoption and highlight the need for refined models specific to this context. The study contributes to technology adoption literature by demonstrating the primacy of convenience in driving the adoption of these platforms. It also offers practical insights for developers and marketers, suggesting that prioritizing convenience and perceived usefulness in design and marketing may be more effective than emphasizing specific features. Future research directions are proposed to address limitations and further explore this evolving digital landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61b95dbcb7afeaf6d4bde75bbcd8957b2d015148eac5801934e98a8fcb81e2c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
