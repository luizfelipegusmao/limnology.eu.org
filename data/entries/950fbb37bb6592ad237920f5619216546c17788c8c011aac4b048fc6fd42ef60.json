{"title":"Antioxidant synergistic anti‐inflammatory effect in the MAPK/NF‐κB pathway of peptide KGEYNK (KK‐6) from giant salamander (Andrias davidianus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13689?af=R","date":1719915319000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Giant salamander protein peptide is a peptide with rich functional properties. Giant salamander protein peptide KGEYNK (KK-6) is a peptide with both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of KK-6 are still unclear. When we studied the functional mechanism of KK-6, we found that the antioxidant property of KK-6 has a synergistic and promoting effect on anti-inflammatory properties.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>KK-6 enhances cellular resistance to LPS via the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to increased levels of inflammatory factors: interleukin-1β (764.81 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>), interleukin-6 (1.06 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) and tumor necrosis factor-α (4440.45 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>). KK-6 demonstrates potent antioxidant properties by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, resulting in elevated levels of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase: 0.03 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>; superoxide dismutase: 0.589 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and a reduction in the concentration of the oxidative product malondialdehyde (967.05 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Our findings highlight the great potential of KK-6, a peptide extracted from giant salamander protein, as a remedy for intestinal inflammation. Through its dual role as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, KK-6 offers a promising avenue for alleviating inflammation-related damage and oxidative stress. This study lays the foundation for further exploration of giant salamander products and highlights their importance in health and novel food development. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jun‐qi Zhan, \nJun‐xin Wu, \nJing‐jing Fu, \nGao‐shang Li, \nFang Wu, \nYue‐wen Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"950fbb37bb6592ad237920f5619216546c17788c8c011aac4b048fc6fd42ef60","category":"Environment"}
