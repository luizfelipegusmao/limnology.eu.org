{"title":"Unveiling the Antitumor Mechanism of 7&alpha;-Acetoxy-6&beta;-Hydroxyroyleanone from Plectranthus hadiensis in Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0775/v1","date":1715581426000,"content":"Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive and prevalent glioma within the Central Nervous System. GB exhibit a dismal 5-year survival rate (~6%) due to unfavorable prognosis and lack of viable treatment options. Therefore, novel therapies with plant-derived compounds emerge as very promising. This study aims to investigate the antitumor activity of 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (Roy) in GB cell lines. Roy was isolated from Plectranthus hadiensis Schweinf. and its antitumor mechanism was assessed in a panel of five GB cell lines to mimic tumor heterogeneity. Metabolic activity was evaluated by Alamar Blue® assay, while cell death, cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated caspase-3 were evaluated by flow cytometry. mRNA levels of target genes were measured by qPCR and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting. Cell uptake and impact on mitochondrial morphology were evaluated by confocal microscopy. Roy induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and increasing activated caspase-3 levels with concentration 6-9 fold lower than those of temozolomide, the first-line treatment. Roy demonstrated a robust antitumor activity against GB cells, without affecting non tumoral cells (microglia and astrocytes), being a promising natural lead compound for the development of novel chemotherapeutic approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c767ffb7bacf2df6764adb474ba5573a3c09bb74a12d96be230cab25729c9f79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
