{"title":"lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 is downregulated in patients with ventricular fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304041","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Ricardo Pan-Lizcano, Lucía Núñez, Pablo Piñón, Guillermo Aldama, Xacobe Flores, Ramón Calviño-Santos, José Manuel Vázquez-Rodríguez, Manuel Hermida-Prieto</p>\r\n\r\nVentricular fibrillation (VF) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the main cause of deaths occurring in the acute phase of an ischemic event. Although it is known that genetics may play an important role in this pathology, the possible role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) has never been studied. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the expression of 10 lncRNAs in patients with and without VF in AMI. For this purpose, the expression of CDKN2B-AS1, KCNQ1OT1, LIPCAR, MALAT1, MIAT, NEAT1, <i>SLC16A1-AS1</i>, <i>lnc-TK2-4</i>:<i>2</i>, <i>TNFRSF14-AS1</i>, and <i>UCA1</i> were analyzed. After the analysis and Bonferroni correction, the lncRNA <i>CDKN2B-AS</i> showed a statistical significance lower expression (P values of 2.514 x 10<sup>−5</sup>). <i>In silico</i> analysis revealed that six proteins could be related to the possible effect of lncRNA <i>CDKN2B-AS1</i>: AGO3, PLD4, POU4F1, ZNF26, ZNF326 and ZNF431. These <i>in silico</i> proteins predicted to have a low cardiac expression, although there is no literature indicating a potential relationship with VF in AMI. Thus, the lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 shows a significant lower expression in patients with VF in AMI <i>vs</i> patients without VF in AMI. Literature data suggest that the role of CDKN2B1-AS is related to the miR-181a/SIRT1 pathway.","author":"Ricardo Pan-Lizcano","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ed22bb8d8f99ee1e199694a27532bc397e2efd4efde36e5c6fccb6c893d9ae62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
