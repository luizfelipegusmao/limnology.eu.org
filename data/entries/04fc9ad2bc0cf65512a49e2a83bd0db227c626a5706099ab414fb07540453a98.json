{"title":"Leadership Dynamics in Higher Education: An Integrated Model Exploring the Role of AI-Literacy, and Gender in the China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0088/v1","date":1717461309000,"content":"In an era characterized by technological disruption and unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this scholarly investigation explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in shaping Leadership Dynamics in Higher Education Institutions (LDHE) within the specific socio-cultural and regulatory environment of China. Utilizing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) as operationalized through the SMART_PLS software, this research harnessed data from a robust sample of 381 key stakeholders in China higher education. The study's empirical findings indicate a noteworthy impact of AI-informed decision-making processes on LDHE, which was further mediated by the variable of AI Literacy among leadership. Moreover, the consequences of the ongoing pandemic served as a moderating factor in this relationship. These nuanced outcomes not only contribute to the theoretical discourse surrounding educational leadership and technological integration but also provide actionable insights for policy formulation and institutional strategies in an increasingly complex educational landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04fc9ad2bc0cf65512a49e2a83bd0db227c626a5706099ab414fb07540453a98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
