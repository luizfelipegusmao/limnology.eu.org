{"title":"Bioinformatics design of a peptide vaccine containing sarcoma antigen NY-SAR-35 epitopes against breast cancer and evaluation of its immunological function in BALB/c mouse model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306117","date":1719410400000,"content":"<p>by Nour Samman, Hassan Mohabatkar, Mandana Behbahani, Mazdak Ganjlikhani Hakemi</p>\r\n\r\nThe development of a cancer vaccine has become an essential focus in the field of medical biotechnology and immunology. In our study, the NY-SAR-35 cancer/testis antigen was targeted to design a novel peptide vaccine using bioinformatics tools, and BALB/c mice were used to evaluate the vaccine’s immunological function. This evaluation involved assessing peptide-specific IgG levels in the serum via ELISA and measuring the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and granzyme B in the supernatant of cultured splenocytes. The final vaccine construct consisted of two T lymphocyte epitopes linked by the AAY linker. This construct displayed high antigenicity, non-allergenicity, non-toxicity, stability, and ability to induce IFN-γ and IL-4. It showed stable dynamics with both human MHC-I and II molecules, as well as mouse MHC-II molecules, and revealed strong Van der Waals and electrostatic energies. Emulsifying our peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant resulted in a remarkable increase in the levels of IgG. The splenocytes of mice that received the combination of peptide and adjuvant displayed a noteworthy increase in IFN-γ, IL-4, and granzyme B secretion. Additionally, their lymphocytes exhibited higher proliferation rates compared to the control group. Our data demonstrated that our vaccine could stimulate a robust immune response, making it a promising candidate for cancer prevention. However, clinical trials are necessary to assess its efficacy in humans.","author":"Nour Samman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"830be7c3af156991c1829e6287ae03c5ec2d56bae265c5743352d478b4e3874a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
