{"title":"Joint effects of warming and salinization on instream leaf litter decomposition assessed through a microcosm experiment","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05466-2","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Stream ecosystem functioning is often impaired by warming and salinization, but the joint effect of both environmental stressors on key processes such as leaf litter decomposition is virtually unknown, particularly in the tropics. We experimentally explored how increased water temperature (26, 29 and 32°C) and salinity (no salt addition, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 g l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl added) affected the rates of total, microbial and detritivore-mediated decomposition, in stream microcosms containing leaf litter of <em>Ficus insipida</em> and larvae of <em>Chironomus</em> sp. collected from tropical streams. Effects of temperature were strong and consistent with previous findings: it promoted microbial decomposition and reduced decomposition mediated by detritivores, which showed greater feeding activity at 26°C. Salinity was negatively correlated with microbial decomposition at 32°C; it also had a negative influence on detritivore-mediated decomposition, which was nevertheless non-significant due to the high detritivore mortality at higher salinities. Notably, total decomposition was reduced with the joint presence of both factors (32°C and salt addition treatments, compared to 26°C and no salt addition), indicating the existence of additive effects and highlighting the relevance of multiple-stressor contexts when assessing the consequences of global change on stream ecosystems.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"c26ff77ee9a82e2d91c8e81f950bb242662a32c71dea5f6614e9e4fda3b50865","category":"Environment"}
