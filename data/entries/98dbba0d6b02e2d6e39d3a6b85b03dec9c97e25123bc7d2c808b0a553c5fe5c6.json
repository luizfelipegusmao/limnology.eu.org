Among many putative mechanisms, laboratory and clinical findings have implicated circadian biology in the etiology of myopia. Consistent with a circadian hypothesis, we recently reported a marked variability in diurnal patterns of gene expression in two crucial tissues controlling post-natal refractive development ‐ the retina and choroid–at the onset of form-deprivation myopia in chick, a widely studied and validated model. To extend these observations, we assayed gene expression by RNA-Seq in retina and choroid during the progression of established unilateral form-deprivation myopia of chick. We assayed gene expression every 4 hours during a single day from myopic and contralateral control eyes. Retinal and choroidal gene expression in myopic vs. control eyes during myopia progression differed strikingly at discrete times during the day. Very few differentially expressed genes occurred at more than one time in either tissue during progressing myopia. Similarly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis pathways varied markedly by time during the day. Some of the differentially expressed genes in progressing myopia coincided with candidate genes for human myopia, but only partially corresponded with genes previously identified at myopia onset. Considering other laboratory findings and human genetics and epidemiology, these results further link circadian biology to the pathogenesis of myopia; but they also point to important mechanistic differences between the onset of myopia and the progression of established myopia. Future laboratory and clinical investigations should systematically incorporate circadian mechanisms in studying the etiology of myopia and in seeking more effective treatments to normalize eye growth in children.","author":"Richard A.
