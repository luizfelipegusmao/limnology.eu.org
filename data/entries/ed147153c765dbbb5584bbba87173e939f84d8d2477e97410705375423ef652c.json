{"title":"79 Evaluating the effects of increasing levels of sodium diformate on nursery pig performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/243/7664801?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Organic acids, such as formic acid, are commonly used as acidifiers in swine diets. Forms of formic acid include salts of sodium, calcium, or potassium. Previous research has shown positive results using potassium diformate in swine diets including improved nutrient digestibility, growth performance, and altered gut microbiota. Additionally, recent data has shown increasing levels of sodium diformate improved growth performance in finishing pigs; however, additional data are needed in nursery pigs. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of increasing sodium diformate in nursery diets on growth performance. Weanling barrows [n = 360; DNA 200 × 400; initial body weight (BW) = 5.9 ± 0.06 kg] were used in a 38-d study. At weaning, pigs were randomly assigned to pens with 5 pigs per pen. Each pen was randomly allocated to 1 of 6 treatments in a completely randomized design with 12 replicates per treatment. Dietary treatments were formulated to provide none, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00, or 1.20% sodium diformate (Formi NDF, ADDCON, Nordic AS, Porsgrunn, Norway) at the expense of corn. Experimental diets were fed in 3 phases: phase 1 from weaning to d 9, phase 2 from d 9 to 24, and phase 3 from d 24 to 38. Feces was collected on d 9 and 24 from 3 pigs per pen to determine fecal dry matter (DM). All data were analyzed using a linear mixed model with treatment as a fixed effect and barn as a random intercept. Contrast statements were used to evaluate the linear and quadratic dose response to increasing sodium diformate inclusion. All statistical models were fit using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). From d 0 to 24 (phase 1 and 2), gain to feed ratio (G:F) increased (linear, <span>P</span> = 0.001) as sodium diformate increased in the diet (Table). However, sodium diformate did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) average daily gain (ADG) or average daily feed intake (ADFI). From d 24 to 38 (phase 3), there was no evidence of differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) due to increasing sodium diformate for any growth response criteria. For the overall experimental period (d 0 to 38), increasing sodium diformate did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) ADG, ADFI, or G:F. Overall mortality was 0.8% and was not influenced (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) by treatment. There was no evidence for differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) in fecal DM on d 9. However, fecal DM decreased (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05; quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.097) as sodium diformate increased in the diet on d 24 with pigs fed 0.40% sodium diformate having the greatest fecal DM. In conclusion, these data suggest increasing levels of sodium diformate has the potential to improve feed efficiency in the early nursey period but did not affect performance in the late nursery.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ed147153c765dbbb5584bbba87173e939f84d8d2477e97410705375423ef652c","category":"Environment"}
