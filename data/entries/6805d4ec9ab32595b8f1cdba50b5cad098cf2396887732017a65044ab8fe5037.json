Negotiation in procurement plays a crucial role in shaping organizational strategies, supplier relationships, and operational efficiencies. In a globalized economy characterized by rapid technological advancements and market uncertainties, effective negotiation practices are essential for organizations seeking competitive advantage and sustainable growth. Through semi-structured interviews with procurement professionals, supply chain executives, and industry experts, this study examines the nuanced strategies employed in negotiation processes. Thematic analysis of the data reveals key themes including negotiation strategies (e.g., preparation, flexibility), challenges (e.g., price volatility, regulatory constraints), and outcomes (e.g., cost savings, innovation incentives). Relationship management emerges as pivotal, highlighting the importance of trust, transparency, and mutual respect in fostering collaborative supplier partnerships. The study also explores contextual factors (e.g., organizational culture, industry dynamics) and emotional dimensions (e.g., emotional intelligence, interpersonal dynamics) that influence negotiation effectiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6805d4ec9ab32595b8f1cdba50b5cad098cf2396887732017a65044ab8fe5037","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
