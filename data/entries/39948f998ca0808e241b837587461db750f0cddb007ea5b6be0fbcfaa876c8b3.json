{"title":"Abscisic acidâ€“mediated autoregulation of the MYB41-BRAHMA module enhances drought tolerance in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1608/7721070?rss=1","date":1721865600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought stress poses a substantial challenge to plant growth and agricultural productivity worldwide. Upon water depletion, plants activate an abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway, leading to stomatal closure to reduce water loss. The MYB family of transcription factors plays diverse roles in growth, development, stress responses, and biosynthesis, yet their involvement in stomatal regulation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ABA significantly upregulates the expression of <span>MYB41</span>, <span>MYB74</span>, and <span>MYB102</span>, with MYB41 serving as a key regulator that induces the expression of both <span>MYB74</span> and <span>MYB102</span>. Through luciferase assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we reveal that MYB41 engages in positive feedback regulation by binding to its own promoter, thus amplifying its transcription in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Furthermore, our investigation showed that MYB41 recruits BRAHMA (BRM), the core ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, to the <span>MYB41</span> promoter, facilitating the binding of HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 (HDA6). This recruitment triggers epigenetic modifications, resulting in reduced <span>MYB41</span> expression characterized by elevated H3K27me3 levels and concurrent decreases in H3ac, H3K27ac, and H3K14ac levels in wild-type plants compared to <span>brm</span> knockout mutant plants. Our genetic and molecular analyses show that ABA mediates autoregulation of the MYB41-BRM module, which intricately modulates stomatal movement in <span>A. thaliana</span>. This discovery sheds light on a drought response mechanism with the potential to greatly enhance agricultural productivity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"39948f998ca0808e241b837587461db750f0cddb007ea5b6be0fbcfaa876c8b3","category":"Environment"}
