{"title":"Prognostication Opportunity of Future STEM Education and 4IR for Africa: Uphill Massif","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1970/v1","date":1727247538000,"content":"The broad adoption of information and communication technology and the shift to a fully digital society are together referred to as the \"digital revolution.\" Similar to how the first industrial revolution affected western nations in the 19th century, the digital revolution has the power to drastically develop and transform Africa. The majority of African nations, if not all of them, are still searching for answers to the political, social, and educational issues that their citizens deal with. The principal objectives of the research were to ascertain the obstacles and possible patterns in African nations concerning the execution of STEM education and 4IR across the region, in addition to offering a plan and approach for doing so. In order to explore the sought papers and find answers to the research questions, the study employed the archival research study process. The results show that certain patterns that were adopted in Africa must be cooperatively adopted throughout the continent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc11437199372500af74434820cbc530eea0f8b98ec47a6269fcbb58fe079f02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
