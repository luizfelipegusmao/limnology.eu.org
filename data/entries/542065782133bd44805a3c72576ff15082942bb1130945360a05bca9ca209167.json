{"title":"Scaling Relationships among the Mass of Eggshell, Albumen, and Yolk in Six Precocial Birds","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/64/1/134/7604007?rss=1","date":1707350400000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The proportions in the size of the avian egg albumen, yolk, and shell are crucial for understanding bird survival and reproductive success because their relationships with volume and surface area can affect ecological and life history strategies. Prior studies have focused on the relationship between the albumen and the yolk, but little is known about the scaling relationship between eggshell mass and shape and the mass of the albumen and the yolk. Toward this end, 691 eggs of six precocial species were examined, and their 2-D egg profiles were photographed and digitized. The explicit Preston equation, which assumes bilateral symmetrical geometry, was used to fit the 2-D egg profiles and to calculate surface areas and volumes based on the hypothesis that eggs can be treated as solids of profile revolution. The scaling relationships of eggshell mass (<span>Ms</span>), albumen mass (<span>Ma</span>), and yolk mass (<span>My</span>), as well as the surface area (<span>S</span>), volume (<span>V</span>), and total mass (<span>Mt</span>) were determined. The explicit Preston equation was validated in describing the 2-D egg profiles. The scaling exponents of <span>Ma</span> vs. <span>Ms, My</span> vs. <span>Ms</span>, and <span>My</span> vs. <span>Ma</span> were smaller than unity, indicating that increases in <span>Ma</span> and <span>My</span> fail to keep pace with increases in <span>Ms</span>, and that increases in <span>My</span> fail to keep pace with increases in <span>Ma</span>. Therefore, increases in unit nutrient contents (i.e., the yolk) involve disproportionately larger increases in eggshell mass and disproportionately larger increases in albumen mass. The data also revealed a 2/3-power scaling relationship between <span>S</span> and <span>V</span> for each species, that is, the simple Euclidean geometry is obeyed. These findings help to inform our understanding of avian egg construction and reveal evolutionary interspecific trends in the scaling of egg shape, volume, mass, and mass allocation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"542065782133bd44805a3c72576ff15082942bb1130945360a05bca9ca209167","category":"Environment"}
