{"title":"The feasibility and clinical significance of lateral approach thyroidectomy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300604","date":1711116000000,"content":"<p>by Ran An, Yong-Xue Gu, Xi-Hao Ni, Ying Lei, Wei-Tao Wang, Xiao-Juan Men, Jing-Yi Ma, Chang-Liang Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>By comparing the three lateral approaches to thyroidectomy, the feasibility and clinical effects were analyzed, and the advantages of the lateral approach were summarized.</p> Methods <p>From January 2022 to January 2023, 52 patients with thyroid cancer admitted to our department were selected and subjected to Lateral approach for thyroidectomy. Among them, 31 patients underwent thyroidectomy via the supraclavicular approach, 13 patients underwent endoscopic thyroidectomy via the subclavicular approach, and 8 patients underwent endoscopic thyroidectomy via the axillary approach. The basic conditions, surgical conditions, complications, postoperative pain scores and postoperative satisfaction of patients in the three approach surgery groups were recorded and analyzed.</p> Results <p>There were no significant differences among the three approach groups in terms of patient characteristics, number of central lymph node dissections, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, duration of drainage tube placement, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, satisfaction, and complications. However, the operation time was longest in the subclavicular approach group, followed by the axillary approach group, and shortest in the supraclavicular approach group. The total hospitalization cost was highest in the axillary approach group, followed by the subclavicular approach group, and lowest in the supraclavicular approach group.</p> Conclusion <p>The lateral approach for thyroidectomy is deemed a safe and effective method. The three different approach paths gradually increase in length, allowing for the accumulation of anatomical experience. This approach has a shorter learning curve for clinical doctors and is a favorable choice for patients seeking aesthetic benefits.</p>","author":"Ran An","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f584e9468d074dbf38094c754d27b52e652e6c2d521dcdd0f3e93e116e51a00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
