{"title":"Serum Markers for Evaluating Beef Meat Quality: Potential Applications in Cell-Cultured Meat Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1223/v1","date":1710933837000,"content":"Cell-culture meat is a novel concept to replace traditional meat produced from animals, and to satisfy rising food demands due to the world population growth. It is still a young field and requires to solve technical issues including cell sources and types, efficient culture for large scale production, taste and texture for customer satisfaction. The current review summarized traditional beef meat production and evaluation methods for customer satisfaction. In particular, serum biomarkers for beef meat evaluation are discussed, which can be applicated for cell-culture meat production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7f0e60b399f0eab60b670f9c5d5de012f23ded0479a01eaa2358e73137a4de7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
