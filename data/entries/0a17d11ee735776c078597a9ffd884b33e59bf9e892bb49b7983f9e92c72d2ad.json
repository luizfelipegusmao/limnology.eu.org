{"title":"Genetic Predisposition to Type 1 Diabetes and Respiratory Failure in Pediatric Covid-19 Patients: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1522/v1","date":1724298983000,"content":"Abstract\nBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has severely impacted children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), placing them at high risk for severe outcomes. Despite extensive observational data suggesting a link between T1D and severe COVID-19, there is a lack of understanding regarding the causal effects. This study aims to determine whether Type 1 diabetes (T1D) influences the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, particularly respiratory failure, in pediatric ICU patients.\nMethods: This two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study utilized genetic data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic variants associated with T1D were used as instrumental variables to assess their impact on severe COVID-19 outcomes. The primary datasets included genetic data for T1D from 457,695 individuals (6,447 T1D cases) and severe COVID-19 outcomes from 3,790 individuals (1,610 severe cases). Various MR methods, including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR-Egger Regression, and Weighted Median, were employed to ensure robust causal inference and eliminate potential biases such as pleiotropy.\nResults: The MR analysis revealed no causal relationship between T1D and severe COVID-19 outcomes in pediatric patients. Odds ratios (ORs) obtained using MR-Egger, Weighted Median, and IVW methods varied from 0.7648 to 0.9853, with p-values greater than 0.05, indicating no significant causal effect. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, showing no evidence of heterogeneity or directional pleiotropy.\nConclusion: Our findings indicate no genetic causal link between T1D and severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 in children. These results contrast with numerous observational studies and suggest that metabolic dysfunction and other non-genetic factors should be the focus in managing this susceptible group. The insights gained are crucial for developing targeted interventions and improving clinical management strategies for pediatric ICU patients with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a17d11ee735776c078597a9ffd884b33e59bf9e892bb49b7983f9e92c72d2ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
