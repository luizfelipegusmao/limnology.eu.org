{"title":"Trend analysis of temperature and vegetation cover in the distribution range of Apis florea in Iran","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-024-05504-z","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Numerous studies have been performed on <em>Api</em><em>s florea</em> to examine the effect of temperature and vegetation cover on the distribution of the species, but less on the trend of changes in Dynamic Habitat Indices within the habitats. Land Surface Temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as the annual average (2003 to 2021) were analyzed by Mann-Kendall test. The differences in the geographical distribution of these variables were examined by the periodical average of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Temperature (2003–2021) using Pettitt test. The True Skill Statistics based on Ensemble species distribution was used to identify patches and the <em>Z</em> value of Mann-Kendall test to detect the changes of Dynamic Habitat Indices at the significance levels of 90, 95, and 99. The conformity of different levels of significance with the distribution range was investigated by GAP analysis, and on common patches, multi-scale fragmentation analysis was performed by the Foreground area density (FAD) method. According to the results, Pettitt test found heterogeneity in temperature and vegetation in the west–east distribution (<em>P </em>value &lt; 0.001). In the upward trend (99%), habitat patches overlapping with the significant trend of vegetation cover a larger area of distribution than habitat patches overlapping with the significant trend of temperature. Foreground area density indicates the increase in vegetation cover of the species habitat has been continuous and is different from the temperature trend. For decision making, Dynamic Habitat Indices with distribution models are proposed as practical approach to rehabilitate lost habitats.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"86912d26222cfcabd370372fe7bc443bde869a4fee017f23e95d297de5e0b0d3","category":"Environment"}
