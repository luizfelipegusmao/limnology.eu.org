{"title":"The synergy of transcriptional and epigenetic controls promotes fruit ripening in peach","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/1929/7473221?rss=1","date":1702512000000,"content":"<span>Fruit ripening is a complex process involving hormonal, transcriptional, and epigenetic regulations. During ripening in many fruits, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is converted to ethylene, which binds to ethylene receptors to activate genes such as those encoding ERF (ethylene response factor) transcription factors (TFs) (<a href=\"#kiad663-B3\">Liu et al. 2020</a>). ERF TFs then regulate the expressions of fruit ripening–related genes such as those regulating fruit softness, color, and flavor (<a href=\"#kiad663-B2\">Gao et al. 2020</a>). Early studies on fruit ripening predominantly employed tomato as the model. Later, the fruitENCODE project annotated genes and revealed the epigenomes of other climacteric fruits, including peach (<a href=\"#kiad663-B4\">Lü et al. 2018</a>). In peach, NAC TFs were suggested to regulate genes for ethylene biosynthesis (<a href=\"#kiad663-B4\">Lü et al. 2018</a>). However, the detailed role of NACs in peach fruit ripening remained largely unknown.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a05493dcc9908e0077082e90fa91400d0b6bee62420cac747a71486ea2869888","category":"Environment"}
