The intensity of electron diffraction patterns is, as a result, sensitive to the charge density of atoms and bonding inside crystals [<a href=\"#ozae044.943-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.943-B2\">2</a>]. Experimentally, the traditional method to probe this information is quantitative Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED). Quantitative CBED or QCEBD is a method which uses dynamic diffraction theory to quantify CBED intensities and to extract information about crystal structure and bonding [<a href=\"#ozae044.943-B3\">3</a>]. The sensitivity of dynamical scattering is leveraged to measure crystal symmetry and crystal structure factors. At its limit, electron structure factors are measured at high accuracy allowing access to chemical bonding information, which corroborate theoretical calculations through multipole model refinements of the experimental charge density [<a href=\"#ozae044.943-B4\">4</a>]. The primary limit to QCBED is the requirement of a non-overlapping convergent beam. This subsequently limits QCBED to crystals with small unit cells which are stable under the focused probe.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b0ddaee55b08d81589656567665622051c8755b0accbbab0de9b7449df2e2a87","category":"Environment"}
