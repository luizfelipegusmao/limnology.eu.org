{"title":"The Discharge-Induced Polarity-Dependent Propagation Characteristics of a Strong Shock Wave","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1185/v1","date":1728984493000,"content":"The specifics of a shock wave propagation down a positive column of a dc discharge in molecular chemically inert gases has been investigated. It was shown that axial gradients caused by the imbalance in the charged particle momentum transfer to the gas molecules can be a reason for the shock velocity dependence on the electric field direction. In the pure nitrogen gas, the calculated shock velocity difference up to 13.5% is in good agreement with 12% value obtained in the experiment. A returning gas flow organizing in the discharge as a possible mechanism for an extended shock structure, and a number of kinetical factors capable of affecting the shock motion are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c873e7e883d43068e29865b0c11505ec73e820170f9f3f84cfbc191ea045e4fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
