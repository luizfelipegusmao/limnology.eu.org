{"title":"Impact of Urban Parameters on Microclimate Conditions and Building Energy Consumption over Chicago Metropolitan Area during an Extreme Heatwave Event","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2459/v1","date":1722340231000,"content":"This study utilizes a regional numerical weather model incorporating multilayer urban canopy parameterization alongside a building energy model (BEP + BEM) to examine the sensitivity of various urban parameters, including those defining urban materials and building environments, during a real-case heatwave event in the Chicago Metropolitan Area (CMA) in August 2023. The application of local climate zones further refines this analysis. Findings indicate that wall conductivity and ground albedo play significant roles in affecting urban near-surface temperatures. Conversely, alterations in other urban parameters are found to exert minimal influence on near-surface temperatures throughout the heatwave. In terms of building energy consumption, the selection of the target indoor temperature emerges as a pivotal factor. While adjustments in ventilation rates also bear considerable effects, other variables appear to have a subdued impact on energy usage. Additionally, the marginal effect of wall emissivity on energy consumption highlights the intricate balance between different heat transfer mechanisms and the adaptive capacity of building heating and cooling systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eae2cd5f76ea22045379f2f535845923376efe84928ef8b74d1e3dfe1805100c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
