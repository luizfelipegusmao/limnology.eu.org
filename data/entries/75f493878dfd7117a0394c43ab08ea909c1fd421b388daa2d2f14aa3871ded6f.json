{"title":"Effect of molecular weight of chitosan on quercetin‐loaded chitosan nanoparticles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13777?af=R","date":1722664436000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The widespread use of quercetin is limited by its instability, low solubility and poor oral bioavailability. Encapsulation of quercetin using a nanoparticle delivery system is an effective way to overcome these drawbacks.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The effect of the molecular weight (<i>M</i>\n<sub>w</sub>) of chitosan (CS) (100, 200, 500 and 1000 kDa) on quercetin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (QCNPs) was investigated. The structure, stability, release properties and antioxidant activities of the nanoparticles (QCNP-10, QCNP-20, QCNP-50 and QCNP-100) were assessed. Particle size of QCNPs decreased and polydispersity index increased with the increasing <i>M</i>\n<sub>w</sub> of CS. The main forces involved in the formation of QCNPs were hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. X-ray diffraction verified that quercetin was loaded into CS nanoparticles. The photostability and thermal stability of QCNPs increased with increasing <i>M</i>\n<sub>w</sub> of CS. QCNP-100 exhibited the lowest release rate in a mixture of water and anhydrous ethanol. The antioxidant activities of QCNPs were enhanced with increasing <i>M</i>\n<sub>w</sub> of CS, and QCNP-100 possessed the highest antioxidant activities, which might be relevant to its smallest particle size.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, these results revealed that the <i>M</i>\n<sub>w</sub> of CS affected the properties of QCNPs, and QCNP-100 possessed the smallest particle, best stability, lowest release rate and highest antioxidant activities. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Feng Geng, \nMengyang Zhang, \nTao Sun, \nJing Xie, \nJianhong Gan, \nXiaohui Li, \nBin Xue","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"75f493878dfd7117a0394c43ab08ea909c1fd421b388daa2d2f14aa3871ded6f","category":"Environment"}
