{"title":"Inhibition of IRAP Enhance the Expression of Pro-cognitive Markers Drebrin and MAP2 in Rat Primary Neuronal Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2523/v1","date":1722414282000,"content":"The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP; oxytocinase) is part of the M1 aminopeptidase family and is highly expressed in many tissues, including the neocortex and hippocampus of the brain. IRAP is involved in various physiological functions and has been identified as a receptor for the endogenous hexapeptide Angiotensin IV (Ang IV). Binding of Ang IV inhibits the enzymatic activity of IRAP and has proven to enhance learning and memory in animal models. The macrocyclic compound 9 (C9) is a potent synthetic IRAP inhibitor developed from the previously reported inhibitor HA08. In this study, we have examined compound C9 and its effects on cognitive markers drebrin, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in primary hippocampal and cortical cultures. Cells from Sprague Dawley rats were cultured for 14 days before treatment with C9 for 4 consecutive days. The cells were analysed for protein expression of drebrin, MAP2, GFAP, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), and synapsin I using immunocytochemistry. The gene expression of related proteins was determined using qPCR, and viability assays were performed to evaluate toxicity. The results showed that protein expression of drebrin and MAP2 was increased, and the corresponding mRNA levels were decreased, after treatment with C9 in the hippocampal cultures. The ratio of MAP2 positive neurons and GFAP positive astrocytes was altered in both hippocampal and cortical cultures, and there were no toxic effects observed. In conclusion, IRAP inhibitor compound C9 enhance the expression of pro-cognitive markers drebrin and MAP2 which further confirms IRAP as a relevant pharmaceutical target and C9 as a promising candidate for further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1b3e881f126f6ceaadabbc7841d702ae9d65ad2724e364b90f987e692fdecbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
