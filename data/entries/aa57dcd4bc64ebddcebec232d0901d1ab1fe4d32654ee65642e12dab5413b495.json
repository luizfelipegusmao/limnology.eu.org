{"title":"Deploying Wireless Sensor Networks in Multi-Story Buildings towards IoT-Based Intelligent Environments: An Empirical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1818/v1","date":1714276635000,"content":"Abstract: With the growing integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart buildings, it is crucial to ensure the precise implementation and operation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper aims to study the implementation aspect of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in a commercial multi-story building, specifically addressing the difficulty of dealing with variable environmental conditions on each floor. This research addresses the disparity between simulated situations and actual deployments, offering valuable insights that have the potential to signifi-cantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of building management systems. We obtain real-time sensor data to analyze and evaluate the systemâ€™s performance. Our investigation is grounded in the growing importance of incorporating WSNs into buildings to create intelligent environments. By leveraging the capabilities of Contiki operating system, this study employs a specialized simulator to generate simulated data, allowing for a comparison between real-world and simulated scenarios. We provide an in-depth analysis to scrutinize the disparities and commonalities between the datasets obtained from real-world deployments and simulated en-vironments. We highlight the necessity of precise simulation to validate real-life sensor data, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing WSNs in in-telligent buildings. Results obtained show the significance of accurate simulation models for re-liable data representation, providing a roadmap for further developments in the integration of WSNs into intelligent building scenarios. The findings highlight the potential for optimizing living and working conditions based on the real-time monitoring of critical environmental pa-rameters. This includes insights into temperature, humidity, and light intensity, offering oppor-tunities for enhanced comfort and efficiency in intelligent environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa57dcd4bc64ebddcebec232d0901d1ab1fe4d32654ee65642e12dab5413b495","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
