{"title":"Firefightersâ€™ medical use and Korean Medicine experience in Korea: A qualitative study protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300532","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Jisu Ha, Inae Youn, Yuri Han, Jinwon Kim, Sunjoong Kim, Hanbit Jin, Jung Won Kang, Jungtae Leem</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Firefighters, compared to other occupational groups, are exposed more frequently in their working environment not only to physical issues, such as musculoskeletal disease, respiratory disease, and burns but also to mental health issues, such as PTSD and depression. Specifically, Korean firefighters experience significantly higher rates of work-related injuries compared to those in other countries. Recent statistics from the Korea National Fire Agency indicate a steady increase in the number of firefighting work-related injuries. However, there is a shortage of measures in place to address these issues. This study aims to investigate the health needs, overall healthcare usage, and unmet needs of firefighters in Korea. We also aim to investigate, through in-depth interviews, perceptions and hindering factors for integrative medicine approaches to fulfilling unmet needs.</p> Method <p>This study was conducted in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research. Convenience and snowball sampling methods will be used to recruit firefighters to participate in the study, and interviews will be conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. The data will be analyzed in four stages using the qualitative analysis method of Krippendorff.</p> Discussion <p>In this study, we examine the state of health issues and healthcare usage among Korean firefighters and investigate their perceptions of and needs for integrative medicine. In this way, we aim to explore how integrative medicine and Korean medicine approaches could improve and assist healthcare services for firefighters. Furthermore, our findings will provide policymakers and healthcare providers with the necessary basic information to develop integrative medicine systems suited to firefighters.</p>","author":"Jisu Ha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee6519ec7e0aa4ad53e31f145c7ec94b1ff55f7b41356b4d802cf0037d4f546a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
