Narayan, Meagan L. Hennessy, Dipti Pitta</p>\r\n\r\nRuminant livestock are major contributors to anthropogenic methane emissions in the United States and worldwide. Enteric methane is generated by methanogenic archaea residing in ruminant digestive tracts. Information on when methanogens colonize the gut and when they begin to interact with bacteria during the early phases of the ruminant life cycle is less explored. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the composition of the methanogenic archaeal community at birth and through the weaning transition and (ii) to determine if and when the methanogenic archaea begin to interact with bacteria in the lower gut of neonatal dairy calves. Ten female Holstein calves (approximately 45kg birth weight) were enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected every two weeks (Wk 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) between birth and weaning and analyzed for methanogenic archaeal diversity via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Estimates of alpha diversity (Observed species, and Shannon diversity index) and beta diversity (weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances) showed significant differences (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) between archaeal communities across timepoints. Both 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and RT-qPCR analyses revealed <i>Methanobrevibacter</i> was the most prevalent genus at Wk2, Wk4, and Wk6, whereas <i>Methanosphaera</i> gradually increased with time and was most abundant at Wk10 and Wk12. Correlation analysis revealed that <i>Methanobrevibacter</i> and <i>Methanosphaera</i> were inversely correlated with each other and formed distinct cohorts with specific bacterial lineages similar to those reported in the mature rumen, thus revealing that these associations are established during the preweaning period. Therefore, the preweaning period presents a window of opportunity to interfere with early-life methanogenic colonization with the ultimate goal of reducing enteric methane emissions without perturbing ruminal function later in the life of dairy cattle.","author":"Nagaraju Indugu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d1b561d1fe218404bb5b133620fc39c4abcda41f5204284ececc3f0742e74454","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
