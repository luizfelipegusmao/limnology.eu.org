{"title":"Bonding Effectiveness of Zirconia to Veneering Ceramic after Different Sandblasting Treatments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1640/v1","date":1716542387000,"content":"Objective: To determine the effect of sandblasting before and after sintering on the surface roughness of zirconia and the micro-tensile bond strength of a pressable veneering ceramic to zirconia.\nMethods: Pre-sintered zirconia blocks (IPS e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were divided into a control group (CTR, no surface treatment) and four test groups of three specimens each: Pre-S-30, Pre-S-50, Pre-S-110 were sandblasted with 30µm SiO2, 50µm Al2O3 and 110µm Al2O3 particles respectively, before sintering, Post-S-30 was sandblasted with 30µm SiO2 after sintering. For each treatment, the surface roughness was measured (Ra, Perthometer M4P, Mahr Perthen).  After sintering the zirconia blocks, a liner and a pressable ceramic (IPS e.max ZirPress, Ivoclar Vivadent) were fired. Sixteen micro-bars were obtained from each block and submitted to the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) test. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Any correlation between Ra and µTBS was evaluated (Sperman test).\nResults: Sandblasting before sintering with 110µm Al2O3 (Ra=3.44±0.44µm), 50µm Al2O3 (Ra=2.32±0.46µm), and 30µm SiO2 (Ra=1.22±0.22µm) resulted in significantly higher roughness than sandblasting after sintering with 30µm SiO2 (Ra=0.46±0.11µm). The highest µTBS was measured when the sintered zirconia was sandblasted with 30μm SiO2 (26.79±14.80 MPa), which was significantly different from that of specimens that were sandblasted before sintering (Pre-S-30=20.90±11.70; Pre-S-50=21.27±15.19; Pre-S-110=23.99±16.83) or were not treated (CTR=17.44±14.03).\nConclusions: Sandblasting zirconia before sintering enhances the surface roughness proportionally to the particle size of the sand used. Sandblasting with 30µm SiO2 after sintering appeared to improve bonding between the veneering ceramic and zirconia.\nClinical Significance: Sandblasting with 30µm SiO2 after sintering may improve bonding between veneering ceramics and zirconia, thus reducing ceramic fractures/chippings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06379bb5d999c2f2fa6da8ff18bb32f67b0773ab3edaaec08d314f42e2d2ce8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
