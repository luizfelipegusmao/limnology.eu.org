{"title":"Long-Term Effects of Nitrogen and Tillage on Yields and Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Irrigated Corn","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1203/v1","date":1723820904000,"content":"By tonnage, corn (Zea Mays L.) is the #1 crop produced globally, and recent research has suggested that no-till (NT) systems can lead to reduced yields of this important crop. Additionally, there is a lack of long-term data about the effects of tillage and N management on cropping systems. Corn is the most nitrogen (N)-fertilized crop in the USA, and N losses to the environment contribute to significant impacts on air and water quality. We conducted long-term studies on conventionally tilled (CT), and conservation tillage systems such as strip tillage (ST) and NT, under different N rates. We found that immediately after conversion to NT, yields from NT were significantly lower than yields from CT (P&amp;lt;0.1), but after five years of NT, the NT yields were 1.5% higher than the CT yields (P&amp;lt;0.1). Initially, the NT yields were lower than the ST (P&amp;lt;0.01), but after seven years of NT, the NT yields were comparable to ST grain yields. Although the total aboveground N uptake with NT immediately after conversion to NT was lower than with CT and ST, these differences were not significant in the long run. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) with NT increased over time. The present work highlights the importance of long-term research for determining the cumulative impacts of best management practices such as NT. We found that NT becomes a more viable practice after five or seven years of implementation, demonstrating the high importance of long-term research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d53522b2b948094123ef01244c04589c88f78fd0d7d8951511335668dfdada76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
