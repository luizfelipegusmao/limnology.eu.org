{"title":"Preliminary study of indocyanine green-guided laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection for rectal cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307077","date":1721052000000,"content":"<p>by Chu-Ying Wu, Wen-Jin Zhong, Kai Ye</p>\r\nBackground <p>LLNM can occur in mid-low rectal cancer, but LLND in patients with rectal cancer presents certain challenges. Recent years have seen the progressive application of ICG fluorescence imaging technology in colorectal surgery. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of ICG-guided laparoscopic LLND for rectal cancer.</p> Methods <p>We applied ICG-guided laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection in 11 patients diagnosed as rectal cancer with lateral lymph node metastasis.</p> Results <p>All 11 patients in this group successfully completed ICG-guided laparoscopic LLND for rectal cancer with good lateral lymph node imaging.</p> Conclusions <p>ICG-guided laparoscopic LLND for rectal cancer is safe and represents a feasible solution, thereby providing valuable guidance for intraoperative lymph node dissection.</p>","author":"Chu-Ying Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8272700b8334e756fab60ada03bad214e18669a7cb4b0997fcedf3eb54cf1105","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
