{"title":"Implementation of Low Carbon Supply Chain Management Practices (LCSCMP) in Indian Manufacturing Industries Using ISM-DEMATEL","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0298/v1","date":1715042446000,"content":"Low carbon supply chain management (LCSCM) strategies are required in the Indian manufacturing industries due to rapidly growing energy usage for financial and environmental concerns. LCSCM technologies face a number of challenges that limit their adoption. Eleven hurdles were selected from the literature as well as the recommendations of business and academic experts. These barriers are defined by a number of factors, including a lack of information, financial worries, environmental concerns, and governmental limits, among others. In addition, efforts are being made to quantify the most optimal relevant barriers using Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques such as interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and decision-making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). MICMAC analysis is used to estimate the sensitivity and priority of barriers based on dependency power and driving power. One of these barriers is a needed factor; three are driving elements; four barriers are linked factors; and three are self-sufficient factors. The findings of this study can help academic specialists, industry representatives, and practitioners in their ongoing attempts to adopt 'LCSCM techniques' in Indian manufacturing industries. The model is appropriately explained and applies the link between the barriers.The objective of this paper is the Evaluation and selection of most influential of Barriers to Adopt Low Carbon Supply Chain Management (LCSCM) in the Indian Manufacturing Sector is interrelated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c77fcf8b8f8869f1a2dd0b8c6fe5b31a43173a5d1eb3835044083fffbec1cba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
