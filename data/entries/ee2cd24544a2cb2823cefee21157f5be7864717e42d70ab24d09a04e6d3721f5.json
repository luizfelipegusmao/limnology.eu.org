{"title":"Dmany Nexus Protocol: A Decentralized Reputation Protocol for Scalable Web3 Economies Through Dynamic Trust Quantification and Zero-Knowledge Mechanisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2325/v1","date":1727662048000,"content":"The advent of Web3 technologies promises a paradigm shift toward decentralized and autonomous economic interactions enabled by blockchain and smart contracts. However, the lack of robust trust and reputation mechanisms hinders its evolution into a fully functional economic system. This paper introduces the Dmany Nexus Protocol, a decentralized reputation system that quantifies user trustworthiness through verified on-chain and off-chain actions. By integrating principles from information economics, game theory, and mechanism design, the protocol addresses issues of information asymmetry, moral hazard, and adverse selection inherent in decentralized networks. Leveraging the Dmany Quest Engine for decentralized task management and employing zero-knowledge proofs for privacy preservation, Dmany Nexus establishes a foundation for trust and cooperation in the Web3 ecosystem. The protocol enhances economic efficiency, mitigates security risks like Sybil attacks, and fosters mass adoption by enabling secure, privacy-preserving interactions among pseudonymous actors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee2cd24544a2cb2823cefee21157f5be7864717e42d70ab24d09a04e6d3721f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
