{"title":"Inhibition of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Endogenous Lipids: Induction of Pyroptosis by Geranylgeranoic Acid&mdash;A Comparison with Palmitic Acid and Retinoic Acid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0368/v1","date":1712218543000,"content":"Research on retinoid-based cancer prevention, spurred by the effects of vitamin A deficiency on gastric cancer and subsequent clinical studies on digestive tract cancer, unveils novel avenues for chemoprevention. Acyclic retinoids like 4,5-didehydrogeranylgeranoic acid (4,5-didehydroGGA) emerged as potent agents against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), distinct from natural retinoids such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Mechanistic studies reveal GGA's unique induction of pyroptosis, a rapid cell death pathway, in HCC cells. GGA triggers mitochondrial superoxide hyperproduction and ER stress responses through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and modulates autophagy, ultimately activating pyroptotic cell death in HCC cells. Unlike ATRA-induced apoptosis, GGA and palmitic acid (PA) induce pyroptosis, underscoring their distinct mechanisms. While all three fatty acids evoke mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress responses, GGA and PA inhibit autophagy, leading to incomplete autophagic responses and pyroptosis, whereas ATRA promotes autophagic flux. In vivo experiments demonstrate GGA's potential as an anti-oncometabolite, inducing cell death selectively in tumor cells and thus suppressing liver cancer development. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying GGA's anti-HCC effects and underscores its promising role in cancer prevention, highlighting its importance in HCC prevention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10d781275886a0eddb455edb7ec55484dfd94a595ef99295014d99e36b2144e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
