Nevertheless, achieving atomic-scale visualization of Li atoms alongside heavier elements poses challenges for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques such as annular bright field, differential phase contrast, and single-slice ptychography. With these methods, there are artifacts from mis-tilt, defocus, and thickness variations in the sample, and also there are limitations to sample thickness of a few nanometers due to multiple scattering and probe channeling [<a href=\"#ozae044.570-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.570-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6d1c97bd61139e918c6f5910705ac7964972853e47fe28b88278b07da4168a99","category":"Environment"}
