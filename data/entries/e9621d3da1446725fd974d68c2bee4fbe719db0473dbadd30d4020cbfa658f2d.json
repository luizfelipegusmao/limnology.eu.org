{"title":"Prolonged Neurological and Musculoskeletal Symptoms Following Shingrix Vaccination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1921/v1","date":1727179235000,"content":"Background: The Shingrix vaccine helps prevent shingles and its complications in adults 50 and older. While minor side effects are common, severe adverse reactions are thought to be rare, and long-term side effects are not well documented. Case Presentation: A 50-year-old woman with Crohn's disease developed joint pain, effusion, and neurological symptoms such as numbness and tingling shortly after receiving the first dose of Shingrix. Symptoms waxed and waned but persisted for over a year despite anti-inflammatories and specialist referrals. Diagnostic imaging and labs were unrevealing. Conclusion: This case of prolonged somatic and neurological symptoms associ-ated temporally with Shingrix administration reinforces the critical need for thorough pharma-covigilance and investigation of possible long-term adverse vaccine reactions. Provider documen-tation and reporting of individual experiences can help improve the detection of rare vaccine-related risks, elucidate potential risk factors, and refine safety screening. Diligent monitoring and research into longitudinal vaccine outcomes remain paramount, especially following recent emergency au-thorizations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9621d3da1446725fd974d68c2bee4fbe719db0473dbadd30d4020cbfa658f2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
