This study proposed a practical method for calibrating <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> sensor using measured dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. Our findings suggested the minimum number of bottle samples needed for calibration to ensure 1% accuracy. Additionally, we identified the significant role of a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon due to photosynthesis and the increase in buffer capacity of the seawater from the release of excess alkalinity by sea ice in regulating <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>. The mean air–sea CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes were −48.9 ± 44.6, −7.3 ± 14.6, and −1.4 ± 2.8 mmol m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> in the southern Chukchi Sea, northern Chukchi Sea, and northern East Siberian Sea, respectively. We found a robust negative correlation between the flux and sea ice concentration in the Arctic Sea ice regions.</p>","author":"Ahra Mo, \nKeyhong Park, \nTae‐Wook Kim, \nDoshik Hahm, \nJung‐Ok Choi, \nSohyeon Geum, \nJinyoung Jung, \nEun Jin Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"7deafabcebbcc4c87fb638f7e3fde8af69b9f232bad315a9e4b51f6f1cd4f674","category":"Environment"}
