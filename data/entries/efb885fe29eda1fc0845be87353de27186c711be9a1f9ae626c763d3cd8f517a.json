{"title":"The symbiotic effects of energy consumption, globalization, and combustible renewables and waste on ecological footprint in the United Kingdom","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12392?af=R","date":1707569126000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study aims to investigate the effects of energy consumption, globalization, and combustible renewable waste consumption on the ecological footprint in the United Kingdom. The study utilizes data from 1970 to 2015 using econometrics techniques, including the Fourier autoregressive Distributive Lag (Fourier ADL) co-integration test, autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL), and co-integrating regression. The results of the Fourier ADL and ARDL bounds tests indicate a long-term relationship among the variables examined. The outcomes of the ARDL model and co-integrating regression tests demonstrate that globalization, energy consumption, and economic growth contribute positively to the ecological footprint. However, there is a negative impact of combustible renewable waste on the ecological footprint. Furthermore, the gradual shift causality test identifies a one-way causal relationship between the ecological footprint and the investigated variables. The study acclaims that the British government should prioritize implementing policies to transition to sustainable and renewable energy sources.</p>","author":"Babatunde Sunday Eweade, \nAda Chigozie Akadiri, \nKehinde O.
