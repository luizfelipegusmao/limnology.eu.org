Here, we tested whether long-term nutrient additions affect carbon storage in a boreal forest. Over six decades, we found that nitrogen stimulated tree growth, which increased soil carbon input.

Although boreal forests contribute to approximately 45% of the total forest carbon sink, tree growth and soil carbon sequestration are constrained by nutrient availability. Here, we examine if long-term nutrient input enhances tree productivity and whether this leads to carbon storage or whether stimulated microbial decomposition of organic matter limits soil carbon accumulation. Over six decades, nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium were supplied to a <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>-dominated boreal forest. We found that nitrogen fertilization alone or together with calcium and/or phosphorus increased tree biomass production by 50% and soil carbon sequestration by 65% compared to unfertilized plots. However, the nonlinear relationship observed between tree productivity and soil carbon stock across treatments suggests microbial regulation. When phosphorus was co-applied with nitrogen, it acidified the soil, increased fungal biomass, altered microbial community composition, and enhanced biopolymer degradation capabilities. While no evidence of competition between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi has been observed, key functional groups with the potential to reduce carbon stocks were identified. In contrast, when nitrogen was added without phosphorus, it increased soil carbon sequestration because microbial activity was likely limited by phosphorus availability. In conclusion, the addition of nitrogen to boreal forests may contribute to global warming mitigation, but this effect is context dependent.</p>","author":"Etienne Richy, \nTania Fort, \nInaki Odriozola, \nPetr Kohout, \nFlorian Barbi, \nTijana Martinovic, \nBoris Tupek, \nBartosz Adamczyk, \nAleksi Lehtonen, \nRaisa Mäkipää, \nPetr Baldrian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"7cbc379c724f6ad5797e298e237e17c379bc597f06536fd81da9d398bb223c39","category":"Environment"}
