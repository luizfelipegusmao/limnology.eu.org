{"title":"Can a Higher Dimensional Model of the Universe Solve the Problem of Dark Matter?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1383/v1","date":1724077582000,"content":"In this letter, we show that the effects usually attributed to the presence of dark matter in the Universe can equally be seen as the ”external” effect on our Universe due to extra dimensions. For this, we consider a braneworld scenario where our universe, which is a 3-brane, is immersed in a 6D Minkowski bulk. We derive the 1/r force on the 3-brane at large distances as a response of cosmic fluid to external force due to extra dimensions. This scaling reproduces the effect of dark matter, such as the flat rotation curves of galaxies and a higher deflection angle around some gravitational lenses. It also explains the large-scale structure formation of the universe. This approach thus offers a novel perspective on dark matter, suggesting that higher-dimensional physics can account for these cosmic phenomena.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4313ab6f45ea5e5a2c1cee32e183d992f661dd99556d6ee5e949f05704ee461a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
