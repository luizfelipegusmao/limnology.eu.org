{"title":"Identification of promoter targets by Aureochrome 1a in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1834/7463986?rss=1","date":1701993600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Aureochromes (AUREOs) are unique blue light receptors and transcription factors found only in stramenopile algae. While each of the four AUREOs identified in the diatom <span>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</span> may have a specific function, PtAUREO1a has been shown to have a strong impact on overall gene regulation, when light changes from red to blue light conditions. Despite its significance, the molecular mechanism of PtAUREO1a is largely unexplored. To comprehend the overall process of gene regulation by PtAUREO1a, we conducted a series of <span>in vitro</span> and <span>in vivo</span> experiments, including pull-down assays, yeast one-hybrid experiments, and phenotypical characterization using recombinant PtAUREOs and diatom mutant lines expressing a modified <span>PtAureo1a</span> gene. We describe the distinct light absorption properties of four PtAUREOs and the formation of all combinations of their potential dimers. We demonstrate the capability of PtAUREO1a and 1b to activate the genes, <span>diatom-specific cyclin 2</span>, <span>PtAureo1a</span>, and <span>PtAureo1c</span> under both light and dark conditions. Using mutant lines expressing a modified PtAUREO1a protein with a considerably reduced light absorption, we found novel evidence that PtAUREO1a regulates the expression of PtLHCF15, which is essential for red light acclimation. Based on current knowledge, we present a working model of PtAUREO1a gene regulation properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bbcafcee64a3595965f76f1e2137d16d8457a0edd3fd00a2bf0aa0b87564e6a2","category":"Environment"}
