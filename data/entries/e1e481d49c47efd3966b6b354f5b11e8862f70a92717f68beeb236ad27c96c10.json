{"title":"Effect of Acid Etching Time in Ti3C2 MXene’s Interlayer Spacing and Conductivity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.598/7719876?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Materials with sheet-like morphologies often form interconnected networks of layers or flakes, offering continuous channels for electron and ion transport in electrochemical energy storage applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.598-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.598-B2\">2</a>]. One such material is the recently discovered class of 2-D transition metal carbides/nitrides, called MXene, whose general formula is M<sub>n+1</sub>X<sub>n</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (where M = transition metal; n = 1, 2, or 3; X = carbon or nitrogen; and T<sub>x</sub> = termination group such as –F, –OH, and/or =O) [<a href=\"#ozae044.598-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.598-B4\">4</a>]. Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, one of the most studied MXene, can be synthesized by selectively etching the aluminum layer in Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> (also called MAX phase) [<a href=\"#ozae044.598-B5\">5</a>]. The most straightforward technique to exfoliate this layer is by wet-chemical etching with high-concentration hydrofluoric acid (HF) [<a href=\"#ozae044.598-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.598-B7\">7</a>]. In this work, the effect of etching time on the morphology, interlayer spacing, and electrical conductivity of the resultant MXene was studied.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e1e481d49c47efd3966b6b354f5b11e8862f70a92717f68beeb236ad27c96c10","category":"Environment"}
