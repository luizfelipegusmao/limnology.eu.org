{"title":"Assessing genotypes of buffel grass (<i>Cenchrus ciliaris</i>) as an alternative to maize silage for sheep nutrition","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304328","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Sultan Singh, Pushpendra Koli, Tejveer Singh, Madan Mohan Das, Subhendu Bikash Maity, Krishna Kunwar Singh, Rohit Katiyar, Asim Kumar Misra, Sanat Kumar Mahanta, Manoj Kumar Srivastava, Uchenna Young Anele, Olatunde Akeem Oderinwale, YongLin Ren</p>\r\n\r\nNutritive value of five <i>Cenchrus ciliaris</i> (buffel grass) genotypes (IG96-50, IG96-96, IG96-358, IG96-401 and IG96-403) weredetermined. Their sugar contents (&gt;70 mg/g of dry matter) and ensiling potential were evaluated using <i>in vitro</i> batch culture and <i>in vivo</i> studies. Research indicated significant differences (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) in the dry matter, organic matter, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, cellulose and lignin contents of the <i>C</i>. <i>ciliaris</i> genotypes tested. Genotypes also differed (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) in total carbohydrates, structural carbohydrates, non-structural carbohydrates and protein fractions. Genotype IG96-96 had the lowest total digestible nutrients, digestible energy and metabolizable energy contents (377.2 g/kg, 6.95 and 5.71 MJ/kg of dry matter, respectively), and net energy values for lactation, maintenance and growth. After 45 days of ensiling, <i>C</i>. <i>ciliaris</i> silages differed (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) in dry matter, pH, and lactic acid contents, and their values ranged between 255–339, 4.06–5.17 g/kg of dry matter and 10.8–28.0 g/kg of dry matter, respectively. Maize silage had higher (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) Organic Matter (919.5g/kg of dry matter), ether extract (20.4g/kg of dry matter) and hemi-cellulose (272.3 g/kg of dry matter) than IG96-401 and IG96-96 silages. The total carbohydrates and non-structural carbohydrates of maize silage were higher (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>), while structural carbohydrates were comparable (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) with <i>C</i>. <i>ciliaris</i> silages. Sheep on maize silage had (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) higher metabolizable energy, lower crude protein, and digestible crude protein intake (g/kg of dry matter) than those on <i>C</i>. <i>ciliaris</i> silage diets. Nitrogen intake and urinary-N excretion were higher (<i>P &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>) on genotype IG96-96 silage diet. Overall, this study suggested that certain <i>C</i>. <i>ciliaris</i> genotypes, notably IG96-401 and IG96-96, exhibited nutritive values comparable to maize silage in sheep studies, offering a promising avenue for future exploration as potential alternatives in diversified and sustainable livestock nutrition programs.","author":"Sultan Singh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e25c212a34d29ed5773bae075c8ed7ba75b4e8bc99d01f998d4d8d58ccd21c72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
