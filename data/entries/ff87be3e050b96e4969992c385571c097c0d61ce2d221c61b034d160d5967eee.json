The venom they produce is remarkably diverse and has recently drawn much interest from a pharmacological perspective. To respond to this growing interest, a better understanding of the ecology and biology of the species is required. Only a few studies have examined the feeding behaviour and the trophic specialization of these species in detail. In this study, we investigated diet through hunger and satiety experiments of eight species of cones that occur in French Polynesia and that present different feeding modes (piscivorous, molluscivorous or vermivorous). Monitoring behaviour of cones during fasting periods demonstrated a correlation between increased hunger and nocturnal cone activity, mainly for piscivorous species, while the molluscivores did not show this correlation. In the study on satiety, we defined an average frequency of feeding for cone species that were fed prey <span>ad libitum</span>. Finally, this study provided indications that will help to define an equilibrium feeding frequency in further studies involving the cultivation of cones.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"ff87be3e050b96e4969992c385571c097c0d61ce2d221c61b034d160d5967eee","category":"Environment"}
