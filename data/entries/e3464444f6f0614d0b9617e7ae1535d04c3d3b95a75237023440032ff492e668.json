The aim of this study was to identify the predictors of neonatal mortality in the Eastern Regional Hospital, Ghana. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted using secondary data from electronic medical records from the Eastern Regional Hospital between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2022 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2022. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and adjusted Cox regression model were used to estimate survival probability and to assess the predictors of neonatal mortality. Data on 1684 neonates were analyzed and we found that 11.82% deaths occurred with a neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of 13.98 (95% CI: 12.05, 15.91) per 1000 person-days. Most neonatal deaths occurred within the first 24hrs of life (9.9%). The predictors of neonatal mortality were found to be low birthweight [Adjusted hazard rate (aHR): 1.63, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.54], hypothermia (aHR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.85), hyperthermia (aHR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.39), birth asphyxia (aHR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.68, 8.11), and multiparty (aHR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.70). However, neonates aged 8–28 days (aHR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.81), born in the Eastern Regional Hospital (aHR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.55), walk-in neonates (aHR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.90), and neonates whose mothers had 8 or more antenatal contacts (aHR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.92) had lower neonatal mortality. There was high NMR in the Eastern Regional Hospital in Ghana. Averting complications such as low birthweight, hypothermia, hyperthermia, birth asphyxia, including the provision of obstetric and early neonatal care within the first 24 hours of life is critical to reducing neonatal mortality. Adherence to the World Health Organization’s recommendation of 8 or more antenatal contacts among pregnant women is also essential in reducing neonatal mortality.","author":"Diana Awintima Apanga","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"e3464444f6f0614d0b9617e7ae1535d04c3d3b95a75237023440032ff492e668","category":"Environment"}
