{"title":"Microplastic pollution in the Chapora River, Goa, Southwest India: spatial distribution and risk assessment","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10661-024-12587-1","date":1712016000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The amount of information available on the microplastic (MP) contamination in Goa’s riverine water systems is currently limited. The abundance, size, colour, and polymer composition of microplastics in Chapora River surface water were investigated in this study. MPs in Chapora River surface water ranged from 0.1 particles/L (station 13) to 0.47 particles/L (station 5). The mean (± standard deviation) MP concentration was 0.25 (± 0.13) particles/L. Fibre was the dominant shape (77.15%), followed by fragments (12.36%), films (9.36%), and foam (1.12%). Most MPs were found in the 0.1–0.3 mm size range, then in the 0.3–1 mm and 1–5 mm. The dominant type of polymer studied was polyethylene terephthalate (PET; 46%), followed by high-density polyethylene (HDPE; 14%), polypropylene (PP; 5%), and polystyrene (PS; 1%). The risk assessment study indicated high risk with respect to PHI, while PLI shows low risk in the area. The source of MPs was mostly anthropogenic in nature in the region. When compared with other tropical rivers, MP pollution was relatively lower in the Chapora River. Nevertheless, the baseline data will help the local administration take mitigation measures to reduce the impact of MP pollution in the region.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"01d49ec45c8b77b18a579e1e607ea6deb95429f37768ff11ca10c2225419037b","category":"Environment"}
