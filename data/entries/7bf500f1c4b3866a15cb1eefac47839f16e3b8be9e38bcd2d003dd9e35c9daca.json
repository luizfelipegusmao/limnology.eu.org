{"title":"Treatment of Orthognathic Surgical Class III Patient with Cof-Fin Siris Syndrome: A Descriptive Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0295/v1","date":1719993095000,"content":"We present a case report of a 26-years-old female suffering from Coffin Siris Syndrome, who underwent orthodontic treatment and surgery to solve her malocclusion and improve her aes-thetics and functional occlusion. Methods: The presurgical phase involved multibracket self-ligating attachments, Damon prescription. The patient underwent maxillofacial surgery to correct the severe skeletal malocclusion and relocate the bone bases in the right relationship. The post-surgical orthodontic treatment was performed to complete the alignment. Results: The pa-tient improved her aesthetics and functional abilities. Conclusions: Syndromic patients can un-dergo orthodontictreatment if comorbidities and collaboration allow it. Support and collaboration of families and psychotherapists must be considered, but clinical cases of syndromic patients can be faced and solved. Obviously, each syndromic patient is considered unique, and the risk-benefit ratio must be correctly assessed for each one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bf500f1c4b3866a15cb1eefac47839f16e3b8be9e38bcd2d003dd9e35c9daca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
