{"title":"Standardization of FTIR-Based Methodologies for Microplastics Detection in Drinking Water: A Meta-Analysis Indeed and Practical Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2446/v1","date":1727765220000,"content":"The detection of microplastics (MPs) in drinking water has emerged as a critical environmental concern, with significant implications for public health. However, the variability in identification methods across studies has made it difficult to compare results, underscoring the urgent need for standardized protocols. This study presents a comprehensive meta-analysis and practical ap-proach to standardizing Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)-based methodologies for detecting MPs in drinking water. By systematically reviewing studies from 2019 to 2023, this research identifies the most effective techniques for MP quantification, with an emphasis on the use of 0.45 Î¼m cellulose nitrate filters and Nile red staining for fluorescence detection. The me-ta-analysis demonstrates consistent results across studies, supported by statistical analysis con-firming the reproducibility and reliability of the methodologies employed. Experimental findings highlight that the cellulose nitrate filter offers superior microplastic retention with low back-ground fluorescence, making it ideal for FTIR analysis. Moreover, the Nile red spray method is recommended for its efficiency and uniformity in staining, and random counting proves to be a rapid and reliable quantification technique. This study advocates for the adoption of standard-ized protocols, particularly in filter selection and staining methods, to ensure accurate and com-parable MP detection. The findings contribute valuable insights for optimizing water treatment processes and provide a solid foundation for future research and regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating microplastic contamination in water resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"985ba5c8219b9f62141313e80ea7a1cc71b8eb51f5592abacd0216dd3a1208f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
