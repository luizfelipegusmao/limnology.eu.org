Due to the peculiar characteristics of this device, the last few years have seen the steady rise on the application of this system in a variety of cultural heritage materials, having been useful to understand microbial biodeteriogens diversity and some of their metabolic and biodeteriogenic features. Considering the immense potential for application of this system, this manuscript discusses further possibilities of the technique aiming to help understand critical questions on the cultural heritage biodeterioration area. Its application in various differential contexts, has opened the doors for their putative usage on other interesting sub-areas of research worthy of future investigations, including: biodeteriogens genome and transcriptome analysis, metatranscriptomics, biodeteriorative metabolism studies, inter and intra kingdom interactions analysis, resistome profiling, object history and context studies, in situ applications, bioprospecting and biotechnology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"312e4b1b4b8505548288f52f7c4c508c7d7446fa1fb68dc5fac2c50f79849942","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
