{"title":"The spatial effect of upgrading economic development zones on regional eco-efficiency: evidence from China","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-023-05445-z","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>As the concept of sustainable development gains deeper traction, the upgrading of the economic developmentzone has become a significant way to improve Chinaâ€™s eco-efficiency and resource sustainability. This study uses a spatial econometric model predicated on a three-stage data envelopment analysis model to explore the ramifications of upgrading the economic development zone on regional eco-efficiency. The direct effect evaluation of the economic development zone upgrading shows that it significantly promotes sustainable urban development and urban eco-efficiency. In contrast, the regression results of indirect effects indicate that the economic development zone upgrading policy decrease the eco-efficiency of nearby regions, which is incompatible with sustainable regional development. This spatial effect is realized through the urban level of technological innovation, willingness to regulate the environment, and rising the degree of urban marketization. In addition, in cities with multiple upgraded economic development zones, high government management efficiency, high industrial relatedness, and better transportation infrastructure, the more obvious the direct effect of the policy on the improvement of eco-efficiency in pilot cities and a negative spatial effect on eco-efficiency in surrounding cities.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"c1e705634c06505afb2d14419db13aa0ede7fb03e76a12e9dfa1e1419cb3f487","category":"Environment"}
