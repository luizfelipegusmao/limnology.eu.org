{"title":"Identification of the single and combined acute toxicity of Cr and Ni with <i>Heterocypris</i> sp. and the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300800","date":1711029600000,"content":"<p>by Chi Su, Yilong Hua, Yi Liu, Shu Tao, Fei Jia, Wenhui Zhao, Wangyang Lin</p>\r\n\r\nMining wastewater with heavy metals poses a serious threat to the ecological environment. However, the acute single and combined ecological effects of heavy metals, such as chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni), on freshwater ostracods, and the development of relevant prediction models, remain poorly understood. In this study, <i>Heterocypris</i> sp. was chosen to investigate the single and combined acute toxicity of Cr and Ni. Then, the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was used to predict the combined toxicity of Cr and Ni. The single acute toxicity experiments revealed high toxicity for both Cr and Ni. In addition, Cr exhibited greater toxicity compared to Ni, as evidenced by its lower 96-hour half-lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of 1.07 mg/L compared to 4.7 mg/L for Ni. Furthermore, the combined acute toxicity experiments showed that the toxicity of Cr-Ni was higher than Ni but lower than Cr. Compared with the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models, the predicted results of the QSAR model were more consistent with the experimental results for the Cr-Ni combined acute toxicity. So, the high accuracy of QSAR model identified its feasibility to predict the toxicity of heavy metal pollutants in mining wastewater.","author":"Chi Su","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2b389d81742858cd34f47d325354676d47160490a665a9cd3f06ee893482c5e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
