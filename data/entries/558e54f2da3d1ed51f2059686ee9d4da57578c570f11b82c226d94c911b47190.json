{"title":"The H3K4 demethylase JMJ1 is required for proper timing of flowering in Brachypodium distachyon","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2729/7656881?rss=1","date":1713830400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Flowering is a key developmental transition in the plant life cycle. In temperate climates, flowering often occurs in response to the perception of seasonal cues such as changes in day-length and temperature. However, the mechanisms that have evolved to control the timing of flowering in temperate grasses are not fully understood. We identified a <span>Brachypodium distachyon</span> mutant whose flowering is delayed under inductive long-day conditions due to a mutation in the <span>JMJ1</span> gene, which encodes a Jumonji domain-containing protein. JMJ1 is a histone demethylase that mainly demethylates H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 in wild-type plants by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing combined with RNA sequencing revealed that H3K4m1 and H3K4me3 are positively associated with gene transcript levels, whereas H3K4me2 is negatively correlated with transcript levels. Furthermore, JMJ1 directly binds to the chromatin of the flowering regulator genes <span>VRN1</span> and <span>ID1</span> and affects their transcription by modifying their H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels. Genetic analyses indicated that JMJ1 promotes flowering by activating <span>VRN1</span> expression. Our study reveals a role for JMJ1-mediated chromatin modification in the proper timing of flowering in <span>B. distachyon</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"558e54f2da3d1ed51f2059686ee9d4da57578c570f11b82c226d94c911b47190","category":"Environment"}
