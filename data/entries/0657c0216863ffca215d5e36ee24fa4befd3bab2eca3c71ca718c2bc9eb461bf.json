According to RFT, the promotion system is engaged in attaining ideal goals (e.g. hopes and dreams), whereas the prevention system is associated with accomplishing ought goals (e.g. duties and obligations). Prior task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have mostly explored the mapping of these two systems onto the activity of a priori brain regions supporting motivation and executive control in both healthy and depressed adults. However, complex behavioral processes such as those guided by individual differences in regulatory focus are likely supported by widely distributed patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity. We used data-driven connectome-based predictive modeling to identify patterns of distributed whole-brain intrinsic network connectivity associated with individual differences in promotion and prevention system orientation in 1,307 young university volunteers. Our analyses produced a network model predictive of prevention but not promotion orientation, specifically the subjective experience of successful goal pursuit using prevention strategies. The predictive model of prevention success was highlighted by decreased intrinsic functional connectivity of both heteromodal association cortices in the parietal and limbic networks and the primary motor cortex. We discuss these findings in the context of strategic inaction, which drives individuals with a strong dispositional prevention orientation to inhibit their behavioral tendencies in order to shield the self from potential losses, thus maintaining the safety of the status quo but also leading to trade-offs in goal pursuit success.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"0657c0216863ffca215d5e36ee24fa4befd3bab2eca3c71ca718c2bc9eb461bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
