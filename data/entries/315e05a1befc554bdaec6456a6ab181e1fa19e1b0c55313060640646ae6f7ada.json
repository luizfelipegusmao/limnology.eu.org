{"title":"Caveolin and NOS in the Development of Muscular Dystrophy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0141/v1","date":1719901135000,"content":"Caveolin is a structural protein within caveolae, which may be involved in transmembrane molecular transport and/or various intercellular interactions within cells. Specific mutations of caveolin-3 in muscle cells are well-known to cause a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Altered expression of the caveolin-3 has been also detected in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which may be a part of the pathological process leading to muscle weakness. Interestingly, it has been shown that the renovation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to the sarcolemma with muscular dystrophy could improve the muscle health, suggesting that NOS may be involved in the pathology of muscular dystrophy. Here, we summarize the notable function of caveolin and/or NOS in skeletal muscle cells, and would like to discuss about their involvement in the pathology as well as possible tactics for the innovative treatment of muscular dystrophies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"315e05a1befc554bdaec6456a6ab181e1fa19e1b0c55313060640646ae6f7ada","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
