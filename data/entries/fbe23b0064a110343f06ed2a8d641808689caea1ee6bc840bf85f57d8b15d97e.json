{"title":"Phylogeny and evolution of streptophyte algae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/3/385/7687509?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Streptophyta emerged about a billion years ago. Nowadays, this branch of the green lineage is most famous for one of its clades, the land plants (Embryophyta). Although Embryophyta make up the major share of species numbers in Streptophyta, there is a diversity of probably &gt;5000 species of streptophyte algae that form a paraphyletic grade next to land plants. Here, we focus on the deep divergences that gave rise to the diversity of streptophytes, hence particularly on the streptophyte algae. Phylogenomic efforts have not only clarified the position of streptophyte algae relative to land plants, but recent efforts have also begun to unravel the relationships and major radiations within streptophyte algal diversity. We illustrate how new phylogenomic perspectives have changed our view on the evolutionary emergence of key traits, such as intricate signalling networks that are intertwined with multicellular growth and the chemodiverse hotbed from which they emerged. These traits are key for the biology of land plants but were bequeathed from their algal progenitors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"fbe23b0064a110343f06ed2a8d641808689caea1ee6bc840bf85f57d8b15d97e","category":"Environment"}
