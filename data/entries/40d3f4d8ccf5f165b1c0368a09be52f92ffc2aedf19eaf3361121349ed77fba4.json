{"title":"The Effect of Different Carrier Frequencies in Binaural Beats on the Relative Power of Gamma, Alpha, and Theta Frequency Bands in Healthy People","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0976/v1","date":1728870224000,"content":"Binaural beats are an acoustic-based form of brain stimulation that relies on engineering and neurophysiological principles. One important engineering factor in binaural beat stimulation is the carrier frequency Given the limited information available on the impact of carrier frequencies, our research aims to explore how carrier frequencies of 250 Hz and 400 Hz in binaural beats affect the theta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands in healthy individuals. The research involved 30 people between the ages of 20 and 30. It was conducted as a single-group comparative study. Prior to the test, brain maps were created for the participants. Based on these brain maps and the participants' resilience, various binaural beats with different carrier frequencies were played while the participants sat quietly in a chair and looked ahead. Their brain waves were then recorded. The results showed: 1- The relative power of the gamma frequency band changed significantly between the carrier frequencies of 250 and 400. However, there were no significant changes in the relative power of the alpha band, and no changes were observed in the theta frequency band. 2- Based on the principle of theta-gamma coupling in the theta frequency band, there have been positive changes in the gamma frequency band at the carrier frequency of 255 compared to 405. 3- The brain's topography map has shown changes at different carrier frequencies. The results indicate that as the carrier frequency increases, the energy also increases, but it must be proportional to the frequency band based on the energy equation between the carrier frequency and the frequency band. Based on the brain topography map, the carrier frequency mainly affects the intensity and extent of the involved areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40d3f4d8ccf5f165b1c0368a09be52f92ffc2aedf19eaf3361121349ed77fba4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
