The 2017 Chemistry Nobel Prize for cryo-Electron Microscopy honoured this “technique to image bio-molecules”. Applications of the technique have grown rapidly. However, the sample preparation is still a critical and often difficult element in the overall workflow. Several groups worldwide are working to solve this challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7e06866696fb8b2d42a1a1a7a6fba5446e9a47c7f7e791e7dbe4ef1e7281a1cc","category":"Environment"}
