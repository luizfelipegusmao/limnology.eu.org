{"title":"Neurotoxic snakebite envenomation treated with Philippine cobra antivenom in the eastern Visayas: a descriptive study between 2016 and 2020","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae088/7690219?rss=1","date":1717977600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Introduction</div>There is a significant shortage of observational studies on neurotoxic snakebite envenomation in the Philippines. This lack of data, especially concerning treatment using Purified Cobra Antivenom (PCAV), has prompted the initiation of this foundational study.<div>Methods</div>The target population included snakebite patients admitted to the Eastern Visayas Medical Center and treated with PCAV between 2016 and 2020. A retrospective chart review was conducted for data collection. The investigation analyzed the hospital stay and patient features of individuals who were administered either lower or higher doses of PCAV.<div>Results</div>Eighty-two patients were identified during the study. Of these, 27 (33%) were under 20 years of age and 50 (61%) were male. Most patients, totalling 75 (92%) were hailed from rural areas. Of the 82 patients, 59 (72%) received one or two ampoules of PCAV during the course. However, patients who received more than two ampoules had a longer median hospital stay than those who received less than three ampoules [96 h (interquartile range, IQR 66–122) vs. 125 h (IQR 96–218), <span>P</span> = 0.038]. The study reported five in-hospital mortalities (6.1%).<div>Conclusions</div>The individuals who needed a high dosage of PCAV tended to have more extended hospital stays, yet over 70% of the patient population required a lower dosage. To gain a clearer understanding of the burden of neurotoxic snakebites and determine the optimal PCAV dosage based on disease severity in the area, a more comprehensive, prospective study is recommended.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"dea33519f808544bccb9c324163fcdc1a41b73f918a4f42ed4410b90a5953aa4","category":"Environment"}
