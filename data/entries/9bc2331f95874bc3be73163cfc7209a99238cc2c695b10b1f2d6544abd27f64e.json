{"title":"Spatial patterns and associated factors of HIV testing and counselling (HTC) as a component of antenatal care services in Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310890","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Tigabu Kidie Tesfie, Werkneh Melkie Tilahun</p>\r\nBackground <p>While HIV testing and counselling play a crucial role in preventing mother-to-child transmission, numerous pregnant women did not receive these services. Understanding the spatial variation of HIV testing and counselling and its associated factors during antenatal care in Ethiopia remains limited. Thus, this study was aimed at assessing the spatial patterns and factors associated with HIV testing and counselling during antenatal care visits in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study design was employed with a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. A total of 2,789 women who gave birth in the two years prior to the survey and had at least one antenatal care visit were included in the study. Stata version 16 and ArcGIS version 10.8 software were used for analysis. A multilevel robust Poisson regression model was fitted to identify significantly associated factors since the prevalence of HIV testing and counselling was higher than 10%. A statistically significant association was declared based on multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression analysis using an adjusted prevalence ratio with its 95% confidence interval at a p-value &lt; 0.05. Spatial regression analysis was conducted, and the local coefficients of statistically significant spatial covariates were visualised.</p> Results <p>In Ethiopia, the overall prevalence of HIV testing and counselling during antenatal care visits was 29.5% (95% CI: 27.8%, 31.2%). Significant spatial clustering was observed (Global Moran’s I = 0.138, p-value &lt;0.001). In the spatial regression analysis, high and comprehensive knowledge related to HIV, and comprehensive knowledge on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission were significant explanatory variables for the spatial variation of HIV testing and counselling. In the multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression analysis, education, household wealth, media exposure, number of antenatal care visits, comprehensive knowledge on mother-to-child transmission, comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and region were significantly associated factors.</p> Conclusion <p>The prevalence of HIV testing and counselling during antenatal care visits was low. Empowering women through education, promoting mass media exposure, increasing numbers of antenatal care visits, and enhancing women’s knowledge related to HIV and mother-to-child transmission by targeting cold spot areas could improve HIV testing and counselling service uptake among pregnant women in Ethiopia.</p>","author":"Tigabu Kidie Tesfie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9bc2331f95874bc3be73163cfc7209a99238cc2c695b10b1f2d6544abd27f64e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
