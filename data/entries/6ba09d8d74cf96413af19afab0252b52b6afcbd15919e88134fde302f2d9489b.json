{"title":"The Role of Technology in Burn Disaster Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1025/v1","date":1710754965000,"content":"Technological advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and novel technological tools have transformed disaster management practices from localized approaches to a global framework. These innovations necessitate a unified understanding and application of diverse methodologies at an international level, ensuring they are accessible and operational across different sectors. This integration is crucial not only for technical personnel but also for medical teams, who play a pivotal role in disaster response and management. By fostering a comprehensive grasp of these methods, we can enhance coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness in addressing disasters on a global scale. The authors aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of emerging techniques that are driving shifts in strategic approaches and treatment technologies. Recognized as a domain of continuous research and development, this overview, by necessity, remains an incomplete snapshot of an evolving field. It highlights the dynamic nature of technological and strategic advancements, underscoring the importance of ongoing investigation and innovation to stay abreast of current trends and future directions. The article also highlights the importance of international collaboration beyond societal and national boundaries A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: (1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; (2) Methods: briefly describe the main methods or treatments applied; (3) Results: summarize the articleâ€™s main findings; (4) Conclusions: indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article and it must not contain results that are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ba09d8d74cf96413af19afab0252b52b6afcbd15919e88134fde302f2d9489b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
