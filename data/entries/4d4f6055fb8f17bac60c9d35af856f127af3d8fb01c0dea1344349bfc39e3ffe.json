{"title":"The role of metabolomics in informing strategies for improving photosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/6/1696/7504410?rss=1","date":1703894400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Photosynthesis plays a vital role in acclimating to and mitigating climate change, providing food and energy security for a population that is constantly growing, and achieving an economy with zero carbon emissions. A thorough comprehension of the dynamics of photosynthesis, including its molecular regulatory network and limitations, is essential for utilizing it as a tool to boost plant growth, enhance crop yields, and support the production of plant biomass for carbon storage. Photorespiration constrains photosynthetic efficiency and contributes significantly to carbon loss. Therefore, modulating or circumventing photorespiration presents opportunities to enhance photosynthetic efficiency. Over the past eight decades, substantial progress has been made in elucidating the molecular basis of photosynthesis, photorespiration, and the key regulatory mechanisms involved, beginning with the discovery of the canonical Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle. Advanced chromatographic and mass spectrometric technologies have allowed a comprehensive analysis of the metabolite patterns associated with photosynthesis, contributing to a deeper understanding of its regulation. In this review, we summarize the results of metabolomics studies that shed light on the molecular intricacies of photosynthetic metabolism. We also discuss the methodological requirements essential for effective analysis of photosynthetic metabolism, highlighting the value of this technology in supporting strategies aimed at enhancing photosynthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"4d4f6055fb8f17bac60c9d35af856f127af3d8fb01c0dea1344349bfc39e3ffe","category":"Environment"}
