{"title":"Evaluation of a Phytogenic Feed Additive with Essential Oils and Plant Extracts on Growth Performance in Auction-Derived Beef Steers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1514/v1","date":1719205712000,"content":"This study used 10 replicate pens per treatment in a randomized complete block design and each pen contained 8 steers (initial BW = 305 ± 30.4 kg; n=80 steers/treatment) to determine if a phytogenic feed additive (PFA) with essential oils and plant extracts (PHYTOsolvan 200; DOSTOFARM, Westerstede, Germany) influences measures of growth or growth efficiency during the feedlot receiving phase in auction-derived beef steers. No steers were removed from the study; one steer from the control treatment was treated for respiratory disease. No mortality was noted in the present experiment. No appreciable differences were noted for BW, ADG, DMI, or feed conversion efficiency from d 1 to 29, 29 to 53, or during the cumulative receiving period (P ≥ 0.12). Performance based NEm and NEg were not influenced by dietary treatment (P ≥ 0.79). The ratio of observed-to-expected dietary net energy was not impacted by dietary treatment (P ≥ 0.71). These were healthy, high-growth potential Northern Plains steers. There was minimal morbidity (0.63%) and no mortality noted during the 53 d receiving study. Steers performed well and met growth performance expectations (the ratio of observed-to-expected NEm = 1.00), hence, it was not anticipated that the phytogenic compound would appreciably influence growth or health outcomes under the conditions of this experiment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32f70a74c592793b6331cb3749d7f30c23421044d689fa77c2f50eb14a31a5e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
