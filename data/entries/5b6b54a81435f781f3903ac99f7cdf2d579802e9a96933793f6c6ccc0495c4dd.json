In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), the abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathways play important roles in modulating seed germination. However, the molecular links between salinity stress and ABA/GA signaling are not well understood. Herein, we showed that the expression of <span>DIVARICATA1</span> (<span>DIV1</span>), which encodes a MYB-like transcription factor, was induced by GA and repressed by ABA, salinity, and osmotic stress in germinating seeds. DIV1 positively regulated seed germination in response to salinity stress by directly regulating the expression of <span>DELAY OF GERMINATION 1-LIKE 3</span> (<span>DOGL3</span>) and <span>GA-STIMULATED ARABIDOPSIS 4</span> (<span>GASA4</span>) and indirectly regulating the expression of several germination-associated genes. Moreover, NUCLEAR FACTOR-YC9 (NF-YC9) directly repressed the expression of <span>DIV1</span> in germinating seeds in response to salinity stress. These results help reveal the function of the NF-YC9â€“DIV1 module and provide insights into the regulation of ABA and GA signaling in response to salinity stress during seed germination in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5b6b54a81435f781f3903ac99f7cdf2d579802e9a96933793f6c6ccc0495c4dd","category":"Environment"}
