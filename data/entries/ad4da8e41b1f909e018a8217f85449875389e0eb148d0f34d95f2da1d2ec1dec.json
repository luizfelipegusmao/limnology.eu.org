{"title":"A biospecies-derived genomic DNA hybrid gel electrolyte for electrochemical energy storage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae213/7685368?rss=1","date":1717027200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Intrinsic impediments, namely weak mechanical strength, low ionic conductivity, low electrochemical performance, and stability have largely inhibited beyond practical applications of hydrogels in electronic devices and remains as a significant challenge in the scientific world. Here, we report a biospecies-derived genomic DNA hybrid gel electrolyte with many synergistic effects, including robust mechanical properties (mechanical strength and elongation of 6.98 MPa and 997.42%, respectively) and ion migration channels, which consequently demonstrated high ionic conductivity (73.27 mS/cm) and superior electrochemical stability (1.64 V). Notably, when applied to a supercapacitor the hybrid gel-based devices exhibit a specific capacitance of 425 F/g. Furthermore, it maintained rapid charging/discharging with a capacitance retention rate of 93.8% after ∼200,000 cycles while exhibiting a maximum energy density of 35.07 Wh/kg and a maximum power density of 193.9 kW/kg. This represents the best value among the current supercapacitors and can be immediately applied to minicars, solar cells, and LED lightning. The widespread use of DNA gel electrolytes will revolutionize human efforts to industrialize high-performance green energy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"ad4da8e41b1f909e018a8217f85449875389e0eb148d0f34d95f2da1d2ec1dec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
