{"title":"Climate Change and the Ob River: A Reassessment of Major and Trace Element Fluxes to the Arctic Ocean","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2081/v1","date":1717142657000,"content":"This study investigated the content of macro- and microelements in the lower reaches of the Ob River (Western Siberia). Seasonal sampling was performed over a four-year period (2020-2023) during the main hydrological seasons (winter low water, spring-summer floods, and early fall low water) at three river stations. Suspended and dissolved fractions were separated by filtration through 0.45-micron nitrocellulose filters. The results revealed significant seasonal variations in the elemental content of the Ob River water, associated with changes in catchment inputs, physical and chemical conditions of the aquatic environment, and the amount and composition of incoming suspended sediment. During high water flow events in the Ob River, the concentration of suspended solids increased substantially. These included significant quantities of sparingly soluble hydrolysates such as Al, Ti, Zr, Ga. During the winter period when the Ob River was ice-covered, a 2- to 3-fold rise was observed in the concentration of Na, Mg, Ca, K, Si, Mn. Having accounted for these seasonal variations in water chemistry, we were able to refine our estimates of elemental export to the Arctic Ocean. Compared to estimates from previous studies, we observed with 2.3-fold higher dissolved loads of Mn, 2.1-fold for Zn, 1.6-fold for Fe, and 1.4-fold for Pb.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9512cc83d70fd38c148c03e97c94124819c693b22ed3efcd66f8d392f49bd1c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
