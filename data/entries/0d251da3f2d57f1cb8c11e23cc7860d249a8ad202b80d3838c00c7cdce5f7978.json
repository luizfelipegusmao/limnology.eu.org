Aerosol jet printing (AJP) can be advantageous for development and fabrication of custom electronics at low cost due to its rapid prototyping capabilities [<a href=\"#ozae044.1002-B1\">1</a>]. Additionally, it can print over irregular, curved surfaces by maintaining a distance of a few millimeters between the nozzle and the substrate [<a href=\"#ozae044.1002-B1\">1</a>]. Despite its advantages, AJP is challenged by a complex set of processing parameters. Thermal sintering parameters for silver nanoparticle ink used in AJP were investigated via resistivity analysis and focused ion beam (FIB) sectioning and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0d251da3f2d57f1cb8c11e23cc7860d249a8ad202b80d3838c00c7cdce5f7978","category":"Environment"}
