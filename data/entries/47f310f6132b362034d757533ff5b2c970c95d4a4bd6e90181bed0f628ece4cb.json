Although juveniles are known to use estuaries and occasionally move to freshwater environments, these freshwater incursions had not been reported for adults. Recently, this behavior was observed in the Tagus River (Portugal) for adults occurring up to 150 km from the river mouth, about 80 km upstream from the tidal influence, suggesting the existence of a freshwater contingent. Fisheries management of sea bass should consider the putative existence of a freshwater contingent.</p>","author":"R. Almeida, \nS. E. Tanner, \nC. S. Mateus, \nF. Ribeiro, \nB. R.
