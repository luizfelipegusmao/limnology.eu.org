It was found that the critical point has a strong statistically significant correlation (0.83 by Spearman and 0.93 by Pearson) with the strain hardening coeffi-cient calculated in the section from yield strength to fracture strength. A regression equation linking the critical transition point to the strain hardening coefficient was obtained.\nIt is shown that with increasing plasticity of thin-walled samples obtained by selective laser melting of AlSi10Mg leads to a change in the type of stress distribution in the elastic-plastic region (the Weibull distribution changes to a normal distribution) and the contribution of the probability density of stress distribution described by the Cauchy distribution with a mode near the fracture stress to the full probability density of fracture increases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af45c36920d586bf743062014a0c6ea57ddaec7896376cc0a9ef083cbf508437","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
