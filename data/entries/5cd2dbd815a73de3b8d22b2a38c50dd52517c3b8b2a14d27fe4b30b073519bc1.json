{"title":"Polyamidoamine-based graphene oxide nanoparticles as adsorbent for mitigation of fouling in electrochemical membrane bioreactor","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-024-05556-1","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>In the present study, improved treatment of synthetic wastewater using integrated electrochemical membrane bioreactor (EMBR) and the addition of graphene oxide nanoparticles (GO-NPs) is reported. For this aim, GO-NPs were reduced and modified using ethylene diamine (EDA). After that, EDA-treated GO particles (RGO-NH<sub>2</sub>) were exposed to alkylation, and repetitive amidation for synthesizing polyamidoamine (PAMAM)-bonded nanosheets of GO. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results confirmed the formation of various structures, while thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) graphs showed the occurrence of non-ideal reactions and lack of PAMAM bonding as expected. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) graphs showed that the bonding resistance exists against the bonding of nanosheets. The results showed that GO-NPs included EMBR systems led to a significant reduction in membrane fouling, and operational time was extended for ca. 20 days before reaching the flux limit. This could be due to the reduction in the cake layer extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) fraction with a significant decrease in the content of protein-like compounds in the lightly bound EPS (LB-EPS) fraction. This could be related to the electrophilic attack of electro-generated OH<sup>Â·</sup> radicals to the electron-rich moieties of fouling agents, adsorption of organic fouling agents on the outer surface of GO-NPs, increase in overall sludge particle size and prevention of floc penetration through membrane pores. The results were validated by the FTIR and emission excitation matrix (EEM) spectroscopy methods. The results of the current study could be beneficial for the operation of a scaled-up system using more membrane modules and a larger permeate flowrate.</p>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Graphical abstract</h3>\n                      <p><span>\n                        <span>\n                          <img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/MediaObjects/13762_2024_5556_Figa_HTML.png\" />\n                        </span>\n                      </span></p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"5cd2dbd815a73de3b8d22b2a38c50dd52517c3b8b2a14d27fe4b30b073519bc1","category":"Environment"}
