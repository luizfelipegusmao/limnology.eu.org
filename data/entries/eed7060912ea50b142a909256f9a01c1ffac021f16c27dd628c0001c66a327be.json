{"title":"High-dose oral thiamine versus placebo for chronic fatigue in patients with primary biliary cholangitis: A crossover randomized clinical trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301354","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Palle Bager, Lars Bossen, Rasmus Gantzel, Henning Grønbæk</p>\r\nBackground &amp; aims <p>Fatigue has high negative impact on many patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and treatment options are limited. Recently we showed favorable effects of four weeks of high-dose thiamine treatment on fatigue in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to investigate the effect and safety of high-dose (600–1800 mg daily) oral thiamine treatment on chronic fatigue in patients with PBC.</p> Methods <p>Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial including patients with severe PBC-related fatigue. Participants were allocated 1:1 to either group 1) 4 weeks of high-dose thiamine, 4 weeks of washout, and 4 weeks of placebo; or group 2) 4 weeks of placebo, washout, and high-dose thiamine, respectively. Fatigue severity was quantified using the fatigue subscale of the PBC-40 questionnaire. The primary outcome was a fatigue reduction of ≥ 5 points after 4 weeks of high-dose thiamine treatment.</p> Results <p>We enrolled 36 patients; 34 completed the study. The overall mean reduction in fatigue was 5.0 points (95% CI: 2.5 to 7.5; p &lt; 0.001) for the combined group 1 and group 2. Crossover analysis showed a mean increase in fatigue of 0.3 points (95% CI: -4.2 to 3.8) after high-dose thiamine treatment compared to a 1.4 points (95% CI: 6.2 to –3.4) mean reduction after placebo (p = 0.55). Only mild and transient adverse events were recorded.</p> Conclusion <p>Four weeks of high-dose oral thiamine treatment in patients with PBC was well tolerated and safe. However, high-dose thiamine was not superior to placebo in reducing PBC-related fatigue.</p> Trial registration <p>The trial was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04893993) and EudraCT (2020-004935-26).</p>","author":"Palle Bager","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"eed7060912ea50b142a909256f9a01c1ffac021f16c27dd628c0001c66a327be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
