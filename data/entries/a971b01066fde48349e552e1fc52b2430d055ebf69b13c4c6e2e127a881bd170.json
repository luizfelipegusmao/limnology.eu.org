{"title":"A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the molecular mechanisms common to mitophagy and atherosclerosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0186/v1","date":1722592857000,"content":"Related studies have shown that mitophagy plays a role in the progression of Atherosclerosis (AS). Utilizing GSE43292, GSE100927, and GSE159677 datasets, WGCNA and differential expression analysis identified mitophagy-related module genes and DEGs1, while single-cell analysis screened DEGs2. MR analysis revealed causal AS-linked genes in DEGs1. LASSO and expression validation identified biomarkers, evaluated via ROC curves. Further analyses included GSEA, immune infiltration, ANN, regulatory networks, and drug prediction. Four candidate genes were identified through WGCNA, differential expression analysis and MR analysis. The LASSO analysis identified CD36, IL1RN, and MME as biomarkers, while the MR analysis showed that IL1RN and MME are protective factors and CD36 is a risk factor in AS. The ROC curves disclosed that the ANN model had greater diagnostic power for AS than any other biomarker. The GSEA revealed that the biomarkers were enriched in lysosomes and hematopoietic cell lineage and were significantly positively correlated with monocytes. The regulatory network construct showed that small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 regulates MME via the micro RNAs. This study identified CD36, IL1RN, and MME as biomarkers of mitophagy in AS and indicated that they could be applied in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a971b01066fde48349e552e1fc52b2430d055ebf69b13c4c6e2e127a881bd170","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
