In addition, previous studies have shown that overexpression of an apple homolog leads to increased drought tolerance in tomato plants. Therefore, SWEET17 might be a molecular element involved in plant responses to drought. However, the role and function of SWEET17 in above-ground tissues of Arabidopsis under drought stress remain elusive. By combining gene expression analysis and stem architecture with the sugar profiles of different above-ground tissues, we uncovered a putative role for SWEET17 in carbohydrate supply and thus cauline branch elongation, especially during periods of carbon limitation, as occurs under drought stress. Thus, SWEET17 seems to be involved in maintaining efficient plant reproduction under drought stress conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0bbbc5150ccda6fb220c6bfab41c26e1883bec92bc2fe89c1f88decb582e70b7","category":"Environment"}
