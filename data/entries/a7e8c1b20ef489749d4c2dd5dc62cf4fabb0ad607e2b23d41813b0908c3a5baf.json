{"title":"Exploring the Role of Psychedelic Experiences on Wellbeing and Symptoms of Disordered Eating","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0496/v1","date":1725608339000,"content":"Accumulating psychedelic research has demonstrated potential for improving mental health and wellbeing, yet studies in the context of eating disorders (EDs) are limited. This study explores the subjective effects of psychedelic experiences to gain insight into the benefits and risks for people with EDs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 eligible adults. A purposive sample of eight adults aged 25-54 (M =  36.9) with chronic EDs, diagnosed (N = 7) and undiagnosed (N = 1) were thematically analysed. Reports of cessation or reduction of ED symptoms were unanimous, with two participants reporting recovery, attributed to psychedelic use. Thematic analysis resulted in two superordinate themes, each comprising three subordinate themes. The first superordinate theme, ‘Exploring’ via the ‘gateway to healing’, illustrates mental, emotional, and transcendental elements of psychedelic experiences. The second superordinate theme, ‘Transformation’ and being ‘able to do the work’, illustrates cognitive and behavioural outcomes, with retrospective safety perceptions. This research presents an account representative of the ED population for the therapeutic potential for psychedelic experiences to reduce symptoms and improve wellbeing. Findings provide evidence of therapeutic feasibility to support larger scale research, emphasising the therapeutic use of psychedelics as a potentially promising avenue for chronic and treatment resistant EDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7e8c1b20ef489749d4c2dd5dc62cf4fabb0ad607e2b23d41813b0908c3a5baf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
