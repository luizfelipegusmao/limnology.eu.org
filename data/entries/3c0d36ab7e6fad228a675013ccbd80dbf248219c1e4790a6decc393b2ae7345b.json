{"title":"Production Technologies towards Safe or No Aflatoxin Risk in Groundnut: The Case of Northern Ghana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2235/v1","date":1722332773000,"content":"Groundnut is an important cash crop and a diet component for rural households in sub-Saharan Africa.  However, Aflatoxin contamination remains a barrier to promoting groundnut-based food products as food levels above maximum limit (ML) can adversely affect human health. Three objectives were set, namely, (i) to characterize the post-harvest operations and risk factors affecting aflatoxin contamination, (ii) to assess aflatoxin incidence in on-farm stores and, iii) to assess agronomic practices that can be integrated to improve yield and reduce aflatoxin contamination.  The average aflatoxin levels in on-farm stores were 11.3-16.4μg/kg, in which the proportions of ML were 25.7% at 4μg/kg, 56.3% at 15μg/kg, and 80% at 20μg/kg (~5-7 months after harvest). The application of Aflasafe® resulted in safe or no aflatoxin contamination across the locations. Significant hazards identified during postharvest operations include intermittent rain at harvest and drying (6.5), insect pests attacks after harvest (6), prolonged harvest to stripping interval (6.6), drying on bare ground (6.2), storing on bare floor (6.9), use of poorly efficient shelling machines (6.5), and re-use of rejected nut (6.1). This study provides solutions to minimize aflatoxin risk if appropriate technologies (e.g. improved variety, fertilizer, rhizobia inoculant, and Aflasafe®) and policies are deployed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c0d36ab7e6fad228a675013ccbd80dbf248219c1e4790a6decc393b2ae7345b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
