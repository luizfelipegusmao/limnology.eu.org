{"title":"Validation of an Enhanced Drinking Water Temperature Model during Distribution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1181/v1","date":1723753895000,"content":"The drinking water temperature is expected to increase in the Netherlands due to climate change and the installation of district heating networks as part of the energy transition. To determine effective measures to prevent undesirable temperature increase of the drinking water a model is developed. This model describes the temperature in the drinking water distribution network as a result of the transfer of heat from the climate, above and underground heat sources through the soil. The model consists of two coupled applications. The extended soil temperature model (STM+) describes the soil temperatures, in a two-dimensional finite element method that includes a drinking water pipe and two hot water pipes, coupled to a micro meteorology model. The extended water temperature model (WTM+) describes the drinking water temperature as a function of the surrounding soil temperature (the boundary temperature, resulting from the STM+), thermal sphere of influence where the drinking water temperature influences the soil temperature, and the hydraulics in the drinking water network. Both models are validated with field measurements. This paper describes the WTM+. Previous models did not consider the cooling effect of the drinking water on the surrounding soil, which led to an overestimation of the boundary temperature, and to an overestimation of how quickly the drinking water temperature reaches this boundary temperature. The field measurements show the improved accuracy of the WTM+ when considering one to two times the radius of the drinking water pipe as the thermal sphere of influence around the pipe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16afa041d276dc2f5cac5143db353f27521a5ca572afb5a31d970c6eca9e572e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
