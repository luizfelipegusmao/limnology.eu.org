{"title":"Carbon-Neutral Forestry Contributes to Global Warming due to Carbon Debt","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0447/v1","date":1728294716000,"content":"This article presents an evaluation of the environmental impact of forestry based on landscape theory. It has been argued that this type of forestry offers a positive impact on the climate because there is a balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and the absorption of these gases within an entire forested area. However, this analysis will demonstrate that the arrangement and composition of managed forests are linked to a significant carbon debt. This debt represents the disparity between the carbon that would typically be stored in a natural forest and the actual amount of carbon stored in the managed forest. While this excess carbon remains in the atmosphere rather than being sequestered, it contributes to the greenhouse effect. Using the Swedish forestry as an example, the carbon debt is estimated to be comparable in scale to the total accumulated fossil fuel emissions of the country.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31a5f51763a2397af2b97e2c8ee4501279cb557763a904a236bd04dca3d1d5ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
