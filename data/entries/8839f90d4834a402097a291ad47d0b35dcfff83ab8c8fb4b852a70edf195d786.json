{"title":"Spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of tourism resources based on point of interest data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310487","date":1726668000000,"content":"<p>by Feng Ding, Shijun Zhang, Luote Dai</p>\r\n\r\nThe agglomeration and dispersion of tourist attractions in space greatly affect the development of regional tourism resources and the consumption choice of tourism market. At present, the research on the spatial distribution characteristics of tourist attractions and their influencing factors mainly adopts induction and investigation, and there is a lack of effective statistical models for the research on the spatial distribution of tourist attractions and their influencing factors in some historical and cultural ancient cities. This paper uses Internet technology to obtain the spatial distribution data of tourist attractions in Shaoxing city, and uses mean nearest neighbor analysis, nuclear density analysis, imbalance index analysis, standard deviation ellipse and other spatial statistical analysis techniques and geographical detector methods to study the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of tourist attractions in Shaoxing City. This paper studied the distribution characteristics of tourist attractions in Shaoxing city, such as spatial aggregation, distribution equilibrium and spatial orientation, and applied geographical detector to study the influencing factors of the spatial distribution of scenic spots. It was concluded that the spatial distribution pattern of scenic spots was affected by various factors such as natural environment, social environment and economic environment. The explanatory power of two-factor interaction is obviously stronger than that of single factor. The research results provide scientific basis for the planning, layout and development of tourist attractions in Shaoxing and its similar cities, and then promote the high-quality development of tourism in Shaoxing and its similar historical and cultural ancient cities.","author":"Feng Ding","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8839f90d4834a402097a291ad47d0b35dcfff83ab8c8fb4b852a70edf195d786","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
