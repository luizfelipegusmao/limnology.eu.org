{"title":"Path Analysis of Green Finance-Driven Regional Technological Innovation in China: The Mediating Effect of R&amp;D Investment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0520/v1","date":1728315415000,"content":"As the global economy pays increasing attention to sustainable development and environmental protection, the role of green finance in promoting regional technological innovation is becoming more and more prominent. This study aims to analyse the impact of green finance on regional technological innovation and its mechanism of action, with special attention to the mediating effect of R&amp;D inputs and the moderating role of regional characteristics. By analysing the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2021 with fixed and mediated effect models, the results show that green finance significantly promotes regional technological innovation. R&amp;D investment intensity partially mediates this effect, while regional innovation and entrepreneurship capacity plays a significant moderating role in this relationship. Specifically, regional innovation and entrepreneurship capacity reinforces the positive impact of green finance on R&amp;D investment, but the marginal effect of R&amp;D investment is reduced in regions with stronger innovation and entrepreneurship capacity. The findings provide a theoretical basis for formulating relevant policies to promote green finance development and sustainable innovation in regional economies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e139ae22cb86c847f64dedd39bc3546c26498de069ef19d9add534148e3932d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
