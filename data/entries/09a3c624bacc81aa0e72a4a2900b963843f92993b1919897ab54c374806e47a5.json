{"title":"Evaluation of the Effect of Primary and Secondary Closure on the Use of Leukocyte and Platelet Rich Fibrin in Impacted Lower Third Molar Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0094/v1","date":1711975353000,"content":"Background/Objectives: In the efficacy of L-Prf on complications in lower impacted third molar surgery, it's not known which method increases the effect of L-Prf on postoperative complications when using primary and secondary closure methods with L-Prf. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of using L-PRF in patients undergoing impacted lower third molar surgery with either primary or secondary closure techniques. Methods: This prospective, randomised, double-blind, split-mouth clinical trial was conducted in patients with bilateral lower impacted third molars of similar position. The study had 2 groups. Primary closure was performed in group 1 and secondary closure in group 2. Group 1 closure technique was applied to one side of the patients and group 2 closure technique was applied to the other side at different times. A total of 45 patients were evaluated during the study period. 9 of these patients were excluded from the study due to alveolitis and failure to attend regular control visits. Results: Of the 36 patients included in the study, 23 were female and 13 were male and the mean age was 22.42Â±3.36 years. The secondary closure group had lower VAS scores at hour 6 (p&amp;lt;0.05). Pain decreased more in the primary closure group when comparing changes between the VAS scores at 6 hours and 7 days (p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study, showing that both secondary and primary closure are effective with similar outcomes in terms of pain, swelling and trismus, should be supported by future prospective clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09a3c624bacc81aa0e72a4a2900b963843f92993b1919897ab54c374806e47a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
