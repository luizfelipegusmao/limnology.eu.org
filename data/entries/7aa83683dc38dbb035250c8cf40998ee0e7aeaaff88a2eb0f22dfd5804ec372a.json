{"title":"Hematological Reference Intervals of Mangrove Parrots (Amazona amazonica) Kept in a Wildlife Management Establishment in the Amazon Biome, Par&aacute;, Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1672/v1","date":1727070148000,"content":"Amazona amazonica, popularly known as the mangrove parrot, belongs to the order Psittaciformes and is widely distributed across South America, occurring in all regions of Brazil. Although this species is commonly admitted to veterinary care, detailed hematological data are scarce. These data are crucial for guiding clinical interventions, monitoring specimens in human care environments, and providing research references. Hematological reference intervals were established for man-grove parrots kept in a fauna management establishment located in the Amazon biome in the state of Pará, Brazil. The study included 32 Amazona amazonica parrots. Average values for the analyzed analytes in the complete blood count (CBC) were: red blood cells (RBC) 2.42 million/µL; hemoglobin 15.92 g/dL; hematocrit 50.31%; MCV 205.47 fL; MCHC 31.7%; MCH 66.73 pg; white blood cells (WBC) 6,281.4 cells/µL; heterophils 2,671.1 cells/µL; lymphocytes 3,452.27 cells/µL; eosinophils 0 cells/µL; basophils 22.63 cells/µL; monocytes 106.41 cells/µL; thrombocytes 29.44; PPT 6.71 g/dL. Morphological characteristics of the cells were similar to those of other parrots. This research is pioneering in deter-mining hematological reference intervals for mangrove parrots under human care in a holding facility in the Amazon biome. These data can be used as a reference for animals of the species raised under similar conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7aa83683dc38dbb035250c8cf40998ee0e7aeaaff88a2eb0f22dfd5804ec372a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
