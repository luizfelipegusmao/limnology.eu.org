{"title":"Upgrading/Deacidification of Organic Liquid Phase by Liquid-Liquid Extraction Using Methanol/Water as Solvent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0531/v1","date":1712567865000,"content":"The objective of this work was to investigate the deacidification of bio-oils (BOs) from triglyceride-based biomass through the application of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in a simple stage, using methanol and water as a binary solvent and feed/solvent ratio of 1/1. For this, the effects of process parameters such as the water content present in the solvent, the content of carboxylic acids present in the bio-oil, and the extraction temperature on the deacidification process through the efficiency and distribution coefficient were evaluated, as well as the effects of such parameters on the quality of deacidified bio-oils through physical-chemical analyzes and GC-MS analysis. The results show that such process parameters significantly affect the quality of deacidified bio-oils. The ideal condition to have the highest acid removal, i.e., the highest deacidification efficiency (72.65%), is the one in which the deacidification process is performed with aqueous methanol (5% water) at 35 °C and for BOs that have a total acid number (TAN) equal to 24.38 mg KOH/g. Therefore, the process of deacidification by LLE using aqueous methanol is a promising alternative for removing carboxylic acids and other oxygenated compounds, contributing significantly to the upgrading or improving biofuels produced by catalytic thermal cracking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02941b40cc8cd4f41bdf006cc80103f57167d211bebcf08fe919f75e7a219846","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
