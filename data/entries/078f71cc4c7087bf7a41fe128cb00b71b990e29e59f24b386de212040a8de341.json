{"title":"Cutting-Edge Diagnostic Tools for Cardiac Amyloidosis Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0498/v1","date":1720157320000,"content":"The prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis (CA), especially as a cause of heart failure, has significantly increased in recent years. Early detection and accurate assessment of the disease burden are crucial for initiating timely treatment and ensuring precise prognosis. CA primarily results from the infiltration of the myocardium by either immunoglobulin light chain fibrils (AL) or transthyretin fibrils (ATTR), leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy and eventual death if untreated.\nOver the past decade, advancements in diagnostic imaging and heightened clinical awareness have revealed a substantial presence of CA, particularly ATTR, among the elderly. These diagnostic improvements encompass echocardiography, cardiac computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide scintigraphy with bone-avid tracers. Concurrently, significant progress has been made in therapeutic options, with new disease-modifying treatments now available that can dramatically alter the disease trajectory and improve survival rates when administered early. However, despite these advancements, there remains an urgent need for the early and accurate detection of CA to ensure that patients can fully benefit from these emerging therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"078f71cc4c7087bf7a41fe128cb00b71b990e29e59f24b386de212040a8de341","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
