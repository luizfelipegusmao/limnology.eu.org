{"title":"Design and Performance Analysis of a Novel Hollow Core-Based Photonic Crystal Fiber for Edible Oil Sensing in the \nTerahertz (THz) Regime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0728/v1","date":1710253269000,"content":"This work proposes a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber-based edible oil sensor in the terahertz (THz) range (e.g., 1.0THz ≤ f ≤ 3.0THz) and different sensing characteristics are numerically analyzed. The suggested sensor’s performance was assessed by means of COMSOL Multiphysics, a commercial program that uses the finite element approach. The computational results indicate that the relative sensitivity is 85.591%, 84.648%, 82.625%, 82.683%, and 79.161%, respectively, at f = 2.2 THz, for several types of sunflower oil, mustard oil, coconut oil, olive oil and palm oil; and the corresponding effective areas are 7.22×10-8 um2, 7.09×10-8 um2, 6.83×10-8 um2,7.09×10-8 um2, 6.5231 ×10-8 um2. In addition, the effective material loss for sunflower oil, muster oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and palm oil has been found to be 0.02561 cm-1, 0.027054 cm-1, 0.030322 cm-1, 0.028854 cm-1 ,0.035427cm-1 respectively. Moreover, the proposed sensor also has low confinement loss are 1.55×10-8 dB/m, 1.63×10-8 dB/m, 1.31×10-8 dB/m, 1.99×10-8 dB/m, 4.0345×10-8 dB/m.This proposed sensor can be fabricated using extrusion and 3D-printing technologies, and due to its augmented detecting capabilities, it can be a vital part of oil sensing devices implemented in real life such as industry fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34a13972acedad27737981fd59b358fbfec829b2777627dc13bd1aa8bb2c779c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
