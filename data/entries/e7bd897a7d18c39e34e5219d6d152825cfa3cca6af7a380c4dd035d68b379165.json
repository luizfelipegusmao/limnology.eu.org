{"title":"Habitat selection in two species of Eulimidae (Mollusca: Gastropoda) parasitic on the black sea cucumber Holothuria atra","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05417-x","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Parasites exhibit high diversity in various ecosystems. Habitat selection has played an important role in the diversification of parasites by facilitating intra-host speciation and repeated shifts to a single host species by multiple parasite taxa. In this study, we investigated habitat selection in two gastropod species, <em>Melanella</em> cf. <em>acicula</em> and <em>Peasistilifer nitidula</em> (Caenogastropoda: Vanikoroidea: Eulimidae), that are parasitic on the black sea cucumber <em>Holothuria atra</em> in southwestern Japan. The number and position of parasites were observed for 335 hosts; in total, 89 individuals of <em>M</em>. cf. <em>acicula</em> and 194 of <em>P. nitidula</em> were found. <em>Melanella</em> cf. <em>acicula</em> exhibited strong habitat selection, with 70 individuals (78.7%) attached around the hostâ€™s mouth, whereas <em>P. nitidula</em> had relatively low infection site specificity. This suggests that the two parasite species have different feeding habits. Molecular phylogenetic analysis verified their non-monophyletic relationship, indicating that they likely made independent host shifts to <em>H. atra</em>. The observed difference in habitat preference, as well as the abundance of suitable habitats, may have contributed to the repeated host shifts and sympatric distribution of <em>M</em>. cf. <em>acicula</em> and <em>P. nitidula</em>. Our phylogenetic analysis also revealed the non-monophyly of eulimids parasitising holothuroids, as in asteroid and ophiuroid parasitic taxa.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e7bd897a7d18c39e34e5219d6d152825cfa3cca6af7a380c4dd035d68b379165","category":"Environment"}
