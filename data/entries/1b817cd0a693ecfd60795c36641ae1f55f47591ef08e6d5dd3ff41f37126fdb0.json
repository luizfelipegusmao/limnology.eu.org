{"title":"Polyvinyl Acetate Binders Undermine the Effectiveness of Biochar-Based Seed Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1005/v1","date":1715755109000,"content":"Pyrolyzed organic matter – commonly referred to as biochar – generally has positive effects on plant growth and can enhance early seedling development. Biochar-based seed coatings may thus be beneficial, specifically under adverse soil conditions such as high soil salinity. We evaluated germination and early plant development in radish (Raphinus sativa) seeds coated with conifer-feedstock slow-pyrolysis biochar; following the precedent of prior studies, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) was used as the binding agent. Biochar-based seed coatings reduced germination rates and radicle extension in Petri dish trials; however, leaching of coated seeds largely eliminated this effect. PVAc applied in solution inhibited seed germination to a similar extent, suggesting that toxicity of PVAc or chemical products derived from it is the main mechanism for germination inhibition; a meta-analysis of published literature also indicates negative effects of biochar-based seed coatings using PVAc. In greenhouse trials the same biochar seed coatings improved aspects of plant growth and physiological status relative to controls, specifically enhancing root development. We conclude that biochar-based seed coatings have promise in promoting early seedling growth, and in combating salinity stress in agronomic and restoration applications. However, our findings contraindicate PVAc use as a binding agent. Further research is needed to test non-phytotoxic, readily biodegradable binding agents and to optimize biochars and seed coating processes for specific applications in agronomy and ecological restoration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b817cd0a693ecfd60795c36641ae1f55f47591ef08e6d5dd3ff41f37126fdb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
