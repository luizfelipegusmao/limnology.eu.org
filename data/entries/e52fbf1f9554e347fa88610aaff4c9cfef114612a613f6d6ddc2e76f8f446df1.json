{"title":"Framework of Smart and Integrated Household Waste Management System: A Systematic Literature Review Using PRISMA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0297/v1","date":1715042636000,"content":"Household waste is the primary source of environmental pollution due to global population growth compared to other sources of waste. This research aims to develop a smart and integrated household waste management system framework. The resulting framework not only focuses on dimensions of information technology but also links it with other integrated dimensions. This research attempts to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol to produce a smart and integrated household waste management framework. The framework's design is carried out by identifying the type of household waste management process based on the Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM) framework, dimensions that support smart household waste management, and stakeholders involved. The SLR results, namely dimensions and subdimensions that support the framework of a smart and integrated household waste management system, were validated by a resource person from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The smart and integrated household waste management framework that has been developed in this research contains five main dimensions: Information Technology, Operational Infrastructure, Governance, Economy, and Social-culture. This framework also addresses stakeholder engagement to support smart household waste management systems and identifies waste management processes based on the ISWM framework. This research uses the PRISMA technique to provide a framework for smart and integrated household waste management systems in the initial stage. The proposed framework has been validated and can be further developed as a smart and integrated household waste management system. This research also contributes to the involvement of various dimensions identified to deal with waste problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e52fbf1f9554e347fa88610aaff4c9cfef114612a613f6d6ddc2e76f8f446df1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
