{"title":"The best irrigation level for establishment and development of sugarcane pre-sprouted seedlings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0943/v1","date":1718334056000,"content":"In recent years, using pre-sprouted seedlings for sugarcane establishment has been developed in Brazil. Despite yielding promising results, the optimal irrigation management for this method during the Brazilian winter planting season has yet to be determined. Additionally, information regarding water demand and seedling behavior when subjected to different irrigation levels remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the response of pre-sprouted sugarcane seedlings to different irrigation levels during the winter in southeastern Brazil. Pre-sprouted sugarcane seedlings were subjected to different irrigation levels during the winter season in the region of Piracicaba, using a sprinkler irrigation system. Periodic evaluations were conducted, such as seedlings mortality rate, root size, root dry mass, number of sugarcane tillers sprouted per meter, total number of tillers, plant height, leaf area index, shoot dry mass, and total leaf chlorophyll index. The findings of this investigation indicate that a 10 mm irrigation level facilitated optimal fixation depth and achieved a 97.8% survival rate. Moreover, a correlation between seedling mortality rate and irrigation management was observed, emphasizing the critical role of irrigation in establishing and developing seedlings. Based on these findings, a 10 mm irrigation may represent the optimal irrigation strategy for pre-sprouted sugarcane seedlings in this scenario.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40d31832460da3725e5ae48aeaf31ad8f18833a29decc287f449391578d64f5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
