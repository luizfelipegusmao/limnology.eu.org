{"title":"Malaria transmission blocking activity of <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> alanyl aminopeptidase N antigen formulated with MPL, CpG, and QS21 adjuvants","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306664","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Zeinab Pourhashem, Leila Nourani, Sakineh Pirahmadi, Hemn Yousefi, Jafar J.

Subunit recombinant transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) have been proposed as promising vaccines to succeed in malaria elimination and eradication. Here, a provisional study was designed to assess the immunogenicity and functional activity of alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN1) of <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, as a TBV candidate, administered with MPL, CpG, and QS21 adjuvants in the murine model.</p> Methodology/Principal findings <p>The mouse groups were immunized with recombinant APN1 (rAPN1) alone or formulated with CpG, MPL, QS-21, or a combination of adjuvants (CMQ), and the elicited immune responses were evaluated after the third immunization. The standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) measured the functional activity of antibodies against bacterial-expressed APN1 protein in adjuvanted vaccine groups on transmission of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> (NF54) to <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i> mosquitoes. Evaluation of mice vaccinated with rAPN1 formulated with distinct adjuvants manifested a significant increase in the high-avidity level of anti-APN1 IgG and IgG subclasses; however, rAPN1 induced the highest level of high-avidity anti-APN1 IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies in the immunized vaccine group 5 (APN1/CMQ). In addition, vaccine group 5 (receiving APN1/CMQ), had still the highest level of anti-APN1 IgG antibodies relative to other immunized groups after six months, on day 180. The SMFA data indicates a trend towards higher transmission-reducing activity in groups 2 and 5, which received the antigen formulated with CpG or a combination of three adjuvants.</p> Conclusions/Significance <p>The results have shown the capability of admixture to stimulate high-affinity and long-lasting antibodies against the target antigen to hinder <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite development in the mid-gut of <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i>. The attained results authenticated APN1/CMQ and APN1/CpG as a potent APN1-based TBV formulation which will be helpful in designing a vaccine in the future.</p>","author":"Zeinab Pourhashem","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7e1157a726dfdcae8211a951d92d04d66a6e34c650a78e5e40b65532416203b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
