Focht</p>\r\nBackground <p>Accounting for more than 60% of cancer survivors, older (â‰¥65 years) cancer survivors have a 2- to 5-fold risk of physical function impairment, compared to cancer-free peers. One strategy to improve physical function is dietary and resistance training interventions, which improve muscle strength and mass by stimulating muscle protein synthesis. The E-PROOF (E-intervention for Protein Intake and Resistance Training to Optimize Function) study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week randomized controlled trial of an online, tailored nutritional and resistance training education and counseling intervention to improve physical function and associated health outcomes (muscle strength, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-efficacy, and weight management).</p> Methods <p>In this study, 70 older cancer survivors will be randomized to one of two groups: experimental (receiving remote behavioral counseling and evidence-based education and resources), and control (general survivorship education). We will examine the intervention effects on physical function, muscle strength, HRQoL, self-efficacy, weight, and waist circumference during a 12-week period between the experimental and control groups. Three months following the end of the intervention, we will conduct a follow-up assessment to measure physical function, muscle strength, and HRQoL.</p> Significance and impact <p>This study is the first synchronous, online protein-focused diet and resistance training intervention among older cancer survivors. This novel study advances science by promoting independent health behaviors among older cancer survivors to improve health outcomes, and provide foundational knowledge to further address this growing problem on a wider scale through online platforms.</p>","author":"Jessica L.
