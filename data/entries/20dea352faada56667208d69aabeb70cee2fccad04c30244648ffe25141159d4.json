{"title":"Effect of freeze‒thaw cycles on root–Soil composite mechanical properties and slope stability","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302409","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Ruihong Wang, Zexin Jing, Hao Luo, Shun Bao, Jingru Jia, Xiaoyu Zhan</p>\r\n\r\nNatural disasters such as landslides often occur on soil slopes in seasonally frozen areas that undergo freeze‒thaw cycling. Ecological slope protection is an effective way to prevent such disasters. To explore the change in the mechanical properties of soil under the influence of both root reinforcement and freeze‒thaw cycles and its influence on slope stability, the Baijiabao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area was taken as an example. The mechanical properties of soil under different confining pressures, vegetation coverages (VCs) and numbers of freeze‒thaw cycles were studied via mechanical tests, such as triaxial compression tests, wave velocity tests and FLAC3D simulations. The results show that the shear strength of a root–soil composite increases with increasing confining pressure and VC and decreases with increasing number of freeze‒thaw cycles. Bermuda grass roots and confining pressure jointly improve the durability of soil under freeze‒thaw conditions. However, with an increase in the number of freeze‒thaw cycles, the resistance of root reinforcement to freeze‒thaw action gradually decreases. The observed effect of freeze‒thaw cycles on soil degradation was divided into three stages: a significant decrease in strength, a slight decrease in strength and strength stability. Freeze‒thaw cycles and VC mainly affect the cohesion of the soil and have little effect on the internal friction angle. Compared with that of a bare soil slope, the safety factor of a slope covered with plants is larger, the maximum displacement of a landslide is smaller, and it is less affected by freezing and thawing. These findings can provide a reference for research on ecological slope protection technology.","author":"Ruihong Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"20dea352faada56667208d69aabeb70cee2fccad04c30244648ffe25141159d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
