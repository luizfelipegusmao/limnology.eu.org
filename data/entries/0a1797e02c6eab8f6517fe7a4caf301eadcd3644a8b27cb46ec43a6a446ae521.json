{"title":"Fintech adoption in Emerging Economy Using structural Equation Model (SEM) Analysis: Extended UTUAT Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0211/v1","date":1722606884000,"content":"Fintech's emergence is one of the most significant developments in finance, and its application has been of much interest and popularity in recent decades.  This study aims to explore the adoption of fintech in emerging economies by employing a structural equation model. The study's sample population consists of bank clients of Ethiopian commercial banks who have used financial technology platforms for at least one year. The total number of sample sizes is 440. The data collection instrument used for this study is a questionnaire (seven-point likert scales ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Structural equation model (SEM) analysis was implemented using Amos software to examine the relationship between variables. The findings of the study support the hypotheses that various factors, including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, traliaility, and user innovativeness, significantly influence the adoption and usage of fintech services. The study recommends that FinTech companies implement pilot programs to allow potential users to trial FinTech services on a limited basis before full commitment. Fintech industries should engage with local communities through events, seminars, and workshops to introduce fintech services. Having community leaders and respected individuals advocate for the technology can enhance acceptance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a1797e02c6eab8f6517fe7a4caf301eadcd3644a8b27cb46ec43a6a446ae521","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
