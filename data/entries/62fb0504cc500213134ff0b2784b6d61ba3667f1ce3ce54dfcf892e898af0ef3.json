{"title":"Transfusions of Blood Products Derived from Genetic Vaccine Recipients: Safety Concerns and Proposals for Specific Measures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0881/v2","date":1716964399000,"content":"The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, following which a global genetic vaccination program has been rapidly implemented as a fundamental solution. However, it has been reported worldwide that the modified mRNAs encoding spike proteins and lipid nanoparticles, which are used as drug delivery systems, not only cause thrombosis and cardiovascular disorders post vaccination, but might also cause diverse diseases involving all organs and systems, including the nervous system. Furthermore, the toxicity and pathogenicity of spike proteins may necessitate defining these proteins as nonbiological infective material. Based on these reports and the abundant evidence that has come to light in the past few years, this paper aims to draw the attention of medical professionals to the various risks associated with transfusion using blood products derived from long COVID patients or from genetic vaccine recipients, and to make proposals regarding specific inspection items, testing methods, regulations, etc. This paper provides insights to address the post-vaccination syndrome and its consequences following such genetic vaccination programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62fb0504cc500213134ff0b2784b6d61ba3667f1ce3ce54dfcf892e898af0ef3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
