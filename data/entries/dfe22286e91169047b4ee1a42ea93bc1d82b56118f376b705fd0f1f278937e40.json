{"title":"Leveraging Self-Distillation and Disentanglement Network to Enhance Visual-Semantic Feature Consistency in Generalized Zero-Shot Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0672/v1","date":1712728402000,"content":"Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to simultaneously recognize both seen classes and unseen classes by training only on seen class samples and auxiliary semantic descriptions. Recent state-of-the-art methods infer unseen classes based on semantic information or synthesize unseen classes using generative models based on semantic information, all of which rely on the correct alignment of visual-semantic features. However, they often overlook the inconsistency between original visual features and semantic attributes. Additionally, due to the existence of cross-modal dataset biases, the visual features extracted and synthesized by the model may also mismatch with some semantic features, which could hinder the model from properly aligning visual-semantic features. To address this issue, this paper proposes a GZSL framework that enhances the consistency of visual-semantic features using self-distillation and disentanglement network (SDDN). The aim is to utilize self-distillation and disentanglement network to obtain semantically consistent refined visual features and non-redundant semantic features to enhance the consistency of visual-semantic features. Firstly, SDDN utilizes self-distillation technology to refine the extracted and synthesized visual features of the model. Subsequently, the visual-semantic features are then disentangled and aligned using a disentanglement network to enhance the consistency of the visual-semantic features. Finally, the consistent visual-semantic features are fused to jointly train a GZSL classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more competitive results on four challenging benchmark datasets (AWA2, CUB, FLO, and SUN).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfe22286e91169047b4ee1a42ea93bc1d82b56118f376b705fd0f1f278937e40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
