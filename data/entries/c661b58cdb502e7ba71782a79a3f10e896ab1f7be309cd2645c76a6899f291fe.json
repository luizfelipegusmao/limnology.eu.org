{"title":"Ameliorative impacts of astaxanthin against atrazine-induced renal toxicity through the modulation of ionic homeostasis and Nrf2 signaling pathways in mice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae071/7665601?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Astaxanthin (ASX), a red pigment belonging to carotenoids, has antioxidant activity and anti-oxidative stress effect. Atrazine (ATZ), a frequently used herbicide, whose degradation products are the cause for nephrosis and other oxidative stress associated diseases. This study was aimed to reveal the potential protective mechanism of astaxanthin against atrazine-induced nephrosis. Atrazine was orally given (250 mg/kg bw) to the mice along with astaxanthin (100 mg/kg bw) for 28 days. Serum biochemical indicators, oxidative stress biomarkers, ATPase activities, ion concentration, histomorphology, and various renal genes expression linked with apoptosis, Nrf2 signaling pathway, and aquaporins (AQPs) were assessed. It was found that serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and MDA levels were significantly increased after the treatment of atrazine, whereas serum renal oxidative stress indicators like CAT, GSH, T-AOC, SOD decreased. Renal histopathology showed that atrazine significantly damaged renal tissues. The activities of Ca <sup>2+</sup>-Mg <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase were increased whereas Na <sup>+</sup>-K <sup>+</sup>-ATPase decreased significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, results confirmed that the expression of <span>AQPs</span>, <span>Nrf2</span>, and apoptosis genes were also altered after atrazine administration. Interestingly, astaxanthin supplementation significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) improved atrazine-induced nephrotoxicity via decreasing SCr, BUN, oxidative stress, ionic homeostasis and reversing the changes in AQPs, Nrf2, and apoptosis gene expression. These findings collectively suggested that astaxanthin has strong potential ameliorative impact against atrazine induced nephrotoxicity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"c661b58cdb502e7ba71782a79a3f10e896ab1f7be309cd2645c76a6899f291fe","category":"Environment"}
