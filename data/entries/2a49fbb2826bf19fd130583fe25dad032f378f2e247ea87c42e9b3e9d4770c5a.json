However, overuse and improper disposal of ARVDs have been recognized as an emerging concern whereby wastewater treatment major recipients. Therefore, in this work, the activated macadamia nutshells (MCNs) were explored as low-cost adsorbents for the removal of ARVDs in wastewater samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET), and Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The highest removal efficiency (R.E) was above 86% for the selected analytes nevirapine, abacavir, and efavirenz. The maximum adsorption capacity of the functionalized MCN adsorbent was 10.79, 27.44, and 38.17 mg/g for nevirapine, abacavir, and efavirenz for HCl-modified adsorbent. In contrast, NaOH modified had adsorption capacities of 13.67, 14.25, and 20.79 mg/g. The FTIR showed distinct functional groups O<span></span>H and CO, which facilitate the removal of selected ARVDs. From studying kinetics parameters, the pseudo-second-order (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.990–0.996) was more dominant than the pseudo-first-order (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.872–0.994). The experimental data was most fitted in the Freundlich model with (R<sup>2</sup> close to 1). The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. The study indicated that MCNs are an eco-friendly, low-cost, and effective adsorbent for the removal of nevirapine, abacavir, and efavirenz.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nModification macadamia nutshell with HCl and NaOH improved physio-chemical properties that yielded high removal efficiency compared with raw macadamia nutshells.\nModification of macadamia by HCl showed high removal efficiency, which could be attributed to high interaction such as H-bonding that improves adsorption.\nThe macadamia nutshell as an adsorbent showed so much robustness with regeneration studies yielding to about 69.64% of selected compounds.\n</p>","author":"Lindokuhle Simelane, \nPrecious Mahlambi, \nSebastien Rochat, \nBen Baker","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"2a49fbb2826bf19fd130583fe25dad032f378f2e247ea87c42e9b3e9d4770c5a","category":"Environment"}
