{"title":"New Insights into the Force Released by Superelastic Orthodontic Wires. Part I: Force vs Deflection Diagrams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1326/v1","date":1721164657000,"content":"(1) Background: A wide literature based on loading and unloading bending tests has been carried out over the half past century for assessing the force released by superelastic wires. The aim of this investigation is not only to characterize a broadly described superelastic NiTi and a novel CuNiTi archwire, but also to provide novel insights into the load vs deflection profiles. A harmonic scenario for superelastic wires will be shown as temperature is kept constant at 37°C. However, a completely different picture will be highlighted as a temporary heating step up to 50°C is introduced within the force vs deflection profiles. (2) Methods: A variety of NiTi and a novel CuNiTi round and rectangular cross-section archwires have been investigated. Static 3-point bending tests up to a deflection level of 3.0 mm have been carried out for detecting the unloading force plateau levels occurring at 37°C. A hold deflection step of 5 min at deflection levels occurring along the unloading plateau extension is introduced. The effect of a temporary heating up to 50°C on the force plateau level released by the investigated wires is analyzed. (3) Results: Mechanical profiles suggest that the plateau force levels detected at 37°C are consistent with those broadly reported in the literature, but they only represent a single block puzzle of the force scenario that a superelastic wire releases during the orthodontic treatment. (4) Conclusions: Once a superelastic wire is bent and clinically applied, the effect of a temporary heating up to 50°C (e.g. hot food or drink ingestion) produces a significant plateau force increase whose magnitude depends on the deflection level. The highest force increase of about 50% and 40% have been detected at deflection levels located at the beginning of the unloading plateau extension for NiTi and CuNiTi wires, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b006bb3f8560c2bd0babbf8678c77188e0ca84d203d351611f881327a92db08b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
