{"title":"Optimizing water use efficiency in greenhouse cucumber cultivation: A comparative study of intelligent irrigation systems","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311699","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Faeze Behzadipour, Mahmoud Ghasemi-Nejad-Raeini, Saman Abdanan Mehdizadeh, Morteza Taki, Bijan Khalili Moghadam, Mohammad Reza Zare Bavani</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigated the use of an intelligent irrigation system for greenhouse cucumber cultivation, aiming to manage water consumption efficiently. During the initial phase, irrigation was tested at four levels: 80%, 90%, and 100% of Field Capacity (FC), and Conventional Flood Irrigation (CFI). Data on environmental conditions and water usage were meticulously recorded. Optimal yields and crop quality (measured by size and firmness) were achieved at CFI and 100% FC, with CFI consuming the most water (0.148 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) Consequently, 100% FC was identified as the best practice, informing the intelligent systemâ€™s calibration in the subsequent phase. This adjustment resulted in reduced water consumption and a 15.6% improvement in Water Use Efficiency (WUE) over CFI. Additionally, by examining the product performance and the color characteristics, chlorophyll content, and photosynthesis of the leaves, it was observed that the quality and optimal water supply and the product performance were maintained in the smart irrigation system. The study concludes that, considering long-term outcomes, the intelligent irrigation system is preferable to CFI, offering significant water savings and enhanced WUE without compromising crop quality.","author":"Faeze Behzadipour","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b4e7c7b41a9b9101b8ca3e1165e95df217df2e9de791f8ddadfc4bb0dd2d7242","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
