{"title":"Not on the right rung for me? How status inconsistency leads to avoidance of status-threatening ties in NCAA","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308352","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Keehyuk Ra, Bo Kyung Kim</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examines the impact of status inconsistency on status-threatening activities within NCAA Division I men’s basketball teams. Specifically, we focus on a nested form of status that includes both individual and group-level elements. We argue that organizations dealing with status inconsistency stemming from such nested form face challenges in reducing status inconsistency. To maintain their deserved status, these status-inconsistent organizations tend to avoid activities that could further threaten their status, despite potential economic gains. An analysis of NCAA Division I men’s basketball scheduling data from 2000 to 2019 provides robust support to our theoretical arguments. Our findings suggest that the status inconsistency between a team’s status and its conference status diminished the likelihood of scheduling games with non-Division I teams, a behavior considered counter-normative in this context. This effect is most prominent among teams in “Mid Major” conferences, while teams with recent participation in the NCAA Tournament show a mitigated effect.","author":"Keehyuk Ra","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c18827f847e82ae0cf548937d804d68d103227c212b98fff9e678b0391e2538a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
