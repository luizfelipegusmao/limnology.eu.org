{"title":"An Examination of the Physical Proximity of Learning in Shaping Students&rsquo; Mastery of Technology-Enhanced Mathematics and Science Concepts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1894/v1","date":1721825040000,"content":"The fast-paced advancements in the technological space and its application have influenced greatly its usage in teaching especially in science and mathematics subjects. The overall objective of this study was to examine the physical proximity of learning in shaping students’ mastery of technology-enhanced mathematics and science concepts. Consequently, the study investigates how technology can promote teaching presence toward the mastery of mathematics and science concepts and how the latter can be grasped by the learners using physical proximity strategies. This research study used a mixed-method research design and was conducted in Kayonza District (Eastern Province) and Gasabo District (Kigali), Rwanda. The participants were postgraduate students at the University of Rwanda, College of Education undertaking a master degree in chemistry education, mathematics education, physics education and biology education under the Africa Centre of Excellence for Innovative Teaching and Learning Mathematics and Science. A sample size of 88 students was selected from both Remera and Rukara campuses. Participants were in a range of 21-40 years old. The study used both interviews and questionnaires to collect empirical data. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis while quantitative data was analyzed using R software. The study reveals that a virtual lab is a vital tool in promoting teaching presence regarding the mastery of mathematics and science concepts. The use of virtual labs seems to foster instructional design and organization from teachers. Moreover, virtual labs seem to facilitate meaningful discourses, interactions between learners and between the learners and the teacher. The findings show also that virtual visualizing seems also to play a role in direct instruction where the teacher offers guidance and direction to learners on various subjects or issues of contention that may need the clarity. Thus 87.6% of the respondents affirm that technology integration in learning is efficient in bridging the gap of physical proximity among learners and teachers through various virtual instruments and platforms. The study also demonstrates that various forms of technology that can be used to bring mathematics and science concepts to the learners’ physical proximity including WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Zoom and Webex. The study therefore recommends that visualization should be integrated in the curricula, training of teachers and students to maximize physical proximity components and sharing of best practices among teachers and students.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aebd7915099ea12a64667ae0a8b4798c6a9f8ff5152dad523475a0af477a3006","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
