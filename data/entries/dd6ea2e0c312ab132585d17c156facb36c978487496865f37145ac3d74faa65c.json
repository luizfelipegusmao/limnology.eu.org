{"title":"Effects of Defoliation Frequency on Biomass Production on Selected Drought Tolerant Forage Legumes Intercropped with (Chloris gayana): Drought Mitigation Strategy and Solutions Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1098/v1","date":1713358151000,"content":"AbstraIncorporating knowledge of indigenous forage legumes or associated nutritional attributes in cultivated pastures has the potential to improve grazing conditions, rangeland conditions, and cattle productivity. Climate change and other site-specific factors such as land sizes and other grazing management practices play a significant role in food security, job creation, and environmental health. Several research results have reported that the utilization of forage legumes in most farming systems has proved to increase herbage yield and soil fertility. The major aim of this review is to elucidate the potential benefits of intercropping indigenous forage legumes such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculacta L.Walp) and Dolichols (Lablab purpureaus) intercropped with Chloris gayana, this is to assesses the principal advantages, productivity, and overall performance of forage legumes grown in conjunction with grasses. Moreover, this review seeks to provide insights into the optimal management practices for intercropping forage legumes with grasses. The promising feature of intercropping South African pastoral systems must target the ability of forage legumes in terms of performance and utilization of agro-symbiotic relationships of N2 fixation symbiotic relationship in pastures. Moreover, this review aims also to address this knowledge gap by assessing the effects of defoliation frequency on the biomass production of selected forage legumes when intercropped with Chloris gayana in different growing seasons. By examining how varying defoliation frequencies influence biomass production, this review aimed to provide practical recommendations for optimizing forage management practices and promoting sustainable forage production systems. Through this investigation, we can gain insights into the complex dynamics between the defoliation frequency, intercropping systems, and biomass production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd6ea2e0c312ab132585d17c156facb36c978487496865f37145ac3d74faa65c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
