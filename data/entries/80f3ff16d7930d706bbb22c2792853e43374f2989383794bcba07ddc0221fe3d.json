{"title":"Mitigating the Effects of Facility Decline at the Local Level through Spatial Planning: A Case Study of the Municipality of Knjaževac, Serbia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1542/v1","date":1724225226000,"content":"One of the main challenges associated with spatial entities affected by potentially irreversible adverse development processes (depopulation and related changes in the population structure, economic difficulties, declining accessibility and quality of services, etc.) is coping with their consequences – taking a planned approach (as opposed to passive observation of spontaneous developments) towards mitigating adverse effects on the quality of life of the local population. Public services (healthcare, education, culture, etc.), as a fundamental human need in modern society, but also a warranty of a certain level of living quality, are particularly important in such areas. Apparently, it is necessary to accept the closing of a number of facilities as a reality, and to take a planned approach seeking to mitigate the negative effects on the life of the local population. This is a context of our research, where these services are taken as a universal human right and striving for their equitable availability as a goal of national spatial development policies. The starting point in our analysis of this issue observed through the lens of the Serbian national legal and planning framework is the spatial plan of a local self-government unit as the basic platform for defining and operationalising spatial development policies at the local level. It has been examined whether it would be possible to use the mathematical modelling of optimal spatial solutions as support in making decisions that would minimise the negative effects of the closure of a number of public service facilities. The results for the selected research area and the network of primary healthcare facilities show that it is possible to stabilise the accessibility of these facilities by modelling the spatial organisation of primary healthcare despite the expected closure of as much as one-third of the facilities, while any other solution would give more or less unfavourable results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80f3ff16d7930d706bbb22c2792853e43374f2989383794bcba07ddc0221fe3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
