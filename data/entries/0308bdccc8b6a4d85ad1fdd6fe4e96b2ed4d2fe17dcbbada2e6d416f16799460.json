{"title":"Optimal Sleep as a Determinant of Healthy Lifespan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0643/v1","date":1712647830000,"content":"Sleep is an essential component of a healthy lifespan, influencing both physical and mental well-being along with good quality of life. Adequate sleep quality and quantity are associated with a host of health advantages, including enhanced immune function, learning and memory, emotional well-being, and cardiovascular health. Chronic sleep deprivation, or poor sleep quality, is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, including an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, depression, cancer, and even premature death. One compelling argument in favor of sleep as a predictor of a healthy lifespan is its effect on cellular repair and regeneration. During sleep, the body goes through important activities such as tissue repair, muscular growth, and memory consolidation. Sleep also helps the brain eliminate toxins and metabolic waste, which contributes to its optimal functioning. Without adequate sleep, these important processes are jeopardized, resulting in accelerated aging and greater susceptibility to chronic illnesses. Furthermore, sleep is essential for maintaining hormone balance, particularly those involved in appetite regulation and metabolism. Sleep disturbances can disrupt the regulation of these hormones, resulting in weight gain, metabolic diseases, and, ultimately, a shorter life span. Finally, prioritizing optimal sleep is pivotal for increasing longevity and general health. Emphasizing the importance of sleep hygiene and treating sleep-related dysfunctions should be part of the modern approach to extending healthy life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0308bdccc8b6a4d85ad1fdd6fe4e96b2ed4d2fe17dcbbada2e6d416f16799460","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
