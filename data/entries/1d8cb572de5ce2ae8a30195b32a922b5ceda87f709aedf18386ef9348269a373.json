{"title":"Study on the Safety Characteristics of Different Types of Pepper (Capsicum L.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1836/v1","date":1716888544000,"content":"The research was aimed at comparing the fire characteristics of different types of pepper in the context of designing explosion prevention. The following characteristics were studied: explosion pressure pmax and Kst at selected concentrations, ignition temperature of the deposited dust layer from the hot surface and minimum initiation energy. The comparison of the chemical properties of the used types of pepper was performed using TG/DSC. Results of the measurements suggest that different types of peppers exhibit different explosion characteristics. Each of the samples reached the maximum value of the explosion pressure, and their rate of pressure rise increased at different concentrations. The volume of the explosion chamber used also influenced the explosion characteristics. It is a consequence of the fact that the explosion characteristics strongly depend on the mechanism of action of a particular igniter. The minimum effect on the safety characteristics was observed when measuring the minimum initiation energy and the minimum ignition temperature of dust layer from the hot surface. The results of the measurements suggest that different types of peppers exhibit different explosion characteristics. This information should then be considered in explosion prevention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d8cb572de5ce2ae8a30195b32a922b5ceda87f709aedf18386ef9348269a373","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
