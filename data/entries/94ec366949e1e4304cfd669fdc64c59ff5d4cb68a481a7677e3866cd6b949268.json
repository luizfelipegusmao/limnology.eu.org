{"title":"Validation of Two Instruments for the Measurement of Dehu-manization and Self-dehumanization in Healthcare Settings.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2289/v1","date":1722324002000,"content":"Understanding and addressing dehumanization in healthcare is crucial due to its pro-found impact on patient care, ethical implications on patient dignity and autonomy, and its potential to affect the psychological well-being of healthcare professionals. The primary aim of this study was to establish reliable and valid instruments measuring two different types of dehumanization, namely animalistic dehumanization (i.e., stripping one of their uniquely human characteristics) and mechanistic dehumanization (i.e., stripping one of their human nature characteristics) among healthcare professionals. In a cross-sectional validation study among healthcare professionals, we tested measures of both animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization, focusing on dehumanization of patients (hetero-dehumanization) and oneself (self-dehumanization), respectively. All measures were developed and validated based on a concept analysis, a literature review, and an appraisal of pre-existing scales. The research was conducted among 400 nurses and medical doctors employed in Greek public hospitals. Coefficient Validity Ratio re-sults showed that 100% of items were acceptable for both measures. The newly estab-lished and validated hetero-dehumanization scale encompassed two-factors (factor 1: animalistic dehumanization, factor 2: mechanistic dehumanization, Cronbach’s alpha was equal to 0.86 for each measure). The self-dehumanization scale was a mono-factorial measure mechanistic dehumanization (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.97). Two validated measures of (self and hetero-) animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization measures were developed for the assessment of dehumanization among health profes-sionals, which will form the basis for future research in this important scientific field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94ec366949e1e4304cfd669fdc64c59ff5d4cb68a481a7677e3866cd6b949268","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
