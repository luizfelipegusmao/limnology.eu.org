{"title":"A Systemic Model for Resilience and Time Management in Healthcare Academia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1862/v1","date":1714379102000,"content":"Academics in healthcare grapple with the challenge of efficiently managing time while addressing diverse roles and responsibilities, leading to heightened levels of anxiety and stress within the academic community. The primary objective of this study is to offer a sustainable and systemic solution to the prevalent time-management challenges in healthcare academia, through the development of a predictive model. Employing systemic analysis software and adopting a systemic management approach, we crafted a model to address academic time-management concerns. The dynamics of time allocation for academicians are governed by three fundamental pillars: teaching, research, and administrative tasks. Significantly prioritizing administrative tasks depletes valuable academic time, making time management within academia excessively costly. This occurs as highly skilled individuals find themselves diverted towards administrative duties at the expense of their academic roles diminishing resilience levels. The proposed Timebooster Academic Systemic Model (TASM) advocates for the cultivation of soft skills in academia, en-compassing prioritization, seeking assistance, and addressing tendencies of perfectionism and procrastination. Additionally, TASM recommends the implementation of full automation, delegation of administrative responsibilities, and the mitigation of both overt and covert time-consuming elements. Furthermore, TASM reports on the pivotal role of the academic resilient manager-leaders, who actively contribute to their own satisfaction and academic growth by enhancing collaboration and teamwork. Time-management challenges emerge as a critical determinant of academic well-being and resilience. Systemic models, exemplified by TASM, offer a valuable framework for investigating prioritization concerns, identifying administrative impediments in academic processes, and managing low-value time-consuming elements. The TASM model, along with the systemic philosophy underpinning its design, presents an avenue for advancing the exploration of time-management phenomena within the context of healthcare academia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa54872706ee5d7a76cce4f21238c40da41441c897881c87b5c2d713aacc2c3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
