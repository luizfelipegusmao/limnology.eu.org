{"title":"Size‐based indicators of unexploited deep‐sea community in the Colombian Caribbean Sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12720?af=R","date":1720414733000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Composition, size distribution, structure, and function of deep-sea marine communities must be understood before they are impacted by anthropogenic effects. The deep-sea ecosystem of the Colombian Caribbean Sea is unexploited with no fishing activity ever registered. We quantified the current state of the marine community using body size distribution (size-spectra), size-based indicators, minimum length (L<sub>MIN</sub>), maximum length (L<sub>MAX</sub>), average length (L<sub>mean</sub>), standard deviation of length (L<sub>SD</sub>), 10th and 90th percentiles of the length distribution, Shannon–Wiener diversity (<i>H</i>′), and Pielou's evenness (<i>J</i>′) to generate a baseline of potential ecological indicators that contribute to management and conservation of the Colombian bento-demersal community of deep-sea marine ecosystem. Sampling was in the Colombian Caribbean Sea at 58 stations during four samplings in August and December 2009, 21 stations in March and May 2010, and 45 stations from August to December 2020, using the swept area method, at depths of 200–550 m. Catches included &gt;50% families and species of fish, followed by 27 families (30%) and 33 and species (37%) of crustaceans. Chondrichthyes included 14% families and 9–11% species. Cephalopods included 2–3% families and 1–4% species. Size-spectra analysis confirmed expected values for unexploited communities in three sampling years for teleostei, crustacea, and whole community.</p>","author":"Jorge Paramo, \nDaniel Pérez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"70a978d90e68e5b882aeed59c8e52a32ebab853afd83bf3e7f1bd2f4d644dad0","category":"Environment"}
