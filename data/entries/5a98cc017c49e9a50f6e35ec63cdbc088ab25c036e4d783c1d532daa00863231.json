{"title":"Patient perceptions of the impact of inducible laryngeal obstruction on quality of life","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307002","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Katherine M. McConville, Susan L. Thibeault</p>\r\nBackground <p>Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) accounts for or contributes to dyspnea in a noteworthy proportion of treatment seeking populations including those misdiagnosed with asthma. Despite increasing awareness of the disorder, literature exploring patient experience is limited. The aim of this work is to report patient perspectives on ILO and the way in which it impacts quality of life.</p> Methods <p>This qualitative study utilized methods detailed in the literature on grounded theory and phenomenological research to analyze interviews collected from participants diagnosed with ILO. Interviews were conducted, audio recorded, and transcribed. Transcriptions underwent content-analysis using Burnard’s 14 step method [15], which included review of content codes across multiple raters until consensus regarding analyses was reached.</p> Results <p>Twenty-six participants were included in the study. Most participants were female (92%). Ages ranged from 18–72 with a mean age of 45 for female participants and 37 for male participants. Without specific prompting to do so, all participants offered descriptions of the specific symptoms they experienced and the triggers for their symptoms. In the content analysis process, \"descriptions of symptoms and triggers” was thus labeled a theme that was present in all interviews. Seven additional themes were shared consistently and judged to encapsulate the interview material. These themes were: 2) <i>diagnosis and treatment</i>, <i>3) emotional impact of ILO</i>, <i>4) perception of health and prognosis</i>, <i>5) ameliorating factors</i>, <i>6) influence of ILO on lifestyle</i>, <i>7) the physical impact of ILO</i>, and 8), <i>social consequences of ILO</i>. In addition, 54 subthemes were identified.</p> Conclusions <p>Patients appear to place particular emphasis on the emotional and psychosocial consequences of ILO as well as factors that ameliorate the condition. As such, future efforts to treat ILO and to collect outcomes measures should account for these aspects of the patient experience.</p>","author":"Katherine M.
