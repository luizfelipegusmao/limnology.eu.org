{"title":"Exploring the Influence of Corporate Social Responsibility on Supply Chain Sustainability in Renewable Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1888/v1","date":1716902285000,"content":"This qualitative research explores the influence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on supply chain sustainability within the renewable energy sector. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, key themes and patterns are identified, shedding light on the complex dynamics and interrelationships inherent in CSR practices and their impact on supply chain sustainability. The findings highlight the critical role of CSR in driving environmental sustainability, social equity, economic viability, governance mechanisms, and technological innovation across renewable energy supply chains. Environmental sustainability emerges as a priority, with CSR initiatives focusing on reducing carbon emissions, promoting clean energy technologies, and adopting sustainable sourcing strategies. Social equity is emphasized through stakeholder consultation, transparent decision-making, and investments in community development. Economic viability is addressed through considerations of brand reputation, financial performance, and regulatory compliance. Governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in shaping CSR practices, with collaborative partnerships and policy advocacy driving industry-wide change. Technological innovation, particularly the integration of blockchain, IoT, and AI, enhances transparency, traceability, and accountability in supply chains. The study concludes by discussing theoretical implications, practical insights, limitations, and avenues for future research, highlighting the importance of CSR in promoting sustainable development in the renewable energy sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0e7711534273259d8dec3bd03c912ce4747eeafbb5b9108933364e2e4e4dabb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
