{"title":"Research on the impact of digitalization on green development: An empirical analysis from the low-carbon strategy perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300288","date":1709906400000,"content":"<p>by Jiehui Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nWith the collision between the green and low-carbon economy and the accelerating digital economy, how to realize the effect of \"1+1&gt;2\" has gradually become an important topic for contributing to the high-quality development of regions and enterprises. Entrepreneurship in the digital age continues to exhibit new characteristics, and its impact on green development is also more closely related. This article focuses on the context of the low-carbon strategy, incorporating the digitalization level, entrepreneurship, and green development into the same framework. It then takes 2011–2021 Chinese provincial panel data and enterprise panel data as samples to conduct research. The results indicate the following: (1) The digitalization level has a significant positive promoting effect on the green development of regions and enterprises, and blockchain technology has the strongest promoting effect on the green development of enterprises. (2) The digitalization level drives the green development of regions and enterprises through three channels: entrepreneurs’ innovative spirit, entrepreneurs’ entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurs’ contract spirit. Entrepreneurship is the intermediary bridge for the digitalization level to promote green development. (3) Environmental regulations partially serve as \"accelerators\" of the impact of green development. The findings of this article will provide empirical support for evaluating the impact of digitalization on green development and offer useful insights for better stimulating and cultivating entrepreneurship in the new era to empower comprehensive green development.","author":"Jiehui Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8dd5e7bb4f419bb551a2bf362159f11fce021e9eea20cb3975f0dc4b2d842b8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
