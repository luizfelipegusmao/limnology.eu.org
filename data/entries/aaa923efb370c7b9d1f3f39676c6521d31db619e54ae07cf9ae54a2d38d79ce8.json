{"title":"Phytochemical and Pharmacological Research in Ajuga reptans L. Herb Extracts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0738/v1","date":1728610413000,"content":"The genus Ajuga (Lamiaceae family) comprises approximately 300 species. Species within this genus are widely used in traditional medicine and are known for their diaphoretic, antiseptic, hemostatic, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, they are scarcely used in official medicine. Therefore, the study of one of the most common species, Ajuga reptans L., holds promise for developing new medicinal products for clinical and pharmaceutical applications. In aqueous and aqueous-alcoholic extracts of A. reptans herb, 8 organic acids, 16 amino acids, 20 phenolic compounds, 10 volatile substances, and 9 phytosterols were identified. The assay of the main groups of biologically active substances in the obtained extracts was determined. Experimental results demonstrated that A. reptans herb extracts are practically non-toxic, exhibit hepatoprotective activity in experimental carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatitis, moderate anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced oedema models, and possess significant local hemostatic and wound-healing properties. The most significant reduction in bleeding was caused by applying the aqueous extract, reducing bleeding time by 40.6%. The aqueous-ethanolic A. reptans extract (50% ethanol) demonstrated complete wound healing after 9 days of its local administration. This extract also has the most pronounced hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. A. reptans extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms and showing higher activity against gram-positive bacteria. Notably, the antimicrobial activity of the extracts increases in direct correlation with the ethanol concentration as an extracting agent. A. reptans herb extracts are promising agents for implementation in official medicine as wound healing and hepatoprotective remedies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaa923efb370c7b9d1f3f39676c6521d31db619e54ae07cf9ae54a2d38d79ce8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
