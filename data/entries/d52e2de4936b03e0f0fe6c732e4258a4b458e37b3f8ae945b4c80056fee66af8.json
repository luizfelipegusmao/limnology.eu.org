{"title":"Knowledge-Based Fuzzy Control System for Automatic Transmission with Human-Sensitive Inputs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0818/v2","date":1724408374000,"content":"With the increasing use of automatic transmissions in passenger vehicles, there is a growing need for improved gear shifting control strategies that aim to enhance performance and fuel efficiency. This paper introduces a knowledge-based fuzzy control system designed specifically for automatic transmissions in light vehicles. The proposed system utilizes a fuzzy inference system as the controller, enabling the emulation of the driverâ€™s perceptions during the gear shifting process. Consequently, the input signal consists of variables that are either sensitive to or observable by the driver, while the output represents the selected gear. The paper evaluates three distinct control strategies, each based on different inputs. These inputs include the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle, the angular velocity of the engine, or a combination of both, along with the time-derivative of the throttle valve opening. Through the evaluation, it is observed that the combination of inputs yields significantly improved performance. Therefore, the methodology presented in this paper demonstrates that the combined input approach is more effective for gear shifting control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d52e2de4936b03e0f0fe6c732e4258a4b458e37b3f8ae945b4c80056fee66af8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
