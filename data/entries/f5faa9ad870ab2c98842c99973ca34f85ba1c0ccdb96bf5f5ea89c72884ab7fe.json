{"title":"When You Think of and Identify Yourself as a Nurse, You Will Become More Deontological and Less Utilitarian","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1942/v1","date":1714459544000,"content":"This study aims to examine how the activation of nursing roles and professional identification as a nurse can influence moral judgments in terms of deontological and utilitarian inclinations. In Study 1, a priming technique was used to assess the impact of activating the nursing concept on moral reasoning. Participants were randomly assigned to either a nursing prime or neutral prime condition. By using a scrambled-sentences task, participants were prompted to think about nursing-related or neutral thoughts. Following the priming task, participants were asked to respond to 20 moral dilemmas. The process dissociation approach was employed to measure the degree of deontological and utilitarian tendencies in their moral reasoning. In Study 2, participants completed the nursing profession identification scale and the moral orientation scale before engaging in moral judgments similar to those in Study 1. The findings revealed that priming the concept of nursing roles resulted in an increase in deontological clinical inclinations, while having no significant effect on utilitarian inclinations. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between identification with the nursing profession and deontological clinical inclinations, whereas a negative correlation was found with utilitarian inclinations. Deliberation orientation acted as a complete mediator in the relationship between nursing professional identification and deontological tendencies, and as a partial mediator for utilitarian tendencies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5faa9ad870ab2c98842c99973ca34f85ba1c0ccdb96bf5f5ea89c72884ab7fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
