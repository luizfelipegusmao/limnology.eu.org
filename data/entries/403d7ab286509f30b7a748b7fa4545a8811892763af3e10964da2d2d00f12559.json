{"title":"Secured Artificial Intelligence Based Face Anti-spoofing Detection Model via Serverless Architecture and SaaS Based Cloud Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0740/v1","date":1725951624000,"content":"As the adoption of deep learning models continues to surge across various applications, the need for efficient deployment architectures becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the deployment of deep learning models by leveraging serverless architecture. Serverless computing has been popular for its auto-scaling, cost-effectiveness, and simplified management characteristics. However, the intense resource demands of deep learning models pose challenges in maintaining low response times and effective load balancing within serverless environments. The proposed architecture addresses these challenges by integrating principles from both deep learning model optimization and serverless computing. Through systematic experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate that by appropriately designing and tuning the deployment architecture, significant improvements in response time, performance, resource utilization, and load distribution can be achieved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"403d7ab286509f30b7a748b7fa4545a8811892763af3e10964da2d2d00f12559","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
