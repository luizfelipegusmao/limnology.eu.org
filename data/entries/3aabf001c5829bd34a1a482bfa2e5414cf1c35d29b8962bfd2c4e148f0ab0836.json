{"title":"Highly-Sensitive Measure of Complexity Captures Boolean Networks Regimes and Temporal Order More Optimally","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1569/v1","date":1711444033000,"content":"In this work, several random Boolean networks (RBN) are generated and analyzed from two characteristics: their time evolution diagram and their transition diagram. To do this, its randomness is estimated using three metrics, of which algorithmic complexity is the only one capable of revealing both transitions towards the chaotic regime and the algorithmic contribution of certain states to the transition diagram and their relationship with the order they occupy in the temporal evolution of the respective RBN.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3aabf001c5829bd34a1a482bfa2e5414cf1c35d29b8962bfd2c4e148f0ab0836","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
