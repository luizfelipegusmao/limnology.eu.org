{"title":"Single-plant-omics reveals the cascade of transcriptional changes during the vegetative-to-reproductive transition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4594/7731080?rss=1","date":1723161600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants undergo rapid developmental transitions, which occur contemporaneously with gradual changes in physiology. Moreover, individual plants within a population undergo developmental transitions asynchronously. Single-plant-omics has the potential to distinguish between transcriptional events that are associated with these binary and continuous processes. Furthermore, we can use single-plant-omics to order individual plants by their intrinsic biological age, providing a high-resolution transcriptional time series. We performed RNA-seq on leaves from a large population of wild-type Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) during the vegetative-to-reproductive transition. Though most transcripts were differentially expressed between bolted and unbolted plants, some regulators were more closely associated with leaf size and biomass. Using a pseudotime inference algorithm, we determined that some senescence-associated processes, such as the reduction in ribosome biogenesis, were evident in the transcriptome before a bolt was visible. Even in this near-isogenic population, some variants are associated with developmental traits. These results support the use of single-plant-omics to uncover rapid transcriptional dynamics by exploiting developmental asynchrony.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"5a6418be24ef8ee2392cce24895eee8e4b8606e242f7468bce7c4a8d74b86fc4","category":"Environment"}
