{"title":"Identifying areas of Australia with high out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence and low bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates: A retrospective, observational study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301176","date":1713880800000,"content":"<p>by Tan Doan, Stuart Howell, Stephen Ball, Judith Finn, Peter Cameron, Emma Bosley, Bridget Dicker, Steven Faddy, Ziad Nehme, Natalie Heriot, Andy Swain, Melanie Thorrowgood, Andrew Thomas, Samuel Perillo, Mike McDermott, Tony Smith, Karen Smith, Jason Belcher, Janet Bray, on behalf of the Aus-ROC OHCA Epistry Management Committee </p>\r\nAim <p>This study aims to explore regional variation and identify regions within Australia with high incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and low rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p> Method <p>Adult OHCAs of presumed medical aetiology occurring across Australia between 2017 and 2019 were mapped onto local government areas (LGA) using the location of arrest coordinates. Bayesian spatial models were applied to provide “smoothed” estimates of OHCA incidence and bystander CPR rates (for bystander-witnessed OHCAs) for each LGA. For each state and territory, high-risk LGAs were defined as those with an incidence rate greater than the state or territory’s 75<sup>th</sup> percentile and a bystander CPR rate less than the state or territory’s 25<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p> Results <p>A total of 62,579 OHCA cases attended by emergency medical services across 543 LGAs nationwide were included in the study. Nationally, the OHCA incidence rate across LGA ranged from 58.5 to 198.3 persons per 100,000, while bystander CPR rates ranged from 45% to 75%. We identified 60 high-risk LGAs, which were predominantly located in the state of New South Wales. Within each region, high-risk LGAs were typically located in regional and remote areas of the country, except for four metropolitan areas–two in Adelaide and two in Perth.</p> Conclusions <p>We have identified high-risk LGAs, characterised by high incidence and low bystander CPR rates, which are predominantly in regional and remote areas of Australia. Strategies for reducing OHCA and improving bystander response may be best targeted at these regions.</p>","author":"Tan Doan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6175a7223a7a45147487ee205fc6171dd64eed575805f3dd09b1f6d636dbde8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
