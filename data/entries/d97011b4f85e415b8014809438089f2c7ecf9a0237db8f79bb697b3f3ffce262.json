Diagnosing epilepsy in children can be very challenging, especially as it often coexists with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism and ADHD. Functional brain networks obtained from neuroimaging and electrophysiological data in wakefulness and sleep have been shown to contain signatures of neurological disorders, and can potentially support the diagnosis and management of co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions. In this work, we use electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from children, in restful wakefulness and sleep, to extract functional connectivity networks in different frequency bands. We explore the relationship of these networks with epilepsy diagnosis and with measures of neurodevelopmental traits, obtained from questionnaires used as screening tools for autism and ADHD. We explore differences in network markers between children with and without epilepsy in wake and sleep, and quantify the correlation between such markers and measures of neurodevelopmental traits. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the interplay between epilepsy and neurodevelopmental traits when exploring network markers of epilepsy.","author":"Leandro Junges","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d97011b4f85e415b8014809438089f2c7ecf9a0237db8f79bb697b3f3ffce262","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
