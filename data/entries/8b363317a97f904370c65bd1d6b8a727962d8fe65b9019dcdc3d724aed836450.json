{"title":"Navigating the COVID-19 Therapeutic Landscape: Unveiling Novel Perspectives on FDA-Approved Medications, Vaccination Targets, and Emerging Novel Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2409/v1","date":1727689129000,"content":"Amidst the ongoing global challenge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the quest for effective antiviral medications remains paramount. This comprehensive review delves into the dynamic landscape of FDA-approved medications repurposed for COVID-19, categorized as antiviral and non-antiviral agents. Our focus extends beyond conventional narratives, encompassing vaccination targets, repurposing efficacy, clinical studies, innovative treatment modalities, and future outlooks. Unveiling the genomic intricacies of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the WHO-designated Omicron variant, we explore diverse antiviral categories such as Fusion inhibitors, Protease inhibitors, Transcription inhibitors, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Nucleoside reverse transcriptase, and non-antiviral interventions like Importin α/β1-mediated nuclear import inhibitors, Neutralizing antibodies and convalescent plasma. Notably, Molnupiravir emerges as a pivotal player, now licensed in the UK. This review offers a fresh perspective on the historical evolution of COVID-19 therapeutics, from repurposing endeavors to the latest developments in oral anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments, ushering in a new era of hope in the battle against the pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b363317a97f904370c65bd1d6b8a727962d8fe65b9019dcdc3d724aed836450","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
