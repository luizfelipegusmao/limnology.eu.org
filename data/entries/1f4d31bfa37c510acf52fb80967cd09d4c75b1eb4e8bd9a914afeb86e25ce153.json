{"title":"Effect of Dielectric Constant on the Zeta Potential of Spherical Electric Double Layers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0012/v1","date":1711959099000,"content":"Zeta potential refers to the electrokinetic potential present in colloidal systems, exerting significant influence on the diverse properties of nano-drug delivery systems. The impact of dielectric constant on the zeta potential and charge inversion of highly charged colloidal particles, immersed in a variety of solvents spanning from polar, such as water, to nonpolar solvents, and in the presence of multivalent salts, was investigated through primitive model Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Zeta potential Î¾ is decreased as decreasing the  dielectric constant of the solvent, and upon further increase in the salinity and the valency of the salt. At elevated levels of salt, the colloidal particles become overcharged, in all solvents. As a result, their apparent charge becomes opposite in sign to the stoichiometric charge. This reversal of charge intensifies until reaching a saturation point with further increase in salinity, as a result, their apparent charge becomes opposite in sign to the stoichiometric charge. This reversal of charge intensifies until reaching a saturation point with further increase in salinity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f4d31bfa37c510acf52fb80967cd09d4c75b1eb4e8bd9a914afeb86e25ce153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
