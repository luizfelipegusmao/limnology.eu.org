{"title":"The Synthesis of a Two-Circuit Steering Mechanism of the Ackerman Transport Mobile Robot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0709/v1","date":1725957673000,"content":"In wheeled vehicles, there exists a challenge concerning the alignment of the front wheels during turns. When both wheels are turned to the same extent, the inner wheel experiences lateral slippage on the road surface, resulting in reduced steering efficiency. Such problems can be solved by using the Ackermann principle. There are two approaches: through the steering mechanism or by employing autonomous wheel control. From a technical standpoint, it is achievable to synthesize a steering mechanism that fulfills the Ackermann condition, ensuring as accurately as possible for any given turning radius. This research paper focuses on synthesizing a steering mechanism, specifically a two-circuit linkage that links the left and right wheels. The structure and kinematics of this mechanism are being investigated. Following the principles of Ackermann, an objective function for the kinematic synthesis of the mechanism has been formulated. The synthesis process of the mechanism is conducted using the analytical method of interpolation in four parameters. A dedicated method has been developed, and kinematic analysis of the mechanism using the synthesized parameters has been performed. The simulation results have demonstrated high accuracy in achieving the desired implementation of the Ackermann condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18e4c9697a617258ed65946f35e85bc8281ea2481fe70637df926b768a65d189","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
