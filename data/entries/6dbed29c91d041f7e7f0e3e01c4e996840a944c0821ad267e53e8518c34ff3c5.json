{"title":"The Role of Trust and Communication in Supplier Relationship Management Within the E-commerce Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1199/v1","date":1721065846000,"content":"This qualitative study explores the pivotal roles of trust and communication in supplier relationship management (SRM) within the e-commerce sector. Drawing on interviews and thematic analysis, the study examines how trust, comprising dimensions of competence, benevolence, integrity, and reliability, underpins collaborative partnerships and operational resilience between e-commerce platforms and suppliers. Effective communication strategies, including proactive engagement, transparent feedback mechanisms, and real-time updates via digital platforms, are identified as critical enablers for enhancing information exchange and fostering mutual understanding in SRM. Challenges such as cultural differences, technological complexities, and regulatory compliance requirements are also discussed, highlighting the need for strategic management and investment to mitigate risks and maintain trust in supplier engagements. Relational competencies such as empathy, active listening, conflict resolution, and trust-building skills are recognized as essential for navigating interpersonal dynamics and fostering collaborative relationships in e-commerce SRM. Strategically, integrating these findings into comprehensive SRM frameworks is emphasized to cultivate a positive organizational culture characterized by openness, ethical integrity, collaboration, and adaptability. This approach aims to enhance supplier relationships, drive innovation, and achieve sustainable growth in a competitive marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6dbed29c91d041f7e7f0e3e01c4e996840a944c0821ad267e53e8518c34ff3c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
