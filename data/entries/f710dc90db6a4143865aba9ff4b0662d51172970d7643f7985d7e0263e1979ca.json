However, many technologically important systems are synthesized and utilized as thin films. Several challenges in sample preparation and data analysis have been overcome to expand the scope of AET to these systems. Polycrystalline yttrium-doped hafnium dioxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) was chosen as a model system, because it is technologically relevant as a high capacitance dielectric and ferroelectric.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f710dc90db6a4143865aba9ff4b0662d51172970d7643f7985d7e0263e1979ca","category":"Environment"}
