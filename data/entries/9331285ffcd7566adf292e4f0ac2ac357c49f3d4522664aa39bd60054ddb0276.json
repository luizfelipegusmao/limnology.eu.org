{"title":"Exploring the spatial spillover effects of Yangtze River Delta ports on urban economic growth","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307770","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Jian Hou, Juming Shi, Liangyu Chen, Zhouping Zhang, Edwin Kuang</p>\r\n\r\nThe Yangtze River Delta (YRD) ports are pivotal in shaping the Yangtze River Economic Belt and advancing urban economies across China. This article utilizes panel data from 20 cities with ports in the YRD area, spanning from 2011 to 2020, using the spatial Durbin model to explore how these ports influence urban economic growth. The findings indicate that: (1) The YRD ports significantly contribute to economic growth in both the port cities and their surrounding areas, with the indirect impact on neighboring cities being more substantial than the direct effect on the cities themselves; (2) The beneficial spillover effects of the YRD ports on the economic growth of nearby cities vary in intensity over different spatial ranges, marked by distinct boundary effects and geographical attenuation. The influence extends up to approximately 110km; (3) Within the various elements impacting the economic growth of cities in the YRD, financial development prominently exhibits a threshold effect on urban economic growth; (4) Upon analyzing heterogeneity, inland and coastal port cities manifest divergent spillover effects, with inland port cities predominantly exerting a positive spillover on adjacent regions. Accordingly, in order to eventually achieve the shared prosperity of the regionâ€™s economy, it is recommended that a strong top-level design be established and that efforts be made to transform the YRD region into a core region a diffusion and driving effect.","author":"Jian Hou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9331285ffcd7566adf292e4f0ac2ac357c49f3d4522664aa39bd60054ddb0276","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
