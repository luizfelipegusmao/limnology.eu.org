{"title":"Compact rover surveying and laser scanning for BIM development","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301273","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Syed Riaz un Nabi Jafri, Syed Murtaza Hussain, Asif Ahmed, Syed Asher Hussain Rizvi, Kumayl Hassan Kazmi, Jamshed Iqbal</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a custom made small rover based surveying, mapping and building information modeling solution. Majority of the commercially available mobile surveying systems are larger in size which restricts their maneuverability in the targeted indoor vicinities. Furthermore their functional cost is unaffordable for low budget projects belonging to developing markets. Keeping in view these challenges, an economical indigenous rover based scanning and mapping system has developed using orthogonal integration of two low cost RPLidar A1 laser scanners. All the instrumentation of the rover has been interfaced with Robot Operating System (ROS) for online processing and recording of all sensorial data. The ROS based pose and map estimations of the rover have performed using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique. The perceived class 1 laser scans data belonging to distinct vicinities with variable reflective properties have been successfully tested and validated for required structural modeling. Systematically the recorded scans have been used in offline mode to generate the 3D point cloud map of the surveyed environment. Later the structural planes extraction from the point cloud data has been done using Random Sampling and Consensus (RANSAC) technique. Finally the 2D floor plan and 3D building model have been developed using point cloud processing in appropriate software. Multiple interiors of existing buildings and under construction indoor sites have been scanned, mapped and modelled as presented in this paper. In addition, the validation of the as-built models have been performed by comparing with the actual architecture design of the surveyed buildings. In comparison to available surveying solutions present in the local market, the developed system has been found faster, accurate and user friendly to produce more enhanced structural results with minute details.","author":"Syed Riaz un Nabi Jafri","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"004e6434d97576ee31c95028c2c77aec879ff0d548861f686b4c274f81a712e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
