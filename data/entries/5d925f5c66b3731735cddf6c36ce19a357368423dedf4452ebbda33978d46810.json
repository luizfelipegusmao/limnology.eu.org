{"title":"50 Feeding a multi-carbohydrase improves mortality, morbidity and variability of growing pigs fed varying levels of dried distiller’s grains with solubles","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/85/7665046?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to determine the effects of Rovabio Advance 10 P, a multi-carbohydrase, on growth performance, mortality, and morbidity of growing pigs fed 15% or 35% dried distiller’s grains with solubles (DDGS). In the trial, 1,220 DNA pigs were fed from 32 kg to 134 kg body weight (BW). Four diets were fed: 15% DDGS (LO), 15% DDGS with Rovabio Advance (LO+), 35% DDGS (HI), and 35% DDGS with Rovabio Advance (HI+). Each pen had approximately 30 pigs each with 10 pens per dietary treatment. Pig BW and feed were measured as were the number and BW of dead pigs (mortality) and other pig removals (morbidity). Pigs were harvested beginning on d 105 and weekly thereafter through d 126. No significant (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.16) interactions between DDGS level and Rovabio Advance were observed. Feeding greater levels of DDGS tended to reduce average daily gain (ADG), final BW and carcass weight (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.09) and reduced mortality and morbidity (<span>P</span> = 0.1). Greater levels of DDGS also reduced cost of gain and improved income over feed (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.04). Feeding Rovabio Advance reduced mortality and morbidity (<span>P</span> = 0.08), reduced standard deviation of carcass weight (<span>P</span> = 0.02), improved carcass price (<span>P</span> = 0.02), and improved income over feed (<span>P</span> = 0.02). Feeding greater levels DDGS slowed growth rate but improved cost of gain and profitability. Rovabio Advance improved mortality and morbidity and reduced variability resulting in improved profitability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5d925f5c66b3731735cddf6c36ce19a357368423dedf4452ebbda33978d46810","category":"Environment"}
