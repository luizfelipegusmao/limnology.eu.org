{"title":"Resilient Coping Levels and Psychometric Properties of the Brief Resilient\nCoping Scale among Nursing Professionals in Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1771/v1","date":1724720015000,"content":"This cross-sectional survey assessed the resilient coping levels and their relationship with the socio-demographic characteristics of nursing professionals in Saudi Arabia. Adult (≥18 years) registered nurses and practicing for ≥1 year were included. Resilient coping levels (as assessed via a 4-item Brief Resilience Coping Scale; BRCS) and socio-demographic and other characteristics data were collected. Descriptive analysis and ordinal logistic regressions were used to analyze the data. Further, the psychometric properties of the BRCS were reported. A total of 216 nursing professionals were included. The mean BRCS score was 14.6 (standard deviation=3.6), with most nursing professionals (62.5%) reporting medium to high resilience coping levels. The ordinal logistic regression model demonstrated that increasing age (p=0.002), best overall health (p=0.001), and nurses posted in the outpatient department (p=0.049) and intensive care unit (p=0.032) had significantly high resilient coping levels. The internal consistency of the BRCS was good (Cronbach’s alpha=0.80). In summary, nursing professionals in Saudi Arabia showed medium resilient coping levels. Moreover, this study suggests that BRCS is a psychometrically reliable and adequate tool for assessing resilience coping levels and provides valuable insights into the relationship between resilient coping levels and socio-demographic characteristics of the nursing professionals in Saudi Arabia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02132c8d27ad857d3f63050792d517aaabaffa67adc2a9c23f39db42a30c5a17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
