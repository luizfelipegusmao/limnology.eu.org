Traditionally, any direct modification of a material by the electron beam is viewed as an adverse effect – aka, “beam damage” – and many efforts to avoid this entirely are actively being developed, such as more efficient direct electron detectors. A variety of damage mechanisms can be responsible for the outcome of the beam interacting with a specific material [<a href=\"#ozae044.190-B1\">1</a>] – for example, knock-on damage or radiolysis, where these depend on several factors like accelerating voltage and material. It was observed in 2008 that single Au atoms could be influenced by the electron beam but uncontrollably [<a href=\"#ozae044.190-B2\">2</a>]. The first efforts of controlled atom manipulation at the single atom level were the seminal works in 2017 of Dyck [<a href=\"#ozae044.190-B3\">3</a>] and Susi [<a href=\"#ozae044.190-B4\">4</a>] to guide a silicon impurity atom throughout the graphene lattice, but this was done by hand in both cases and consequently was a time consuming and laborious process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9bd0ee4ba29838578c62612ea1ddf0a770f67ea67d4073d554fa3f5bb3a787ab","category":"Environment"}
