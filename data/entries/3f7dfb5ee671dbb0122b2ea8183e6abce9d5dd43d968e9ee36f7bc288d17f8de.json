{"title":"Occupational Accidents, Injuries, and Associated Factors among Migrant and Domestic Construction Workers in Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2091/v1","date":1717138176000,"content":"The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia (SA) has gradually increased, particularly in the construction industry, where migrant workers make up 89% of the workforce. They continue to experience exposure to dangerous working conditions and increased risk for occupational injury and hazards due to the work they tra-ditionally perform. To address this challenge, this study explores the differences between migrant and domestic workers’ injury and occupational accident rates in SA’s construction industry. Data were analysed from 121,999 (98.7% migrant and 1.28% domestic workers) reported accidents and injuries obtained from the General Or-ganisation for Social Insurance (GOSI) between 2014 and 2019. Chi-square test was used to examine the asso-ciations of occupational accidents and injuries among migrant and domestic workers. Migrant workers suffered more falls, strikes, collisions, rubbing and abrasions (damage caused by scraping, producing wounds), bodily reactions (e.g., reaction to chemicals), and car accidents than domestic workers. The results also show that migrant workers aged 30-39 and domestic workers 20-29 experienced more severe injuries and increased seasonal mortality throughout the six-year period examined. In addition, domestic workers achieved a higher proportion of full recovery across all types of accidents except transport and car accidents. The findings emphasise the need for ongoing safety education, training, and improved safety measures to protect the health and safety of construction workers, especially migrant workers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f7dfb5ee671dbb0122b2ea8183e6abce9d5dd43d968e9ee36f7bc288d17f8de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
