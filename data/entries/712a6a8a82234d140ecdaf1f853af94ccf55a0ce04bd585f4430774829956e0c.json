Although nanoscale characterization of structure and composition via imaging or spectroscopy can be accomplished with contemporary high resolution microscopy based techniques, seeing charge redistribution inside the microscope is quite challenging. Off-axis electron holography has been used to characterize the electrostatic fields originating due to redistribution of charge under electron beam irradiation inside an electron microscope [<a href=\"#ozae044.557-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.557-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.557-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"712a6a8a82234d140ecdaf1f853af94ccf55a0ce04bd585f4430774829956e0c","category":"Environment"}
