{"title":"Discussion and Demonstration of RF-MEMS Attenuators Design Concepts and Modules for Advanced Beamforming in the Beyond-5G and 6G Scenarioâ€”Part 2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0477/v1","date":1717985734000,"content":"In this paper, different concepts of reconfigurable RF-MEMS attenuators for beamforming applications are proposed and critically assessed. Capitalizing on the previous part of this work, the 1-bit attenuation modules featuring series and shunt resistors and low-voltage membranes (7-9 V) are employed to develop a 3-bit attenuator for fine-tuning attenuations (&amp;lt; -10 dB) in the 24.25-27.5 GHz range. More substantial attenuation levels are investigated by means of fabricated samples of coplanar waveguide (CPW) sections equipped with Pi-shaped resistors aiming at attenuations of -15, -30, and -45 dB. The remarkable electrical features of such configurations, showing flat attenuation curves and limited return losses, and the investigation of a switched-line attenuator design based on them led to the final proposed concept of a low-voltage 24-state attenuator. Such simulated device combines the Pi-shaped resistors for substantial attenuations with the 3-bit design for fine-tuning operations, showing a maximum attenuation level of nearly -50 dB while maintaining steadily flat attenuation levels and limited return losses (&lt; -11 dB) along the frequency band of interest.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13031cb26e153b0ffef7c693a779319971350729a18c6721bc227a7a2a559b95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
