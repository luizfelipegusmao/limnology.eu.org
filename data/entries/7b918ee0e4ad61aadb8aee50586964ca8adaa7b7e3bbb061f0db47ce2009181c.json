{"title":"Tailoring Semantic Interventions for the Elderly: Task-Focused vs Person-Centered Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0461/v1","date":1722983729000,"content":"Cognitive interventions vary in their level of structure, encompassing standardized and unstandardized tasks, person-centered tasks. Addressing semantic knowledge/semantic memory/semantics is important, mainly because its efficiency impacts other cognitive domains. Semantic tasks are commonly included in preventive and rehabilitation programs, typically as standardized tasks with pre-defined semantic referents. In contrast, person-centered approaches have introduced personally relevant semantics, allowing for expressive language to share thoughts and experiences. Although these approaches offer benefits beyond cognitive improvement, their lack of structure may pose challenges. Our CQ program blends structured activities with personally relevant semantics, aiming to harness the advantages of both methods. Additionally, in this review we discuss future challenges and directions in the field of semantic interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b918ee0e4ad61aadb8aee50586964ca8adaa7b7e3bbb061f0db47ce2009181c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
