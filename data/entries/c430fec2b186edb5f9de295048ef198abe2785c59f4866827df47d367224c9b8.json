{"title":"Uric acid transporter gene SLC22A12 is a chimera of multiple ancestral genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1911/v1","date":1727171782000,"content":"The URAT1 protein is crucial in absorbing urate in human kidneys. A recent study showed that that Xenopus tropicalis (tropical clawed frog) appears to lack renal urate transporters. This finding raises questions regarding the origin of the SLC22A12 gene which encodes URAT1. The origin of the SLC22A12 gene is being discussed through two hypotheses. The first hypothesis, termed the URAT1-early hypothesis, posits that SLC22A12 was present in the common ancestor of tetrapods and was subsequently lost in amphibian lineages. The second hypothesis, the URAT1-late hypothesis, suggests that the SLC22A12 gene arose uniquely within the lineage leading to mammals. The purpose of this study is to determine which hypothesis is more reasonable for describing the origin of SLC22A12. This study suggests that the SLC22A12 gene the SLC22A12 gene was generated via a fusion of the SLC22A6 and SLC22A20 genes. Thus, the URAT1-late hypothesis is more likely to explain the origin of the SLC22A12 gene. X. tropicalis lacks the SLC22A12 gene, probably because the emergence of SLC22A12 occurred after the divergence of the ancestors of mammals and amphibians. The evolutionary studies of the SLC22A12 will offer valuable insights on how to choose model organisms for studies of the uric acid transporter URAT1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c430fec2b186edb5f9de295048ef198abe2785c59f4866827df47d367224c9b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
