{"title":"Prediction of Interface Behavior of a Steel/CFRP Hybrid Part Manufactured by Stamping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1881/v1","date":1721813502000,"content":"Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) is one of the representative lightweight material. The automotive industry has focused on producing the steel/CFRP hybrid part to reduce the weight. After manufacturing, delamination can occur at the interface between the CFRP and steel owing to the hybrid part constituting dissimilar materials. However, most studies have focused only on designing the manufacturing processes for hybrid part or evaluating the adhesive used at the interface. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the behavior of the interface after demolding the hybrid part. This study aimed to predict the interface behavior of a steel/CFRP hybrid part by considering its forming and cohesive properties. First, double cantilever beam (DCB) and end-notched flexure (ENF) tests were performed to obtain cohesive parameters, such as energy release rate of modes Ⅰ and Ⅱ (GⅠ, GⅡ). The experimentally obtained properties were applied to the bonding area of the hybrid part. Subsequently, a forming simulation was performed to obtain the stress of the steel blank in the hybrid part. The stress distribution after forming was utilized as the initial condition for spring-back simulation. Finally, the interface behavior of the hybrid part was predicted by a spring-back simulation, and the results were compared with the experimental results for verification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32e7989eba7e5f0ffb4186c257577ef55ad63376147c442abaf2eec89f83068b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
