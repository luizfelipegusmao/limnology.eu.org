{"title":"Retinal Dystrophies Associated with Mutations in the RP1 Gene. Genotype-Phenotype Correlations.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1901/v1","date":1716966962000,"content":"Background: We evaluate the genetic and phenotypic features of a cohort of 12 Italian patients affected by Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) associated with RP1 sequence variants.; Methods: Retrospective, single center study (Careggi Hospital, Florence), including a cohort of twelve Italian patients (Five male and seven female) affected by RP carrying pathogenic variants of the RP1 gene. A complete ophthalmic assessment and pedigree analysis was conducted with focus on the onset of disease symptoms, the patient’s age at the first diagnosis, the follow up duration and the possible presence of comorbidities; Results: The mean age at onset of symptoms was 31,0 ± 24,1 years old, with a mean follow-up period of 9,1± 2,4 years. The main symptoms at presentation were hemeralopia and visual field constriction. Fundus evaluation revealed a classic type of RP. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Electroretinogram (ERG), and visual field confirmed in most of the cases the typical features of classic retinitis pigmentosa.; (4) Conclusions: This single-center cohort of Italian patients provided information on the clinical and genetic features of RP1-associated RP. By comprehensively clarifying the genetic variations and their associated clinical manifestations, we can better tailor therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting specific genetic abnormalities. This ultimately promises to improve the prognosis and quality of life for individuals with RP-associated RP1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dd090fdfa11aaa3c22d4a5764834cc62ca6f322110408d26925cf3b51b910cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
