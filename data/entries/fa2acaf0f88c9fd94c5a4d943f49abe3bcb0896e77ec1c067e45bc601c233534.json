{"title":"Improved Evaluation of Seedling Cultivation Efficiency in Coconut Coir Substrate through the Addition of Diverse Nutrient Sources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1276/v1","date":1713445397000,"content":"In order to address the issue of nutrient deficiency in coconut coir-based nursery substrates, three materials with nutrient supplementation effects, namely pig manure, composted rice husks, and agricultural humic acid, were added in equal volumes to the coir-based substrate. The newly formulated substrates were then tested for their seedling growth effects on cucumber and rice. Results indicate that the substrate formulation consisting of \"10% pig manure + 30% peat + 50% coconut coir + 10% vermiculite\" was capable of satisfying the growth requirements of both cucumber and rice seedlings, with the highest acceptance among farmers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa2acaf0f88c9fd94c5a4d943f49abe3bcb0896e77ec1c067e45bc601c233534","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
