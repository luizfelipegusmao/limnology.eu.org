{"title":"In the lap of Gods: Sacred bonds and socio-economic dynamics in resolving Human-Bonnet Macaque conflicts for harmonious coexistence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0071/v1","date":1711964149000,"content":"The study delves into the multifaceted landscape of human-macaque conflict within temple ecosystems, with a specific focus on Bonnet Macaques. In the context of intertwined religious, cultural, and social values, understanding public attitudes towards these commensal species  becomes pivotal. The research aims to decipher the socio-economic factors that shape perceptions of human-monkey conflict within temples and to explore public attitudes within  sacred groves. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive questionnaire was administered  through household interviews to 100 residents living within both a 1 sq. km and a 2 sq. km  radius of the study area, ensuring direct participant interaction. The survey, taking  approximately 40 minutes per participant, examined six variables, including occupation,  religion, and annual income. The data collected was analysed using SPSS ver. 24 software,  employing the chi-square test of independence to explore associations between categorical  variables.  The findings revealed that occupation and religion emerged as influential factors in shaping  perceptions of Bonnet Macaques as problematic. While annual income hinted at significance,  age, education, and knowledge of Kysannur Forest Disease (KFD) did not significantly impact  Bonnet Macaque perception. Interestingly, age emerged as a significant factor influencing the  perception of the monkeys' religious significance, whereas only education and religious  affiliation impacted feeding practices towards the monkeys. Surprisingly, other demographic  variables such as age, gender, occupation, and income showed no significant influence on  monkey feeding practices. These results underscore the intricate interplay of socioeconomic,  cultural, and religious factors in shaping public attitudes and behaviours towards Bonnet  Macaques.  The study further sheds light on the impact of education and religious affiliation on feeding  practices, emphasizing the need for nuanced conservation strategies. Recognizing these  complexities is crucial for developing culturally sensitive conservation efforts. By  acknowledging the influential factors identified in this research, conservation strategies can be  tailored to specific communities, fostering harmonious coexistence between humans and  Bonnet Macaques in temple ecosystems. This nuanced approach ensures that conservation  efforts are not only effective but also respectful of the diverse socio-cultural contexts within  which they are implemented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a9ebb5aab3371eb53e5176603c20417d4bad8ddfb018c534107ddb0d469821f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
