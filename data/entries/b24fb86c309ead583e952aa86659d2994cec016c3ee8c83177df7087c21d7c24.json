{"title":"Unravelling the Complexity of HNSCC through Single-Cell Transcriptomics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1683/v1","date":1721625086000,"content":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous and the most common form of head and neck cancer, posing significant challenges for disease management. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) has emerged as a valuable tool for addressing these challenges by enabling detailed characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) at the cellular level. This review assesses the utility of sc-RNAseq in HNSCC research, compiling current strategies employing single-cell technologies. For HNSCC etiology, sc-RNAseq allows for the construction of cellular atlases, characterization of different cell types, and investigation of key genes and processes involved in cancer initiation, development, and progression within the TME. In terms of HNSCC diagnosis and prognosis, the high resolution offered by sc-RNAseq enables the identification of cell type-specific signatures, enhancing prognostic models and disease stratifiers for more accurate patient outcome assessments. Regarding HNSCC treatment, sc-RNAseq provides insights into cellular responses to various treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, contributing to improved patient stratification and personalized treatment strategies. This review highlights the unique contributions of sc-RNAseq to HNSCC research, addressing its cellular and biological complexity, and emphasizes its potential for advancing research and clinical practice in other cancer types.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b24fb86c309ead583e952aa86659d2994cec016c3ee8c83177df7087c21d7c24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
