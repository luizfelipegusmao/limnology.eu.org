{"title":"A Leaky Deep Intronic Splice Variant in CLRN1 Is Associated With Non-syndromic Retinitis Pigmentosa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0569/v1","date":1725878434000,"content":"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are clinically complex and genetically heterogeneous visual impairment disorders with varying penetrance and severity. Disease-causing variants in at least 289 nuclear and mitochondrial genes have been implicated in their pathogenesis. In the current study, we performed exome sequencing on a 51 years-old Ashkenazi Jewish patient with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and identified compound heterozygous variants in the CLRN1 gene: a known pathogenic missense [p.(N48K)] and a novel deep intronic variant c.254-643G&amp;gt;T. A minigene splicing assay that was performed aiming to study the effect of the c.254-643G&amp;gt;T variant on CLRN1 pre mRNA splicing revealed the inclusion of a pseudo-exon that was also reported to be included in the transcript due to an adjacent variant, c.254-649T&amp;gt;G. However, unlike the reported c.254-649T&amp;gt;G variant, c.254-643G&amp;gt;T showed aberrant splicing in a leaky manner, implying that the identified variant is not totally penetrant. The non-syndromic phenotype observed in this index case may be attributed to the leaky nature of this variant, which is causing some normal transcripts to be produced. To conclude, we report on a novel deep intronic variant in CLRN1 causing non-syndromic RP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6083ee35572f32380fddece58bca441c5570f237cddee13cf7bade59a33ea073","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
