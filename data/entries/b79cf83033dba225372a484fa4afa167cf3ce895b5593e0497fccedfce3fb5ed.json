{"title":"Antibody Drug Conjugates in the Treatment of Urothelial Cancer: The Dawn of a New Era","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0057/v1","date":1722563523000,"content":"This review critically evaluates the role of Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in the treatment of urothelial cancer, exploring their therapeutic potential and addressing the scientific and clinical challenges encountered in the development of these agents. It also discusses the recent approvals and clinical trials that are shaping the future of ADC therapy in this field. Through a detailed examination of the mechanism of action of ADCs, including the bystander effect, this paper aims to highlight both the successes and the limitations of these drugs in clinical settings. The main objective of this work is to provide a thorough overview of the current state of ADCs in urothelial cancer treatment, elucidating how these drugs can offer improved outcomes for patients. By discussing the broader implications of ADC technology and its integration into existing treatment paradigms, this review outlines the next steps in research and application necessary to overcome the existing challenges and harness the full potential of ADCs in cancer therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b79cf83033dba225372a484fa4afa167cf3ce895b5593e0497fccedfce3fb5ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
