{"title":"Role of c-Abl in DENV-2 Infection and Actin Remodeling in Vero Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1418/v1","date":1711344086000,"content":"Dengue is one the most significant mosquito-borne viral diseases globally, with its prevalence extending across tropical and subtropical regions, exerting a considerable financial strain on health systems. Despite decades of research leading to the development of a vaccine implemented in endemic countries, its usage remains restricted to a fraction of the population at risk of contracting dengue. Due to these limitations, there is a growing focus on research aimed at unraveling the cellular mechanisms crucial for Dengue virus (DENV) infection to pinpoint potential host targets. Multiple studies propose a pivotal role of cytoskeletal remodeling in DENV infection. Specifically, DENV alters the organization of actin to facilitate viral entry, replication, and release. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the protein c-Abl, a kinase crucial in actin dynamics, in the context of DENV infection. Our findings suggest that either silencing or pharmacological inhibition of the kinase c-Abl leads to accumulation of dengue ENV protein in vitro, associated with actin remodeling. These results illuminate cellular mechanisms that could serve as potential therapeutic alternatives for dengue management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b59b6c2613a8cd3f7756375a88f0e6264742f5aad58a29954ce54a2c5311445","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
