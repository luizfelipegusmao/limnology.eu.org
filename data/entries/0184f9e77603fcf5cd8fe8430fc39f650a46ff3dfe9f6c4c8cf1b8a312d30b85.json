{"title":"The Amazon River plume—a Lagrangian view","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10626?af=R","date":1717152589000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Hydrographic data, nutrient data and bulk rates of nitrate uptake and primary production were determined in the Amazon River plume (ARP) in the Western Tropical North Atlantic (WTNA) during three cruises in May 2018, June/July 2019, with RV Endeavor and April/May 2021 with RV Meteor. Using daily quasi-geostrophic surface velocity data from satellite observations, the geographical positions of the stations of observations were transformed onto Lagrangian coordinates to obtain a dynamically coherent and consistent spatial distribution. After the transformation, the observed surface salinity and temperature fields were consistent with the flow fields, the ARP formed a coherent structure and the retroflection of the North Brazil Current became visible. By transforming other surface variables such as nitrate concentration, photosynthetically available radiation, turbidity, bulk rates of nitrate uptake, and primary production onto Lagrangian coordinates, patterns became consistent with the physical variables at the surface. The use of “synchronous” fields as done here by transformation onto Lagrangian coordinates is essential for spatially structured analyses of data collected over tens of days in a highly dynamic region characterized by complex flow fields with low persistence such as the WTNA. Therefore, the use of the Lagrangian method provides a powerful tool for exploring spatial distributions of biologically relevant factors in regions with complex and dynamic flow patterns. These spatial distributions are qualitatively in agreement with satellite images of daily sea surface temperature and composites of monthly mean Chlorophyll a distributions.</p>","author":"Joachim W.
