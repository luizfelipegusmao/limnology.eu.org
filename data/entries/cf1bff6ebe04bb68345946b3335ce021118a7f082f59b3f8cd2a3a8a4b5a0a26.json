The multiplicity of binding sites for antibodies (from two for IgG to 10 for IgM) and many antigens (oligomeric proteins, most bacteria and viruses) leads to an extreme diversity of such complexes in composition and structure. Note that the location of repeating antigenic determinants affects not only the possibility of bivalent binding by immunoglobulins, but also the conformational changes in the formed complexes. Besides, the polyvalent binding is accompanied by a significant and variable increase in the affinity [<a href=\"#ozae044.369-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.369-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cf1bff6ebe04bb68345946b3335ce021118a7f082f59b3f8cd2a3a8a4b5a0a26","category":"Environment"}
