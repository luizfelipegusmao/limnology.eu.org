{"title":"Susceptibility of different species of Aesculus L. to the chestnut miner moth Cameraria ohridella Deschka &amp; DimiÄ‡: chemical composition and morphological features of leaves","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0513/v1","date":1725608421000,"content":"The susceptibility of seven species of chestnuts to the orchid leafminer was studied in the arboretum of the Main Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences (MBG RAS), taking into account their interspecific characteristics. Using pheromone delta traps, the highest number of moths was shown for A. hippocstanuam and the lowest for A. chinensis. A number of anatomical parameters of leaves were investigated, such as the thickness of the epidermal cell wall and the thickness of the palisade and spongy parenchyma layers. As a result, it was shown that the most infected chestnut species had a greater thickness of the nutritious parenchyma tissue. No de-pendence was found between the degree of susceptibility to the Ohrid leaf miner and such indi-cators as the content of chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids in the leaves of seven species of chestnuts. Nevertheless, resistance of different species of the genus Aesculus to C. ohridella under increased tannin content in leaves has been shown. Evaluation of phenolic compounds and flavonoids has not established their reliable role as repellents. The high levels of carbohydrates found during the study contributed to increased susceptibility to the Ohrid leaf miner.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b02dcfac72432739f7299b798df6a968f880296fdde01d7d3cb7c955ab9cf32f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
