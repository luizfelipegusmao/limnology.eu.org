{"title":"Measurement and Spatiotemporal Dynamic Evolution of China&#039;s High-Quality Economic Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0921/v1","date":1713160831000,"content":"China's economic development has shifted from high speed to high quality. This study constructs an evaluation index for Chinaâ€™s high-quality development utilizing a new development concept. The entropy method and cluster analysis were used to assess the level of high-quality development in China between 2015 and 2021. Kernel density estimation method was employed to explore spatiotemporal dynamics. The results reveal significant differences in the level of economic development among provinces in China; the eastern region is significantly better than the central, northeastern, and western regions. From the perspective of the sub-item evaluation, challenges with uneven, uncoordinated, and insufficient economic development exist in various Chinese provinces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"070ec7dbd5dff96c372ae9010c18b6f5c130124c117ec9eb434f47fb58c58915","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
