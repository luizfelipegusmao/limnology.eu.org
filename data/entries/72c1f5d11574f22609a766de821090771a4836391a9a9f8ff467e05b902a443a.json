Systemic therapy, such as the combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine or therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals such as [<sup>131</sup>I] meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), may be administered in cases of locally advanced tumors or distant metastases. However, the current therapies are limited in terms of efficacy and implementation. [<sup>211</sup>At] meta-astatobenzylguanidine (MABG) is an alpha-emitting radionuclide-labeled ligand that has demonstrated remarkable tumor-reducing effects in preclinical studies, and is expected to have a high therapeutic effect on pheochromocytoma cells.</p> Methods <p>We are currently conducting an investigator-initiated first-in-human clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of [<sup>211</sup>At] MABG. Patients with locally unresectable or metastatic PPGL refractory to standard therapy and scintigraphically positive [<sup>123</sup>I] MIBG aggregation are being recruited, and a 3 + 3 dose escalation design was adopted. The initial dose of [<sup>211</sup>At] MABG is 0.65 MBq/kg, with a dose escalation in a 1:2:4 ratio in each cohort. Dose-limiting toxicity is observed for 6 weeks after a single bolus dose of [<sup>211</sup>At] MABG, and the patients are observed for 3 months to explore safety and efficacy profiles. The primary endpoint is dose-limiting toxicity to determine both maximum tolerated and recommended doses. The secondary endpoints include radiopharmacokinetics, urinary radioactive excretion rate, urinary catecholamine response rate, objective response rate, progression free survival, [<sup>123</sup>I] MIBG scintigraphy on reducing tumor accumulation, and quality of life.</p> Trials registration <p>jRCT2021220012 registered on 17 June 2022.</p>","author":"Masao Kobayakawa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"72c1f5d11574f22609a766de821090771a4836391a9a9f8ff467e05b902a443a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
