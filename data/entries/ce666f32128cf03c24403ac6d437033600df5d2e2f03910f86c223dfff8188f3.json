Malik</p>\r\n\r\nFungi and bacteria coexist in many polymicrobial communities, yet the molecular basis of their interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the fungus <i>Candida albicans</i> sequesters essential magnesium ions from the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. To counteract fungal Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> expresses the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA when Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are low. Thus, loss of MgtA specifically impairs <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> in co-culture with <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, but fitness can be restored by supplementing Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a panel of fungi and bacteria, we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration is a general mechanism of fungal antagonism against gram-negative bacteria. Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation enhances bacterial resistance to polymyxin antibiotics like colistin, which target gram-negative bacterial membranes. Indeed, experimental evolution reveals that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> evolves <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>-dependent colistin resistance via non-canonical means; antifungal treatment renders resistant bacteria colistin-sensitive. Our work suggests that fungal–bacterial competition could profoundly impact polymicrobial infection treatment with antibiotics of last resort.","author":"Yu-Ying Phoebe Hsieh","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"ce666f32128cf03c24403ac6d437033600df5d2e2f03910f86c223dfff8188f3","category":"Environment"}
