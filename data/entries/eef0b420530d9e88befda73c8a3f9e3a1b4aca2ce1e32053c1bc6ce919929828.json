{"title":"Enhancing cider quality through co‐fermentation with acid protease and esterase‐producing Metschnikowia species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13891?af=R","date":1726282127000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>To date, cider production has primarily relied on <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Introducing novel non-<i>Saccharomyces</i> yeasts can enhance the diversity of cider properties. Among these, the <i>Metschnikowia</i> genus stands out for its ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes that may impact the sensorial and technological properties of cider. This study focused on evaluating the impact of three <i>Metschnikowia</i> species – <i>Metschnikowia koreensis</i> (Mk), <i>M. reukaufii</i> (Mr), and <i>M. pulcherrima</i> (Mp) – which exhibit acid protease and esterase activity, on the quality enhancement of cider.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The research findings indicate that the overall quality of cider produced through co-fermentation with these species surpassed that of cider fermented with mono-fermentation of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (Sc). The cider fermented with the Sc + Mk combination exhibited the lowest levels of harsh-tasting malic acid and higher levels of softer lactic acid. Sensory array analysis also demonstrated that the Sc + Mk fermented cider exhibited high sensor response values for compounds contributing to a complex overall olfactory composition and richness. Furthermore, the Sc + Mk fermented cider exhibited the highest total quantity and variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Specifically, the concentrations of phenethyl alcohol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, ethyl octanoate, and decanoic acid were notably elevated in comparison with other groups.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study illustrates that <i>Metschnikowia</i> species, particularly <i>M. koreensis</i>, show significant potential as starters for cider due to their various technological properties, including acidity modulation, aroma enhancement, and color improvement. The findings of this study provide a foundation for improving cider quality by co-fermenting <i>S. cerevisiae</i> with innovative starter cultures. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuzheng Wu, \nYuening Li, \nHuipeng Liang, \nSufang Zhang, \nXinping Lin, \nChaofan Ji","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"eef0b420530d9e88befda73c8a3f9e3a1b4aca2ce1e32053c1bc6ce919929828","category":"Environment"}
