{"title":"Pioneers of plankton research: Priscilla Susan Bury (1799–1872)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/1/1/7469886?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span>In 1862, Priscilla Susan Bury authored a small but significant book with a rather long title: “<span>Figures of Remarkable Forms of Polycystins, or allied Organisms, in the Barbados Chalk Deposit, (Chiefly from that Collected by Dr. Davy, and which He had Noticed in a Lecture Delivered to the Agricultural Society of Barbados, in July 1846) Drawn by Mrs. Bury, as Seen in Her Microscope, on Slides Prepared by Chr. Johnson, Esq., of Lancaster, 1860 and 1861</span>” (<a href=\"#ref7\">Bury, 1862</a>). It is today quite obscure, and held in only a few libraries. Recall that is was not until 1887 that the term “plankton” was coined by Victor <a href=\"#ref29\">Hensen (1887)</a>, and thus one might question if the author of an 1862 work can be considered a pioneer of plankton research. The position taken here is that Bury was indeed a pioneer as her work appears to be the first pictorial work dedicated to the beauty of planktonic organisms, specifically, ones which came to known as the radiolarians of the marine plankton.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"0e68cb575be21a327b96fde23bc04eabb2be0625188f29e3a518598503cf8654","category":"Environment"}
