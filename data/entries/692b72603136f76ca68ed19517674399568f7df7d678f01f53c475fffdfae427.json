Traditional metabolomics techniques, whether targeted or untargeted, often struggle to interpret these adaptive shifts. Here, we introduce <span>MetaboLiteLearner</span>, a lightweight machine learning framework that harnesses the detailed fragmentation patterns from electron ionization (EI) collected in scan mode during gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to predict changes in the metabolite composition of metabolically adapted cells. When tested on breast cancer cells with different preferences to metastasize to specific organs, <span>MetaboLiteLearner</span> predicted the impact of metabolic rewiring on metabolites withheld from the training dataset using only the EI spectra, without metabolite identification or pre-existing knowledge of metabolic networks. Despite its simplicity, the model learned captured shared and unique metabolomic shifts between brain- and lung-homing metastatic lineages, suggesting cellular adaptations associated with metastasis to specific organs. Integrating machine learning and metabolomics paves the way for new insights into complex cellular adaptations.Â </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"692b72603136f76ca68ed19517674399568f7df7d678f01f53c475fffdfae427","category":"Environment"}
