{"title":"Alkaloid-Based Isoxazolylureas: Synthesis and Effect in Combination With Anticancer Drugs on the c6 Rat Glioma Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1552/v1","date":1716458799000,"content":"Alkaloid-based urea derivatives were produced with high yield through the reaction of anabasine and cytisine with isoxazolylphenylcarbamates in boiling benzene. Their antitumor ac-tivity in combination with the commonly used six anticancer drugs namely cyclophosphane, fluorouracil, etoposide, cysplatine, ribomustine with different mechanisms of action was investi-gated. Based on the quantum chemical calculations data and molecular docking, hypotheses have been put forward to explain their mutual influence when affecting on the ะก6 rat glioma model cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e769def3553861dbaaeceedfb91b0efe01831476ba13dc13ab8ab5343f884b03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
