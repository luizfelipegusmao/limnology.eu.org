{"title":"BrainNest: Implementation of TypeScript and MERN Stack to Improve Scalability of Interactive and Personalized E-learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0051/v1","date":1719820591000,"content":"In the age of digital revolution technology is being used more and more in education around the world to improve student learning. By enabling ongoing skill development and knowledge acquisition through digital platforms e-learning has become a crucial tool. Through E-Learning online learning is becoming increasingly popular and effective in addition to traditional methods of instruction as highlighted by the latest statistics from Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia (BPS). In order to address the issues of scalability, interactivity and security in e-learning platforms. This study introduces a web-based learning environment that is focused on teaching programming. Leveraging the MERN stack, while also integrating TypeScript for improved code reliability, Next.js for accelerated React.js functionality, Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Backend features include media management with Cloudinary, secure video streaming with VdoCipher, data storage with MongoDB, and caching with Redis. Iterative development will be following agile methodology. In order to create a vibrant and encouraging learning environment the platform includes interactive course pages multimedia content real-time feedback mechanisms and community-building tools. Despite some early difficulties the implementation phase effectively achieved development goals. To further support international online learning initiatives further efforts will be directed toward improving platform security and functionality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b0a7634008655a516bd7396f914d39ce8cb33747e323af1cf2bdaa654eabdf8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
