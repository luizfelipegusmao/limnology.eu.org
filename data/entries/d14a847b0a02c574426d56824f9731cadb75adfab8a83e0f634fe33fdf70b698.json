{"title":"Mitigating Effect of the Sea on Temperatures along Mediterra-Nean Coastal Areas: The Case of the Vine Territory of the Matera DOP &ndash; Basilicata (Italy)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1209/v1","date":1726482119000,"content":"The temperature variations caused by the climate changes taking place in the Basilicata region, southern Italy - Ionian Seaside of the Gulf of Taranto - on the territory of the DOP Matera vineyard, were studied by means of an analysis of temperature trends considering both the period of the vegetative-productive season of the vineyards and the whole year. Two datasets were analyzed for this study: data from ERA5-Land of the C3S Climate Data Store -relative to the 1981-2022 window- and data from 5 weather stations belonging to the agrometeorological network of the Lucanian Agency for Development and Innovation in Agriculture (SAL-ALSIA), relative to the 2000-2023 window. From the results of this study, it can be deduced that, for the historical period analyzed, the Matera DOP area showed a clear and worrying trend of increasing temperatures and, in par-ticular, minimum temperatures. This increase, moreover, is more evident at higher elevations than at lower elevations close to the sea. At lower altitudes, in fact, temperatures are strongly “buffered” by the thermoregulatory activity of the bordering Ionian Sea. It follows that the DOP Matera viticultural areas, and in particular the areas furthest from the coastal strip, will already have to adapt to severe climatic conditions that will undoubtedly affect the quality and typicality of the wines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d14a847b0a02c574426d56824f9731cadb75adfab8a83e0f634fe33fdf70b698","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
