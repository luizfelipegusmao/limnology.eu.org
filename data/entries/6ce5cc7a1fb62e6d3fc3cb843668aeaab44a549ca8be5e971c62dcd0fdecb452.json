{"title":"Unraveling the spawning and reproductive patterns of tomato hind grouper, Cephalopholis sonnerati (Valenciennes, 1828) from south Kerala waters","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15775?af=R","date":1714431146000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The objective of this study is to provide information on the reproductive biology of tomato hind grouper, <i>Cephalopholis sonnerati</i> (Valenciennes, 1828) for conservation and management purposes. Fish caught by artisanal fishermen from September 2019 to August 2021 were analysed. A total of 280 females, 31 males, and 4 transitional and 178 sex-undetermined fish were analysed. The female to male sex proportion was 9:1, and the fish reached a maximum total body length of 38.5 and 54.5 cm for females and males, respectively. The following microscopic stages were identified: immature, developing, ripe, running ripe/releasing, and spent in both males and females. Several asynchronous development patterns were observed in the studied gonads, including multiple oocyte stages and early and advanced stages of sexual transition. High gonadosomatic index (GSI) for both males and females was recorded in March, May, and November. Running ripe and releasing stages in females were identified in the months from March to June, which indicates the spawning season. The absolute and relative fecundity of the species ranged from 162,723 ± 207,267 and 239 ± 285, respectively. An exponential relationship was found between fecundity and total body length (TL), fecundity and total body weight (TW), and fecundity and gonad weight (GW).</p>","author":"Ponni J. Mohan, \nM. K.
