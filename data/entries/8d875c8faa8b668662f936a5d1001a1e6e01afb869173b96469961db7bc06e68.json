{"title":"Management of Production Processes in a Heating Company","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1235/v1","date":1716194400000,"content":"The paper is focused on researching the behavior of heating companies in connection with current developments in the electricity market and flexibility in the context of market behavior. The work assesses the increase in profitability through the creation of a technical-economic model using an objective function with profit maximization. The paper objective is presented the procedure and methodology for creating a model using the basic scheme of production processes integrated into the system platform. The result of the work is a comparative analysis of modelled cases of implemented operation deployment according to a defined period and modelling modes in selected time series. The description of individual outputs demonstrates the economic advantage of using combinations of modes of combined electricity and heat production, and non-combined electricity and heat production, including the use of the heat suppression mode because of overproduction of electricity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d875c8faa8b668662f936a5d1001a1e6e01afb869173b96469961db7bc06e68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
