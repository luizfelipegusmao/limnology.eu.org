Despite the great potential, drone use by protected area managers is still scarce or accompanied by scepticism. The ongoing debate revolves around whether drones are fancy gadgets or if they can effectively guide management strategies and align with the overarching goals of protected areas.\n\nHere, we present a practical overview of how novel drone applications contribute to the goals of the oldest national park in the Alps, along with the associated challenges. To do so, we review our seven-year experience as park employees flying drones within the park and its surroundings.\n\nFirst, we provide background information receiving limited attention in the existing literature such as our motivation behind a drone purchase, costs and an overview of our flight operations.\n\nSecond, we show three examples that demonstrate the potential of drones as a valuable tool in addressing the goals of the park: managing the area, researching natural processes and facilitating communication.\n\nThird, we reflect on operational challenges and provide valuable lessons for addressing the specific challenges of flying drones in an alpine and protected environment.\n\n<i>Practical implication</i>: Our experience supports the benefits of drones for protected area management, but it also highlights the need for certain precautions, increased focus on operational challenges and further research on wildlife-drone interactions.\n</p>","author":"Christian Rossi, \nSamuel Wiesmann","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecological Solutions and Evidence: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2d59a3492421ff8dc6c930252c6b4149e9691eaa8596381f5a50d8e1d8243fb4","entryHash":"053af2969e17a0b6414ffb94cc28c33f89ec1e8f0526f08d7f625e3a589d3d0e","category":"Environment"}
