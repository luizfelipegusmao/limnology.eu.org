{"title":"Ameliorative impacts of sinapic acid against mercuric chloride-induced renal toxicity: role of antioxidants and inflammatory cytokines","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae066/7656616?rss=1","date":1713830400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Because of their beneficial properties, natural products, especially medicinal plants, are becoming increasingly popular worldwide and play a significant role in research. This study was aimed to evaluate the nephroprotective effect of sinapic acid against mercuric chloride-induced renal toxicity in mice. The mice were allocated to four groups named a normal group (G1), model group (G2; received HgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg/kg bw), treatments groups (G3 and G4: received 50 and 100 mg/kg bw of sinapic acid together with HgCl2). Mice received HgCl<sub>2</sub> remarkably showed alteration in all examined biochemical biomarkers (urea, creatinine, and bilirubin), and induced alteration in blood cell picture and anemia. HgCl<sub>2</sub> intoxication decreased both systemic and renal antioxidant activity and induced over all oxidative stress as indicated by alteration in inflammation and oxidative stress associated markers. HgCl<sub>2</sub> affected renal histology with leukocytic and inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis and tubular necrosis. Administration of sinapic acid (50 and 100 mg/kg bw) markedly restored the HgCl<sub>2−</sub>induced oxidative stress (serum and renal: MDA, GSH, CAT, SOD, and T-AOC), proinflammatory cytokines (serum and renal: TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and PGE2) and restored the changes on biochemical markers, and hematological parameters (hemoglobin, erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes). Taken together, the results of the present study disclose that sinapic acid has the potential to attenuate HgCl<sub>2</sub>-induced renal toxicity and may be an ideal choice against mercury poisoning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"8424ab88d8143de8de979b4cda7f707f22d6cf0808f58f2b3e022ea61d1bb1e0","category":"Environment"}
