{"title":"Innovative Wood Fire Retardant Coating Based on Biocompatible Nanocellulose Surfactant and Expandable Graphite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1975/v1","date":1719495169000,"content":"Nanocellulose (CNC) seems to be a promising surfactant, which, together with expandable graphite (EG), forms the essence of an effective natural-based fire retardant wood coating. In our research, the most suitable composition of the mixture was tested concerning good solubility, dispersion, and consistency. Favorable results were achieved with the formulation composed of a 4% CNC alkaline solution with 80 wt.% of selected EG. Subsequently, six different EG were used to prepare these wood fire retardant coatings. The effectiveness of treatments was verified using a test with a radiant heat source, where the test samples' relative weight loss, relative burning rate, and surface temperature during 600 sec were evaluated. All prepared formulations can be characterized as more or less equally effective. However, the best results were obtained with EG of GG 200 – 100 N, where the mass loss of the sample was 8.10 ± 1.24%. Very good results were also achieved by graphite 25 E + 180 HPH (8.70 ± 0.89%), which is similar to the previous one, even according to the microscopic assessment of the coating as well as the expanded layer. Graphite type 25 K + 180 (8.86 ± 0.65 %) shows the expanded layer's best cohesion, coating uniformity, and ease of application. The results of this work confirmed that the CNC coating itself has significant retardation effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5519a163615d8b9cea750cb8f0302c6f4670ae0d1048e4e7e42772c95ce17db9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
