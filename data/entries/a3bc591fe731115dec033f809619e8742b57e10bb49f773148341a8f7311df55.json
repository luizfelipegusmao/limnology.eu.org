{"title":"Regulation of seed dormancy by histone post-translational modifications in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/19/6159/7676900?rss=1","date":1716249600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants synchronize their growth and development with environmental changes, which is critical for their survival. Among their life cycle transitions, seed germination is key for ensuring the survival and optimal growth of the next generation. However, even under favorable conditions, often germination can be blocked by seed dormancy, a regulatory multilayered checkpoint integrating internal and external signals. Intricate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlie seed dormancy establishment, maintenance, and release. In this review, we focus on recent advances that shed light on the complex mechanisms associated with physiological dormancy, prevalent in seed plants, with <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> serving as a model. Here, we summarize the role of multiple epigenetic regulators, but with a focus on histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation, that finely tune dormancy responses and influence dormancy-associated gene expression. Understanding these mechanisms can lead to a better understanding of seed biology in general, as well as resulting in the identification of possible targets for breeding climate-resilient plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"a3bc591fe731115dec033f809619e8742b57e10bb49f773148341a8f7311df55","category":"Environment"}
