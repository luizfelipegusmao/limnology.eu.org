{"title":"Plant functional trait is a strong predictor of ecosystem productivity under altered precipitation in desert steppes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2686?af=R","date":1725347974000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function has always been one of the hot issues in the field of ecology. With the acceleration of global warming, the precipitation pattern has become one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss, which has a profound impact on ecosystem functional services and stability. However, the studies on the effects and mechanisms of plant community diversity and ecosystem productivity under precipitation changes in desert steppe are still unclear. According to the change rate (−41.1% to 39.2%) of precipitation in the study area in recent 50 years, five precipitation gradients (i.e., −40%, −20%, CK, +20% and +40%) were set to simulate the possible future precipitation pattern changes. Aboveground biomass increased with the increase of precipitation. Compared with CK, the aboveground biomass increased by 22.81% with +40% and decreased by 80.71% with −40%, and the negative impact of precipitation decrease on aboveground biomass was more significant. Through multiple stepwise regression analyses, species diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity were identified as the best models of aboveground biomass. The results showed that the aboveground biomass changes could be explained by 51.3%, 81.6%, 32.6% and 60% respectively. Combined with plant community diversity, the final index model was obtained through multiple stepwise regression analyses, which could explain 88.3% of changes in aboveground biomass. In this model, The average coefficient of specific leaf area and leaf thickness had a very high significance level, and these two functional traits of dominant species had a greater explanatory power for ecosystem system function. There was a nonlinear correlation between precipitation and aboveground biomass, and drought had a more significant negative effect on aboveground biomass. Compared with species diversity and phylogenetic diversity, plant functional traits can better explain ecosystem productivity. Selection effects are the main maintenance mechanism of desert steppe community productivity under the background of precipitation change.</p>","author":"Lihua Zhang, \nXiaotong Ren, \nYafei Guo, \nRuifeng Zhao, \nXiaoyu Jiang, \nXi Wei, \nLinqi Yang, \nLifang Kang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"54bffe7f811ec2f2f079f355a65142ddb6c2a0fe8a84369fa9000065a6ae2ebb","category":"Environment"}
