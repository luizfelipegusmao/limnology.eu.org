This study aimed to clarify the relationship between vitamin D levels and muscle mass loss. A total of 166 patients with chronic liver disease were enrolled in this study. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and after 1 year. The rate of change in SMI from baseline after 1 year was calculated: ΔSMI (%) = [(1-year SMI − baseline SMI) / baseline SMI] × 100. Muscle mass loss was defined as ΔSMI ≤ −2%. The median 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 15.2 (11.2–19.3) ng/mL. The median SMI were 6.8 (5.9–7.8) kg/m<sup>2</sup> at baseline and 6.7 (5.9–7.6) kg/m<sup>2</sup> after 1 year. The median ΔSMI was −1.23% (−2.21% to 1.61%). Multivariate analysis identified low 25-hydroxyvitamin D as an independent factor associated with muscle mass loss. The optimal cut-off value of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to predict muscle mass loss was 12.7 ng/mL. Muscle mass loss was found in 56.4% v.s. 18.0% of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 12.7 vs. ≥ 12.7 ng/mL, respectively (p = 9.01 × 10<sup>−7</sup>); with the highest incidence in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specifically, patients with NAFLD and 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 12.7 ng/mL had a significantly higher incidence of muscle mass loss than those with ≥ 12.7 ng/mL (p = 1.23 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). Low vitamin D levels are associated with muscle mass loss after 1 year in patients with chronic liver disease, especially NAFLD.","author":"Tomomi Okubo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"069231bf255775abe4ada0d40d55189380ff28c1fef81ef70a7b32866b6db2f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
