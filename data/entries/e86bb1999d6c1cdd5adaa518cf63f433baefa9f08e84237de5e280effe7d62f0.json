{"title":"Mortality events associated with microsporidian, Spraguea sp., in White Trevally culture in Japan","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14006?af=R","date":1723535924000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In 2021, White Trevally or Striped Jack cultured in the western part of Japan exhibited mild, but chronic mortalities from late September through early October. The cumulative mortality rate was approximately 0.02% per a net pen containing approximately 50,000 fish. Although the cumulative mortality rate was not high, most of the fish in net pens showed characteristic gross signs and an abnormal swimming behaviour. The body of diseased fish became pale and the yellow lines on the lateral sides of fish body became darken. In addition, silver lines along the dorsal fin became apparent. Loss of schooling behaviour was noted during the mortality event. In addition, affected fish became lethargic and failed to swim against current, or frequently stopped swimming and sank to the bottom of net pens after feeding. The goal of this study was to identify the cause of the mortality event. To achieve the goal, we used histopathology and metatranscriptome analysis. Histopathological examination revealed that xenoma of microsporidian were frequently observed in the nerve axon in the brain and spinal cord. Spores observed in the sections were stained with a fluorescent dye, Uvitex 2B, indicating those spores are microsporidian. The data from metatranscriptome analysis indicated that the microsporidian is <i>Spraguea</i> sp. The microsporidian was frequently detected from diseased fish with similar symptoms collected in the same region, suggesting that the microsporidian was highly associated with abnormal swimming behaviour of fish.</p>","author":"Tomofumi Kurobe, \nIkunari Kiryu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"e86bb1999d6c1cdd5adaa518cf63f433baefa9f08e84237de5e280effe7d62f0","category":"Environment"}
