In recent years, the community has found great success in using both experimental and simulated data–where we can access ground-truth information– to train neural network models to analyze experimental data. Neural network model performance, however, is strongly dependent on the available training data, the network architecture (or function class), optimization algorithm, loss function, and training hyperparameters. Given the ease of altering the model class and optimization procedure as compared to the difficulty of procuring a more effective training dataset, it is important to understand how these models behave in deployment scenarios when the target data differs from the distribution of training data.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7f10220d204b93157c34e1b6813164156d2c6e23e6960c2940185a413f2fe701","category":"Environment"}
