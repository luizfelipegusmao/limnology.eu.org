Unfortunately, cryo-plunging is infamously fraught with uncertainty and unreliability. The sample deposition time, plunging acceleration, final velocity, thermal properties of the sample and the cryogen, and many other factors interact in a complex way, making reproducibility difficult to achieve [<a href=\"#ozae044.438-B1\">1-4</a>]. Furthermore, there is not a blanket set of parameters that works every time; what works for one protein may not work for another. A range of cryo-plungers, from fully automated to manual, is now available, but the costs of the automated solutions (three orders of magnitude more than manual ones) do not seem to scale with their benefits. Here, we present the challenges encountered during our recent attempts to build two apparatus for manual cryo-plunging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0e5a2e6905fcd82c0c625d6154de519151178ed740fa4f0c5b6bc92dc230e77a","category":"Environment"}
