{"title":"How to comment in Clojure and my use case of each approach","link":"http://visibletrap.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-comment-in-clojure.html","date":1465003260000,"content":"There are 3 ways to comment code in Clojure. I personally use all 3 of them depending on the situation.<br /><br /><b>; [semicolon]</b><br />It's similar to <b>//</b> or <b>#</b> in the other languages. Source code from the point you put it until the end of line won't be executed.<br /><br />I use it for a quick short documentation of the code or when I want to try remove a line quickly. It's the most easy to use one because all the IDEs and text editors support it out of the box.<br /><br /><b>(comment (expr)) [comment macro]</b><br />Use it to wrap expression you don't want it to be run. It's more convenient to use when using with tool to help maintaining balance of the parentheses such as paredit or parinfer.<br /><br />I use this one a lot in while I'm doing interactive development via repl. I always put the code to execute function the I'm implementing in the same file with the function definition so that I can quickly test out when I change something. I wrap that code with comment macro so that I won't be execute automatically by Clojure. When I want, I send only the inside code to the repl to see what's the output of the function.<br /><br /><b>#_ reader macro</b><br />It comments out an expression that follows it, from opening to closing parens<br /><br />This one I've just learnt about it recently. It comes in handy when I don't want to care about where is the end of the expression. I just put #_ and thing will behave as I expected. It's great for multiline comment, similar to the comment macro with a less keystrokes.<br /><br /><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/visibletrap/cd00fb1a21ae3bbd1ade06eae407362c.js\"></script><br /><a href=\"https://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/clojure/comment/\">ClojureBridge is done a better explanation than me</a><br /><br />","author":"Tap","siteTitle":"tAp's blog","siteHash":"ec0b5758aa5280680c8b6839677ce27021dd9d4295725ce4f0e9f298aad77c91","entryHash":"f8363d1e5f3e4e0d8769f19c8bf881946b6480cea2fd82d37a9448fc14e6f6d6","category":"Tech"}
