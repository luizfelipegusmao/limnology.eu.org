One potential solution is using metal hydrides, which have applications in various fields like hydrogen storage, rechargeable batteries, and catalysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.915-B2\">2-4</a>]. Recently, there has been a lot of interests in multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs), characterized by a composition of at least three elements in near-equiatomic proportions [<a href=\"#ozae044.915-B5\">5</a>]. MPEAs exhibit exceptional hydrogen storage capacities, attributed to the additional interstitial sites for hydrogen atom accommodation created by the severe lattice distortion generated by the different atomic radii [<a href=\"#ozae044.915-B6\">6</a>]. Characterizing the atomic distortion and resolving hydrogen atoms is crucial for unravelling the hydrogen storage mechanism and enhancing the properties of MPEA hydrides. However, direct imaging of hydrogen at an atomic scale poses a significant challenge due to its low atomic number. Thus far, hydrogen columns have been resolved using phase contrast imaging techniques such as annular bright field (ABF) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) [<a href=\"#ozae044.915-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.915-B8\">8</a>]. Nevertheless, the image contrast of these methods can be influenced by various parameters, including sample thickness, defocus, sample tilt and surface amorphous layers [<a href=\"#ozae044.915-B9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.915-B10\">10</a>]. Consequently, hydrogen can only be observed under very limited conditions. Furthermore, obtaining depth information, crucial for materials with three-dimensional lattice distortions and chemical inhomogeneities like MPEAs, is not possible with a single ABF or iDPC image. Multislice electron ptychography, capable of reconstructing the 3D structure of specimens using a single dataset, emerges as a solution to circumvent these challenges and provide comprehensive three-dimensional structure information [<a href=\"#ozae044.915-B11\">11</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4e147e9d13e5eb6cabf465b004963a27af2cb3ece98982f2b871e21e48fbe43d","category":"Environment"}
