{"title":"Enhancing Decarbonation in Solid Waste Management, Wastewater and Contaminated Soil Treatments: The Role of Data Automation and Decision Support Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1457/v1","date":1721289316000,"content":"As global concerns about climate change intensify, the need for effective strategies to reduce carbon emissions has never been more urgent. This paper explores the crucial role of data automation (DA) and decision support systems (DSS) in enhancing decarbonation efforts within the realms of solid waste management (SWM), wastewater treatment (WWT), and contaminated soil remediation (CSR). Specifically, the paper provides: (i) an overview of the carbon footprint (CFP) in relation to environmental management (EM) and the role of DA and DSS in decarbonization; (ii) DA case studies in areas of SWM, WWT, and CSR; (iii) 3. life cycle assessment (LCA) based DSS case studies in areas of SWM, WWT, and CSR; (iv) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based DSS case studies in areas of SWM, WWT, and CSR; and (v) optimal contractual delivery methods based DSS case studies in EM practices. The analysis disclosed that adoption of DA and DSS in SWM, WWT, and CSR holds significant potential for decarbonizing these EM processes. By optimizing operations, enhancing resource efficiency, and integrating renewable energy sources, these technologies contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and promote sustainable environmental practices. As the demand for more effective and eco-friendly solutions grows, the role of DA and DSS will become increasingly pivotal in achieving global decarbonization goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62bf3f6dbc763a1ea32501356689d427279084c2768d530b73d6fcb89153ae01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
