{"title":"A Female-Specific Treatment Group for ADHD – Description of the Programme and Qualitative Analysis of First Experiences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1267/v1","date":1711016798000,"content":"Diagnosis and treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in women remain insufficient. Fluctuations of reproductive hormones during the premenstrual period, postpartum period  and (peri)menopause are neglected, even though they impact ADHD symptoms and as-sociated mood disorders [1]. Therefore, we created a female-specific treatment group for women with ADHD and premenstrual worsening of ADHD and/or mood symptoms. We describe the group programme and underlying rationale, offering a qualitative analysis of the participants’ evaluation. The 7 two-weekly sessions foreground the menstrual cycle and address several ADHD-specific topics in relation to this cyclical pattern: emotional regulation; impulsivity; setting boundaries, and triggers. Concurrently, women track their menstrual cycle and (fluctuating) ADHD and mood symptoms with an adjusted premenstrual calendar. In total, 18 women (25-47yrs) participated in three consecutive groups. We analysed the evaluation of the last group. Participants experienced the group as a safe and welcoming space. Recognition was valued by all. The topics discussed were deemed valuable and the structure suited them well. Completing the premenstrual calendar augmented awareness and recognition of individual cyclical symptoms. Discussing ADHD throughout the lifespan increased self-understanding. Participants took their menstrual cycle more seriously, prioritising self-acceptance and self-care in the luteal phase of the cycle. Exploring a cyclical approach in a group setting seems to be a positive addition to treatment for female ADHD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b4eebc781e92c04e2fb92efead16064b5a9d83d2946cd2880265a752d2ab12a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
