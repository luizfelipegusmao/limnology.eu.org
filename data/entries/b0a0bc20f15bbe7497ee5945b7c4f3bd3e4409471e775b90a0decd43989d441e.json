{"title":"Computational Advances in Ionic Liquid Applications for Green Chemistry: A Critical Review of Lignin Processing and Machine Learning Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0430/v1","date":1728379333000,"content":"The valorization and dissolution of lignin using ionic liquids (ILs) is critical for developing sustainable biorefineries and a circular bioeconomy. This review aims to critically assess the current state of computational and machine learning methods for understanding and optimizing IL-based lignin dissolution and valorization processes reported since 2022. The paper examines various computational approaches, from quantum chemistry to machine learning, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and recent advances in predicting and optimizing lignin-IL interactions. Key themes include the challenges in accurately modeling ligninâ€™s complex structure, the development of efficient screening methodologies for ionic liquids to enhance lignin dissolution and valorization processes, and the integration of machine learning with quantum calculations. These computational advances will drive progress in IL-based lignin valorization by providing deeper molecular-level insights and facilitating the rapid screening of novel IL-lignin systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0a0bc20f15bbe7497ee5945b7c4f3bd3e4409471e775b90a0decd43989d441e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
