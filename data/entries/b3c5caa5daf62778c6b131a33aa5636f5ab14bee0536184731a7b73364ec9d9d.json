{"title":"Strip Adjustment of Multi-Temporal LiDAR Data - A Case Study at the Pielach River","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0035/v1","date":1719814317000,"content":"With LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) time series being used for various applications, optimal realisation of a common geodetic datum over many epochs is a highly important prerequisite with direct impact on accuracy and reliability of derived measures. In our work, we develop and define several approaches to the adjustment of multi-temporal LiDAR data in a given software framework. These approaches ranging from pragmatic to more rigorous solutions are applied to an 8 year time series with 21 individual epochs. The analysis of the respective results suggests that a sequence of bi-temporal adjustments brings the best results while being more flexible and computationally viable than the most extensive approach of using all epochs in one single multi-temporal adjustment. With a combination of sparse control patches measured in the field and one selected reference block, we obtain relative datum discrepancies in the range of 1-2 cm for the complete time series. Based on our findings, we formulate design criteria for setting up and adjusting future time series with the proposed method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3c5caa5daf62778c6b131a33aa5636f5ab14bee0536184731a7b73364ec9d9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
