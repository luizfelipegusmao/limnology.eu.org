{"title":"Two different viral proteins suppress NUCLEAR FACTOR-YC-mediated antiviral immunity during infection in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/850/7603417?rss=1","date":1707350400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant viruses have multiple strategies to counter and evade the host’s antiviral immune response. However, limited research has been conducted on the antiviral defense mechanisms commonly targeted by distinct types of plant viruses. In this study, we discovered that NUCLEAR FACTOR-YC (NF-YC) and NUCLEAR FACTOR-YA (NF-YA), 2 essential components of the NF-Y complex, were commonly targeted by viral proteins encoded by 2 different rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span> L.) viruses, rice stripe virus (RSV, <span>Tenuivirus</span>) and southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV, <span>Fijivirus</span>). In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that OsNF-YCs associate with OsNF-YAs and inhibit their transcriptional activation activity, resulting in the suppression of OsNF-YA-mediated plant susceptibility to rice viruses. Different viral proteins RSV P2 and SRBSDV SP8 directly disrupted the association of OsNF-YCs with OsNF-YAs, thereby suppressing the antiviral defense mediated by OsNF-YCs. These findings suggest an approach for conferring broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice and reveal a common mechanism employed by viral proteins to evade the host’s antiviral defense by hindering the antiviral capabilities of OsNF-YCs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"dfc273e483bf7b840f39caf37d80f857a009b56d326f9944deae3c8c1fb99136","category":"Environment"}
