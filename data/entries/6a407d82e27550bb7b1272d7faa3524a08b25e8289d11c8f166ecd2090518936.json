{"title":"At the Intersection of Science and Education: The Process of Scientists and Educators Co‐developing Authentic Learning Experiences for K‐16 Students","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lob.10627?af=R","date":1715409024000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Students lose interest in science as they progress from elementary to high school. There is a need for authentic, place-based science learning experiences that can increase students' interest in science. Scientists have unique skillsets that can complement the work of educators to create exciting experiences that are grounded in pedagogy and science practices. As scientists and educators, we co-developed a lesson plan for high school students on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a historically underserved coastal area, that demonstrated realistic scientific practices in students' local estuaries. After implementation of the lesson plan, we observed that students had a deeper understanding of ecosystem processes compared to their peers who had not been involved, were enthusiastic about sharing their experiences, and had a more well-rounded ability to think like a scientist than before the lesson plan. We share our experiences and five best practices that can serve as a framework for scientists and educators who are motivated to do similar work. Through collaboration, scientists and educators have the potential to bolster student science identities and increase student participation in future scientific endeavors.</p>","author":"Kayleigh Granville, \nCora Baird, \nCharles Carlson, \nPeter Berg","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Bulletin: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4067ad97a51cc8dc25fbbbaa2160150c28c0da1c950424683ce4f339a8ef5bff","entryHash":"6a407d82e27550bb7b1272d7faa3524a08b25e8289d11c8f166ecd2090518936","category":"Environment"}
