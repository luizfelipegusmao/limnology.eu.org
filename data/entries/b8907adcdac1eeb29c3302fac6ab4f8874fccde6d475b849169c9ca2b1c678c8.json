{"title":"GABALAGEN Alleviates Stress-Induced Sleep Disorder in Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0562/v1","date":1718009128000,"content":"(1) Background: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the inhibitory neurotransmitters with beneficial effects including sedative property. However, despite various clinical trials, scientific evidence regarding the impact of orally ingested GABA, whether natural or synthesized through biological pathways, on sleep is not clear.; (2) Methods: The present study work evaluated GABA-A biding affinity of GABALAGEN(GBL), a low-molecular-weight collagen infused with GABA, through receptor binding assays. The sedative effects of GBL were investigated through electroencephalography (EEG) analysis in the electro foot shock (EFS) stress-induced sleep animal model and then we examined the expression orexin, GABAA receptor in the brain region using immunohistochemistry.; (3) Results: We found that on the binding assay, GBL displayed high affinity to GABAA receptor (IC50 value, 31.5Âµg/mL)). Also, after treatment of GBL, percent of total time of REM and NREM were significantly and dose-dependently increased compared to the Con group. Consistent with behavioral results, the GBL-treated groups showed that the expression of GABAA receptor immune-positive cells in the VLPO were markedly and dose-dependently increased compared to the Con group. Also, the GBL-treated groups showed that the expression of orexin immune-reactive cells in the LH were significantly decreased compared to the Con group.; (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, GBL showed efficacy and potential to be used as an anti-stress therapy to treat sleep deprivation through antagonism of GABA receptors and consequent inhibition of orexin activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8907adcdac1eeb29c3302fac6ab4f8874fccde6d475b849169c9ca2b1c678c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
