{"title":"Nuclear Receptors and Stress Response Pathways Associated with the Development of Oral Mucositis Induced by Antineoplastic Agents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0696/v1","date":1720500719000,"content":"Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the common adverse events associated with cancer treatment that decreases quality of life and affects treatment outcome. However, the medications used to manage OM are generally only palliative, and our knowledge of the syndrome is limited. The etiology of the syndrome is thought to be complex and multifactorial. We investigated the trends and characteristics of OM and estimated molecular initiating events (MIEs) associated with the development of the syndrome using FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. The study of trends and characteristics suggested that OM is significantly more likely to occur in females and nonelderly patients and is likely to be induced by protein kinase inhibitors such as afatinib and everolimus. Next, we used Toxicity Predictor, an in-house quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship system, to estimate OM-associated MIEs. The results revealed that agonist activity of human pregnane X receptor, thyroid-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone receptor, and androgen receptor may be associated with OM development. Our study findings are expected to help avoid the risk of OM induction during the drug discovery process and clinical use of antineoplastic agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4c97a4402eb347041823f7e9372c2c3bc9e27a9c589e6884df0fac907cdcc55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
