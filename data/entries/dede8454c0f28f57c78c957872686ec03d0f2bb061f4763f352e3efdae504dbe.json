{"title":"On Duality Principles and Concerned Convex Dual Formulations Applied to a Non-Linear Plate Theory and Related Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0460/v4","date":1726562814000,"content":"This article develops duality principles applicable to originally non-convex primal variational formulations. More specifically, as a first application, we establish a convex dual approximate variational formulation for a non-linear Kirchhoff-Love plate model. The results are obtained through basic tools of functional analysis, calculus of variations, duality and optimization theory in infinite dimensional spaces. We emphasize such a convex dual approximate formulation obtained may be applied to a large class of similar models in the calculus of variations. Finally, in the last section, we present a duality principle and respective convex dual formulation for a Ginzburg-Landau type equation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dede8454c0f28f57c78c957872686ec03d0f2bb061f4763f352e3efdae504dbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
