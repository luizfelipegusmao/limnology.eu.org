{"title":"Hydraulic Fracture Closure Detection Techniques: A Comprehensive Review.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0725/v1","date":1723213415000,"content":"This study reviews methods for detecting fracture closure pressure in both unconventional and conventional reservoirs using mathematical models and fluid flow equations. It evaluates tech-niques such as the Nolte method, tangent method, and compliance method. The investigation re-lies on observing changes in fluid flow regimes from pre-closure to post-closure, using fluid flow equations to examine the post-closure flow regime effect on the G function. Reverse calculations model pressure decline across synthesized flow regimes, facilitating a detailed investigation of the closure process. The analysis reveals that the tangent method is sensitive to post-closure fluid flow, while the compliance method is less effective in reservoirs with significant tortuosity or natural fractures. The paper recommends assessing natural fractures' characteristics and perme-ability to identify the source of leak-off before selecting a technique. It proposes integrating vari-ous methods for a comprehensive understanding of subsurface formations, combining their strengths for accurate fracture closure identification and better understanding of subsurface formations. The new proposed workflow employs the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) technique for fracture closure detection, avoiding physical model pre-assumptions or simplifica-tions to confirm the results. This approach offers guidance on selecting appropriate methods by integrating different techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aeff825bb2c5be9038fa87c1190044cc3374f6598b370285095610e595da3230","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
