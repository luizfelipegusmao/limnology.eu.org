Conventionally, it has been widely believed that larger grain sizes are preferable in photovoltaic devices, as grain boundaries are often defective and act as sources of carrier traps, resulting in reduced solar cell efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.780-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.780-B3\">3</a>]. However, it has been overlooked that grain enlargement can generate other types of defects within grains, such as twin boundaries and stacking faults which also have the potential to adversely affect device efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.780-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.780-B5\">5</a>]. A detail understanding of the microstructural origin of device efficiency has been limited because the inherent sensitivity of MHPs to electron beams makes it challenging to obtain reliable information on intragrain defect structures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.780-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eaf8bfc7bca182f54b8d4003e483d56f462e8aef048b6de295ac0abffb3e4ead","category":"Environment"}
