{"title":"Intra-chloroplast proteases: A holistic network view of chloroplast proteolysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3116/7694349?rss=1","date":1718582400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Different proteases and peptidases are present within chloroplasts and nonphotosynthetic plastids to process precursor proteins and to degrade cleaved chloroplast transit peptides and damaged, misfolded, or otherwise unwanted proteins. Collectively, these proteases and peptidases form a proteolysis network, with complementary activities and hierarchies, and build-in redundancies. Furthermore, this network is distributed across the different intra-chloroplast compartments (lumen, thylakoid, stroma, envelope). The challenge is to determine the contributions of each peptidase (system) to this network in chloroplasts and nonphotosynthetic plastids. This will require an understanding of substrate recognition mechanisms, degrons, substrate, and product size limitations, as well as the capacity and degradation kinetics of each protease. Multiple extra-plastidial degradation pathways complement these intra-chloroplast proteases. This review summarizes our current understanding of these intra-chloroplast proteases in Arabidopsis and crop plants with an emphasis on considerations for building a qualitative and quantitative network view.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"f0b761f135add8139571d3a47412f910e6af2298cdd5ac2d655e46b38f0fd16b","category":"Environment"}
