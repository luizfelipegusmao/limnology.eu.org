{"title":"Plant Obliviousness to Plant Consciousness Through Knowledge Gap Bridging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0192/v1","date":1719911620000,"content":"Plant conciousness is a scenario where people imbibe the culture of engaging plants as a constant part of their day to day activity. The earth supports both plants and animals, but , plants unlike animals are unable to express themselves by shouting, nagging or crying, e.t.c. They are only able to response saliently thus making them oblivious and constantly neglected. Unfortunately, plants play just as much major roles in sustaining the earth as much as people and animals do. The proper handling of plants is much reliant on the ‘’Plant consciousness or obliviousness’’ of people including both the young and the old. Are people well aware of plants, how important they are to the earth, the environment and it sustenance?, the answer is not enough. There is a need for plant knowledge bridges to create more and adequate awareness about plants, their importance, how they should be handled, how they should be cared for, and an understanding that they are partners for the sustaining our dying world. We seek to change this obvious lack of appreciation and understanding of plants, but how can this be done? We discuss methodologies that have and can been used for bridging this knowledge gap to ensure that our world is safe by protecting and caring for plants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad24c784a662d39d459e1d2eb5142bf50a021503c21196ef6518bfd9b27fb9b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
