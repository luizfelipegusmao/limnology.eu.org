Teodoro</p>\r\n\r\nWe hypothesized that after synovial injury, collagen V (Col V) expose occult antigens, and Col V autoantibodies develop, indicating the loss of immune tolerance against this molecule, thus leading to damage to mesenchymal-derived cells as well as the extracellular matrix in experimental arthritis. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of oral administration of Col V on the synovium after the development of inflammation in mBSA/CFA-induced arthritis. After fourteen days of intraarticular administration of mBSA, 10 male Lewis rats were orally administered Col V (500 μg/300 μL) diluted in 0.01 N acetic acid (IA-Col V group). The arthritic group (IA group, n = 10) received only intraarticular mBSA. An intra-articular saline injection (20 μL) was given to the control group (CT-Col V, n = 5). IA group presented damaged synovia, the expansion of the extracellular matrix by cellular infiltrate, which was characterized by T and B lymphocytes, and fibroblastic infiltration. In contrast, after Col V oral immunotherapy IA-Col V group showed a significant reduction in synovial inflammation and intense expression of IL-10+ and FoxP3+ cells, in addition to a reduction in Col V and an increase in Col I in the synovia compared to those in the IA group. Furthermore, an increase in IL-10 production was detected after IA-Col V group spleen cell stimulation with Col V <i>in vitro</i>. PET imaging did not differ between the groups. The evaluation of oral treatment with Col V, after mBSA/CFA-induced arthritis in rats, protects against inflammation and reduces synovial tissue damage, through modulation of the synovial matrix, showing an immunotherapeutic potential in inhibiting synovitis.","author":"Lizandre Keren Ramos da Silveira","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"194b29fbf13535bc299724419f57270c10479a06bfc9ddc18e047520a582b485","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
