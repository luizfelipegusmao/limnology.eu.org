{"title":"Characterization and Stability Study of a Fluoride Toothpaste with Organic Abrasive from Acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) Seeds for Oral Hygiene Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0762/v1","date":1725950830000,"content":"Açai is a fruit common in the northern region of Brazil, and its consumption is primarily focused on culinary uses, resulting in the disposal of its seeds and contributing to environmental pollution. In this context, the objective of this study was to obtain, characterize, and perform a stability study of a toothpaste made from acai seeds as an organic abrasive for oral hygiene use. The depulped acai seeds were subjected to drying, grinding, and sieving to achieve the desired granulometry before being added to the other formulation components. Stability tests were conducted through cen-trifugation, density determination, acidity index, foam formation, FTIR, TG/DTG, rheological properties, and accelerated stability study. The formulation proved stable after the centrifugation test. The obtained density value was 1.36. The acidity value was 0.1720 mg/KOH, and the initial and final foam indices were 66.66%. TG/DTG analysis showed stability around 90°C. The acai tooth-paste exhibited pseudoplastic fluid behavior. The pH ranged from 6.5 to 8.08, and it showed good stability under the study conditions. Thus, the acai seed powder was found to be an acceptable organic abrasive for incorporation into toothpastes, and it demonstrated favorable characteristics for daily use in oral hygiene.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adc8e1d99f532b90b59ba473bb99a98877b11f6488fb6a53c40095f7b19cdedb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
