{"title":"Wearable Antennas in Medical Applications: A Comprehensive Review of Design, Performance, Safety, and Clinical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0624/v1","date":1715268162000,"content":"Wearable antennas are increasingly vital in modern healthcare, facilitating continuous monitoring and communication for medical purposes. These antennas are integrated into wearable devices, allowing for the transmission and reception of vital health data, such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure, to medical professionals or monitoring systems in real time. This instantaneous data transmission enables timely interventions, thus improving the quality of healthcare services. This review aims to comprehensively synthesize recent research from reputable databases, focusing on the functionality and effectiveness of wearable antennas in medical applications. The primary objectives of each study were categorized, including antenna design and integration, the performance of medical wearable antenna technology, safety considerations in wearable antenna biomedicine, and the use of antennas in clinical applications and their impact. This synthesis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to develop and deploy wearable antennas in medical settings, ultimately enhancing healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf7a0f760b9796223c736c1ac9223406bc0536078019518d252a5c396fca00e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
