{"title":"“In the dry season, our suffering doubles”: Barriers to water access in poor urban settlements in Ghana","link":"https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000265","date":1726668000000,"content":"<p>by Willow Leahy, Meshack Achore, Florence Dery</p>\r\n\r\nIf current trends of water insecurity continue, nearly two-thirds of the world’s population will live in water-scarce conditions by 2025. Nevertheless, qualitative studies on barriers to water access, particularly in informal settlements, remain limited. This study used in-depth interviews to examine the daily barriers to water access faced by urban poor households in Ghana. A total of 30 (n = 30) semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with residents in water-insecure areas in Tamale and Accra, Ghana. Four themes emerged from our analysis: lack of financial resources, distance and travel time, land and topography, and poor water infrastructure. Sustainable Development Goal Six cannot be achieved if the water needs of the urban poor, particularly those who dwell in informal settlements, are unmet. Thus, governments and systems must implement measures to eliminate inequalities and inequities in water distribution.","author":"Willow Leahy","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"4e1c4b1ee1045bfb1d8df5495308472d97b5ba4666405120a6c7a03bea40fabe","category":"Environment"}
