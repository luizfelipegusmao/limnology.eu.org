{"title":"Complements to Existing Implementations of Quantum Information Processing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1692/v1","date":1724488849000,"content":"Two approaches are being proposed to complements existing practical implementations of quantum information processing; (a) Multiplexed Michelson interferometry for Linear Optical quantum computation which should in principle split further an initially split beam to yield new sets of beams which are scalable to multiple interferometric outputs beyond just the dual output in Mach Zehnder interferometry. Generally Interferometry is applied in quantum computation particularly linear optical quantum computation schemes such as K.L.M protocol using the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, however a multiplexed Michelson interferometry enables the production of scalable cross-correlated beams making it suitable for optical multi-qubit operations. (b) Coupled LDR Circuits for Quantum emulation which can model cross correlation and probabilistic qubit states to enable parallelization and Gating on Classical electrical circuits. The system is to be designed as a network of electrical circuits coupled to each other using electrical coupling elements and are equipped with a light dependent resistor (LDR) alternatively referred to as photo-resistor to provide variable resistance in response to varied intensity of incident light. The maximum threshold current state which is being defined for the circuit and a minimum current state corresponds to 1 and 0 binary states respectively, however an intermediate current state models a superposition of 1 &amp; 0. Likewise varying the intermediate current values closer to either 1 or 0 is akin to a probability rotation of the qubit states which is achieved by varying resistance using the LDR where the multi-circuit coupling interaction helps emulates cross-correlation of multi-qubit systems. The proposed system can be useful at least as a tool for informative applications in a classical framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90b5db6ed6030576ec277da432000f1cb97dee218ac8fce64a59b7699ddd9a63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
