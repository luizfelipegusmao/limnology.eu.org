{"title":"Upstream experience and experimental translocation of invasive bigheaded carps results in increased upstream passage success at a navigation lock in a large river","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4253?af=R","date":1715076409000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fish movements in regulated rivers can be challenging to study because anthropogenic modifications, such as locks and dams, can influence animal behavior. Upper Mississippi River Lock and Dam 19 (LD 19), for example, is an invasive carp movement bottleneck due to an impassable dam. Upstream fish passage at LD19 is restricted to the lock chamber, making it an optimal location to test invasive fish deterrents that could limit further range expansion. Evaluating the effectiveness of experimental deterrents requires baseline knowledge of fish movements and suitable sample sizes of fish encountering the deterrents to ensure adequate statistical power. Some evidence indicates fish with prior upstream experience may return upstream or challenge potential deterrents at a higher rate than fish without such experience. To test how previous upstream experience could increase the rate at which fish moved upstream through a navigation lock chamber, we compared upstream passage through LD 19 using bigheaded carp captured below the dam (downstream-origin) and two groups of bigheaded carp captured upstream from the dam: those that swam downstream on their own volition (upstream-origin fish) and those that were captured upstream and translocated downstream of LD 19 (translocated upstream-origin). Translocated upstream-origin carp demonstrated the highest rate of upstream passage, with 59% of the fish detected downstream from LD 19 passing upstream during our study. In contrast, downstream-origin carp made no upstream passages over 2 years. Fish origin was shown to influence upstream passage success. This may be an important consideration for fish passage studies and deterrent evaluations.</p>","author":"Andrea K. Fritts, \nDaniel K. Gibson‐Reinemer, \nBrent C. Knights, \nAmanda S.
