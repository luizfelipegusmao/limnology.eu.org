However, the molecular mechanism of Xinnaotongluo liquid is not completely understood. H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) was used to simulate damage to cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction in vitro. The biological indicators of H9c2 cells were measured by cell counting kit-8, enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay, and western blot assay. In H/R-induced H9c2 cells, a markedly reduced murine double minute 2 (MDM2) was observed. However, the addition of Xinnaotongluo liquid increased MDM2 expression in H/R-induced H9c2 cells. And MDM2 overexpression strengthened the beneficial effects of Xinnaotongluo liquid on H9c2 cells from the perspective of alleviating oxidative damage, cellular inflammation, apoptosis and ferroptosis of H/R-induced H9c2 cells. Moreover, MDM2 overexpression reduced the protein expression of p53 and Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 3 (STEAP3). Whereas, STEAP3 overexpression hindered the function of MDM2-overexpression in H/R-induced H9c2 cells. Our results insinuated that Xinnaotongluo liquid could protect H9c2 cells from H/R-induced damage by regulating MDM2/STEAP3, which provide a potential theoretical basis for further explaining the working mechanism of Xinnaotongluo liquid.","author":"Jiankun Cui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8cfd12ae6e690d21c9c8bfd4939f2bd17f5863f13c357c1a022156ef9848d84c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
