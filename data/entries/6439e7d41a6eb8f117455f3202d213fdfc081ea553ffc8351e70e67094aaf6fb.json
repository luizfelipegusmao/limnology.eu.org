{"title":"Perspectives for Photocatalytic Decomposition of Environmental Pollutants and Pathogens on Photoactive Particles of Soil Minerals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1257/v1","date":1713505986000,"content":"The literature shows that both in laboratory and in industrial conditions, photocatalytic oxidation method copes quite well with the degradation of the most organic substances, including environmental toxins and molecular components of pathogenic microorganisms. However, the effective utilization of photocatalytic processes for environmental decontamination and disinfection require significant technological advancement both in the area of semiconductor material synthesis and its application. Here we focused on the presence and ‘photocatalytic capability‘ of photocatalysts among soil minerals, and their potential contribution to the environmental decontamination in vitro and in vivo. (The issue is sketched from the perspective of chemists and environmental scientist.) Reactions caused by sunlight on the soil surface are involved in its normal redox activity. It appears that some of them may take part in the soil decontamination. However, their importance for decontamination in vivo cannot be overstated due to diversity of soils on the Earth caused by the environmental conditions, such as climate, parent material, relief, vegetation etc. The solar-light induced reactions are just a part of extremely complicated processes dependent on a plethora of environmental determinates. Such multiplicity of affecting factors, which we tried to sketch from the perspective of chemists and environmental scientist, makes us rather sceptical about the effectiveness of the photocatalytic processes in vivo. On the other hand, there is a huge potential of the soils as the alternative source of useful photocatalytic materials of unique properties","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6439e7d41a6eb8f117455f3202d213fdfc081ea553ffc8351e70e67094aaf6fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
