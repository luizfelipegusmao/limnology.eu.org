{"title":"Synthesizing perspectives: Crafting an Interdisciplinary view of social media’s impact on young people’s mental health","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307164","date":1721052000000,"content":"<p>by John Maltby, Thooba Rayes, Antara Nage, Sulaimaan Sharif, Maryama Omar, Sanjiv Nichani</p>\r\n\r\nThis study explores the intricate relationship between social media usage and the mental health of young individuals by leveraging the insights of 492 UK school headteachers. It adopts a novel multidisciplinary approach, integrating perspectives from psychology, sociology, education studies, political science, philosophy, media studies, linguistics, social work, anthropology, and health sciences. The application of thematic analysis, powered by ChatGPT-4, identifies a predominantly negative perspective on the impact of social media on young people, focusing on key themes across various disciplines, including mental health, identity formation, social interaction and comparison, bullying, digital literacy, and governance policies. These findings culminated in the development of the five-factor Comprehensive Digital Influence Model, suggesting five key themes (Self-Identity and Perception Formation, Social Interaction Skills and Peer Communication, Mental and Emotional Well-Being, Digital Literacy, Critical Thinking, and Information Perception, and Governance, Policy, and Cultural Influence in Digital Spaces) to focus the impacts of social media on young peoples’ mental health across primary and secondary educational stages. This study not only advances academic discourse across multiple disciplines but also provides practical insights for educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals, seeking to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by social media in the digital era.","author":"John Maltby","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fa7ef751e5316715bcac9ebb5ce30ea74a0c7c61a788b9b844d594185ad83ce9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
