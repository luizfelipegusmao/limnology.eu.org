This enhanced conductivity is attributed to the low solubility of Ag in Cu and vice versa. Additionally, their remarkable strength, which surpasses what would be expected from a simple rule-of-mixture calculation for Cu and Ag, is credited to the abundance of nanosized Ag fibers. These fibers predominantly originate from small silver particles within the as-cast composites. To achieve optimal properties in the final product, a detailed examination of the microstructure of the cast composites at the nanoscale or even atomic scale is essential [<a href=\"#ozae044.1005-B4\">4</a>]. Past investigations have revealed the complexity of the microstructure in Cu-Ag composites. Therefore, comprehensive characterization demands a thorough analysis of the microstructure in three dimensions (3D) and a deep understanding of the interfaces at the atomic level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ca3dbc5969bc8cccd69e717ccc9479fa1d55a809a11021185cdae5a22935f9d5","category":"Environment"}
