A pilot study was conducted to compare the use of methanol and glycerol as external carbon sources for an IFAS PdNA startup, with a goal to optimize nitrogen removal while minimizing carbon usage. The study also investigated the establishment of anammox bacteria on virgin carriers in IFAS reactors without the use of seeding, and it is the first IFAS PdNA startup to use methanol as an external carbon source. The establishment of anammox bacteria was confirmed in both reactors 102 days after startup. Although the glycerol-fed reactor achieved a higher steady-state maximum ammonia removal rate because of anammox bacteria (1.6 ± 0.3 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day) in comparison with the methanol-fed reactor (1.2 ± 0.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day), both the glycerol- and methanol-fed reactors achieved similar average in situ ammonia removal rates of 0.39 ± 0.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day and 0.40 ± 0.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day, respectively. Additionally, when the upstream ammonia versus NOx (AvN) control system maintained an ideal ratio of 0.40–0.50 g/g, the methanol-fed reactor attained a lower average effluent TIN concentration (3.50 ± 1.2 mg/L) than the glycerol-fed reactor (4.43 ± 1.6 mg/L), which was prone to elevated nitrite concentrations in the effluent. Overall, this research highlights the potential for PdNA in IFAS configurations as an efficient and cost-saving method for wastewater treatment, with methanol as a viable carbon source for the establishment of anammox bacteria.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nMethanol is an effective external carbon source for an anammox startup that avoids the need for costly alternative carbon sources.\nThe methanol-fed reactor demonstrated higher TIN removal compared with the glycerol-fed reactor because of less overproduction of nitrite.\nAnammox bacteria was established in an IFAS reactor without seeding and used internally stored carbon to reduce external carbon addition.\nControlling the influent ammonia versus NOx (AvN) ratio between 0.40 and 0.50 g/g allowed for low and stable TIN effluent conditions.\n</p>","author":"Megan Bachmann, \nMike Parsons, \nStephanie Klaus, \nHalil Kurt, \nKartik Chandran, \nDaniel Stockard, \nGeorge Wells, \nHaydee De Clippeleir, \nCharles Bott","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"32a0d064c594bc34cef2eff5dd2e77d0d86dbda6131c06d39ef637873948c21d","category":"Environment"}
