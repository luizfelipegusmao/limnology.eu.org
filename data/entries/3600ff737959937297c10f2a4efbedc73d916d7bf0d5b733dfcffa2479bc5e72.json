{"title":"Efficacy of Commercial Biocontrol Products for Management of Verticillium and Fusarium Wilt in Greenhouse Tomatoes: Impact on Disease Severity, Fruit Yield, and Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0587/v1","date":1715248943000,"content":"Verticillium dahliae (Vd) and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) are two major fungal pathogens that infect tomato plants, causing significant challenges in their control since both pathogens can persist in the soil for several years even in the absence of a host plant and no effective fungicides are available at present. This study investigated the efficacy of two biocontrol formulations, Clonotri and Strepse, against Vd and Fol, and their impact on tomato fruit quality and yield under greenhouse conditions. Pathogenicity experiment demonstrated that the Clonotri formulation, containing Trichoderma and Clonostachys spores, significantly reduced Fusarium wilt disease by 32% compared to the control group. However, in Vd pathogenicity experiment, the formulations did not exhibit disease reduction, although the treatment with Strepse, containing Streptomyces and Pseudomonas microorganisms, resulted in preserved total fruit number when compared to uninfected plants. Analysis of fruit quality attributes revealed no significant differences among the various interventions. Furthermore, Fol infection in the first fruit set significantly increased fruit firmness, while Vd infection resulted in elevated levels of total soluble solids in fruits. These findings demonstrate that the evaluated biocontrol formulations provide a degree of protection against fungal wilt pathogens in tomato plants and can increase yield in greenhouse conditions, while having minimal impact on overall fruit quality attributes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3600ff737959937297c10f2a4efbedc73d916d7bf0d5b733dfcffa2479bc5e72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
