Known as transmission scanning electron microscopy (TSEM), this method is a valuable approach that links SEM and high-voltage transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TSEM integrates the flexibility of SEM, such as high sample throughput and lower operational costs, with the advantageous imaging capabilities of transmitted electrons. It is an alternative to TEM or high voltage scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in applications where atomic resolution is not needed [<a href=\"#ozae044.324-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"008b116850597c41a74f2beb7c34bfda54ccae967b0be0233d03c8cadf3b7c93","category":"Environment"}
