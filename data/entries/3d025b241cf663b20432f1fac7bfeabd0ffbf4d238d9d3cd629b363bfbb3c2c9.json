The root economics space, defined by root functional traits, reflects a plant's nutrient acquisition strategy. However, the combined effects of warming and parasitism on root functional traits and their positions within the root economics space have not been extensively studies.\n\nWe grew soybean plants in pot cultures outdoor in the absence or presence of parasitism by <i>Cuscuta gronovii</i> and with or without simulated climate warming using infrared heater lamps. We measured various root functional traits of soybean, including root morphological traits, symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and rhizobia and enzyme activity. Correlations among these traits were analysed, and principal component analysis was used to determine the position of the plants in the root economics space.\n\nParasitism significantly reduced AMF colonization rate, nodule biomass, root tissue density (RTD) and phosphatase activity in the rhizosheath, while increasing root nitrogen concentration (RN). Nodule biomass was positively correlated with AMF colonization, indicating an ‘outsourcing’ strategy for nutrient foraging. Parasitized soybeans occupied a trait space with higher RN and lower RTD, indicative of a ‘fast’ nutrient acquisition strategy. Warming did not significantly affect root functional traits or the plants' positions in the root economics space, regardless of parasitism presence.\n\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that rhizobial colonization, similar to AMF colonization, is part of the ‘outsourcing’ strategy and that parasitism shifts host plants from a ‘slow’ to a ‘fast’ nutrient uptake strategy. These findings provide new insights into plant below-ground strategies under warming and parasitism.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/09/10/parasitic-plants-shift-host-plants-from-a-slow-to-a-fast-nutrient-uptake-strategy/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Yongge Yuan, \nMark van Kleunen, \nJunmin Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"3d025b241cf663b20432f1fac7bfeabd0ffbf4d238d9d3cd629b363bfbb3c2c9","category":"Environment"}
