{"title":"Two species of the green algae <i>Volvox</i> sect. <i>Volvox</i> from the Japanese ancient lake, Lake Biwa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310549","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Hisayoshi Nozaki, Ryo Matsuzaki, Koichi Shimotori, Noriko Ueki, Wirawan Heman, Wuttipong Mahakham, Haruyo Yamaguchi, Yuuhiko Tanabe, Masanobu Kawachi</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Volvox</i> sect. <i>Volvox</i> is a group of green algae with unique morphological features (thick cytoplasmic bridges between somatic cells and spiny zygote walls) and a worldwide distribution. Despite research interest in the diversity of organisms in ancient lakes, <i>Volvox</i> sect. <i>Volvox</i> from ancient lakes worldwide has not been identified to the species level. Here, we established clonal cultures of two species of this group originating from Lake Biwa, an ancient lake in Japan, and performed identification based on morphological and molecular data. One was identified as <i>Volvox kirkiorum</i> based on the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal spacer region (ITS) sequence, bisexual (monoicous or monoecious) spheroids, and zygote morphology. The other showed genetic separation from related species based on the secondary structure of the ITS and results of phylogenetic analysis of a combined data set from the nuclear <i>actin</i> gene, ITS, and two plastid genes (large subunit of RuBisCO and photosystem II CP43 apoprotein gene); it represented a new phylogenetic lineage within <i>Volvox</i> sect. <i>Volvox</i>, suggesting possible endemism in Lake Biwa. This species produced bisexual spheroids with different zygote morphology and zygote number from other species with bisexual spheroids in <i>Volvox</i> sect. <i>Volvox</i>. Therefore, <i>Volvox biwakoensis</i> Nozaki et H. Yamaguchi sp. nov. is described herein. This is the first endemic species of the genus <i>Volvox</i> described from an ancient lake.","author":"Hisayoshi Nozaki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"88f43854072169613d6f70e81ee5682bf92f10aee6417e3944bf222a5a7d6d09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
