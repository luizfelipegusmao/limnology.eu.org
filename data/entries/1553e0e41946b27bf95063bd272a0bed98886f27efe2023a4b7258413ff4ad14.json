{"title":"PSIII-6 Multi-sire artificial insemination of beef heifers in the Nebraska Sandhills effect on pregnancy rate compared with single-sire insemination","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/499/7757776?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to compare pregnancy outcomes resulting from artificial insemination (AI) with multi-sire semen (MS) compared with single-sire semen (SS) in beef heifers. Another study observed pregnancy and paternity outcomes to sexed MS without a control treatment. In the first study, unrelated ABS Global Angus bulls (n = 3) were selected for AI to 441 (Yr 1) and 391 (Yr 2) Angus crossbred heifers. Heifers were synchronized with the melengestrol acetate – prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> timed-AI protocol. Conventional semen, from each bull, were labeled A, B, or C. Remaining semen was pooled in equal amounts to form conventional MS straws. Heifers were AI using alternating treatment of MS or SS: A, B, or C with one-half of inseminated heifers receiving either MS or SS. The GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4 analyzed responses to treatments using the BIN distribution option and reported as LSMEANS. Contrasts and estimates analyzed responses between treatments. Ultrasound determined SS pregnancy rate averaged 60% (SS-A = 64%, SS-B = 58%, SS-C = 58%) and MS average 62% (<span>P</span> = 0.63). Paternity was determined in 57 MS calves and confirmed in 49 SS calves. In Yr 1, Bull A sired 7%, bull B sired 56%, and bull C sired 37%. Although bull A was much less successful than bull B or C, the values are not significantly different due to the small sample size (<span>P</span> = 0.11 and <span>P</span> = 0.24, respectively). Few conclusions can be made from the ongoing study, but it is hypothesized MS may improve consistency of pregnancy rate by equilibrating semen quality in herds subjected to timed AI. In the observational study, multiple 5-way cross bulls born from the ranch herd were selected for AI of 951 ± 41 heifers for 3 yr. Heifers were synchronized using the previously mentioned protocol with split-time AI. Unequal amounts of semen were collected, pooled, and sexed to favor heifer progeny at an expected ratio of 9:1. Semen from 2 to 4 random bulls were pooled making 3 to 4 MS groups each year. Heifers exhibiting estrus were administered sexed MS, but there was no control treatment. The observed ultrasound determined average pregnancy rate of heifers administered sexed MS was 65% (Yr 1), 75% (Yr 2), and 72% (Yr 3). Previous literature suggests average pregnancy rate to AI with sexed SS is 53%. Paternity testing in Yr 2 found semen contribution mirrored paternity ratios within some groups but the sire group with 2 bulls found one sired 15% and the other sired 85%. This study exemplified a viable method for AI that requires further research. Further research into semen quality of a single sire, and pooled semen could lead to optimization of fertilization among individuals within a herd.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1553e0e41946b27bf95063bd272a0bed98886f27efe2023a4b7258413ff4ad14","category":"Environment"}
