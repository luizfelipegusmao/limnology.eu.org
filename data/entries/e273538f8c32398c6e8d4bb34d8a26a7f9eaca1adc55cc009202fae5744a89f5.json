{"title":"The HOCl dry fog–is it safe for human cells?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304602","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Rafał Bogdan Lewandowski, Małgorzata Stępińska, Łukasz Osuchowski, Wiktoria Kasprzycka, Monika Dobrzyńska, Zygmunt Mierczyk, Elżbieta Anna Trafny</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aims to investigate if high-concentration HOCl fogging disinfection causes cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cultured primary human skin fibroblasts. The cells were exposed to a dry fog of HOCl produced from solutions with a concentration of 300 ppm (5.72 mM) or 500 ppm (9.53 mM). After four times when fibroblasts were exposed to aerosolized HOCl at a concentration of 500 ppm for 9 minutes, significant cytotoxicity and genotoxicity effects were observed. Significant changes in the morphology of fibroblasts and cell death due to membrane disruption were observed, independent of the number of exposures. Flow cytometry analyses performed under these experimental conditions indicated a decrease in the number of cells with an intact cell membrane in the exposed samples compared to the sham samples, dropping to 49.1% of the total cells. Additionally, under the same conditions, the neutral comet assay results demonstrated significant DNA damage in the exposed cells. However, no analogous damages were found when the cells were exposed to aerosolized HOCl generated from a 300-ppm solution for 3 minutes, whether once or four times. Therefore, we have concluded that aerosolized HOCl in dry fog, with a concentration exceeding 300 ppm, can cause cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on human skin fibroblasts.","author":"Rafał Bogdan Lewandowski","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e273538f8c32398c6e8d4bb34d8a26a7f9eaca1adc55cc009202fae5744a89f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
