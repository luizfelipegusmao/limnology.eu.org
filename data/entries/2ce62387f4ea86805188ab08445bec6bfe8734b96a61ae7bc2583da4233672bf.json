{"title":"FFA: Foreground Feature Approximation Digitally Against Remote Sensing Object Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1195/v1","date":1721092303000,"content":"In recent years, research on adversarial attack techniques for remote sensing object detection (RSOD) has made great progress. Still, most of the research nowadays is on end-to-end attacks, which mainly design adversarial perturbations based on the prediction information of the object detectors (ODs) to achieve the attack. These methods do not discover the common vulnerabilities of the ODs and thus the transferability is weak. Based on this, this paper proposes a foreground feature approximation (FFA) method to generate adversarial examples (AEs) that discover the common vulnerabilities of the ODs by changing the feature information carried by the image itself to implement the attack. Specifically, firstly, the high-quality predictions are filtered as attacked objects using the detector, after which a hybrid image without any target is made, and the hybrid foreground is created based on the attacked targets. The images' shallow features are extracted using the backbone network, and the features of the input foreground are approximated towards the hybrid foreground to implement the attack. In contrast, the model predictions are used to assist in realizing the attack. In addition, we have found the effectiveness of FFA for targeted attacks, and replacing the hybrid foreground with the targeted foreground can realize targeted attacks. Extensive experiments with seven rotating ODs on the RSOD datasets DOTA and UCAS-AOD show that FFA achieves both targetless and targeted attacks with a high success rate and transferability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ce62387f4ea86805188ab08445bec6bfe8734b96a61ae7bc2583da4233672bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
