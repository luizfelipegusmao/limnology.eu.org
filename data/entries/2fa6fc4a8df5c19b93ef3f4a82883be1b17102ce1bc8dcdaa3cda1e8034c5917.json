{"title":"Wideband and High-Efficiency Transmit-Arrays Antenna with Wide-Angle Passive Beam-Scanning Operating in mmWave Bands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1432/v1","date":1721213252000,"content":"This paper presents a demonstration of a linearly-polarized transmit-arrays antenna with high-efficiency and wideband operating in X-band.  The topology of the unit cell consists of two identical patch antennas loaded by C-loop slot and interconnected by a metalized via through a ground plane sandwiched between two identical substrates [18]. A waveguide measurement system WGMS has been used for single cell characterization (reflection/transmission coefficients). Good results have been demonstrated in terms of matching performances; the reflection coefficient S11 is under 10-dB in the 9.4-10.4 GHz band (i.e. 10.1% around 9.9 GHz) and with only 0.35 dB-insertion loss at 10 GHz. The transmit-arrays prototype permitted to achieve 22.4 dBi of directivity and 20.1 dBi of gain. The aperture and radiation efficiencies are about 28.2% and 58.3%, respectively. With a focal ratio (F/D) of 1/2 the spill-over loss is less than 2 dB. Beam-scanning up to ± 35° has been achieved with the same phase quantization (passive) and less than 3 dB of gain losses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fa6fc4a8df5c19b93ef3f4a82883be1b17102ce1bc8dcdaa3cda1e8034c5917","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
