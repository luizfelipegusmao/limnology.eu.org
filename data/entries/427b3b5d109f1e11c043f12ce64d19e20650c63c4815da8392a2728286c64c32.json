{"title":"Microplastics and Morphometrics Relationship in Coastal Fish","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0792/v1","date":1723461995000,"content":"This study found microplastics in selected commercial fish species in Governor Generoso, Davao Oriental. A total of 80 samples of fish were taken from the nearshore area (0-5 km) and from the farshore area (6-15 km). The fish samples were taken by a handliner (with GPS tracker), then dissected in the laboratory to remove its gut. Microscope analysis of gut contents showed 4 microplastic fibers found in the 40 fish samples collected from 0-5 km and only 2 microplastic fibers in the 6-15 km, among the 80 fish samples collected. Moreover, fish morphometrics were not related to the number of microplastic ingestion, but to mouth size for fish from the nearshore (0-5 km) and pectoral fin for fish from the farshore (6-15 km). While this study is not conclusive given that only 6 microplastics were found, it supports the thesis that nearshore areas are sink of microplastics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"427b3b5d109f1e11c043f12ce64d19e20650c63c4815da8392a2728286c64c32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
