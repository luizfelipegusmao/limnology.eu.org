However, their effectiveness in combating high-temperature rutting and fatigue cracking in middle and lower layers is limited. To address this issue, a study optimized the incorporation of basalt fibers in different layers to improve road performance based on design specifications. Nine asphalt pavement structures with varying amounts of basalt fibers were assessed using an orthogonal test method. The optimal structure was determined considering factors such as fatigue life and overloading using the finite element method for modeling. Results showed that fiber dosage had a minimal impact on road surface bending subsidence and the location of tensile strain in the lower layer. Shear stresses were concentrated mainly at the outer edges of loads. Optimal dosages of basalt fiber were determined for different layers: 0.3% for the upper layer, 0.1% for the middle layer, and 0.3% for the lower layer. The optimal structure consists of a strong base with a thin-surfaced semi-rigid base layer, with 0.3% for the upper layer and 0.1% for the middle layer. This study provided valuable insights into designing basalt fiber asphalt pavement structures.","author":"Xiangbing Xie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d50832c3891c5158ed2a98b58f3a9b3a15815e457cb0acfddedb3ca6518abd82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
