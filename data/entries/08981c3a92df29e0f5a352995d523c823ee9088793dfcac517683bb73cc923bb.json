Several prior studies have observed crystallization behavior within the alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) system, especially when grown on beta gallium oxide (β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) [<a href=\"#ozae044.078-B1\">1-3</a>]. β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a promising next generation ultrawide band gap semiconductor, possessing a band gap of 4.8 eV and a tunable carrier concentration via an array of doping candidates [<a href=\"#ozae044.078-B4\">4</a>]. In an amorphous form, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has been extensively studied as an insulator in the semiconductor industry and specifically as a gate dielectric in β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.078-B5\">5-7</a>]. Understanding Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterointerfaces is vital for developing versatile β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> device applications, since Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>’s relation to β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> across an interface is of broad interest in the power electronics industry. The most stable alumina crystalline polymorph, α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a well understood crystal with the corundum structure (R-3c point group). The exact atomic structures of the other Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> polymorphs, however, are not as well understood [<a href=\"#ozae044.078-B8\">8-10</a>]. Monoclinic θ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has primarily been studied for applications in catalysis and was recently proposed to be a mixture of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-like monoclinic regions interspersed by perpendicular columns of octahedral Al atoms, creating a monoclinic structure not fully analogous to β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.078-B11\">11</a>]. In this study, we present some of the first examples of θ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> stabilization across a β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interface. Our prior studies have shown defect-free β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> near a Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> dielectric layer grown at 600°C [<a href=\"#ozae044.078-B12\">12</a>]. In these samples, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer was observed to be crystalline exactly along the interface and turning almost entirely amorphous stepping a few nanometers away from the β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interface.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"08981c3a92df29e0f5a352995d523c823ee9088793dfcac517683bb73cc923bb","category":"Environment"}
