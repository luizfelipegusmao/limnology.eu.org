{"title":"Sustainable and Reusable Modified Membrane Based on Green Gold Nanoparticles for Efficient Methylene Blue Water Decontamination by a Photocatalytic Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2239/v1","date":1725024861000,"content":"Methylene blue (MB) is a dye hazardous pollutant widely used in several industrial processes that represents a relevant source of water pollution. Thus, the research of new systems to avoid its environmental dispersion, represents an important goal. In this work, an efficient and sustainable nanocomposite material based on green gold nanoparticles for MB water remediation, was developed. Starting from reducing and stabilizing characteristics of compounds naturally present in Lambrusco winery waste (grape marc) extracts, green gold nanoparticles (GM-AuNPs) were synthesized and deposited on a supporting membrane to create an easy and stable system for water MB decontamination. GM-AuNPs, with a specific plasmonic band at 535 nm, and the modified membrane were firstly characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of two breeds of crystalline shapes, triangular platelets and round-shaped pentatwinned nanoparticles, respectively. The crystalline nature of GM-AuNPs was also confirmed from XRD. The photo-catalytic performance of the modified membrane was evaluated under natural sunlight radiation obtaining a complete MB degradation (100%) in 116 minutes. A pseudo-first-order kinetic described the photocatalytic process with a rate constant k equal to 0.044 Â± 0.010 min-1. The modified membrane demonstrated high stability since it was reused, without any treatment, for 3 months and for at least 20 cycles maintaining the same performances. GM-AuNPs-based membrane was also tested with other water pollutants (methyl orange, 4-nitrophenol and rhodamine B revealing a high selectivity towards MB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02ae168d08110d455bf92dff1d96b68ef42a87da934d116e63087da34d6334e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
