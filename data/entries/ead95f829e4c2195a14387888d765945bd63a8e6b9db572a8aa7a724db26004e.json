{"title":"A New Approach to Breast Specimen Orientation: Avoiding Pitfalls with the Specimen Plate Concept","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1232/v1","date":1721056658000,"content":"Accurate specimen marking is crucial during breast cancer surgery to avoid misorientation, which can cause inadequate re-excision and tumor recurrence. We studied marking methods at various breast cancer centers to create a tool that prevents specimen misorientation.\nAn online questionnaire surveyed marking procedures at major breast cancer centers in Hungary, and a tool was developed using a troubleshooting method.\nTwelve out of twenty units responded (60\\%). Nine use an institutionally standardized marking system. Only half of the surgical teams had clear specimen mammography images. Pathologists were unsure of specimen orientation in 5â€“10\\% of cases in over 75\\% of departments. Ambiguous marking methods caused orientation errors in half the cases, while unclear marking directions caused the rest. Most pathologists (85\\%) and surgeons (75\\%) believed that coronal plane specimen mammography would help solve the problem. A plastic specimen plate was developed to anchor breast tissue to a coronal breast scheme seen in mammographic images, providing clear localization information throughout the surgery process.\nThere is a lack of standardization in breast specimen orientation and marking in Hungary. An optimized orientation toolkit is being developed to ensure consistent interpretation of specimen mammograms by surgeons and pathologists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ead95f829e4c2195a14387888d765945bd63a8e6b9db572a8aa7a724db26004e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
