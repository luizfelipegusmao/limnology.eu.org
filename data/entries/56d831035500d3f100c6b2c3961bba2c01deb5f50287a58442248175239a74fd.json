{"title":"Neutralization and Binding Capability of SARS-CoV-2 Variants by/of IgG Antibodies of Early COVID-19 Convalescent Inactivated Sera based on Indirect ELISA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1313/v1","date":1716274061000,"content":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single stranded RNA virus which has resulted in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has infected millions of people all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 has been mutating rapidly resulting in the emergence of multiple variants to escape the host immune system mainly by mutations in its receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. This rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 posed a great challenge regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The RBD and full-length spike of SARS-CoV-2 is the main target of the neutralizing antibodies. Many SARS-CoV-2 variants are considered to have the potential to escape from the host immune system. In this study, the RBD of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa and Omicron and the full-length spike of BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4/5, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 Omicron variants were used as coating antigens in Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) to check the neutralization capability of COVID-19 convalescent sera from patients of first wave of infection occurring in Wuhan. Our results show that the currently circulating Omicron BQ.1.1, XBB.1.5 and previous Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5 do not show significant reduction in neutralization, while Omicron BA.3 and previous variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa, and Omicron showed a significantly reduced neutralization when compared to the wild-type Wuhan strain. These results indicate patients recovering from natural infection of early original Wuhan strain may have the potential to resist infection of current circulating variants and the vaccines using the prototype antigen may still working for newly emerged variants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56d831035500d3f100c6b2c3961bba2c01deb5f50287a58442248175239a74fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
