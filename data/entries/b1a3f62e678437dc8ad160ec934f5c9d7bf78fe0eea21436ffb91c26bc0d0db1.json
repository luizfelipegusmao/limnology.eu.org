{"title":"The association between major gastrointestinal cancers and red and processed meat and fish consumption: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the observational studies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305994","date":1719410400000,"content":"<p>by Jalal Poorolajal, Younes Mohammadi, Marzieh Fattahi-Darghlou, Fatemeh Almasi-Moghadam</p>\r\nBackground <p>The association between red meat, fish, and processed meat consumption and the risk of developing gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remains inconclusive despite several investigations. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to update the existing scientific evidence.</p> Methods <p>We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases until May 20, 2023. We analyzed observational studies that examined the associations between red and processed meat and fish consumption and GI cancers. We assessed between-study heterogeneity using the χ<sup>2</sup> and τ<sup>2</sup> tests, as well as I<sup>2</sup> statistics. We explored the likelihood of publication bias using Begg’s and Egger’s tests and trim-and-fill analysis. We reported the overall effect sizes as odds ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model.</p> Results <p>Of the 21,004 studies identified, 95 studies involving 5,794,219 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The consumption of high levels of red meat, as compared to low levels, was found to significantly increase the risk of developing esophageal, pancreatic, liver, colon, rectal, and colorectal cancers. Similarly, the consumption of high levels of processed meat, as compared to low levels, significantly increased the risk of pancreatic, colon, rectal, and colorectal cancers. In contrast, the consumption of high levels of fish, as compared to low levels, significantly reduced the risk of colon, rectal, and colorectal cancers.</p> Conclusions <p>This meta-analysis provides updated evidence on the association between red meat, processed meat, and fish consumption and the risk of developing five major types of GI cancers.</p>","author":"Jalal Poorolajal","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b1a3f62e678437dc8ad160ec934f5c9d7bf78fe0eea21436ffb91c26bc0d0db1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
