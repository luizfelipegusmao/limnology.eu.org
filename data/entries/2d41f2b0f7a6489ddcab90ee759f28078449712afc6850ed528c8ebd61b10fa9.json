Their high adaptability to diverse environments has led to an increase in the number of farms that are available for their production. However, long-term closed breeding adversely affects their reproductive performance, leading to a decrease in production efficiency. This is possibly caused by inbreeding depression. To investigate the root cause of this issue, the genetic diversity of captive North African catfish populations was assessed in this study. Microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequencing were applied to 136 catfish specimens, collected from three populations captured for breeding in Thailand. Interestingly, extremely low inbreeding coefficients were obtained within each population, and distinct genetic diversity was observed among the three populations, indicating that their genetic origins are markedly different. This suggests that outbreeding depression by genetic admixture among currently captured populations of different origins may account for the low productivity of the North African catfish in Thailand. Genetic improvement of the North African catfish populations is required by introducing new populations whose origins are clearly known. This strategy should be systematically integrated into breeding programs to establish an ideal founder stock for selective breeding.","author":"Chananya Patta","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2d41f2b0f7a6489ddcab90ee759f28078449712afc6850ed528c8ebd61b10fa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
