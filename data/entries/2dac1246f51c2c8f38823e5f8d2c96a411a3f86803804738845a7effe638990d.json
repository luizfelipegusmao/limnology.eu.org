{"title":"Classification of Non-IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity Reactions to Foods: An Up-to-Date Approach Focused on Mechanisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1966/v1","date":1729786945000,"content":"Adopting an immune response and tissue-based nomenclature in food allergies brings the field closer to precision and personalized medicine. An updated classification of non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity highlights mechanisms through a complex pathophysiological perspective and endotype-driven framework. This approach aligns with the essential goals of discovering new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, enhancing the understanding of clinical presentations, and refining immunotherapy and targeted treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drugs, to improve patient management and quality of life. Endotype-focused and molecular-based decision-making also endows translational and clinical research, fostering the ongoing scientific quest for more innovative solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dac1246f51c2c8f38823e5f8d2c96a411a3f86803804738845a7effe638990d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
