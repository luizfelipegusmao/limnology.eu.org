Midwives play a critical and unique role in ensuring communities receive quality and safe essential sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health services. A lack of knowledge exists on the availability and experiences of midwifery services in HFS. This manuscript provides an overview of the midwifery density in HFS and a synthesis of the experiences of women receiving midwifery care, and barriers and facilitators for midwives providing essential SRMNCAH services in HFS. Guided by an expert committee, a concurrent mixed methods approach was applied, using secondary analysis of primary quantitative and qualitative data sources. Quantitative analysis of the global distribution of midwives compared to fragility was undertaken. Qualitative analysis of experiences of receipt and provision of midwifery care was undertaken across four settings providing humanitarian care. There is a critically low density of midwives in humanitarian and fragile settings. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for the highest levels of fragility yet lowest density of midwives able to provide SRMNCAH services. Lack of finances both constrains midwives from effectively providing services and prevent communities from utilising services. Sub-optimal working conditions through rising workloads, insufficient and/or inconsistent resources were frequently reported to impede midwives from providing care in HFS. Uniquely for HFS, threats to the safety and security of midwives to conduct their work was widely reported. Key facilitators identified included, complex adaptive health system designs to respond effectively to the rapidly changing HFS environment, realisation of supporting “power, agency and status” as instrumental for midwives to provide quality care and promotion of community-centric approaches may enable continuity of care and uptake of essential SRMNCAH services. Midwives are critical to protect the health and well-being of communities. They require urgent protection and prioritisation in HFS areas where the need is greatest.","author":"T.
