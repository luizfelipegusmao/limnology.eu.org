If you have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a>, a plug tool is a good shout, and if you run rim brakes there’s no need for a disc brake rotor truing tool.</p>\n<p>But away from more specialist tools, here are the most basic tools that almost every rider will benefit from having on a multi-tool.</p>\n<h3>Hex keys</h3>\n<p>Or otherwise known as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/allen-keys-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Allen keys</a>. Look for a full array, in order to be covered for most eventualities. Most multi-tools come with 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8mm sizes and this should be more than enough for your bike.</p>\n<p>A big 8mm Allen key is enough to nip tight crank bolts but don’t expect it to do the job of a big workshop 8mm because it won’t have the same amount of leverage as a longer tool.</p>\n<p>Chamfered tips are a sign of quality and also prevent the rounding of bolts and the keys.</p>\n<h3>Torx keys</h3>\n<p>T25 and T20 Torx keys are most common and are often needed for disc brake and rotor bolts. Some stems and other places on your bike might also use Torx bolts, so it’s best to check to see if you’ll need these on your multi-tool.</p>\n<h3>Chain tool</h3>\n<p>The small size of multi-tool chain tools can make them awkward to use when compared to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-chain-tool/\">best chain tools</a>, but they can really save the day.</p>\n<p>It might also be worth keeping a spare quick-link or master link in your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-saddle-bags/\">saddle bag</a> to minimise roadside hassles.</p>\n<h3>Screwdrivers</h3>\n<p>Most tools include a flat-nosed screwdriver, which can also be used for prising things apart. A Phillips cross-head screwdriver may also be included and is used to adjust derailleur stop screws and brake tension springs.</p>\n<h3>Tyre levers</h3>\n<p>Alongside a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/pumps/mini-pumps/\">mini pump</a>, tyre levers are an essential tool to take with you when cycling because <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">fixing a puncture</a> will probably be an inevitability at some point if you spend enough time cycling.</p>\n<p>Many riders will already have separate tyre levers in their on-bike tool kit, but getting a multi-tool that has integrated tyre levers is a good idea if you’re just starting out or simplicity is what you seek.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"aed772ffd378b0d6b426438a16b82edbe571073723222b3424f00ec48c405532","category":"Cycling"}
