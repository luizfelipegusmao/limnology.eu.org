{"title":"New Predictive Model for the Computation of Reinforced Concrete Column Shear Strength","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0422/v1","date":1728381285000,"content":"The assessment methods for estimating the behavior of the complex mechanics of reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements were primarily based on experimental investigation, followed by collective evaluation of experimental databases from the available literature. There is still a lot of uncertainty in relation to the strength and deformability criteria that have been derived from tests due to the differences in the experimental test setups of the individual research studies that are being fed into the databases used to derive predictive models. This research work focuses on structural elements that exhibit pronounced strength degradation with plastic deformation and brittle failure characteristics. The study’s focus is on evaluating existing models that predict the shear strength of RC columns, which take into account important factors including the structural element’s ductility and axial load, as well as the contributions of specific resistance mechanisms like that of concrete, transverse, and longitudinal reinforcement. Significantly improved predictive models are proposed herein through the implementation of machine learning (ML) algorithms on refined datasets. Three ML models, LINREG, POLYREG-HYT, and XGBoost-HYT-CV, were used to develop different predictive models that were able to compute the shear strength of RC columns. According to the numerical findings, POLYREG-HYT and XGBoost-HYT-CV derived models outperformed other ML models in predicting the shear strength of rectangular RC columns with the correlation coefficient having a value R greater than 99% and minimal errors. It was also found that the newly proposed predictive model derived a 2-fold improvement in terms of the correlation coefficient compared to best available equation in the international literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6c75d7dfca21d49634104ad7dc9d9ecb17de23eae507bc9e9e84eee21fa5ce3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
