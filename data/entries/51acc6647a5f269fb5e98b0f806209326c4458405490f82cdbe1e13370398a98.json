Diatoms are a group of unicellular microalgae with a high colonizing ability, but little is known about their responses to drying. We carried out different resistance and resilience experiments to evaluate temporal and spatial dispersal capacity of diatoms during the dry period. The resistance was tested experimentally by rehydrating dried biofilms and sediments from temporary rivers, whereas resilience was tested by installing artificial mesocosms along a dry river section. Disconnected pools were also sampled to evaluate their propagule emission capacity. In turn, dogs from the area were sampled to test potential zoochory dispersal capacity. In the resistance experiment, we found living diatoms in all the rehydrated sediments but not in biofilms. Diatoms with mobility traits, high ecological plasticity, and resistance spores presented high, along with typical soil diatoms. In the resilience experiment, all mesocosms hosted living diatoms, which were low-profile, pioneering, and small species. Diatoms found in the mesocosms were also common in the disconnected pools, underscoring the potential role of the latter as a propagule emission zone. Dogs' paws also had living diatoms, which evidences that wild fauna could potentially act as passive diatom vectors.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"51acc6647a5f269fb5e98b0f806209326c4458405490f82cdbe1e13370398a98","category":"Environment"}
