{"title":"A Comprehensive Review of MI-HFE and IPHFE Cryptosystems: Advances in Internal Perturbations for Post-Quantum Security","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1874/v1","date":1727165170000,"content":"The RSA cryptosystem has long been a fundamental component of contemporary public key in- frastructure. However, recent developments in quantum computing and mathematical theory have introduced signicant challenges to its security. A fully operational quantum computer would allow for the application of Shor's algorithm, enabling the ecient factoring of large integers, thereby com- promising the integrity of RSA and other cryptographic methods dependent on discrete logarithms. Although Grover's algorithm poses a comparatively smaller threat to symmetric encryption systems, it still presents a vulnerability by accelerating key search processes. The looming threat from quan- tum technologies has driven a surge in research aimed at developing quantum-resistant cryptography. These eorts focus on cryptographic techniques grounded in error-correcting codes, lattice structures, and multivariate public key systems, all of which leverage the complexity of NP-hard problemssuch as solving multivariate quadratic equationsto preserve security in a post-quantum world. This pa- per reviews the current progress in quantum-resistant encryption methods, particularly emphasizing the role of robust trapdoor functions. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive analysis of critical multivariate cryptosystem frameworks, such as Matsumoto-Imai, Oil and Vinegar, and Polly Cracker schemes. It also examines advances in lattice-based systems like Kyber and Crystals-Dilithium, which are undergoing assessment by NIST for potential standardization. As quantum computing continues to evolve, the demand for cutting-edge cryptographic solutions to safeguard digital communications grows increasingly pressing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b8548338584be8e2c23b4121bb3943ec454d652aa6177a9ca2ec4f30cd613a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
