{"title":"Prevalence and Prevention of Clinical Injuries Among Undergraduate Dental Students: A Post-COVID-19 Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0253/v1","date":1717568721000,"content":"Background: Our study investigates the prevalence and causes of injuries among undergraduate dental students during clinical sessions. Methods: The study was conducted at the Department of Dentistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, focusing on injuries reported from 2021 to 2024. Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires and clinical records. The primary variables assessed included the type of injury, the instrument involved, the clinical procedure being performed, and the immediate actions taken post-injury. Serological testing was conducted on both students and patients to assess the risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission. Results: The findings revealed a high prevalence of injuries, with needles being the most common cause, followed by burs and dental probes. The most frequent injury type was piercing, primarily affecting the fingers. Periodontal treatments, restorative procedures, and endodontic treatments were the main activities leading to injuries. Despite normal medical records for most patients treated by injured students, serological testing showed significant positivity rates for HCV and HBV. It is noteworthy that most injured students demonstrated their commitment to safety by adhering to recommended post-exposure protocols, including wound cleaning, disinfecting, and serological testing. Our study highlights the critical need for enhanced biosafety awareness and training among dental students to reduce injury risks. Conclusions: These findings underline the necessity for integrated safety protocols and continuous education to improve clinical practices and ensure student safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cbc3bc23b3e0885a9d26c66a7b93a32be14104bce7065924d993cd17da200e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
