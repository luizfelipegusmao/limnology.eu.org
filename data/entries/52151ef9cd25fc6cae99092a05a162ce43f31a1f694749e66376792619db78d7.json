{"title":"Phase Transition Analysis of the Potts-SOS Model with Spin Set {-1,0, 1} on the Cayley Tree","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1768/v1","date":1724634166000,"content":"The author previously investigated the thermodynamic properties of the one-dimensional Potts-SOS model on the lattice of positive natural numbers N in [Akin H, Phys. Scr. 99 (2024), 055231]. In this present paper, we extend that research by determining the Gibbs measures for the same mixed-type model using partition functions constructed on a second-order semi-infinite Cayley tree. By leveraging the self-similarity of the Cayley tree, we analyze the behavior of these partition functions and identify the regions where phase transitions occur. We pinpoint these phase transition regions through a stability analysis of the dynamical system associated with the model at specific fixed points.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52151ef9cd25fc6cae99092a05a162ce43f31a1f694749e66376792619db78d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
