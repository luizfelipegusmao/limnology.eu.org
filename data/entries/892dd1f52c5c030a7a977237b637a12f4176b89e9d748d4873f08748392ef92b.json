{"title":"Fabrication of Sodium Alginate/Polyethyleneimine/ Polyvinyl Alcohol Multilayer Composite Electrospun Nanofiber Membrane for Cu2+ Removal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1548/v1","date":1713888383000,"content":"In this study, multilayer composite nanofiber membranes of sodium alginate (SA) /polyethyleneimine (PEI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was fabricated via electrospinning technique to enhance the adsorption of Cu2+ from wastewater. The preparation and adsorption mechanisms of the SA/PEI/PVA nanofiber membranes were analyzed by utilizing analytical techniques such as SEM, FTIR, EDS, UV-vis, XRD, and TG. The obtained nanofiber membrane characterized by small diameter, high uniformity, and extensive surface area, demonstrate significant potential for heavy metal ion filtration. Optimal spinning parameters were identified, including a voltage of 19.5 KV, a distance of 8 cm, and specific mass ratios (SA: PEI: PVA, 1:2:6) and injection speeds (8 Î¼L/min) and. The resulting nanofibers with an average diameter of 112.5 nm exhibited excellent morphology and high efficiency, retaining over 85% adsorption capacity for Cu2+ in initial tests and maintaining above 80% efficacy through four successive filtration cycles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"892dd1f52c5c030a7a977237b637a12f4176b89e9d748d4873f08748392ef92b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
