{"title":"Improved Cold Tolerance in Brassica rapa: Functional Diversification of BrICE1 and BrICE2 Paralogs via CBF and ROS Scavenging Pathways, Balancing Growth and Defense","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0394/v1","date":1717720665000,"content":"Inducer of C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) expression (ICE), a well-known MYC-type bHLH transcription factor, plays a crucial role in the ICE-CBF-cold regulated (COR) cold signaling pathway. Brassica rapa (B. rapa), an important oilseed and vegetable crop, exhibits strong chilling and freezing tolerance. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which ICE1 functions in B. rapa remain unclear. Here, 41 ICE1 homologous genes were identified from six widely cultivated Brassica species using a bioinformatics approach. These genes exhibit high conservation but reveal evolutionary complexity between diploid and allotetraploid species. Low-temperature stress induced ICE1 homolog expression, with patterns differing between strong and weak cold-tolerant varieties. Two novel ICE1 paralogs, BrICE1 and BrICE2, were cloned from Longyou 6. They positively regulate cold tolerance in B. rapa via a CBF-dependent pathway, contributing to reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenfging and osmotic adjustment. Immunoblot analysis revealed that low temperatures induce BrICE1 and BrICE2 degradation via the 26S-proteasome pathway. In summary, ICE1 exhibits complex evolutionary relationships in Brassica species. BrICE1 and BrICE2 positively regulate cold tolerance via the CBF-dependent pathway and ROS scavenging mechanism and are also responsible for balancing the development and cold defense of B. rapa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9f3711c35c80ed6807328ad2760b84ca4198558275d55d3a51c975b80288693","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
