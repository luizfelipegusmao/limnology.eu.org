But electronic processes vital to the function and failure of modern components are invisible to standard TEM techniques, which generate contrast related to physical structure or composition. For example, the presence or absence of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), which determines the programmed state of a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), is a purely electronic condition that is impossible to detect with most TEM-based imaging modes. Moreover, sample preparation challenges make inducing such bias-driven changes in the TEM prohibitively difficult. It is almost unheard of to extract an electron-transparent cross section from a mass-fabricated microelectronic device without corrupting its electronic properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8a977b25a5a38de9a633aa657fdf0d1484dbcb6d4f1702d6a44a0ce394ece753","category":"Environment"}
