{"title":"Functional Process Control (FPC): A Methodology to Reduce Variability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0740/v1","date":1712757161000,"content":"In the last century, statistical process control has been considered a successful methodology for monitoring the variability and stability of a process over time. The analysis of variability using functional data analysis has become widespread during the early years of the 21st century. The present study proposes the implementation of a hybrid methodology called functional process control based on the functional data analysis methodology and combines its advantages with those of statistical process control, in order to provide a tool for detecting functional deviations. The phases are: (1) stabilization of processes through the identification and elimination of special causes of functional variability; (2) improvement of the process to be controlled by minimizing the common causes of functional variability; and (3) monitoring of the processes to ensure the maintenance or addition of further improvements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8894a10ab61f5fc91d2ab2ec2b07e86285decf6de89886613f89158851135f53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
