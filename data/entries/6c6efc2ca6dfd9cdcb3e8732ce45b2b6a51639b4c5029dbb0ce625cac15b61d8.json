{"title":"CopG1, a Novel Transcriptional Regulator Affecting Symbiosis in Bradyrhizobium sp. SUTN9-2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0436/v1","date":1715175492000,"content":"The symbiotic interaction between leguminous and Bradyrhizobium sp. SUTN9-2 mainly relies on the nodulation process through Nod factors (NFs), while the type IV secretion system (T4SS) acts as an alternative pathway in this symbiosis. Two copies of T4SS (T4SS1 and T4SS2) are located on the chromosome of SUTN9-2. ΔT4SS1 reduces both nodule number and nitrogenase activity in all SUTN9-2 nodulating legumes. The functions of three selected genes (copG1, traG1, and virD21) within the region of the T4SS1 were examined. We generated deleted mutants and tested in Vigna radiata cv. SUT4. ΔtraG1 and ΔvirD21 exhibited lower invasion efficiency at the early stages of root infection but could be lately restored. In contrast, ΔcopG1 completely hindered nodule organogenesis and nitrogenase activity in all tested legumes. ΔcopG1 showed low expression of nodulation gene and ttsI, but exhibited high expression levels of T4SS genes, traG1 and trbE1. The secreted proteins from ΔT4SS1 were down-regulated compared to the wild type. Although ΔcopG1 secreted several proteins after flavonoid induction, T3SS (nopP and nopX)  and C4-dicarboxylate transporter (dct) were not detected. These results confirm the crucial role of the copG1 gene as a novel key regulator in the symbiotic relationship between SUTN9-2 and legumes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c6efc2ca6dfd9cdcb3e8732ce45b2b6a51639b4c5029dbb0ce625cac15b61d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
