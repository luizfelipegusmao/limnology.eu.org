{"title":"Effect of Potentilla anserina L. powder on gel properties and volatile flavor characteristics of silver carp surimi","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13428?af=R","date":1718692178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Potentilla anserina</i> L. is rich in various nutrients, active ingredients and unique flavor, comprising a natural nutrition and health food. However, its application in aquatic food has been rarely reported. Therefore, the effects of <i>Potentilla anserina</i> L. powder (PAP) on gel properties and volatile flavor profile of silver carp surimi were investigated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The gel strength and water-holding capacity of the surimi gels were significantly improved (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and the whiteness and cooking loss of all the samples decreased slightly with the increase in PAP content. The addition of PAP shortened the relaxation time (<i>T</i>\n<sub>2</sub>) of the surimi gels and converted some of the free water into immobile or bound water, which resulted in a better immobilization of water in the surimi. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the network of surimi gels with PAP added was denser and had a smoother surface compared to the control. Volatile components (VCs) analysis showed that 33 VCs were identified in the surimi gel samples with different additions of PAP, among which aldehydes, alcohols and esters were the major VCs, accounting for more than 50% of the VCs in the surimi gels. PAP addition reduced the fishy and rancid flavor compounds in surimi gels, such as 1-propanol, 1-octen-3-ol, etc., and promoted the production of aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other flavor substances.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results of the present study provide theoretical support for the investigation and development of new nutrient-health-flavored surimi products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wenting Li, \nHongchao Liu, \nZhen Zhang, \nYiyi Liu, \nXuehua Zhang, \nYinghong Qu, \nWenzheng Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"05f5de147ca612f5cd125d3f5d593a87c9fc268c500ee2fa1a5bd05fb6b5d1ac","category":"Environment"}
