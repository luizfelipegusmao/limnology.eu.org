{"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Recombinant Gelsolin 1-3 for Use in the Detection of Lysophosphatidic Acid, a Possible Ovarian Cancer Biomarker","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1589/v1","date":1721379156000,"content":"Gelsolin is an actin-binding protein that is competitively bound by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a possible biomarker for the early detection of ovarian cancer. Our group has previously shown the usage of gelsolin 1-3 (a fragment of gelsolin composed of the first three of its six subdomains) along with actin to detect the presence of lysophosphatidic acid. This histidine-tagged gelsolin 1-3 fragment is synthesized in our lab using bl21 Rosetta cells but required further characterization. This study aims to provide sufficient characterization of gelsolin 1-3 synthesized in our lab via both sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and mass spectrometry using a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR-MS). Both techniques show the presence of protein at the expected mass of approximately 41 kDa. Additionally, the dissociation of a smaller fragment of the complex when introduced into the gas phase which was equivalent to the approximate mass of one subdomain of gelsolin 1-3 further supports this conclusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5edfbf0ccb9bfce94036f296a1646a9b7b51f3a0fe8b6943167a03f34941d216","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
