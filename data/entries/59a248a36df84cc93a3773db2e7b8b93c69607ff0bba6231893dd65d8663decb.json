{"title":"Source and Distribution of Palynomorphs in Southern Red Sea Coastal Environments of Saudi Arabia; Their Palaeoenvironmental and Palaeoecological Inferences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1637/v1","date":1719211819000,"content":"Abstract: Palynomorph assemblages and mineral microfossils from five southern Red Sea coastal environments were studied to demonstrate their distribution pattern and suggest their source. The environments studied were 1. mangrove swamp 2. middle Holocene paleochannel 3. algal mat, 4. Sabia Island coral reef, and intertidal zone. The samples studied were from the top 3 cm semi-consolidated sediments from various environments. Standard palynological maceration technique was used to isolate palynomorphs. These sediment samples are mainly clay and fine sand and yielded low numbers but high diversity of palynomorph assemblages. They are grouped into pollen and spores, dinoflagellate cysts, and algal remains, fungal spores, hyphae and fruit bodies, protists, and invertebrates. A few Ascidian and sponge spicules, and phytoliths (mineral microfossils) occur in the Sabia Island coral reef environment. The protists and invertebrate remain include microforaminifera, thecamoebians, tintinnomorphs, crustacean and annelid palynomorphs. The assemblage also includes six form taxa belonging to the form genera Katora and Mangrovia. These palynomorphs belong to both marine and terrestrial environments and are of autochthonous and allochthonous origins. The source and genetic relationship of each palynomorphs is discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59a248a36df84cc93a3773db2e7b8b93c69607ff0bba6231893dd65d8663decb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
