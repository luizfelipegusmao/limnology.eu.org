{"title":"Game Theory for predicting stocks’ closing prices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1668/v1","date":1721634331000,"content":"We model the financial markets as a game and make predictions using Markov chains estimators. We extract the possible patterns displayed by the financial markets, define a game where one of the players is the speculator, whose strategies depend on his/hers risk-to-reward preferences, and the market is the other player, whose strategies are the previously observed patterns. Then we estimate the market’s mixed probabilities by defining Markov chains and utilizing its transitions matrices. Afterwards, we use these probabilities to determine which is the optimal strategy for the speculator. Finally, we apply these models to real-time market data to determine its feasibility. After all, we obtained a model for the financial markets that has an outstanding performance in terms of accuracy and profitability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7a251bd52e55322b6c44c41071fc072ce35bba7330cf56a5df785dbaa939199","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
