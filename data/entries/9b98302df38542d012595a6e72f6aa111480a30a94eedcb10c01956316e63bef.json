{"title":"Transcriptomic Analysis across Crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) Claw Regeneration Reveals Potential Stem Cell Sources for Cultivated Crustacean Meat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0231/v1","date":1719973182000,"content":"In the face of rising global demand and unsustainable production methods, cultivated crustacean meat (CCM) is proposed as an alternative means to produce delicious lobster, shrimp and crab products. Cultivated meat requires starting stem cells that may vary in terms of potency, and propensity to proliferate or differentiate into myogenic (muscle-related) tissues. We suggest that regenerating crustacean limbs harbor a range of stem cells suitable for cultivated meat production and present a humane tissue source because they can be accessed non-lethally. To investigate stem cell activity in this model, we have conducted RNA-Seq analysis across six stages of claw regeneration in the crayfish CheraxÂ quadricarinatus (four pre-molt and two post-molt stages), along with histology and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Differential expression analysis revealed expression patterns of significantly up- or down-regulated genes in 14 functional categories. Relative expression of select stem cell target genes (including endocrine, myogenic, cell cycle and pluripotency factors) highlighted two growth peaks during pre-molt regeneration and limited stem cell activity after the molt. Histology and qPCR results support the overall finding that pre-molt limb regeneration stages harbor more stem cell activity, likely making them a more prolific cell source for CCM development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b98302df38542d012595a6e72f6aa111480a30a94eedcb10c01956316e63bef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
