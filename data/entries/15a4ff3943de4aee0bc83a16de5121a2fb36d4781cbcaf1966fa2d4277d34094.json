Increasing hydrostatic pressure could further reduce the degradation efficiency of sinking POC, but this effect remains unexplored. Here, the degradation of carcasses and fecal pellets of the abundant marine copepod <span>Calanus finmarchicus</span> was experimentally studied as a function of pressure (0.1–100 MPa). Samples were either exposed to elevated pressure in short 1-day incubations or a gradual pressure increase, simulating continuous particle sinking during a 20-day incubation. Both experiments revealed gradual inhibition of microbial respiration in the pressure range of 20–100 MPa, corresponding to 2–10-km depth. This suggests that hydrostatic pressure impedes carbon mineralization of fast-sinking carcasses and fecal pellets and enhances the deep-sea deposition rate of zooplankton-derived organic material.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"15a4ff3943de4aee0bc83a16de5121a2fb36d4781cbcaf1966fa2d4277d34094","category":"Environment"}
