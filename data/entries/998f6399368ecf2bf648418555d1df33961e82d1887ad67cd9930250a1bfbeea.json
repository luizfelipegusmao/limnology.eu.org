However, increasing complexity and production of nanoscale imaging data have made this analysis more difficult, and, in some situations, infeasible. Multivariate volumetric data, which contains more than one channel per voxel, has become increasingly prevalent in important industries such as battery technology. Due to its multidimensional nature, however, multivariate data is complex and usually requires substantial human effort to analyze. Oftentimes, each channel is visualized separately and individually. However, this does not reveal the complex yet frequently important interactions between the channels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"998f6399368ecf2bf648418555d1df33961e82d1887ad67cd9930250a1bfbeea","category":"Environment"}
