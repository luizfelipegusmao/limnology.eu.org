{"title":"Correlative Multi-scale Characterization of Nanoparticles Using Transmission Electron Microscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0256/v1","date":1725509470000,"content":"Chemical and physical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) are strongly influenced not only by the crystal structure of the respective material including crystal structure defects, but also by the NP size and shape. Contemporary transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is capable of describing all of these NP characteristics, however typically with a different statistical relevance. While the size and shape of NPs are frequently determined on a large ensemble of NPs and thus with good statistics, the characteristics on the atomic scale are usually quantified for a small number of individual NPs and thus with a low statistical relevance. In this contribution, we present a TEM-based characterization technique, which is capable of determining relevant characteristics of NPs in a scale-bridging way – from the crystal structure and crystal structure defects up to the NP size and morphology – with a sufficient statistical relevance. This technique is based on a correlative multi-scale TEM approach that combines information on atomic scale obtained from the high-resolution imaging with the results of the low-resolution imaging assisted by a semi-automatic segmentation routine. The capability of the technique is illustrated on several examples including Au NPs having different shape, Au nanorods having different facet configurations and multi-core iron oxide nanoparticles having a hierarchical structure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fd2eebe1f946b73b73faba7220604e52a459afcf7aefa9ab123bc2d34462324","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
