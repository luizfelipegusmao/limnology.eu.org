In a perfect system with high mass resolving power, Gaussian peak shapes, no noise, and no direct peak overlaps, one could calculate local and global compositions with perfect accuracy. In all real-world atom probe tomography (APT) analyses however, there are often multiphase materials that have peak overlaps, peak shape differences, differences in background noise, etc. As there are currently no standards governing the ranging of APT data, two people analyzing the same dataset may get different answers [<a href=\"#ozae044.023-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.023-B2\">2</a>]. To investigate ranging techniques, a multiphase simulation of a boron doped silicon and nickel diffusion couple was created with variable mass resolving power, background noise levels and peak shapes for the various elements using the region of interest (ROI) simulation utility in AP Suite 6.3.1 (See Figure 1).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"31a2b2af2f8d8fcf08f925cf29a18396370a51283639ab48e021254fb0c922b9","category":"Environment"}
