{"title":"What makes a tree weep?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1097/7629474?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span>Plants come in many shapes and sizes, from tiny mosses to large trees. A common feature among plants is their upright posture, a natural response to gravity. Roots grow down into the soil in search of nutrients and stability, while shoots grow upward, a process known as negative gravitropism. Many tree species develop a complex branching system to maximize light capture for photosynthesis, which requires the formation of tension woodâ€”a specific anatomical adaptation to cope with gravity. Species such as magnolia (<span>Magnolia acuminata</span>) or poplar (<span>Populus tremula</span>) have branches that grow upward. However, some species, like the weeping willow (<span>Salix babylonica</span>) and Japanese apricot (<span>Prunus mume</span>), are known for their gracefully drooping branches. Despite recognizing the impact of branch orientation on tree architecture and light absorption, the molecular mechanisms controlling this orientation are not well understood.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4848bb3a287df13ffe2731a7d4ad8261f75a954da2dd8c7a638dfde3d1bac8d9","category":"Environment"}
