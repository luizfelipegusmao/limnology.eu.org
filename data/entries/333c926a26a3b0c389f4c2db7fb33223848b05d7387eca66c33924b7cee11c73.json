{"title":"Explainable AI for Interpretation of Ovarian Tumor Classification Using Custom ResNet60","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1865/v1","date":1716893219000,"content":"Deep learning architectures like ResNet and Inception have produced accurate predictions for classifying benign and malignant tumors in the healthcare domain. This enables healthcare institutions to make data-driven decisions and potentially enable early detection of malignancy by employing computer-vision-based deep learning algorithms. These Convolutional Neural Network algorithms, in addition to requiring huge amounts of data, can identify higher and lower-level features that are significant while classifying tumors into benign or malignant. However, these algorithms have limitations concerning explainability and identifying the exact features that are of importance and contributing to the final classification of tumors as benign or malignant. In this paper, we implement several explainable AI techniques, namely, LIME, Saliency Map, Occlusion Analysis, Grad-CAM, SHAP, and Smooth Grad to interpret the results of a custom ResNet60 classifier in the classification of ovarian tumors as benign or malignant. The ResNet60 model attained an accuracy of 97.50% for the test dataset.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"333c926a26a3b0c389f4c2db7fb33223848b05d7387eca66c33924b7cee11c73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
