{"title":"Prospects for Implementation of Autonomous Vehicles and Associated Infrastructure in Developing Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2014/v1","date":1719631797000,"content":"Introduction: Most industrialized and developed countries now working to implement more advanced transportation systems. These include autonomous vehicle(AV) systems of various forms, such as delivery vehicles, which eliminate the crashes, injuries, and fatalities associated with human-operated machinery. Self-driving vehicles have the potential to make roads safer, but some safety concerns need to be addressed. Before AV systems become commonplace in developing countries, society needs to determine how safe they truly are. \nObjectives: This paper provides brief descriptions and examines the realities for AV in developing countries using results from infrastructure-based assessment of countries worldwide and from a questionnaire-based survey. \nMethods: Relevant research papers, articles, reports, and departmental websites were used as the main data sources. Ethiopia was chosen as a representative case. Different aspects of AV infrastructure, its current status in developing countries, and perspectives on AV systems are explored through interviews with approximately 1500 randomly selected individuals. The main variables in the assessment were physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and societal perceptions on AV systems.\nResults: Surprisingly, the results indicated that 55.82%, 78.58%, 87.78%, and 86.09% of Ethiopian interviewees agreed with statements regarding high ease of use, usefulness, positive attitude, and benefits, respectively, of  AV. However, it should be noted that some interviewees did not provide a response to certain questions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45eac95323bc581aef6477ebe330e034dd944ac32c776a29a3022d83fbb98629","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
