{"title":"Evaluating the SarQoL® Questionnaire as a Screening Tool for Sarcopenia among Korean Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0221/v1","date":1725412113000,"content":"Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, poses significant risks to physical health, leading to a reduced quality of life (QoL), increased disability, and higher mortality rates among older adults. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent the cascading effects of sarcopenia, including falls, fractures, and hospitalization. This study determined an optimal cut-off point of the SarQoL® score that can serve as an effective screening tool among community-dwelling Korean older adults. The study involved 451 South Korean older adults, assessing the correlation between SarQoL® scores and sarcopenia as defined by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. Participants completed the Korean version of the SarQoL questionnaire. Findings revealed that individuals diagnosed with sarcopenia had significantly lower SarQoL® scores compared to non-sarcopenic participants, with a cut-off score of ≤ 58.5 providing good diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.768, sensitivity = 69.3%, specificity = 75.2%). These results underscore the questionnaire’s reliability and validity in screening for sarcopenia-related QoL impairment and its potential utility as a clinical tool. Implementing the SarQoL® in routine assessments could improve clinical outcomes by enabling earlier and more precise identification of sarcopenia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74b366028e520b1d7a05b6d2df64268146ac9ebc914448bc6465510e3ee891a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
