{"title":"Immobilizing Effects on Exchangeable CD Merged Soil by Various Amendments &ndash; Focused on Plant Uptake and Soil Microbial Community","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1293/v1","date":1724063012000,"content":"Cadmium (Cd) contaminated soil is a serious environmental problem due to its effect on crop production, soil microbial community, and risk to human health. The commercial amendments are widely used in the immobilization of heavy metal-contaminated soil because of their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and community acceptance. This study is conducted to assess the effect of sole commercial amendments including bentonite (B), talc (T), activated carbon (AC), cornstarch (CS), and their combination on exchangeable Cd content in soil, Cd uptake by the plant, and soil microbial community. The results indicated that CS and its composites (T+CS and B+CS) showed the highest effect on reducing Cd mobility in soil (up to 10% in CS), decreasing the Cd uptake by lettuce (up to 78% in T+CS), and increasing the microbial community in soil compared to the control. Furthermore, results from Biolog Ecoplate and realtime-Polymerase chain reaction indicated that the mixture amendments (B+CS and T+CS) showed the highest effect on the microbial community by increasing soil microbial population maximum of 3.81-fold difference (in B+CS) compared to the control. The results indicated that applying composite amendments provided an efficient option for immobilizing Cd in soil, reducing the Cd uptake by plants, and increasing microbial community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a601b2c1b6b01a88769cb035a49656a2d20978acfc1aca11f651ee37dfa1df5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
