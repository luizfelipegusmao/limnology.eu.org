{"title":"A Completed Proved of Rapid Nondestructive Prediction Model of Wood Chip Biomass Higher Heating Value Ready for Industrial Updating","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1392/v1","date":1711116099000,"content":"Nepal, primarily an agricultural country, heavily relies on agricultural residue and fuelwood for daily energy requirements. In 2022, total energy consumption was 640 PJ, with traditional sources accounting for 64.17%, and fuelwood comprising 58.53% of total fuel consumption. The estimated potential supply of agricultural residue is 26 million tonnes, yielding about 442 million GJ of energy in 2021. Biomass trading often emphasizes volume or weight, necessitating a rapid and non-destructive assessment of energy properties for mutual benefit, aiding in the identification, management, and utilization of biomass sources. In this study, 200 biomass samples were collected in two batches (126 and 74 samples) from various locations in Nepal. Using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), a model was developed correlating higher heating value (HHV) from a bomb calorimeter and spectral data from Fourier Transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) (3595 â€“ 12,489 cm-1) sensor. PLSR models incorporated raw spectra, eight preprocessing techniques, the multi-preprocessing five-range method, and a genetic algorithm. Outliers in the first batch were identified, and the first batch divided into an 80% calibration set and a 20% validation set, while the second batch was designated as an unknown sample set. The optimum PLSR model, utilizing first derivative preprocessing, improved accuracy by 6.77%, with coefficients of determination in the calibration set, validation set, and unknown set as 0.9694, 0.9578, and 0.8089, respectively. Root mean square errors were 132.4790 J/g, 189.4800 J/g, and 360.8845 J/g for the calibration set (RMSEC), validation set (RMSEP), and unknown set (RMSEUN), respectively. The prediction to deviation ratio (RPD) for the validation set and unknown set was 4.9 and 2.4, respectively. The cross validation model of combined sample data of every sets showed the R2CV of 0.95 and RPDCV of 4.6 indicating the model could serve as a reliable and swift non-destructive alternative for evaluating biomass HHV using NIRS and ready for updating for industrial use. However, incorporating a larger number of representative samples is crucial to enhance accuracy and develop a more comprehensive global model for predicting biomass HHV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53be3087866f51f478d99173c9217f62603169261549f4e99c37c12e24840ab6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
