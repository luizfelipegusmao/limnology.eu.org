{"title":"Mechanism of How Plant-Based Diet (PBD) Reduces the Risk of In-Stent Restenosis (ISR) and Stent Thrombosis (ST)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0628/v1","date":1712645399000,"content":"Despite the advances in stent design, coating drugs, polymers, the use of intravascular imaging, special devices (such as intravascular lithotripsy, ultra-high-pressure non-compliant balloons, and drug-coated balloons), and improved operator skills and techniques, the problem of in-stent restenosis (ISR) and stent thrombosis (ST) remains a challenge for interventional cardiologists. Atherosclerotic lesions, ISR, and ST, are systemic metabolic chronic inflammatory illnesses with a local manifestation in the coronary vessels. Therefore, we propose managing these systemic illnesses systemically through plant-based diet (PBD) intervention. We explain how PBD intervention can help mitigate atherosclerosis, ISR, and ST. Thus, PBD intervention can overcome biological and epigenetic problems in managing ISR and ST similarly to reversing atherosclerosis. Our team is pioneering the implementation of PBD for cardiology patients who have undergone coronary intervention. So far, the results have been very promising. We hope that in the future, many research studies will be performed to investigate further the role of PBD in decreasing the incidence of ISR and ST.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afc1c86c9e4d2ba933b885977595fbaea87cca28f0c7e8408e5fddf76f6dc0a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
