{"title":"Literature Review of the Contribution of Remote Sensing Exposures to Asthma, Other Respiration Specific Outcomes, and Risk Factors in Greenness, Air Pollution, and Wildfire Ecologic Settings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0917/v1","date":1728711797000,"content":"Numerous Epidemiologic studies have used remote sensing to quantify the contribution of greenness, air pollution, and wildfire smoke to asthma and other respiration outcomes.  This is the first review paper to evaluate the influence of remote sensing exposures to specific outcome severity and risk factors in different ecologic settings.  Literature searches utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar identified 61 unique studies published between 2009-2023, with 198 specific outcomes.  Respiration specific outcomes were lower in greenness, and higher in air pollution, and in wildfire ecologic settings.  Aerosol optical depth (AOD)-PM2.5 readings and specific outcomes were higher in economically developing than in economically developed countries.  Prospective studies found prenatal and infant exposure to higher ambient AOD-PM2.5 concentration level readings contributed to higher childhood asthma incidence.  Lung function was higher in greenness, and lower in the other two ecologic settings.  Age, environment, gender, other, and total risk factors showed significant differences between health outcomes and ecologic settings.  Published studies utilized physiologic mechanisms of immune, inflammation, and oxidative stress to describe obtained results.  Individual and total physiologic mechanisms differed between ecologic settings.  Study results were used to develop a descriptive physiologic asthma model and then use it to propose updated population-based asthma intervention program guidelines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1942d764be5a110a2fdd2d787a7fa3789b5b79f8e7ae70b7c47cfeb36646b549","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
