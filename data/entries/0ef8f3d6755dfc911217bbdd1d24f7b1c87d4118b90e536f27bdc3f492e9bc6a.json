The sensor of the MerlinEM can tolerate high intensity direct electron probes with energies ranging between 30 keV and 300 keV, without the need for a beam stop. Moreover, the dynamic range of the detector is sufficiently high to record both the high intensity direct beam and low intensity high-resolution reflections simultaneously [<a href=\"#ozae044.1097-B1\">1</a>]. These properties of the MerlinEM make it ideal for (low-dose) MicroED/three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) experiments. MicroED/3D ED is an umbrella term for a set of data collection and analysis protocols involving the sequential acquisition of electron diffraction patterns and the necessary metadata for atomic structure analysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.1097-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0ef8f3d6755dfc911217bbdd1d24f7b1c87d4118b90e536f27bdc3f492e9bc6a","category":"Environment"}
