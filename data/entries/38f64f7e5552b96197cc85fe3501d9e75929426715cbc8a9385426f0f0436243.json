{"title":"A Comprehensive Review of Non-Carbon Diamond-Like Conductive Thin Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2210/v1","date":1725003506000,"content":"The search for materials with exceptional properties has led to significant advances in the field of non-carbon diamond-like conductive thin films (DLC-CTFs). These films, synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and other techniques, are being actively researched for their potential in high-tech applications. This literature review discusses the synthesis methods, material properties, and applications of DLC-CTFs, highlighting the role of non-carbon dopants in enhancing electrical conductivity. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the historical development, synthesis techniques, material properties, characterization methods, and applications of DLC-CTFs, with a focus on the impact of non-carbon doping on their conductive properties. By reviewing the literature. The review also addresses the challenges faced and suggests future research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38f64f7e5552b96197cc85fe3501d9e75929426715cbc8a9385426f0f0436243","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
