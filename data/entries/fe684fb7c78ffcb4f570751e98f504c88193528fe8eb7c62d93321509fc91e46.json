{"title":"CAD Design and Modeling of a Robotic Arm for Automated Harvesting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1948/v1","date":1727189944000,"content":"The increasing demand for agricultural automation within the precision agriculture sector necessitates the development of advanced robotic systems to enhance efficiency in fruit harvesting. This study presents the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and modeling of a 4-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm specifically designed for automated fruit harvesting applications. Utilizing Fusion 360 software, a comprehensive model has been created, encompassing material selection, stress analysis, and motion simulations to verify both the functionality and durability of the robotic system. Design methodologies are articulated, alongside simulation tests that evaluate the armâ€™s operational performance. Proposed enhancements aim to optimize harvesting efficiency while minimizing potential damage to crops. The robotic arm is equipped with an adaptive gripper, engineered to adjust to various fruit sizes, ensuring delicate and precise manipulation during the harvesting process. This work establishes a robust foundation for the advancement of robotic systems in agricultural contexts, contributing to improved productivity and sustainability in fruit harvesting operations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe684fb7c78ffcb4f570751e98f504c88193528fe8eb7c62d93321509fc91e46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
