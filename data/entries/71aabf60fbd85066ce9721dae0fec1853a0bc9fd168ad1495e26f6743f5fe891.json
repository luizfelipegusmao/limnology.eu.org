{"title":"From complexity to clarity: How AI enhances perceptions of scientists and the public's understanding of science","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae387/7750129?rss=1","date":1725580800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This article evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance the public's understanding of science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from <span>PNAS</span>, yoked to those generated by AI, this work first assessed linguistic simplicity differences across such summaries and public perceptions in follow-up experiments. Specifically, study 1a analyzed simplicity features of <span>PNAS</span> abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used a large language model, GPT-4, to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) summaries facilitated more favorable perceptions of scientists (they were perceived as more credible and trustworthy, but less intelligent) than more complexly written human <span>PNAS</span> summaries. Crucially, study 3 experimentally demonstrated that participants comprehended scientific writing better after reading simple GPT summaries compared to complex <span>PNAS</span> summaries. In their own words, participants also summarized scientific papers in a more detailed and concrete manner after reading GPT summaries compared to <span>PNAS</span> summaries of the same article. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"71aabf60fbd85066ce9721dae0fec1853a0bc9fd168ad1495e26f6743f5fe891","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
