Rats are a primary reservoir of the virus; thus, it is referred to as “rat HEV”. Rats are often found on swine farms in close contact with pigs. Our goal was to determine whether swine may serve as a transmission host for zoonotic rat HEV by characterizing an infectious cDNA clone of a zoonotic rat HEV, strain LCK-3110, in vitro and in vivo. RNA transcripts of LCK-3110 were constructed and assessed for their replicative capacity in cell culture and in gnotobiotic pigs. Fecal suspension from rat HEV-positive gnotobiotic pigs was inoculated into conventional pigs co-housed with naïve pigs. Our results demonstrated that capped RNA transcripts of LCK-3110 rat HEV replicated in vitro and successfully infected conventional pigs that transmit the virus to co-housed animals. The infectious clone of rat HEV may afford an opportunity to study the genetic mechanisms of rat HEV cross-species infection and tissue tropism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"10d0aa5e80a7db35055ca40716d1babd06327d53eed359f9fb418d1478696fbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
