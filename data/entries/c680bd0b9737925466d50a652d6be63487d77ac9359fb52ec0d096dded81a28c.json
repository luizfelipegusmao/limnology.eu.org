{"title":"Wavelength Characteristics of Vertical Deformation and Train Dynamics Simulation of Long-Span Cable-Stayed Bridges under Complex Loads","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2146/v1","date":1724926846000,"content":"Ballastless track has high smoothness, but the laying requirements are strict. Therefore, the maximum span of cable-stayed bridges laying ballastless tracks is 392m. For laying ballastless track structures over larger spans, the deformation characteristics of long-span cable-stayed Bridges under complex loads are incomplete, and the interaction between long-span bridge-track structures is unclear. The influence of wavelength of cosine wave on the track- bridge mapping of different orbital structures was explored. The wavelength characteristics of vertical deformation under complex loads were investigated. The track-bridge integrated model for the cable-stayed bridge was establish to analyze the mapping relationship between rail and bridge and wavelength characteristics of deformation. Based on mapping relationships and wavelength characteristics of deformation, the Train-Track-Bridge dynamic simulation model was simplified. The results show that when the minimum wavelength of bridge deformation surpasses 6 m, 10 m, and 16 m, the rail deformation in the ballasted track, the longitudinal-connected track, and the unit slab-type ballastless track accurately mirrors the deformation of the bridge. For the span of bridge ranging from 200 m to 600 m, the wavelength of vertical deformation ranges from 21 to 1270 m under complex loads. During local loads, the vertical deformation below the 200 m wavelength constitutes a significant proportion near the pie. Considering the influence of the deformation on train vibration response, the Train-Bridge dynamic coupling model can be employed to treat the track structure as a load to reduce complexity of model and enhance the calculation efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c680bd0b9737925466d50a652d6be63487d77ac9359fb52ec0d096dded81a28c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
