{"title":"Smartphone Digital Image Colorimetry: An Affordable Easy-To-Use Approach for Hands-On Training in Resource-Limited Settings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0603/v1","date":1715255169000,"content":"Analytical instruments used for scientific research and education are often expensive. This limitation poses a challenge for schools and educators in low-income countries to provide practical science training to students. To address this problem, the improvisation of analytical instruments and instructional materials has emerged as a viable solution. By incorporating practical experiments into science education, students have the opportunity to engage directly with scientific instruments, conduct investigations, and collect data. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of scientific principles, enhances critical thinking skills, and cultivates scientific mindsets among students. Herein, we review and discuss, step-by-step, the approach of using a smartphone for quantitative analysis, referred to as smartphone digital image colorimetry (SDIC). SDIC, with its practicality and accessibility, utilizes smartphone digital cameras for image acquisition and the freely available image processing programs, such as ImageJ and smartphone Apps, for image quantification. Using SDIC can enable students in low-income countries to develop essential scientific skills, including critical thinking, data interpretation, and an evidence-based approach to scientific research. By leveraging the ubiquity and affordability of smartphone technology, SDIC offers an accessible and cost-effective approach to practical science education, bridging the gap between theory and practice in resource-constrained settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20aaba3695ae51138c1a2eb1687dad556a3a114ddbee46c2946fd1b0529ca890","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
