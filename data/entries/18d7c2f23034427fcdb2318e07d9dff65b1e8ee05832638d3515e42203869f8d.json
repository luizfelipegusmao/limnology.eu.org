{"title":"Addition of Bempedoic Acid to Statin-Ezetimibe versus Statin Titration in Patients with High Cardiovascular Risk. A Single Centre Prospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0612/v1","date":1723111527000,"content":"Abstract: Reducing levels of low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) below recommended thresholds is a core component of cardiovascular prevention strategies. We hypothesized that the addition of bempedoic acid to patients already on statin-ezetimibe therapy was more effective than titrating the statin dose in reducing LDL-C. The study enrolled 120 patients at high cardiovascular risk, and with LDL-C above 70 mg/dl. They were randomly divided in two groups: bempedoic acid (BA) group, taking bempedoic acid in addition to statin plus ezitimibe, and the statin titration (ST) group including patients who doubled the dose of statin. At 12-weeks, BA group presented a greater significant decrease of LDL-C compared to ST group (-22.9% vs 7.5% p 0.002). Total-cholesterol decreased significantly in the BA group compared to ST (-14.8% vs-4.7% ; p 0.013)  No significant between-groups changes in HDL and triglycerides occurred. At 12 weeks the number of patients who reached LDL-C lower than 70 mg/dl was 38 (63%) in the BA group versus 22 (37%) in the ST group (between group p 0.034). In the BA group the LDL lowering effect of bempedoic acid was similar between patients taking atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. No side effects occurred during the follow up period. In conclusion, the addition of Bempedoic acid to statin/ezetimibe combined treatment was more effective than doubling the dose of statin in reducing LDL-C. levels and increased the number of patients reaching the LDL-C goal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18d7c2f23034427fcdb2318e07d9dff65b1e8ee05832638d3515e42203869f8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
