{"title":"A longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on mental health in ophthalmic personnel and students","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300144","date":1710338400000,"content":"<p>by Yi Pang, Connor Robbs, Jingyun Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Our previous study revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic posed mental health challenges to eye care professionals and students. The intent of this study was to identify the longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among ophthalmic personnel and students. Additionally, the potential risk factors for mental health problems were investigated.</p> Methods <p>A two-phase survey among eye care professionals and students in the USA and Canada was conducted. Phase 1 was administrated from June 23 to July 8, 2020, and has been published; Phase 2 was conducted from January 21 to February 2, 2021. A total of 824 eye care professionals and students participated in Phase 2, with a response rate of 44.1%. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were measured and calculated.</p> Results <p>Compared with Phase 1, stress scores in Phase 2 were significantly reduced (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001) although they were still higher than the pre-COVID level (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Scores for depression (<i>P</i> = 0.20) and anxiety (<i>P</i> = 0.40) showed no change, comparing Phase 2 to Phase 1. Reduction of stress scores significantly differed among occupations (<i>P</i> = 0.005); students had less reduction of stress than other eye care professionals (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Vaccination status was significantly associated with a reduction in stress scores (<i>P</i> = 0.04).</p> Conclusions <p>With the continuing COVID pandemic, although stress level was reduced at 7-month follow-up, the mental health of eye care professionals was still impacted. In this population, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with fewer stress symptoms. These results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic continues impacting mental health among eye care professionals, especially students. These study results warrant future interventions for eye care personnel and students to prevent or treat mental health disorders.</p>","author":"Yi Pang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5fa743983bfa102f2449b322395ae3f95ee30b9dbfe71da7c0671a098eeb6ce9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
