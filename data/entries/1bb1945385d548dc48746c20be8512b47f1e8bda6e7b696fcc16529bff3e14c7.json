{"title":"Dependence of Pressure Characteristics of Pressurized Pulse Water Jet Chamber on Nozzle Diameter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0596/v1","date":1720485556000,"content":"The nozzle is the key element of the water jet generator for energy conversion. In order to explore the influence of the nozzle diameter on the pressure characteristics of the supercharged pulsed water jet plenum chamber, a supercharged pulsed water jet pressure acquisition system was established, and the Equations of motion and theoretical pressurization ratio equations of the supercharged pulsed water jet generator were established. The pressurization chamber pressure acquisition experiments under different nozzle diameters were carried out. The research results indicate that there is a critical nozzle diameter. When the nozzle diameter is less than the critical diameter, the pressure in the boost chamber is equal to the product of the driving pressure and boost ratio. As the nozzle changes, there is no significant change in the peak pressure and frequency of the boost chamber; When the nozzle diameter is greater than the critical diameter, there is a non-linear relationship between the boost chamber pressure and the driving pressure. As the nozzle diameter gradually increases, the actual boost ratio gradually decreases, and the peak pressure of the boost chamber further decreases. The nozzle diameter can no longer provide a load for the establishment of fluid pressure in the boost chamber. The research results provide a research basis for further controlling the pressure characteristics of the boost pulse water jet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1bb1945385d548dc48746c20be8512b47f1e8bda6e7b696fcc16529bff3e14c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
