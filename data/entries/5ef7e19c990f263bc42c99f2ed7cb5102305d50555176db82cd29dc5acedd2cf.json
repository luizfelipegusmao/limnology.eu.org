Inulin may precipitate anaphylactic shock. Four-hour and 8-hour one-compartment iohexol plasma clearance models with Bröchner-Mortensen correction provide accurate GFR measurements in patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) &gt; or ≤40 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. We compared the performance of the simplified 5-hour, 4-samplings, two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model (popPK) with the performance of the reference two-compartment 10-hour iohexol method in 16 patients with GFR 15.2 to 56.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. We also compared the performance of shortened (5, 6 and 7-hour) one-compartment models with the performance of the standard 8-hour one-compartment model in 101 patients with eGFR ≤40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The performance of popPK and shortened methods versus reference methods was evaluated by total deviation index (TDI), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and coverage probability (CP). TDI &lt;10%, CCC ≥0.9 and CP &gt;90% indicated adequate performance. TDI, CCC and CP of popPK were 11.11%, 0.809 and 54.10%, respectively. All shortened, one-compartment models overestimated the GFR (p &lt;0.0001 for all) as compared to the 8-hour model. TDI, CCC and CP were 7.02%, 0.815, and 75.80% for the 7-hour model, 7.26%, 0.803, and 74.20% for the 6-hour model, and 8.85%, 0.729 and 64.70% for the 5-hour model. The agreement of popPK model was comparable to that obtained with the Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Collaboration-Epidemiology (CKD-Epi) and the Modification-of-Diet-in-Renal-Disease (MDRD) serum-creatinine based equations for GFR estimation. PopPK model is remarkably unreliable for GFR measurement in stage III-IV CKD patients. In patients with eGFR ≤40 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, shortened one-compartment models, in particular the 5-hour model, are less performant than the reference 8-hour model. For accurate GFR measurements, the iohexol plasma clearance should be measured with appropriate protocols. Over-simplified procedures should be avoided.","author":"Fabiola Carrara","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5ef7e19c990f263bc42c99f2ed7cb5102305d50555176db82cd29dc5acedd2cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
