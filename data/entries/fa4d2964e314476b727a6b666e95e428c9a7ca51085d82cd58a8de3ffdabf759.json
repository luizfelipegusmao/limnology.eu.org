Followed by climatic conditions conducive to high vegetation productivity since 2016, tropical AGC are expected to recover from large losses during the El Niño episode; however, the recovery rate and its spatial distribution remain unknown. Here, we used low-frequency microwave satellite data to track AGC changes, and showed that tropical AGC stocks returned to pre-El Niño levels by the end of 2020, resulting in an AGC sink of 0.180.140.26$$ {0.18}_{0.14}^{0.26} $$ Pg C year<sup>−1</sup> during 2014–2020. This sink was dominated by strong AGC increases (0.610.490.84$$ {0.61}_{0.49}^{0.84} $$ Pg C year<sup>−1</sup>) in non-forest woody vegetation during 2016–2020, compensating the forest AGC losses attributed to the El Niño event, forest loss, and degradation. Our findings highlight that non-forest woody vegetation is an increasingly important contributor to interannual to decadal variability in the global carbon cycle.</p>","author":"Lei Fan, \nTianxiang Cui, \nJean‐Pierre Wigneron, \nPhilippe Ciais, \nStephen Sitch, \nMartin Brandt, \nXin Li, \nShuli Niu, \nXiangming Xiao, \nJérome Chave, \nChaoyang Wu, \nWei Li, \nWenping Yuan, \nZanpin Xing, \nXiaojun Li, \nMengjia Wang, \nXiangzhuo Liu, \nXiuzhi Chen, \nYuanwei Qin, \nHui Yang, \nQiang Tang, \nYuechen Li, \nMingguo Ma, \nRasmus Fensholt","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"fa4d2964e314476b727a6b666e95e428c9a7ca51085d82cd58a8de3ffdabf759","category":"Environment"}
