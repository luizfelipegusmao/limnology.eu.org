{"title":"Revisiting Pseudo-OCV Pulse-Based Incremental Capacity Analysis for Diagnostics of Li-Ion Batteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1910/v1","date":1719481028000,"content":"This paper presents the concept of applying incremental capacity analysis (ICA) on the OCV curve in the SoC space. The OCV curve can be obtained from any sequence of discharge or charge current or power pulse with a necessary rest period to allow the cell to reach a pseudo-OCV after each pulse. With a higher resolution (&gt;100 pulses) in the full SoC window, an OCV vs SoC curve can be obtained with sufficient accuracy to perform an ICA on the obtained OCV curve. ICA as a diagnostic technique has commonly been applied on Li-ion cells with a constant charge and discharge at slow currents. However, a slow controlled constant current charge or discharge is normally not feasible and cannot be easily applied to a battery in an application. Here we revisit pulse-based ICA to supplement the conventional constant-current-based technique. Conventional ICA performed on ageing data with constant current is directly compared to ICA performed on a selection of higher resolution OCV curves. The main advantage of OCV-ICA is that it can be applied to most cells and systems without significant interruption of normal cell operation. OCV-ICA provides valuable insights into ageing mechanisms as well as detailed information on changes in internal resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4e7dfb171944f16c06a09e66725622645e2b503f73af61fb08fbfc3f95b855c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
