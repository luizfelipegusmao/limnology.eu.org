{"title":"An Entomopathogenic Nematode, Oscheius tipulae, Exhibiting a Wide Pathogenic Spectrum and Its Application to Control Dipteran Insect Pests","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0332/v1","date":1712202936000,"content":"An entomopathogenic nematode, Oscheius tipulae, was isolated from a soil sample. The identification of this species was supported by morphological and molecular markers. The nematode isolate exhibited pathogenicity against different target insects including lepidopteran, coleopteran, and dipteran insects. The virulence of this nematode was similar to that of a well-known entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae, against the same insect targets. A comparative metagenomics analysis of these two nematode species predicted the existence of a combined total of 272 bacterial species in their intestines, of which 51 bacterial species were shared between the two nematode species. In particular, the common gut bacteria included several entomopathogenic bacteria including Xenorhabdus nematophila, which is known as a symbiotic bacterium to S. carpocapsae. The nematode virulence of O. tipulae to insects was enhanced by an addition of dexamethasone but suppressed by an addition of arachidonic acid, suggesting that the immune defenses of the target insects against the nematode infection is mediated by eicosanoids, which would be manipulated by the symbiotic bacteria of the nematode. Unlike S. carpocapsae, O. tipulae showed high virulence against dipteran insects including fruit flies, onion flies, and mosquitoes. O. tipulae showed particularly high control efficacies against the onion maggot, Delia platura, infesting the Welsh onion in the rhizosphere in both pot and field assays.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56a1289f5f6c1d6e789ffb85b82f73e79f33484dcc06d7200c17e1dff3170e10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
