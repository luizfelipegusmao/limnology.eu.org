Continued improvements in the precision and application of electrochemical fabrication require a deep understanding of the interplay of kinetic and thermodynamic phenomena that operate during the process. Here, we explore the deposition of copper (Cu) metal on a graphene electrode using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using the temporal and spatial resolution of this technique to explore the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals. The technique reveals an unexpected transient phenomenon under certain applied voltage conditions, and we discuss possible mechanisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7422615f92aa73d6dc379e8a49e7ddef45e570faa9053d1db149b752c5b4511f","category":"Environment"}
