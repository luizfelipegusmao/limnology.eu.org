{"title":"Potential for Recycling Metakaolin-Slag Based Geopolymer Concrete of Various Strength Levels in Freeze-Thaw Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0083/v1","date":1712019011000,"content":"Geopolymer concrete (GPC) represents an innovative green and low-carbon construction material, offering a viable alternative to ordinary Portland cement concrete in building applications. However, existing studies tend to overlook the recyclability aspect of GPC for future use. Various structural applications necessitate the use of concrete with distinct strength characteristics. The recyclability of the parent concrete is influenced by these varying strengths. This study examined the recycling potential of GPC across a spectrum of strength grades (40, 60, 80 and 100 MPa, marked as C40, C60, C80 and C100) when subjected to freeze-thaw conditions. The cementitious material comprised 60% metakaolin and 40% slag, with natural gravel serving as the coarse aggregate, and the alkali activator consisting of sodium hydroxide solution and sodium silicate solution. The strength of the GPC was modulated by altering the Na/Al ratio. After 350 freeze-thaw cycles, the GPC specimens underwent crushing, washing, and sieving to produce recycled geopolymer aggregates (RGAs). Subsequently, their physical properties and microstructure were thoroughly examined. The findings indicated that GPC with strength grades of C100, C80, and C60 were capable of enduring 350 freeze-thaw cycles, in contrast to C40, which did not withstand these conditions. RGAs derived from GPC of strength grades C100 and C80 complied with the criteria for Class II recycled aggregates, whereas RGAs produced from GPC of strength grade C60 aligned with the Class III level. A higher strength grade in the parent concrete correlated with enhanced performance characteristics in the resulting recycled aggregates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f05ce018068cb3948d14e91862d7c348b392813add869be870a4ea869045666c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
