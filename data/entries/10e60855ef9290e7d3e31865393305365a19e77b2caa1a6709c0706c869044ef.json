{"title":"An Investigation on Globe Temperature in Street Canyon: A Scaled Model Study Implementing Cool Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0115/v1","date":1714635754000,"content":"Measurement of Globe temperature is essential for investigating thermal comfort in street canyon. Globe thermometer is the most common instrument used to measure globe temperature (GT), however its application in scale models is still uncertain and not thoroughly investigated as of today. Therefore, this study is explicitly conducted to investigate globe thermometer measurements and proposed an improvised customization of the globe thermometer size to enhance reliability in scale models. The experiments were carried out outdoors using a typical street canyon model (scale 1:100) with East-West street orientation. The experiment presented a comparison between a low solar reflective street canyon (albedo of 0.4) and a high solar reflective canyon (albedo of 0.6) in terms of surface temperatures, heat flux and globe temperature. Furthermore, this study also investigated the influence of solar orientation on the globe temperature using both experimental using scale models and microclimatic modelling using ENVI-met. It is observed that although the surface temperatures are lower with high solar reflective canyon compared to that with low solar reflective canyon, GT is higher in high reflective canyon during daytime, which could be due to combined effect of direct radiation and shortwave reflection. However, for hours after the sun set, GT becomes lower (up to 1Â°C) in the case of high reflective canyon compared to low reflective canyon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10e60855ef9290e7d3e31865393305365a19e77b2caa1a6709c0706c869044ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
