{"title":"Finding the Correlation between Transport Infrastructure and the Fatal Accident Rate of Cyclists&mdash;An International Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1806/v1","date":1716872656000,"content":"Bicycle transport stands at the forefront of sustainable mobility initiatives, a cornerstone of European Union policy. While support for cycling is crucial, its advancement hinges upon the presence of high-quality, secure infrastructure for cyclists. Safety emerges as a paramount concern, influencing the viability of cycling as a mode of transportation, yet its perception varies among user demographics. In light of this, this article endeavors to examine and contrast cycling infrastructure across various European nations, alongside analyzing statistics pertaining to fatal traffic accidents involving cyclists. The findings underscore a substantial correlation between the quality of cycling infrastructure and the incidence of accidents. This correlation underscores the pressing need for robust infrastructure development and safety measures to bolster cycling as a safe and viable transportation option. By understanding the intricate interplay between infrastructure quality and safety outcomes, policymakers can better prioritize resources and enact measures to foster safer cycling environments, thus furthering the objectives of sustainable mobility on a continental scale.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4140a77c7cb36368e39790dd2edf15df8d536f88fcc29a5a7da7753c10c0be7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
