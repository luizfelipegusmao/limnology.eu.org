A single specimen with a total length of 73.2 mm was caught with bottom trawl at a depth of 322 m depth in 2017. The specimen was identified morphologically and confirmed by molecular taxonomy using DNA barcoding. Based on the size and ontogenetic characters found, the specimen was identified as a post-larval individual, and a pelagic habitat of the specimen seems more likely.</p>","author":"Francisco Baldó, \nAlejandro De Carlos, \nRafael Bañón","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"20e65a5bf1f85dd9039146900ae65607e2220abbb86964edadff20d1880eba80","category":"Environment"}
