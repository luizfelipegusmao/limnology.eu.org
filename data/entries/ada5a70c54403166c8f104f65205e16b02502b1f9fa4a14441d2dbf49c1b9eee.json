{"title":"PSV-6 The additive effect of hormonal implant and inclusion of beta-agonists in carcass quality in beef cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/271/7665026?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine what additive effect hormonal implants and inclusion of beta-agonists in the diet have on carcass quality in yearling beef steers. Twenty-one Hereford-cross steers (450 Â± 15 kg) were assigned to one of three drylot pens based on initial body weight (BW) and sire so that each pen had an equal starting BW and sires were equally represented in each pen. Each drylot pen was assigned to one of three treatments: receiving a hormonal implant (IMP), consuming a beta-agonist (BAG), or receiving both of the previous treatments (AND). All steers were fed a mixed ration consisting of 30.0% rye silage, 28.0% DDGS, 30.0% rolled corn, 10.5% soybean meal, and 1.5% mineral supplement (22.0% CP, 2.90 Mcal ME/kg DM). Animals were fed daily at 0700 and 1700 and weighed weekly at 0630. For the duration of the trial, animals were housed in drylot pens with ad libitum access to feed and water and had shade structures in each pen. Following a 15-d adaptation period, feed intake was recorded for 45 d. Weight gain for each treatment group were 1.26, 1.28, and 1.48 kg/d for IMP, BAG, and AND, respectively. After the intake portion of the study was completed, an animal from each pen was slaughtered and evaluated for carcass quality. Hot carcass weights for diets IMP, BAG, and AND were 347.4, 352.9, and 394.8 kg, respectively. Following 14 d aging, samples from the ribeye area were collected from each animal and subjected to sensory analysis and other assessments of quality. Data were analyzed as a completely random design in SAS v9.4. There was not a significant difference between the IMP treatment and the AND treatment based on assessment from Warner-Bratzler shear force, carcass yield, marbling score, and sensory assessment (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05); however, the BAG treatment had significantly less marbling than the other two treatments. It was concluded that the additive effect of using both a hormonal implant and a beta-agonist can produce carcass of good quality without detrimental effects on meat quality when compared with a beta-agonist only inclusion.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ada5a70c54403166c8f104f65205e16b02502b1f9fa4a14441d2dbf49c1b9eee","category":"Environment"}
