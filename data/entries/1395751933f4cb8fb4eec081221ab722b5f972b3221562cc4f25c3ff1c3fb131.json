{"title":"Molecular and phylogenetic evidence of parallel expansion of anion channels in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2533/7492836?rss=1","date":1703289600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) and slow anion channels (SLACs) are important in various physiological processes in plants, including stomatal regulation, nutrient uptake, and in response to abiotic stress such as aluminum toxicity. To understand their evolutionary history and functional divergence, we conducted phylogenetic and expression analyses of ALMTs and SLACs in green plants. Our findings from phylogenetic studies indicate that ALMTs and SLACs may have originated from green algae and red algae, respectively. The ALMTs of early land plants and charophytes formed a monophyletic clade consisting of three subgroups. A single duplication event of ALMTs was identified in vascular plants and subsequent duplications into six clades occurred in angiosperms, including an identified clade, 1-1. The ALMTs experienced gene number losses in clades 1-1 and 2-1 and expansions in clades 1-2 and 2-2b. Interestingly, the expansion of clade 1-2 was also associated with higher expression levels compared to genes in clades that experienced apparent loss. SLACs first diversified in bryophytes, followed by duplication in vascular plants, giving rise to three distinct clades (I, II, and III), and clade II potentially associated with stomatal control in seed plants. SLACs show losses in clades II and III without substantial expansion in clade I. Additionally, ALMT clade 2-2 and SLAC clade III contain genes specifically expressed in reproductive organs and roots in angiosperms, lycophytes, and mosses, indicating neofunctionalization. In summary, our study demonstrates the evolutionary complexity of ALMTs and SLACs, highlighting their crucial role in the adaptation and diversification of vascular plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1395751933f4cb8fb4eec081221ab722b5f972b3221562cc4f25c3ff1c3fb131","category":"Environment"}
