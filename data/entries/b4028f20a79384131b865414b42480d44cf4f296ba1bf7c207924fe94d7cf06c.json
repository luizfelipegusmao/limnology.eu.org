{"title":"Understanding APT Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms: Is Superior Accuracy a Thing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1152/v1","date":1721034137000,"content":"Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at stealing sensitive information or causing damage over an extended period. Detecting APTs is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain. This paper explores the role of ML algorithms in detecting APTs, comparing their accuracy and effectiveness. We evaluate various algorithms, discuss the challenges in achieving superior accuracy, and suggest strategies for improvement. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of ML in APT detection, emphasizing the need for continuous advancements in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4028f20a79384131b865414b42480d44cf4f296ba1bf7c207924fe94d7cf06c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
