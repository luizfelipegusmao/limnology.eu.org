{"title":"(GAAN)Graph Adaptive Attention Network with Cross Entropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0939/v1","date":1718326060000,"content":"ï¼šNon-Euclidean data, such as social networks, and citation relationships between documents, has node information and structural information. Graph Convolutional Network(GCN) can automatically learn node features and association information between nodes. The core ideology of the graph convolutional network is to aggregate node information by using edge information, thereby generating a new node feature. In the process of updating node features, there are two core influencing factors. One is the number of neighboring nodes of the central node, the other is the contribution of the neighboring nodes to the central node. Due to the previous GCN methods not simultaneously considering the numbers and different contributions of neighboring nodes to the central node, we design the Adaptive Attention Mechanism(AAM). To further enhance the representational capability of the model, we utilize Multi-Head Graph Convolution(MHGC). Finally, we adopt cross-entropy(CE) loss function to describe the difference between the predicted results of node categories and the ground truth (GT). Combined with backpropagation, this ultimately achieves accurate node classification. Based on AAM, MHGC and CE, we contrive the novel Graph Adaptive Attention Network (GAAN). Experiments show that the classification accuracy has achieved outstanding performances on Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a0039bceae663e3e6f5463d103f5cfdbf153f4368187f5a347f9e5387e76342","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
