{"title":"The Protective Role of KANK1 in Podocyte Injury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1697/v1","date":1714056836000,"content":"Approximately 30% of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndromes are attributed to monogenic disorders that involve 27 genes. Mutations in KANK family members have also been linked to nephrotic syndrome; however, the precise mechanism remains elusive. To investigate this, podocyte-specific Kank1 knockout mice were generated to examine phenotypic changes. In the initial assessment under normal conditions, Kank1 knockout mice showed no significant differences in the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine levels, or histological features compared to controls. However, following kidney injury with adriamycin, podocyte-specific Kank1 knockout mice exhibited a significantly higher albumin-creatinine ratio and a significantly greater sclerotic index than control mice. Electron microscopy revealed more extensive foot process effacement in the knockout mice than in control mice. In addition, KANK1-deficient human podocytes showed increased detachment and apoptosis following adriamycin exposure. These findings suggest that KANK1 may play a protective role in mitigating podocyte damage under pathological conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"111bd4fda63f2cb64e3b1d51f7e1826f213eb69431a2d614ed64a36c83b29588","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
