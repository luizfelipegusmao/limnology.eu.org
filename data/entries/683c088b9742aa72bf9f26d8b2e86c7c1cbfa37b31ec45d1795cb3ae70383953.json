{"title":"A Head-to-Head Comparative Study of the Replication-Competent Vaccinia Virus and AAV1- based Malaria Vaccine versus RTS,S/AS01 in Murine Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1398/v1","date":1726651947000,"content":"Background/objectives: We developed a multistage Plasmodium falciparum vaccine using a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy. This involved priming with a highly attenuated, replication-competent vaccinia virus strain LC16m8Δ (m8Δ) and boosting with adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1). This approach demonstrated 100% efficacy in both protection and transmission-blocking in a murine model. In this study, we compared our LC16m8∆/AAV1 vaccine, which harbors a gene encoding Pfs25-PfCSP fusion protein, to RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) in terms of immune responses, protective efficacy, and TB activity in murine models. Methods: Mice were immunized following prime-boost vaccine regimens m8∆/AAV1 or RTS,S and challenged with transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasites. Immune responses were assessed via ELISA, and TB efficacy was evaluated using direct feeding assays. Results: m8∆/AAV1 provided complete protection (100%) in BALB/c mice and moderate (40%) protection in C57BL/6 mice, similar to RTS,S. Unlike RTS,S’s narrow focus (repeat region), m8∆/AAV1 triggered antibodies for all PfCSP regions (N-terminus, repeat, and C-terminus) with balanced Th1/Th2 ratios. Regarding transmission blockade, serum from m8∆/AAV1-vaccinated BALB/c mice achieved substantial transmission-reducing activity (TRA = 83.02%) and TB activity (TBA = 38.98%)—attributes not observed with RTS,S. Furthermore, m8∆/AAV1 demonstrated durable TB efficacy (94.31% TRA and 63.79% TBA) 100 days post-immunization. Conclusions: These results highlight m8∆/AAV1's dual action in preventing sporozoite invasion and onward transmission, a significant advantage over RTS,S. Consequently, m8∆/AAV1 represents an alternative and a promising vaccine candidate that can enhance malaria control and elimination strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"683c088b9742aa72bf9f26d8b2e86c7c1cbfa37b31ec45d1795cb3ae70383953","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
