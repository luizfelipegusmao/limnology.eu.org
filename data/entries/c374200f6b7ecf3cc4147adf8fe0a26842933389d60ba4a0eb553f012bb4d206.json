{"title":"Optimal Boundary Control Problem for the Stokes Equation in Cardiovascular Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0631/v1","date":1725858645000,"content":"In this work, we study a boundary control problem for the evolutionary Stokes equations, under mixed boundary conditions, in two and three dimensions. The Stokes equation is a valuable tool in cardiovascular biomechanics, especially for modeling blood flow in low-velocity and high-viscosity conditions. Its application in the microvasculature, the design of medical devices, and the study of cardiovascular diseases helps improve the understanding and treatment of various pathological conditions. We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to address the analysis and the derivation of a system of first-order optimality conditions that characterizes the solution of the control problem. Finally, solution-finding algorithm is proposed and illustrated with some simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c374200f6b7ecf3cc4147adf8fe0a26842933389d60ba4a0eb553f012bb4d206","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
