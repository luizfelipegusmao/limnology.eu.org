{"title":"Visualizing Social and Neural Connectivity in Autism: Insights from Clustering and Stochastic Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0061/v1","date":1719818620000,"content":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by diverse patterns of social interaction, communication, and behavior. This study explores the application of clustering and stochastic migration models to visualize and understand the social and neural connectivity patterns associated with autism. The clustering model, with its strong internal connections and limited external connections, mirrors the tight-knit social groups and communication barriers often observed in individuals with autism. In contrast, the stochastic model, characterized by more dispersed connections and greater adaptability, represents the variability and flexibility seen in social interactions across  typical individuals. By comparing these models, we can gain deeper insights into the unique challenges and strengths of individuals with autism, highlighting the importance of personalized interventions. Additionally, these models provide a visual framework for understanding the differences in brain connectivity patterns observed in autism, with implications for both behavioral and neural correlates. This study underscores the value of computational models in advancing our understanding of autism and guiding effective support strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ba47351e06749dda419bf71c8c61538c7e97a8542efb4bf23b2d1bf03046afe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
