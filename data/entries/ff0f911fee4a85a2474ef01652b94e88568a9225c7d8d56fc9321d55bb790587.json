{"title":"LINC01354 Associates with Low-Grade Glioma Survival","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2043/v1","date":1719633349000,"content":"Background Gliomas are the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors worldwide. Recent studies highlight the potential of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumor progression, with LINC01354 being upregulated in various malignancies. This study investigates the role of LINC01354 in glioma prognosis to provide novel insights for early prognosis prediction.Methods This study involved four cohorts of low-grade glioma tissue samples collected from hospitals in Xinjiang, Beijing, and Guangzhou, China. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure LINC01354 expression levels. Clinical information and survival data were analyzed using Cox regression and ROC analysis to evaluate the association between LINC01354 expression and overall survival. Clinical comparisons were conducted to identify potential discrepancies in clinical parameters across different cohorts.Results Elevated LINC01354 levels were associated with poorer overall survival in the West China cohort (Xinjiang) but not in the North (Beijing) or South China (Guangzhou) cohorts. Clinical parameter comparisons revealed no significant differences among the cohorts that could explain the regional discrepancy. Further analysis within the West China cohort indicated that LINC01354's prognostic value was consistent across Han and non-Han ethnic groups and unaffected by dietary staples. However, LINC01354's prognostic significance was more pronounced in patients born in Xinjiang compared to those born elsewhere. A prognostic model incorporating LINC01354 expression and birth location demonstrated good predictive accuracy with ROC AUC values of 0.777 in the training cohort and 0.757 in the validation cohort.Conclusion LINC01354 is a potential prognostic biomarker for low-grade glioma in the West China population, particularly among patients born in Xinjiang.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff0f911fee4a85a2474ef01652b94e88568a9225c7d8d56fc9321d55bb790587","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
