{"title":"An alleviative effect of Lonicerae japonicae flos water extract against liver fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24154?af=R","date":1713250800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Lonicerae japonicae</i> (<i>L</i>. <i>japonicae</i>) flos is a medical and food homology herb. This study investigated the phenolic acid and flavonoid contents in <i>L</i>. <i>japonicae</i> flos water extract solution (LJWES) and the preventive effects of LJWES against liver fibrogenesis via FL83B cells and rats. LJWES contains many polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acid, morin, and epicatechin. LJWES increased cell viability and decreased cytotoxicity in thioacetamide (TAA)-treated FL83B cells (75 mM) (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). LJWES decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) gene expressions of <i>Tnf-α</i>, <i>Tnfr1</i>, <i>Bax</i>, and <i>cytochrome c</i> but upregulated <i>Bcl-2</i> and <i>Bcl-xl</i> in TAA-treated cells; <i>meanwhile</i>, increased protein levels of P53, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved caspase 9 in TAA treated cells were downregulated (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) by LJWES supplementation. In vivo, results indicated that TAA treatment increased serum liver damage indices (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and cytokines (interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-β1) levels and impaired liver antioxidant capacities (increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance value but decreased catalase/glutathione peroxidase activities) in rats (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) while LJWES supplementation amended (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) them. Liver fibrosis scores, collagen deposition, and alpha-smooth muscle actin deposition in TAA-treated rats were also decreased by LJWES supplementation (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). To sum up, LJWES could be a potential hepatoprotective agent against liver fibrogenesis by enhancing antioxidant ability, downregulating inflammation in livers, and reducing apoptosis in hepatocytes.</p>","author":"Yi‐Ling Lin, \nYi‐Hsieng Samuel Wu, \nMing‐Yuan Chao, \nDeng‐Jye Yang, \nCheng‐Wei Liu, \nJung‐Kai Tseng, \nYi‐Chen Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"3165655bf5b427fb6416f9eeccb72058d8dcd1dd2e3a840a052acad0eb33b7dc","category":"Environment"}
