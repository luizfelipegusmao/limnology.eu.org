{"title":"Investigations of self-heating effects in Silicon-Photomultipliers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0760/v1","date":1710310340000,"content":"The main consequence of radiation damage on a Silicon-Photomultiplier (SiPM) is a significant increase in the dark current. If the SiPM is not adequately cooled, the power dissipation causes it to heat up, which in turn affects its performance based on the temperature. In order to investigate this heating effect, experiments were carried out using a KETEK SiPM glued on an Al2O3 substrate, as well as HPK SiPMs that were either glued onto an Al2O3 substrate or a flexible PCB. The assemblies were connected either directly to a temperature-controlled chuck on a probe station or through layers of materials with well-defined thermal resistance. A DC-mode LED was used to illuminate the SiPM, and the resulting SiPM current was measured to determine the steady-state temperature. This temperature depended on the power dissipated in the multiplication region of the SiPM and the thermal resistance. This information can be utilized to adjust the SiPMs working point, taking into account the effects of self-heating. Similarly, this approach can be applied to packaged SiPMs that have an unknown thermal contact to a heat sink.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1e50db0161ad33d0ba496aa29c542970c60a613930bbaeb4d0e02b51c5a0cab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
