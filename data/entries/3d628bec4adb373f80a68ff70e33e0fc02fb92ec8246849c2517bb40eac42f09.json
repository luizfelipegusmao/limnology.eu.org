Here, we examined the interfacial phase evolution of two-phase NiTi/Cr films made on engineering alloys by a kind of liquid metal dealloying using in situ TEM observations. These materials exhibit interesting responses associated with their complex two-phase nanostructure formed during the dealloying reaction [<a href=\"#ozae044.849-B1\">1-3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3d628bec4adb373f80a68ff70e33e0fc02fb92ec8246849c2517bb40eac42f09","category":"Environment"}
