However, little is known about the capacity of such interaction networks to adapt to a rise in temperature and the occurrence of critical transitions.\n\nHere, combining quantitative genetics and mutualistic dynamics in an eco-evolutionary framework, we evaluated the stability and resilience of mutualistic networks to critical transitions as environmental temperature increases. Specifically, we modelled the dynamics of an optimum trait that determined the tolerance of species to local environmental temperature as well as to species interaction. We then evaluated the impact of individual trait variation and evolutionary dynamics on the stability of feasible equilibria, the occurrence of threshold temperatures at which community collapses, and the abruptness of such community collapses.\n\nWe found that mutualistic network architecture, that is the size of the community and the arrangement of species interactions, interacted with evolutionary dynamics to impact the onset of network collapses. Some networks had more capacity to track the rise in temperatures than others and thereby increased the threshold temperature at which the networks collapsed.\n\nHowever, such a result was modulated by the amount of heritable trait variation species exhibited, with high trait variation in the mean optimum phenotypic trait increasing the environmental temperature at which networks collapsed. Furthermore, trait variation not only increased the onset of temperatures at which networks collapsed but also increased the local stability of feasible equilibria.\n\nOur study argued that mutualistic network architecture interacts with species evolutionary dynamics and increases the capacity of networks to adapt to changes in temperature and thereby delayed the occurrence of community collapses.\n</p>","author":"Gaurav Baruah, \nTim Lakämper","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"5c72d0bf920464a2dab184429e638d290e8559c45c3651aae4f2d2ccf8bef911","category":"Environment"}
