{"title":"The Impact of Laparoscopic Surgery on Fertility Outcomes in Patients with Minimal/Mild Endometriosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0446/v1","date":1720089154000,"content":"Minimal/mild endometriosis (MME) is independently associated with reduced fecundity rates. In this review article, we discuss the role of laparoscopic surgery in enhancing fertility outcomes of patients with MME. Laparoscopic management of MME enhances fecundity and increases chances of spontaneous conception in appropriately selected cases. However, laparoscopy cannot be routinely recommended in asymptomatic patients with the sole purpose of diagnosing and treating potentially present MME. Equally, based on existing evidence, laparoscopic management of MME cannot be routinely recommended prior to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) attempts, as robust evidence of benefit is lacking. As an overlap between unexplained infertility and MME cases likely exists, the development of reliable, widely available, non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of MME may revolutionize the management of cases currently classified as unexplained infertility. In a disease as diverse as endometriosis, management decisions should be based on a multitude of factors. Future studies should focus on reporting outcomes of interventions for MME on fertility and obstetric outcomes, clearly differentiating between disease stages and phenotypes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a081d192e668f43025ddb81d34421c2b0585bd589b9d707aa573ffcc63b8488","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
