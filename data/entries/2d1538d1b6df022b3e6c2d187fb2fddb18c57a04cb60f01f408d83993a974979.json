{"title":"Development and validation of accelerated failure time model for cause-specific survival and prognostication of oral squamous cell carcinoma: SEER data analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309214","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Phillip Awodutire, Michael Kattan, Oladimeji Adeniyi Akadiri</p>\r\nBackground <p>Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma is the most prevalent malignancies affecting the oral cavity. Despite progress in studies and treatment options its outlook remains grim with survival prospects greatly affected by demographic and clinical factors. Precisely predicting survival rates and prognosis plays a role in making treatment choices for the best achievable overall health outcomes.</p> Objective <p>To develop and validate an accelerated failure time model as a predictive model for cause-specific survival and prognosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients and compare its results to the traditional Cox proportional hazard model.</p> Method <p>We screened Oral cancer patients diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2020. An accelerated failure time model using the Type I generalized half logistic distribution was used to determine independent prognostic factors affecting the survival time of patients with oral squamous carcinoma. In addition, accelerated factors were estimated to assess how some variables influence the survival times of the patients. We used the Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion to evaluate the model fit, the area under the curve for discriminability, Concordance Index (C-index) and Root Mean Square Error and calibration curve for predictability, to compare the type I generalized half logistic survival model to other common classical survival models. All tests are conducted at a 0.05 level of significance.</p> Results <p>The accelerated failure time models demonstrated superior effectiveness in modeling (fit and predictive accuracy) the cause-specific survival (CSS) of oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to the Cox model. Among the accelerated failure time models considered, the Type I generalized half logistic distribution exhibited the most robust model fit, as evidenced by the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC = 27370) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC = 27415) values. This outperformed other parametric models and the Cox Model (AIC = 47019, BIC = 47177). The TIGHLD displayed an AUC of 0.642 for discrimination, surpassing the Cox model (AUC = 0.544). In terms of predictive accuracy, the model achieved the highest concordance index (C-index = 0.780) and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 1.209), a notable performance over the Cox model (C-index = 0.336, RMSE = 6.482). All variables under consideration in this study demonstrated significance at the 0.05 level for CSS, except for race and the time span from diagnosis to treatment, in the TIGHLD AFT model. However, differences emerged regarding the significant variations in survival times among subgroups. Finally, the results derived from the model revealed that all significant variables except chemotherapy, all TNM stages and patients with Grade II and III tumor presentations contributed to the deceleration of time to cause-specific deaths.</p> Conclusions <p>The accelerated failure time model provides a relatively accurate method to predict the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and is recommended over the Cox PH model for its superior predictive capabilities. This study also underscores the importance of using advanced statistical models to improve survival predictions and outcomes for cancer patients.</p>","author":"Phillip Awodutire","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2d1538d1b6df022b3e6c2d187fb2fddb18c57a04cb60f01f408d83993a974979","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
