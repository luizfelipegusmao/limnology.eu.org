{"title":"Similar chilling response of dormant buds in potato tuber and woody perennials","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/19/6076/7676034?rss=1","date":1715904000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bud dormancy is a survival strategy that plants have developed in their native habitats. It helps them endure harsh seasonal changes by temporarily halting growth and activity until conditions become more favorable. Research has primarily focused on bud dormancy in tree species and the ability to halt growth in vegetative tissues, particularly in meristems. Various plant species, such as potato, have developed specialized storage organs, enabling them to become dormant during their yearly growth cycle. Deciduous trees and potato tubers exhibit a similar type of bud endodormancy, where the bud meristem will not initiate growth, even under favorable environmental conditions. Chilling accumulation activates C-repeat/dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) factors (CBFs) transcription factors that modify the expression of dormancy-associated genes. Chilling conditions shorten the duration of endodormancy by influencing plant hormones and sugar metabolism, which affect the timing and rate of bud growth. Sugar metabolism and signaling pathways can interact with abscisic acid, affecting the symplastic connection of dormant buds. This review explores how chilling affects endodormancy duration and explores the similarity of the chilling response of dormant buds in potato tubers and woody perennials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0416fcdcf9a7c9a9d35c2927813a3c0839e3b61632f63efcb3401201598020e6","category":"Environment"}
