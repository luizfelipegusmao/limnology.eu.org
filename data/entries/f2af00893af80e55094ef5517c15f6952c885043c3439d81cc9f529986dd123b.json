{"title":"Advancements in Virtual Bioequivalence: Computational Methods and Regulatory Perspectives in the Pharmaceutical Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1534/v1","date":1729503447000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The rise of virtual bioequivalence studies has transformed the pharmaceutical landscape, enabling more efficient drug development processes. This systematic review aims to explore advancements in Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, its regulatory implications, and its role in achieving virtual bioequivalence, particularly for complex drug formulations. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials using computational methods, particularly PBPK modeling, for bioequivalence assessments. Eligibility criteria are emphasized in silico modeling and pharmacokinetic simulations. Comprehensive literature searches were performed across databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. A search strategy using key terms and Boolean operators ensured extensive coverage. We adhered to PRISMA guidelines for study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, focusing on key characteristics, methodologies, outcomes, and regulatory perspectives from the FDA and EMA. Results: Our findings indicate that PBPK modeling significantly enhances the prediction of pharmacokinetic profiles, optimizing dosing regimens while minimizing the need for extensive clinical trials. Regulatory agencies have recognized this utility, with the FDA and EMA developing frameworks to integrate in silico methods into drug evaluations. However, challenges such as study heterogeneity and publication bias may limit the generalizability of results. Conclusions: This review highlights the critical need for standardized protocols and robust regulatory guidelines to facilitate the integration of virtual bioequivalence methodologies into pharmaceutical practices. By embracing these advancements, the industry can improve drug development efficiency and patient outcomes, paving the way for innovative therapeutic solutions. Continued research and adaptive regulatory frameworks will be essential in navigating this evolving field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2af00893af80e55094ef5517c15f6952c885043c3439d81cc9f529986dd123b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
