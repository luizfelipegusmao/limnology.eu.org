{"title":"COVID-19 Vaccinations, Infections and Outcomes among 784 People Living with HIV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2397/v1","date":1727685489000,"content":"Introduction: Variants of COVID-19 are responsible for 700 million infections and 7 million deaths worldwide. Vaccinations have high efficiency in preventing infection and secondary benefits of reducing COVID-19 hospital admissions, attenuating disease severity and duration of illness. Conflicting reports were published regarding COVID-19 among PLWH. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate COVID-19 morbidity, hospitalization and the magnitude of immunological response to sequential BNT 162b2 mRNA vaccines in PLWH regarding demographic and clinical factors. Results: Our retrospective study included 784 PLWH who had at least one anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibody test between March 2021 and  October 2021.  Half of our patients (392) had CD4 cells count above 500 cells/µl, 40.2% (315) had 200&lt;CD4&lt;500 cells/µL and only 9.8% (77) had CD4 &lt;200 cells/µL at their last laboratory workup. The mean age was 50.2±12.2 years. About 90% of our patients were given at least two doses of the BNT 1626b2 Pfizer vaccines, about 60% received three doses of the vaccine. About a quarter of our patients (27.3%) had COVID-19 infection. Only 6 patients required hospital admission. All six patients recovered from COVID-19 infection. Titers of COVID-19 antibodies were lower for patients with CD4 cells count of less than 200 cells/ µL in the first, second and third serological tests with statistical significance. In a multinomial logistic regression the influence of other factors such as age, sex, previous COVID-19 infection on first COVID-19 antibodies titers was not significant. Conclusions: PLWH are responsive to COVID-19 vaccines. As was expected, patients with higher CD4 cells count have higher titers of COVID-19 antibodies and less severe illness. Age, sex and previous COVID-19 infection did not significantly affect antibodies titers according to our study. Larger prospective studies with control groups are needed to further characterize immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccination among PLWH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59be0f9382084106d76304cbd9c9bb684924bf8fef22dd17cb7228393fa6afa1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
