{"title":"Ultrafast Brain MRI at 3 T for MS: Evaluation of a 51-Second Deep-Learning-Enhanced T2-EPI-FLAIR Sequence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1633/v1","date":1719221879000,"content":"Magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisitions are usually time-consuming, limiting utilization in neuroimaging. For multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, MR imaging plays a major role in drug therapy decision-making. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an ultrafast, T2-weighted (T2w), deep-learning-enhanced (DL), echo-planar-imaging-based (EPI) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (FLAIRUF) that has been targeting neurological emergencies so far might even be an option to detect MS lesions of the brain compared to conventional FLAIR sequences. Therefore, 17 MS patients were enrolled prospectively in this exploratory study. Standard MR protocols and ultrafast acquisitions were conducted at 3 tesla (T), including three-dimensional (3D)-FLAIR, turbo/fast spin echo (TSE)-FLAIR, and FLAIRUF. Inflammatory lesions were grouped by size and location. Lesion conspicuity and image quality were rated on an ordinal five-point Likert scale, and lesion detection rates were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed to compare results. Altogether, 568 different lesions were found. Data indicated no significant differences in lesion detection (sensitivity and positive predictive value [PPV]) between FLAIRUF and axially reconstructed 3D-FLAIR (lesion size ≥ 3 mm × ≥ 2 mm) and no differences in sensitivity between FLAIRUF and TSE-FLAIR (lesion size ≥ 3 mm total). Lesion conspicuity in FLAIRUF was similar in all brain regions except for superior conspicuity in the occipital lobe and inferior conspicuity in central brain regions. Further findings include location-dependent limitations of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) as well as artifacts such as spatial distortions in FLAIRUF. In conclusion, FLAIRUF could potentially be an expedient alternative to conventional methods for brain imaging in MS patients since the acquisition can be performed in a fraction of time while maintaining good image quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d56f8ec119caa2fc904f883c70dc5243065c1c718b919f256fa27fd728eb1d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
