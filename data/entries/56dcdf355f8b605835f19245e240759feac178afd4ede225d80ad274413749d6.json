{"title":"A four-week minimalist shoe walking intervention influences foot posture and balance in young adults–a randomized controlled trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304640","date":1718892000000,"content":"<p>by Anna Gabriel, Katharina Fuchs, Bernhard Haller, Iwona Sulowska-Daszyk, Thomas Horstmann, Andreas Konrad</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Minimalist shoes (MS) are beneficial for foot health. The foot is a part of the posterior chain. It is suggested that interventions on the plantar foot sole also affect the upper segments of the body. This study aimed to investigate the local and remote effects along the posterior chain of four weeks of MS walking in recreationally active young adults.</p> Methods <p>28 healthy participants (15 female, 13 male; 25.3 ± 5.3 years; 70.2 ± 11.9 kg; 175.0 ± 7.8 cm) were randomly assigned to a control- or intervention group. The intervention group undertook a four-week incremental MS walking program, which included 3,000 steps/day in the first week, increasing to 5,000 steps/day for the remaining three weeks. The control group walked in their preferred shoe (no MS). We assessed the following parameters in a laboratory at baseline [M1], after the four-week intervention [M2], and after a four-week wash-out period [M3]: Foot parameters (i.e., Foot Posture Index-6, Arch Rigidity Index), static single-leg stance balance, foot-, ankle-, and posterior chain range of motion, and muscle strength of the posterior chain. We fitted multiple hierarchically built mixed models to the data.</p> Results <p>In the MS group, the Foot Posture Index (b = -3.72, t(51) = -6.05, p &lt; .001, [-4.94, 2.51]) and balance (b = -17.96, t(49) = -2.56, p = .01, [-31.54, 4.37]) significantly improved from M1 to M2, but not all other parameters (all p &gt;.05). The improvements remained at M3 (Foot Posture Index: b = -1.71, t(51) = -2.73, p = .009, [-4,94,0.48]; balance: b = -15.97, t(49) = -2.25, p = .03, [-29.72, 2.21]).</p> Discussion <p>Walking in MS for four weeks might be advantageous for foot health of recreationally active young adults but no chronic remote effects should be expected.</p>","author":"Anna Gabriel","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"56dcdf355f8b605835f19245e240759feac178afd4ede225d80ad274413749d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
