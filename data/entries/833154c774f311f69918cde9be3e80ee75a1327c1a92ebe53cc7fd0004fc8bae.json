{"title":"Principles of the Sub-Econ Dynamics The Econ-Dynamics and the Standard Model (â…¢)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1843/v1","date":1721750343000,"content":"The sub-economic dynamics studies the relationship between people's economic impulses and market behavior. Using Bourbaki structuralism as a philosophical consideration and quantum chromodynamics as a conceptual and modeling method, sub-economic dynamics theory is constructed. In this theory, we discuss the deep structure of the free market and analyze the errors in Mises' anthropological arguments. Sub-economic dynamics is the psychological basis of market dynamics. Guided by the preface, this paper is divided into six sections: (1) The Free Market and Impulse Flavor Charge, including topics such as the fate of the free market, the food chain and psychology, and the flavor charge of economic impulses; (2) The Nature of Economic Impulses, including topics such as the flavor and generation of impulses and counter-impulses, and the bound state of impulses and fractional market charges; (3) Freud's Flavor Charge Space and Spin, including topics such as the Pauli exclusion principle and flavor charge, and Freud's personality theory; (4) Consciousness and Gluons; (5) Gauge Transformations and SU(3) Symmetry Group; and (6) General Discussion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"833154c774f311f69918cde9be3e80ee75a1327c1a92ebe53cc7fd0004fc8bae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
