{"title":"High tumor burden score indicated the unfavorable prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308570","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Wangbin Ma, Rongqiang Liu, Jianguo Wang, Li Liu, Zhendong Qiu, Jia Yu, Weixing Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Tumor burden score (TBS) based on maximum tumor diameter and number has been shown to correlate with prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, the results are conflicting. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to analyze the association between TBS and survival outcomes of HCC patients.</p> Methods <p>A comprehensively search of the databases including PubMed, Embase and Web of Science was performed to retrieve studies satisfying the inclusion criteria until August 31, 2023. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. All the data analyses were carried out by STATA 12.0.</p> Results <p>10 retrospective studies containing 25073 patients were incorporated in the study. The results demonstrated that high TBS was markedly association with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.45–2.23) and relapse-free survival / progression-free survival(RFS/PFS) (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.42–2.07). Subgroup analysis showed that the prognostic value of TBS in HCC was not affected by any subgroup.</p> Conclusions <p>TBS may be an efficient prognostic index in HCC patients.</p>","author":"Wangbin Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c6126305dd93a61c33b3a1058f911082d480082b3c4ecdb275018d8f054eee65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
