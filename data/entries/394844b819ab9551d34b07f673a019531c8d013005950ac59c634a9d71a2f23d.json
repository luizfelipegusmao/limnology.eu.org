{"title":"Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial: Effect of an everyday cognition training program on cognitive function, emotional state, frailty and functioning in older adults without cognitive impairment","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300898","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Susana Sáez-Gutiérrez, Eduardo José Fernández-Rodríguez, Celia Sánchez-Gómez, Alberto García-Martín, Fausto José Barbero-Iglesias, Natalia Sánchez Aguadero</p>\r\nBackground <p>Ageing entails changes in complex cognitive functions that lead to a decrease in autonomy and quality of life. Everyday cognition is the ability to solve cognitively complex problems in the everyday world, enabling instrumental activities of life. Benefits have been found in studies using everyday cognition-based assessment and intervention, as the results predict improvements in everyday performance, not just in specific cognitive functions. A study protocol is presented based on assessment and training in everyday cognition versus traditional cognitive stimulation for the improvement of functionality, emotional state, frailty and cognitive function.</p> Methods <p>A parallel randomised controlled clinical trial with two arms will be conducted. It will be carried out by the University of Salamanca (Spain) in eleven centres and associations for the elderly of the City Council of Salamanca. People aged 60 years or older without cognitive impairment will be recruited. Participants will be randomly distributed into two groups: the experimental group will undergo a training programme in everyday cognition and the control group a programme of traditional cognitive stimulation, completing 25 sessions over 7 months. All participants will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, where socio-demographic data and the following scales will be collected: The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), Questionnaire ARMS-e, Everyday Cognition Test (PECC), Scale Yesavage, Test Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Fragility Index and Lawton y Brody Scale.</p> Discussion <p>The present study aims to improve conventional clinical practice on cognitive function training by proposing a specific assessment and intervention of everyday cognition based on the importance of actual cognitive functioning during the resolution of complex tasks of daily life, giving priority to the improvement of autonomy.</p> Trial registration <p>ClinicalTrials.gov; ID: NCT05688163.
