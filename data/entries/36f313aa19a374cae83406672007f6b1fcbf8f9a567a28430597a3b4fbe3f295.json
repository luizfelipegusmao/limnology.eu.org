{"title":"The Verticillium dahliae Effector VdPHB1 Promotes Pathogenicity in Cotton and Interacts with the Immune Protein GhMC4","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/7/1173/7645833?rss=1","date":1713139200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Verticillium dahliae</span> is a kind of pathogenic fungus that brings about wilt disease and great losses in cotton. The molecular mechanism of the effectors in <span>V. dahliae</span> regulating cotton immunity remains largely unknown. Here, we identified an effector of <span>V. dahliae</span>, VdPHB1, whose gene expression is highly induced by infection. The VdPHB1 protein is localized to the intercellular space of cotton plants. Knock-out of the <span>VdPHB1</span> gene in <span>V. dahliae</span> had no effect on pathogen growth, but decreased the virulence in cotton. <span>VdPHB1</span> ectopically expressed <span>Arabidopsis</span> plants were growth-inhibited and significantly susceptible to <span>V. dahliae</span>. Further, VdPHB1 interacted with the type II metacaspase GhMC4. <span>GhMC4</span> gene-silenced cotton plants were more sensitive to <span>V. dahliae</span> with reduced expression of pathogen defense-related and programmed cell death genes. The accumulation of GhMC4 protein was concurrently repressed when VdPHB1 protein was expressed during infection. In summary, these results have revealed a novel molecular mechanism of virulence regulation that the secreted effector VdPHB1 represses the activity of cysteine protease for helping <span>V. dahliae</span> infection in cotton.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"36f313aa19a374cae83406672007f6b1fcbf8f9a567a28430597a3b4fbe3f295","category":"Environment"}
