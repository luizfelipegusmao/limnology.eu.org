Based on the invariance of the Lagrange equations of plane symmetries static space-time systems under the transformation Lie group, we provide the Lie symmetry determination equation, Lie symmetry theorem, and the conserved quantity of the systems; by utilizing the Lie symmetry method to solute the system, we give complete classification of the plane symmetric static space-times systems. The research results indicate that using the Lie symmetry method to study plane symmetric static spacetime can identify a series of conserved quantities that exist in the system; Discovered 5 basic Lie symmetries in the system; When the metric parameters of the system are appropriately selected, the plane symmetric static spacetime can have 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 17 Lie symmetric symmetries and conserved quantities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ced2ee09e43f1afbbbdf863030885512b0c301b9068f2d27e3d1667c95e16838","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
