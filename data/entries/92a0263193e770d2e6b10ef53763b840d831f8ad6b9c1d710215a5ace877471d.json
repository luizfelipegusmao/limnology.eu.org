{"title":"A diverse diet increases animal growth performance and carcass yield of grazing lambs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae103/7710180?rss=1","date":1720569600000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>The current experiments were conducted across two lamb finishing seasons (2019 [experiment 1; <strong>Exp1</strong>] and 2020 [experiment 2; <strong>Exp2</strong>]). In both experiments lambs were provided a monotonous (<strong>MON</strong>) diet (annual ryegrass [<span>Lolium multiflorum</span> L.] during 2019 and perennial ryegrass [<span>L. perenne</span> L.] and white clover [<span>Trifolium repens</span> L.] during 2020) or a diverse (<strong>DIV</strong>) diet composed of spatially separated strips sown to chicory (<span>Chicorium intybus</span> L.), plantain (<span>Plantago lanceolata</span> L.), perennial ryegrass, lucerne (<span>Medicago sativa</span> L.), and dock (<span>Rumex obtusifolius</span>). During Exp1, the DIV lambs had a stocking rate (<strong>SR</strong>) of either 80, 95, 100, or 110 m<sup>2</sup>/lamb/wk, whereas the MON lambs had a 100 m<sup>2</sup>/lamb/wk SR. In Exp2, the SR aimed to allocate the MON lambs with twice the forage allowance (kg DM/lamb/d) as DIV lambs. In Exp1, all lambs provided DIV had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) average daily gain (<strong>ADG</strong>; + 130%) than MON rams, independent of the SR. Accordingly, DIV had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) hot carcass weight (<strong>HCW</strong>; + 26%) and aged carcass weight (<strong>CW</strong>; + 27%) compared with MON, across all SR. The 80 m<sup>2</sup>/lamb/wk SR tended to have a greater (<span>P</span> = 0.10) dressing percentage and had similar (<span>P</span> = 0.29) drip loss percentage to the MON lambs, while the other DIV lamb SR all had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05; +12%) dressing percentages and lower (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) drip loss percentage than MON lambs. In Exp2, DIV lambs had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) ADG (+37%), HCW (+15%), and dressing percentage (+6%) compared with MON lambs. This improved animal performance occurred despite being offered 57% less (<span>P</span> = 0.01) dry matter (<strong>DM</strong>), 56% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) digestible DM, and 57% less (<span>P</span> = 0.02) metabolizable energy per lamb per day. Ultimately, these experiments demonstrate that providing growing lambs a functionally diverse diet improves animal growth performance and carcass weight compared with a monotonous diet of annual ryegrass or a mixed sward containing perennial ryegrass with white clover.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"92a0263193e770d2e6b10ef53763b840d831f8ad6b9c1d710215a5ace877471d","category":"Environment"}
