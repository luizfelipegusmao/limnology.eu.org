Whether calves seek pain relief post-disbudding offers a novel approach to assessing pain in these animals. By employing an approach-aversion paradigm, we explored the ability of cold therapy to provide immediate pain relief in disbudded calves. Calves were habituated to the manual placement of a cool or ambient pack on their forehead for a short duration simultaneous to milk reward consumption, prior to disbudding. Calves were then disbudded under local anaesthesia (procaine) and analgesia (meloxicam), and responses to the packs were observed over subsequent days. Individual calves were consistently exposed to either cool or ambient packs in different halves of a two-sided experimental pen, allowing for the testing of approach-aversion and conditioned place preference. We found calves approached milk rewards quicker and maintained contact for longer when receiving cold therapy compared to the ambient control. However, calves did not display any conditioned preference for the pen where they received the cool pack. These results add to the growing evidence of lasting pain following disbudding procedures and suggests that cold therapy provides some form of pain relief post-disbudding. Future studies should seek other ways to use cold therapy post-disbudding to reduce aversiveness and human involvement.","author":"Kane P. J.
