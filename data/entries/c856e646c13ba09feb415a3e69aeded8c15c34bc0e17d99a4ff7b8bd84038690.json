{"title":"Histone modifications affecting plant dormancy and dormancy release: common regulatory effects on hormone metabolism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/19/6142/7667488?rss=1","date":1715212800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As sessile organisms, plants enter periods of dormancy in response to environmental stresses to ensure continued growth and reproduction in the future. During dormancy, plant growth is suppressed, adaptive/survival mechanisms are exerted, and stress tolerance increases over a prolonged period until the plants resume their development or reproduction under favorable conditions. In this review, we focus on seed dormancy and bud dormancy, which are critical for adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions. We provide an overview of the physiological characteristics of both types of dormancy as well as the importance of the phytohormones abscisic acid and gibberellin for establishing and releasing dormancy, respectively. Additionally, recent epigenetic analyses have revealed that dormancy establishment and release are associated with the removal and deposition of histone modifications at the loci of key regulatory genes influencing phytohormone metabolism and signaling, including <span>DELAY OF GERMINATION 1</span> and <span>DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box</span> genes. We discuss our current understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms required to establish and release seed dormancy and bud dormancy, while also describing how environmental conditions control dormancy depth, with a focus on the effects of histone modifications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c856e646c13ba09feb415a3e69aeded8c15c34bc0e17d99a4ff7b8bd84038690","category":"Environment"}
