At first, more and more complex lenses were used to provide experimentalists with the necessary flexibility to perform flexible imaging conditions. The introduction of aberration correctors, able to shape the beam beyond standard TEM capabilities, open a completely new realm of possibilities, which quickly spread throughout the world. More recently, the development of complex phase plates allowed studying the influence of exotic electron beams with matters [<a href=\"#ozae044.767-B1\">1</a>], provided improved contrast for imaging soft matter [<a href=\"#ozae044.767-B2\">2</a>] or even improved the microscope performances [<a href=\"#ozae044.767-B3\">3</a>]. However, these last solutions are lacking flexibility as they are composed of fixed designs, which requires tedious process to replace or exchange them, and are only providing a single phase profile. In this work, we introduce the last results obtained from a fully programmable phase plate, and describe future applications which, we believe, will expand the capabilities of TEM imaging, as was observed for the introduction of spatial light modulator (SLM) in photonics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"671d735a23878f2c8b5f2e207f980011195c98c49e7e16ce73f67a2f29bb1b06","category":"Environment"}
