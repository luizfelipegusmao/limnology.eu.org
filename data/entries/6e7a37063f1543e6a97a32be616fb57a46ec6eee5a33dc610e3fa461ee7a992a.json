{"title":"Histological Findings In Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis &ndash; A Retrospective Cohort Study Conducted at \"Dr. Carol Davila\" Central Military Emergency University Hospital in Bucharest","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0466/v2","date":1725054038000,"content":"Histological evidence of active prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) in cardiac valve tissue is widely regarded as a criterion established by Duke to confirm the presence of this condition, although the histological characteristics of mechanical prosthetic valve endocarditis have not yet been definitively established. The primary objective of this study was to determine the histologic differences in mechanical PVE in individuals with either early- or late-onset PVE, with the aim of distinguishing the unique aspects of this rare condition. Histological analysis of mechanical cardiac valve tissue was conducted in 27 patients who underwent surgical valve removal, comprising individuals with early onset and late-onset PVE. The findings were compared between the two groups. Histopathologically, PVE in individuals with mechanical heart valves is typically associated with the formation of vegetation and considerable neutrophil-rich infiltrates. In cases of early onset PVE, the affected valve tissue displays intense inflammation predominantly consisting of lymphocytes. In contrast, valve tissue samples from patients with late-onset PVE exhibit extensive fibrosis and inflammation, comprising macrophages, which are specialized immune cells and calcifications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e7a37063f1543e6a97a32be616fb57a46ec6eee5a33dc610e3fa461ee7a992a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
