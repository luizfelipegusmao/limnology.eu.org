{"title":"Geology and Metallogeny of Shu-Ile Ore Zone Intrusive Complexes (Kazakhstan)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1120/v1","date":1713334803000,"content":"The research is devoted to the study of geotectonic and geodynamics of the Shu-Ile belt and petrographic composition and intrusive complexes geochemical features analysis. The Shu-Ile suture is an important geological structure of Kazakhstan. It is characterized by the presence of various intrusive formations and deep faults. The material composition of these intrusions is of interest for understanding the geological and metallogenic processes in this region. The research used modern scientific methods, including petrographic and geochemical studies of various compositions intrusion samples. Based on the results of material composition studies of intrusive complexes, their possible connections with other geological structures of Kazakhstan and the metallogeny of the region have been established. Based on the data obtained, a conclusion was made about the intrusive complexes origin and evolution of the Shu-Ile belt, which may be important for further geological research and forecasting of mineral resources in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f061ec2dd1d86b68a0da6c28ff6d99e0217de44a502081f701a8fdcf7a48f75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
