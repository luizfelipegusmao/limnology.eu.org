{"title":"Mitigating the Adverse Effects of Salt Stress on Pepper Plants through the Utilization of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Beneficial Bacterial (PGPR) Inoculation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2335/v1","date":1727691564000,"content":"Salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting agricultural productivity. This research investigated the impact of mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), bacteria (PGPR), and their combination on pepper plants under salt stress (200 mM NaCl). Conducted in a controlled climate chamber, the study assessed plant height, stem diameter, leaf number, leaf area, leaf weight, shoot fresh and dry weights, SPAD values, leaf relative water content (RWC), leaf water potential, and mineral concentrations (Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn). AMF application significantly increased plant height (39.50 cm) compared to PGPR (37.75 cm) and the control (37.25 cm). While salt stress reduced plant height by 34.90%, AMF and PGPR mitigated these effects, with AMF improving height by 21.65% under saline conditions. AMF and PGPR positively influenced plant diameter, leaf number, and fresh weight. Physiological measurements, including SPAD values, RWC, and osmotic potential, showed that AMF+PGPR applications were most effective in increasing RWC. Nutrient analysis revealed reduced calcium and magnesium levels due to salt stress. In conclusion, AMF and PGPR enhanced pepper plants' growth and physiological responses under salt stress, indicating their potential to improve agricultural practices in saline environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fe00fcff7f5e830504ceeaff5040ca1bfed12cd45292f6a73d4b3b46f7e0f7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
