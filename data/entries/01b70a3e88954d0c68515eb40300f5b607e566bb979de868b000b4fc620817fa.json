Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques are ideal characterization tools for such materials, providing access to atomic structure, composition, and strain down to the atomic level. Furthermore, electric and magnetic fields can be mapped using Lorentz TEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.729-B2\">2</a>], holography [<a href=\"#ozae044.729-B3\">3</a>] and 4D scanning TEM (STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.729-B4\">4</a>]; while electron energy-loss spectroscopy can provide local information about orbital occupancy and charge transfer [<a href=\"#ozae044.729-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.729-B6\">6</a>]. Experiments can be performed at elevated or reduced temperature (down to below 5 K), with control over applied voltage and magnetic field. For the design, synthesis, and understanding of quantum materials, there is a recognized scientific need for high-resolution TEM characterization at cryogenic temperatures combined with electrical characterization [<a href=\"#ozae044.729-B7\">7-10</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"01b70a3e88954d0c68515eb40300f5b607e566bb979de868b000b4fc620817fa","category":"Environment"}
