{"title":"Runway Safety Assistant Foreseeing Excursions: Calculating Means","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2115/v1","date":1721980815000,"content":"Runway Safety Assistant Foreseeing Excursions (RUN.S.A.F.E.) is a complete embedded system solution that predicts a potential runway overrun of a civil aviation aircraft, during the Take off and Landing. This work examines the feasibility of such a system, through the algorithms and computations that predict the overruns. The system executes both static and dynamic calculations, the former being dependent, while the latter independent to the user’s inputs. Both outcomes and the runway’s length continuously estimate in real time if the process will end up in an overrun. All inputs are specifically selected, to either be available to the pilots, or to be retrieved from the existing avionics systems of the cockpit. A performance evaluation is conducted on both static and dynamic calculations, and metrics unveil the accuracy of the predictions and the time needed to converge to a reliable result. The solution is adapted for a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with CFM56-7B engines, yet the calculations also apply for similar aicrafts, equipped with a tricycle Landing gear and turbofan engines, namely the whole Boeing 737 family, the Airbus A320 family etc.. The system is aligned with current standards and certification specifications, where applicable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69db0c3aacd492792150ed1e9313f810fc4cf2eb42c3bb2f74cd523b8f5c5e32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
