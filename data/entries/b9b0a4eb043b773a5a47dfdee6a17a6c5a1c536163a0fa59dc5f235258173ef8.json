{"title":"Evaluation of the Burden of Musculoskeletal Disorders in Korean Workers Using the Job-Exposure Matrix","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1928/v1","date":1724747764000,"content":"Background: This study attempted to construct musculoskeletal JEM using KWCS data and use it to evaluate the burden of these disorders in Korean workers. Methods: This study was conducted using data from the second to the sixth KWCS, and a total of 210,500 people were included. The jobs of the subjects were reclassified based on the unit groups of the 7th Korean Standard Classification of Occupation (KSCO). The intensity of exposure to work-related risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders was classified into ‘high’, ‘moderate’, and ‘low’ for the body segments involving the ‘upper extremities and neck’, ‘lower back’, and ‘lower extremities’. Results: The time of exposure was longest in the standing posture and repetitive hand and arm movements. An analysis of the intensity of exposure by body segments revealed that the highest intensity of exposure was to the upper extremities. For the upper extremities and neck, and the lower back, there was a exposure-response relationship in the association between intensity of exposure and musculoskeletal symptoms. However, for the lower extremities, there was a exposure-response relationship only at high exposure. Conclusion: In this study, a JEM for work-related risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders was constructed for the first time in Korea. The intensity of exposure to musculoskeletal risk factors was estimated for each occupation. The JEM constructed in this study is expected to have high applicability for assessing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders for each job with respect to the upper extremities and neck, and lower back.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9b0a4eb043b773a5a47dfdee6a17a6c5a1c536163a0fa59dc5f235258173ef8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
