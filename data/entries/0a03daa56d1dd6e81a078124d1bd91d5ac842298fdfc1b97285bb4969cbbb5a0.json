{"title":"Breast Reconstruction in Patients with Prior Breast Augmentation: Searching for the Optimal Reconstructive Option","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2271/v1","date":1725203012000,"content":"Breast cancer in patients with prior breast augmentation poses unique challenges for detection, diagnosis, and management. Mastectomy rates are increasing, and patients with prior augmen-tation often have a lower body mass index, making autologous techniques unsuitable. This study aims to assess the best reconstructive option in patients with a history of subglandular or dual plane breast augmentation. Materials and methods: a prospective analysis was conducted on pa-tients who underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Patients with subglandular or dual plane breast augmentation were included. Patients were divided into submuscular breast recon-struction (group 2) or prepectoral breast reconstruction (group 1) groups. Demographic and sur-gical data were collected. Results: A total of 47 patients were included, with 23 in Group 1 and 24 in the Group 2. Complications occurred in 11 patients (23.4%), with significant differences be-tween groups. The most common complication was seroma formation. Implant loss occurred in 4.3% of cases in the Group 1, while no implant loss was observed in the Group 2. Patient-reported satisfaction scores were similar between groups at 12 months postoperatively. Conclusions: sub-pectoral breast reconstruction with a tissue expander seems a safer and effective technique for pa-tients with prior breast augmentation. It resulted in fewer complications. This approach should be considered as an option for breast reconstruction after mastectomy in this cohort of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a03daa56d1dd6e81a078124d1bd91d5ac842298fdfc1b97285bb4969cbbb5a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
