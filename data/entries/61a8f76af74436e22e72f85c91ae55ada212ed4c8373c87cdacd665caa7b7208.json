To improve Se uptake in fruit trees, we investigated the impact of water extract derived from <i>Nasturtium officinale</i> R. Br. straw on the growth and Se uptake of peach seedlings under Se-enriched soil by a pot experiment. The water extract of <i>N. officinale</i> straw exhibited notable effects on various growth parameters and Se accumulation in peach seedlings, with the most significant outcomes observed at a 200-fold dilution. Specifically, the extract led to substantial enhancements in biomass, photosynthetic pigment content, antioxidant enzyme activity, and soluble protein content in peach seedlings. Remarkably, the 200-fold dilution of <i>N. officinale</i> straw extract resulted in a 60.78% increase in root biomass and a 31.26% increase in shoot biomass when compared to the control. Moreover, the water extract augmented the levels of total Se, inorganic Se, and organic Se, along with the activities of Se metabolism-related enzymes in peach seedlings. Among various tested dilutions, the 300-fold and 400-fold dilutions of <i>N. officinale</i> straw extract exhibited the highest total Se contents in roots and shoots, respectively, indicating increments of 97.26% and 44.08% over their respective controls. Additionally, correlation and gray relational analyses unveiled significant associations between peroxidase activity, soluble protein content, chlorophyll <i>a</i> content, chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio, and the total shoot Se content. In conclusion, the water extract of <i>N. officinale</i> straw holds substantial potential for promoting the growth and Se uptake in peach seedlings, with the best concentration of 300-fold dilution.</p>","author":"Jun Wang, \nXingting Xu, \nKexuan Zhou, \nYaxin Xu, \nXin Jin, \nYunying Xiao, \nXianmin Xia, \nRongping Hu, \nLijin Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"61a8f76af74436e22e72f85c91ae55ada212ed4c8373c87cdacd665caa7b7208","category":"Environment"}
