{"title":"Selective penetration of fullerenol through pea seed coats mitigates osmosis‐repressed germination via chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprograming","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13429?af=R","date":1710751688000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The alteration of chromatin accessibility plays an important role in plant responses to abiotic stress. Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNMs) have attracted increasing interest in agriculture due to their potential impact on crop productivity, showcasing effects on plant biological processes at transcriptional levels; however, their impact on chromatin accessibility remains unknown.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This study found that fullerenol can penetrate the seed coat of pea to mitigate the reduction of seed germination caused by osmotic stress. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the application of fullerenol caused the high expression of genes related to oxidoreduction to return to a normal level. Assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) confirmed that fullerenol application reduced the overall levels of chromatin accessibility of numerous genes, including those related to environmental signaling, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study suggests that fullerenol alleviates osmotic stress on various fronts, encompassing antioxidant, transcriptional, and epigenetic levels. This advances knowledge of the working mechanism of this nanomaterial within plant cells. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Kang Ning, \nTing Sun, \nZhuoyi Wang, \nHailan Li, \nPingping Fang, \nXiaoqi Cai, \nXinyang Wu, \nMin Xu, \nPei Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"9973a5b1736ff261c3d3963137ab63b3135f008ba369903dfd0827f98dd83b7b","category":"Environment"}
