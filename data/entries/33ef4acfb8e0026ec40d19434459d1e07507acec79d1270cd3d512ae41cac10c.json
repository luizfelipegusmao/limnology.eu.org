{"title":"Developing a conceptual framework for characterizing and measuring social resilience in blue-green infrastructure (BGI)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0715/v1","date":1710252901000,"content":"Many cities are increasingly adopting blue-green infrastructure (BGI) to bolster resilience against environmental challenges. Beyond its well-acknowledged environmental benefits, the role of BGI in enhancing social resilience is becoming an equally important area of focus. However, the integration of BGI to foster social resilience presents complexities, stemming from the evolving and occasionally ambiguous definition of social resilience. Given its broad application across diverse disciplines, understanding and measuring social resilience proves difficult, posing challenges to understanding it within a BGI context. However, integrating BGI to support social resilience is complicated by the evolving and sometimes ambiguous definition of social resilience. This concept's broad applicability across various disciplines makes its understanding and measurement challenging, especially within the BGI context. Consequently, a clear need for a framework to effectively understand and measure social resilience in BGI settings exists. This paper synthesizes existing social resilience frameworks, particularly leveraging the comprehensive 5S framework by Saja et al. (2018), to create a new conceptual framework that addresses the unique social dimensions and benefits of BGI, incorporating insights from a broad literature review on social resilience. The framework is structured as a three-tier model centered around four key subdimensions of social resilience: social values, social capital, social structure, and social equity and their interrelationships. Characteristics and indicators are customized to support the BGI context integrating both physical and human dimensions within a mixed methods approach to measurement. Specifically, this research develops a conceptual BGI framework to probe into BGI practices and perspectives that enhance social resilience and considers demographic diversity and the spatial attributes of urban environments to understand how to foster more inclusive and socially resilient BGI spaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33ef4acfb8e0026ec40d19434459d1e07507acec79d1270cd3d512ae41cac10c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
