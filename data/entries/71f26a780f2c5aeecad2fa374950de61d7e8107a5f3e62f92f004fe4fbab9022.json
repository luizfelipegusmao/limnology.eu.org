In the absence of a single systematic approach to gauge conservation effectiveness, we explore both temporal changes in ape abundances and spatial distributions as lines of evidence.\n\nUsing line transect data, we estimate that between 1000 and 2200 apes, with comparable numbers of gorillas and chimpanzees, live in the NCA.\n\nIn contrast to elsewhere in eastern DRC, we found no evidence of a declining ape population or shift in their distribution after the establishment of the NCA (~2012–2013). Spatial models revealed the presence of ape hotspots that remained spatially stable across study years (2013–2020).\n\n<i>Practical implication</i>. That apes in the NCA do not experience rapid declines is a cautious but optimistic first sign of the conservation potential of the NCA and its associated intended (i.e. conservation activities) and unintended (e.g. researcher presence) protection interventions.\n</p>","author":"Yntze van der Hoek, \nFrederik Van de Perre, \nConstance Fastré, \nLucinda Kirkpatrick, \nUrbain Ngobobo, \nRaymond Tokunda, \nEscobar Binyinyi, \nTara S.
