{"title":"Advances in monitoring glaciological processes in Kalallit Nunaat (Greenland) over the past decades","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000379","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Dominik Fahrner, Ginny Catania, Michael G.

Hansen, Karina Löffler, Jakob Abermann</p>\r\n\r\nGreenland’s glaciers have been retreating, thinning and accelerating since the mid-1990s, with the mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) now being the largest contributor to global sea level rise. Monitoring changes in glacier dynamics using in-situ or remote sensing methods has been and remains therefore crucial to improve our understanding of glaciological processes and the response of glaciers to changes in climate. Over the past two decades, significant advances in technology have provided improvements in the way we observe glacier behavior and have helped to reduce uncertainties in future projections. This review focuses on advances in in-situ monitoring of glaciological processes, but also discusses novel methods in satellite remote sensing. We further highlight gaps in observing, measuring and monitoring glaciers in Greenland, which should be addressed in order to improve our understanding of glacier dynamics and to reduce in uncertainties in future sea level rise projections. In addition, we review coordination and inclusivity of science conducted in Greenland and provide suggestion that could foster increased collaboration and co-production.","author":"Dominik Fahrner","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"3809907318097e72eef3f4f285a243519f4761398e34f01b43ee166fbf909b80","category":"Environment"}
