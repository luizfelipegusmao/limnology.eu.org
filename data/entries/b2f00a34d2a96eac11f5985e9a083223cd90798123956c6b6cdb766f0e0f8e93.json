{"title":"Integration of nitrate and abscisic acid signaling in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3259/7658220?rss=1","date":1714003200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To meet the demands of the new Green Revolution and sustainable agriculture, it is important to develop crop varieties with improved yield, nitrogen use efficiency, and stress resistance. Nitrate is the major form of inorganic nitrogen available for plant growth in many well-aerated agricultural soils, and acts as a signaling molecule regulating plant development, growth, and stress responses. Abscisic acid (ABA), an important phytohormone, plays vital roles in integrating extrinsic and intrinsic responses and mediating plant growth and development in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, elucidating the interplay between nitrate and ABA can contribute to crop breeding and sustainable agriculture. Here, we review studies that have investigated the interplay between nitrate and ABA in root growth modulation, nitrate and ABA transport processes, seed germination regulation, and drought responses. We also focus on nitrate and ABA interplay in several reported omics analyses with some important nodes in the crosstalk between nitrate and ABA. Through these insights, we proposed some research perspectives that could help to develop crop varieties adapted to a changing environment and to improve crop yield with high nitrogen use efficiency and strong stress resistance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"b2f00a34d2a96eac11f5985e9a083223cd90798123956c6b6cdb766f0e0f8e93","category":"Environment"}
