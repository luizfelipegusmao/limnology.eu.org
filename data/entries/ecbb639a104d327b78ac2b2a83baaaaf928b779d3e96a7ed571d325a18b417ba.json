{"title":"&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Fine for Those Who Are Interested, But I Don&rsquo;t Care&rdquo;: Uncovering Energy Flexibility of Everyday Rhythms and Routines for Households with Real-Time Electricity Pricing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0537/v1","date":1720173911000,"content":"Reducing and time-shifting household energy demand is important for a sustainable transition of energy systems, and dynamic electricity pricing, like real-time pricing (RTP), is a popular instrument to incite households to change energy demand. However, the effect of such products relies on the assumption that dynamic price signals incorporate into everyday routines and rhythms. This paper investigates the flexibility of households’ everyday routines and rhythms. The study provides three insights based on 11 Danish household visits and interviews with electricity customers who are new to RTP. First, the interviews indicated confusion over terminology for dynamic pricing products and low interest in flexible energy demand. Second, everyday practices (already) appeared flexible but for other reasons than energy demand flexibility. Third, energy habits were important for providing meaning to everyday practices. In addition, the study shows that energy flexibility is not just about energy demand, but rather about all the other activities that form routines and rhythms in everyday life. We suggest 1) designing products that reflect ‘natural’ or ‘societal’ daily rhythms, 2) focusing on the engaged households, and 3) being aware that for some households, changes in pricing, including new payment schemes, might put extra pressure on already harried everyday routines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecbb639a104d327b78ac2b2a83baaaaf928b779d3e96a7ed571d325a18b417ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
