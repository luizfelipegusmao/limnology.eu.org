{"title":"A Methodology for Assessing the Impact of In-Situ Fractures on the Intensity of Blast-Induced Damage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1440/v1","date":1729233420000,"content":"Drilling and blasting is the conventional method used for rock fragmentation in open pit mining. Blast-induced damage can reduce the level of stability of benches and pit slopes. To develop an optimal blast design, an adequate knowledge of the rock properties and in-situ fractures is needed. Fractures are generally the paths of least resistance for explosive energy and can affect the intensity of blast-induced damage. Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) are 3D representations of joint systems used for estimating the distribution of in-situ fractures in a rock mass. The combined finite/discrete element method (FDEM) can be used to simulate the complex rock breakage process during a blast. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology for assessing the influence of in-situ joints on the post-blast fracturing and the associated wall damage in 2D bench blasts scenarios. First, a simple one-blasthole scenario is analyzed with the FDEM software Irazu 2D and calibrated based on a laboratory-scale blasting experiment available from previous literature. Secondly, more complex scenarios consisting of one-blasthole models at the bench-scale were simulated. A bench blast without DFN (base case) and one with DFN, were numerically simulated. The model with DFN demonstrated that the growth path and intensity of blast-induced fractures were governed by pre-existing fractures which led to smaller wall damage area. The damage intensity for the base case scenario is about 42% higher than for the blast model with DFN included, which highlights the significance of in-situ fractures in the resulting blast damage intensity. The methodology for developing the DFN-included blasting simulation provides a more realistic modeling process for blast-induced wall damage assessment. This results in a better characterization of the blast damage zone and can lead to improved slope stability analyses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50358724fb58edfbb44d19c615dad768c5f69270d914d649b97d5af537c4e213","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
