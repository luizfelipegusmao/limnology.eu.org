{"title":"Electrolytes as predictors of fibro fatigue scores in Long-COVID patients","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309348","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Wasim Talib Mahdi Al Masoodi, Sami Waheed Radhi, Hussein Kadhem Al-Hakeim, Habiba Khdair Abdalsada</p>\r\nBackground <p>The complex effects of Long-COVID, a syndrome marked by enduring symptoms after COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on patients’ differing degrees of fibro fatigue (FF). Electrolyte disturbances may affect the severity of FF and may be used as a predictive tool for severe FF in Long-COVID patients.</p> Objective <p>The aim is to use the electrolyte levels for prediction of the Long-COVID patients with high FF levels.</p> Methods <p>The electrolyte levels, calcium, and magnesium, as well as albumin and C-reactive protein levels were measured in 120 Long-COVID patients and 60 controls. FF scale was used for scoring the fatigue severity in all subjects. Patients were divided into high-FF (FF score&gt;25) and moderate-FF group (FF score&lt;25).</p> Results <p>FF is the major effector on the serum biomarker levels. High-FF group had older people, longer disease durations, lower SpO2, higher CRP, and higher peak temperatures than the control group. High-FF group has a significant decrease in serum total and ionized calcium compared with the controls and low-FF group. After controlling the cofounders, the major factor controlling the levels of the measured biomarkers is the FF value (Partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.468). The ROC-AUC analysis showed that the peak body temperature, Low-SpO2, high-CRP, and low electrolytes can predict the high-FF in a patient with Long-COVID with a moderate sensitivity and specificities (61.6–70%).</p> Conclusion <p>Long-COVID patients have an elevation in FF score. The decline in electrolytes can predict the severity of FF with moderate sensitivities and specificities.</p>","author":"Wasim Talib Mahdi Al Masoodi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"da3650066a40d7530927588f1b31377fc25861e360233c90be31b9fe3305ad8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
