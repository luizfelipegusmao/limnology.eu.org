{"title":"Deep Learning-Based Eye Blink Detection in Video Frames: Performance Analysis of Various Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0597/v1","date":1723099855000,"content":"The human eye is a vital source of collecting information worldwide via daily observation. The computer science area recognizes it in research as a human-computer interaction. Human blink is an integral part of this observation as a research topic. Several studies have been conducted on eye blinking and left-right eye movements. Previous studies conducted on the eye blink consider the availability of hardware devices high in the budget, high Precision, and low light expo-sure, unlike our study, which uses low-budget devices as simple as a webcam and more versatile usable techniques, incredibly both dim and high light to name a few. This study offers the observational approach via ResNet101v2, VGG-19, and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Outperforming both VGG-19 and CNN in this study, ResNet101v2 achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.2%. In contemporary times, deep learning in AI is taking an advanced form. This study attempts to provide a new insight into the real-world implementation of the eye blink.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d09ed55604e57f3e3ddea2242a5bd4990092a9bddab169650394b087dea0364","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
