{"title":"Human Robot Interaction and Human-Robot Intimacy: Acceptance of Robots As Intimate Companions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1443/v1","date":1721286030000,"content":"Depictions of robots as romantic partners for humans are frequent in popular culture. As robots are becoming part of human society, they gradually assume the role of partners for humans wherever necessary: as assistants, collaborators, or companions. Companion robots are sup-posed to provide social contact to those humans who could not have it otherwise. These com-panion robots are usually not designed to fulfill one of the most important human needs: the one for romantic and intimate contact. Human-robot intimacy  remains a vastly unexplored ter-ritory. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art research in intimate robotics. We discuss major issues limiting acceptance of robots as intimate partners, public perception of robots in in-timate roles, and the possible influence of cross-cultural differences in these domains. We also discuss possible negative effects human-robot intimacy may have on human-human contact. Most importantly, we propose a new term “Intimate companion robots” to reduce the negative connotations of other terms used so far and improve the social perception of research in the domain. With this article, we provide an outlook on prospects for the development of intimate companion robots, considering the specific context of their use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0de0db345d7a58fe939a229fa18470fc61b0d9844cceb809e5668ea8ccafcff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
