{"title":"Enhanced Vehicle Logo Detection Method Using Mamba Structure for Electric Vehicle Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0558/v1","date":1725634329000,"content":"Vehicle logo detection plays a crucial role in various computer vision applications, such as vehicle classification and detection. In this research, we propose an improved vehicle logo detection method leveraging the MAMBA structure. The MAMBA structure integrates multiple attention mechanisms and bidirectional feature aggregation to enhance the discriminative power of the detection model. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Head Attention for Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MHAMFF) module to capture multi-scale contextual information effectively. Moreover, we incorporate the Bidirectional Aggregation Mechanism (BAM) to facilitate information exchange between different layers of the detection network. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset (VLD-45 dataset) demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline models in terms of both detection accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the MAMBA structure. Overall, the proposed MAMBA-based vehicle logo detection approach shows promising potential for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"049ec50b0a4207b22a4feca744ff9dfb1e98b43b93d97c42086bf9f4f02c8876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
