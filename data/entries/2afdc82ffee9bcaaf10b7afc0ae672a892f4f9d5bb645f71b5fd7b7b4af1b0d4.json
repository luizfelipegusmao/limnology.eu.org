{"title":"Social Robots for Meaningful Seated Activities: Acceptance &amp;amp; Use by Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0167/v1","date":1717489621000,"content":"Healthy aging among older adults requires the maintenance of good physical and cognitive activity. However, in the natural course of aging, older adults usually experience a decline in their physical and cognitive activity, causing an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Some older adults may not have a choice but to become increasingly sedentary as they age due to injury or deteriorated physicality. As such they require a manner of assistive technologies to aid in their daily lives and activities to maintain healthy cognitive function. Social Robots are a newer form of assistive technology, specifically designed for social interactions and gameplay. As with other assistive technologies, compliance barriers to the acceptance and use of social robots and types of meaningful, seated activities among older adults are expected. To better explore this phenomenon, improve quality of life and understand what drives older adults to accept and use newer forms of technology like social robots, this research conjoins two conceptual frameworks: The Activity Theory of Aging (ATA) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). As social robots hold great promise for improving the quality of life for older adults, exploring what driving factors could enable their greater acceptance and use is essential to furthering this field of study within Australia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2afdc82ffee9bcaaf10b7afc0ae672a892f4f9d5bb645f71b5fd7b7b4af1b0d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
