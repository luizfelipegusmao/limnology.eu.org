Nanostructured polymers with metallic nanoparticles have received special attention due to the properties they present, giving potential for innovative applications in different fields. In this context, zinc oxide (ZnO) has been highlighted as a nanoparticle with physical and chemical properties, such as its high chemical stability, high radiation absorption range and high photostability. Furthermore, its size on the nanometer scale provides a large surface area and a high surface-to-volume ratio, which confers additional potential in interaction with other materials and their environment. Incorporating ZnO nanoparticles into a polymer matrix can provide improved properties and additional functionalities, taking advantage of both components.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"327cf03a18bf4ca5e46b99c7c4abce2340109ace13d01078bbee3d28dbed1689","category":"Environment"}
