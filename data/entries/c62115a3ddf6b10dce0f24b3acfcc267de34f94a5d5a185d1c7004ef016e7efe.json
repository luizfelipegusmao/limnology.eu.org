The study utilizes panel data from the period of 2002–2020. The findings indicate that there is a significant and positive relationship between innovation (INV) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (0.0244), while GE has a significant and negative impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (−0.5753). In a similar vein, it can be observed that both INV and government efficacy exert a substantial and favorable influence on the process of economic growth (0.0353 and 0.0773). Furthermore, the interaction of INV and GE showed a noteworthy moderating effect on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (−0.1581). Conversely, it exhibited a more pronounced positive influence on economic growth (0.1122). The study highlights that synergizing INV with GE is essential for attaining sustainable economic growth in the studied area.</p>","author":"Sardar Fawad Saleem, \nMuhammad Azam Khan, \nMuhammad Tariq","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"c62115a3ddf6b10dce0f24b3acfcc267de34f94a5d5a185d1c7004ef016e7efe","category":"Environment"}
