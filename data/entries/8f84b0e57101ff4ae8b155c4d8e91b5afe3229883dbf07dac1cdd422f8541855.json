Modern characterization techniques such as Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) can quantify crystallographic texture, though this approach is typically limited to sub-millimeter length scales and requires specialized equipment. Furthermore, extensions of two-dimensional crystallographic characterization techniques to the third dimension using destructive methods, <span>e.g.</span> 3D-EBSD, dramatically increases the effort required for data collection, especially for increasing sample dimensions [<a href=\"#ozae044.132-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.132-B2\">2</a>]. In some cases, the high resolution and fidelity of these methods directly competes with the benefits of faster collection time over larger sample dimensions. As such, there is currently a resurgence of interest in combining quantitative light microscopy techniques and computational methods to extract pertinent crystallographic information [<a href=\"#ozae044.132-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8f84b0e57101ff4ae8b155c4d8e91b5afe3229883dbf07dac1cdd422f8541855","category":"Environment"}
