{"title":"Rapid terrace incision and Quaternary landscape evolution in central Patagonia","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3578?af=R","date":1707372847000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The debate over isostatic uplift versus discharge as drivers of Quaternary river incision is explored here through geospatial analysis of a ~250-m-relief terrace sequence from the Río Pinturas (Argentine Patagonia). The geomorphic setting of the Cañadon Caracoles reach allows evaluation of discharge as a driver of terrace incision because advancing ice during Pleistocene glaciations blocked Pacific drainage and routed meltwater from an expanded ~10<sup>4</sup>-km<sup>2</sup> catchment to the Atlantic through the dryland steppe of the study area. Twenty-two terrace levels, some assigned to previously dated ice margins [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 32–36, MIS 16, MIS 8 and MIS 2], were identified. Average net incision since 800 ka (~0.34 m ka<sup>−1</sup>) exceeded regional uplift rates. The MIS 2 terraces, with <i>ante quem</i> and <i>post quem</i> age constraint on the timing of terrace formation, show that terrace incision was episodic and faster still during a transitional warming climate. Glacier recession and proglacial lake formation at ~18 ka led to rapid incision of ~11.7 m ka<sup>−1</sup> over a few millennia. River capture and negligible flow from ~15.0 ka caused fan-dammed lake formation on the valley floor and vertical stability during MIS 1. The Pinturas terraces demonstrate rapid incision can be driven by discharge and sediment dynamics.</p>","author":"Varyl Robert Thorndycraft","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"a784af252ac490f020bafbd2db1d1e65193b83a1472059b505dd0f3a1a97a0bd","category":"Environment"}
