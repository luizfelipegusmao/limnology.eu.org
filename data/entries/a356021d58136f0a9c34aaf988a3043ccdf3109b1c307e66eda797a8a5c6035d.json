{"title":"A Head-to-Head Comparison of the First-Line Treatments for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer: Has Chemotherapy Still a Role?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0289/v1","date":1718015085000,"content":"Background:  Patients with locally advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer have been conventionally treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Recently, numerous new treatments have been proposed to improve overall survival (OS) and reduce adverse effects, but no head-to-head direct comparison is available. \nMethods: We considered: a) monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI); b) combinations of an ICI with chemotherapy; c) combinations of an ICI with other drugs. An indirect comparison was performed to identify the regimens most effective in prolonging OS compared to each other and to chemotherapy. \nResults:  A total of 6 articles were included. In our final analysis, nivolumab plus chemotherapy showed better OS compared to chemotherapy (HR= 0.70, 95%CI: .59-0.82); while durvalumab plus tremelimumab showed no OS benefit (HR=0.95, 95%CI 0.82-1.11).  More interestingly, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab significantly prolonged OS compared to both chemotherapy alone (HR=0.53, 95%CI 0.45-0.63) and  nivolumab plus chemotherapy (HR= 0.76, 95%CI 0.60-0.97).\n\nDiscussion and conclusion: Among new treatments for locally advanced and metastatic urothelial\ncancer, enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab showed the best efficacy in terms of OS. Our results\nsupport the use of this combination as first-line treatment in this setting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a356021d58136f0a9c34aaf988a3043ccdf3109b1c307e66eda797a8a5c6035d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
