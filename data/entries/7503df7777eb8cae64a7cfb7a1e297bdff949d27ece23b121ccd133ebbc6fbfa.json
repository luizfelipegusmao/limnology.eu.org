{"title":"PSVII-9 Improvement of feed efficiency in Korean Hanwoo cattle: investigation of feed intake and analysis of residual feed intake (RFI)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/447/7757545?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Feed efficiency is an important economic trait in beef cattle production, and improving feed efficiency can reduce production costs and environmental impact. Residual feed intake (RFI) is a useful measure of individual feed efficiency, representing the difference between the actual feed intake of an animal and its predicted feed intake based on its body weight (BW) and growth. This study aimed to investigate feed intake and analyze RFI in Hanwoo cattle to improve feed efficiency. Data were collected from 120 Hanwoo steers (9 to 11 mo old) from six different test stations across the country. Individual daily feed intake of concentrates and forage was recorded over 70 d, and BW was measured at the beginning and end of the feeding trial. Daily feed intake was calculated using the TDN values of the concentrates and forage. Expected feed intake was estimated using a linear regression model based on metabolic BW and daily gain. RFI was calculated as the difference between expected and actual feed intake. Average daily gain ranged from 1.05 to 1.71 kg/d, and average daily feed intake ranged from 5.10 to 7.72 kg/d across the test stations. RFI values ranged from -0.84 to 0.95 kg/d, indicating significant variation in feed efficiency among the animals. This study provides valuable information on feed intake and RFI in Hanwoo cattle. Further research with a larger dataset is needed to develop a genetic evaluation model for RFI and to select animals with superior feed efficiency for improving Hanwoo cattle production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7503df7777eb8cae64a7cfb7a1e297bdff949d27ece23b121ccd133ebbc6fbfa","category":"Environment"}
