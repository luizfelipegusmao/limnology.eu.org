Pilferage is a critical step in this process in which animals steal seeds from other individuals' caches. Pilferers often recache stolen seeds, which are often pilfered by new individuals, who may recache again, and so on, potentially leading to compounded increased dispersal distance. However, little research has investigated intraspecific differences in pilfering frequency, despite its importance in better understanding the role of behavioural diversity in the valuable ecosystem service of seed dispersal.\n\nWe conducted a field experiment in Maine (USA) investigating how intraspecific variation, including personality, influences pilferage effectiveness.\n\nWithin the context of a long-term capture-mark-recapture study, we measured the unique personality of 3311 individual small mammals of 10 species over a 7-year period. For this experiment, we created artificial caches using eastern white pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>) seeds monitored with trail cameras and buried antennas for individual identification.\n\nOf the 436 caches created, 83.5% were pilfered by 10 species, including deer mice ((<i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i>) and southern red-backed voles (<i>Myodes gapperi</i>). We show how individuals differ in their ability to pilfer seeds and that these differences are driven by personality, body condition and sex. More exploratory deer mice and those with lower body condition were more likely to locate a cache, and female southern red-backed voles were more likely than males to locate caches. Also, caches were more likely to be pilfered in areas of higher small mammal abundance.\n\nBecause the risk of pilferage drives decisions concerning where an animal chooses to store seeds, pilferage pressure is thought to drive the evolution of food-hoarding behaviour. Our study shows that pilferage ability varies between individuals, meaning that some individuals have a disproportionately strong influence on others' caching decisions and disproportionately contribute to compounded longer-distance seed dispersal facilitated by pilferage. Our results add to a growing body of knowledge showing that the unique personalities of individual small mammals play a critical role in forest regeneration by impacting seed dispersal.\n</p>","author":"Brigit R.
