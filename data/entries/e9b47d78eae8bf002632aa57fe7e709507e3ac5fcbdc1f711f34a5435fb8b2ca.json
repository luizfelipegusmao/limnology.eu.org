{"title":"Pricing and Financing Strategies of Dual-Channel Green Supply Chain with Risk Aversion and Consumer Preferences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1811/v1","date":1716873734000,"content":"Nowadays, considering the growing tendency of companies towards e-commerce as well as green production, and dual-channel green supply chain management has become particularly important. This paper investigates pricing decisions within a dual-channel green supply chain framework while considering the capital constraints faced by risk-averse manufacturer. Simultaneously, the impact of the degree of risk aversion, consumer green preferences, and channel preferences on the optimal decision-making process of green supply chain members is analyzed. We address the issue of financial constraints faced by manufacturer through bank loans and trade credit financing and compare the two cases. Our findings illustrate that trade credit financing outperforms bank loan financing in the dual-channel green supply chain. Moreover, pricing decisions under different models are influenced by consumer preferences and risk aversion. Specifically, the greenness of the product, wholesale price, and sale price exhibit negative correlations with manufacturers' risk aversion but positive correlations with consumer preferences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9b47d78eae8bf002632aa57fe7e709507e3ac5fcbdc1f711f34a5435fb8b2ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
