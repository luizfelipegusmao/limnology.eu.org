{"title":"Glycemic Control Efficacy of &lsquo;Avaram Amrit&rsquo; in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A 12-Week Open-Label Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0846/v1","date":1728635493000,"content":"Background: Avaram Amrit, derived from a traditional medicinal plant, has shown potential in diabetes management. This study aimed to evaluate its clinical efficacy in glycemic control. Methods: A 12-week, open-label clinical trial was conducted with 9 type 2 diabetes patients. Participants received Avaram Amrit extract daily. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels were measured bi-weekly, with HbA1c assessed at baseline and week 12. Results: Fasting glucose levels decreased significantly from 252.54 ± 71.99 mg/dL at baseline to 195.50 ± 55.01 mg/dL at week 12 (p&lt;0.001), representing a 22.6% reduction. Mean HbA1c decreased by 1.25 percentage points. Postprandial glucose levels showed consistent improvement across the study period. A strong positive correlation was observed between initial HbA1c and fasting glucose (r=0.89). Conclusion: Avaram Amrit demonstrated significant improvement in glycemic control over 12 weeks. The consistent decrease in both short-term (glucose levels) and long-term (HbA1c) measures indicates a positive response to the intervention. While promising, larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings and establish Avaram Amrit's role in diabetes management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0659b155505ce9615a4599e52837cbe67484bdfafe1dffd6b0fa512fbb6afc42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
