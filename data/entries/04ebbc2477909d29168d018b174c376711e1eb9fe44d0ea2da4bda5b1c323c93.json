{"title":"Effects of natural flood management woody dams on benthic macroinvertebrates and benthic metabolism in upland streams: Importance of wood‐induced geomorphic changes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2654?af=R","date":1714355307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Natural Flood Management (NFM) aims to reduce flood hazard by working with nature and is gaining prominence worldwide. One particular NFM technique involves the use of channel-spanning woody dams that maintain a clearance height above baseflow. These dams function by increasing channel roughness during high flows and by forcing excessive water onto the floodplain. Whether these dams provide additional benefits to nature remains unclear. While there are many existing studies on natural in-stream wood structures, very few have documented the impact of NFM woody dams in particular. This study adopted a multidisciplinary approach and a Before–After Control–Impact (BACI) research design to assess whether NFM woody dams installed in a small upland catchment had driven changes in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and benthic metabolic activities through the geomorphic changes that they had created. Statistical results indicate that macroinvertebrate density, richness, and diversity did not show any difference between stream reaches with and without NFM woody dams. The metrics were generally not related to grain-size parameters and volumes of sediments eroded or deposited. However, individual genera such as <i>Baetis</i> and <i>Rhithrogena</i> became more dominant in the control reach towards the end of the study period, likely due to the higher flow velocities and coarser sediments there resulting from the lack of flow resistance in the absence of NFM woody dams. Rates of benthic respiration (but not rates of photosynthesis) were consistently significantly higher in woody dam reaches than in control reaches, likely due to the presence of patches of finer sediments in the former.</p>","author":"Ho Wen Lo, \nMegan Klaar, \nMark Smith, \nClare Woulds","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"04ebbc2477909d29168d018b174c376711e1eb9fe44d0ea2da4bda5b1c323c93","category":"Environment"}
