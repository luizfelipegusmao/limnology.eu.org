{"title":"Optimizing Mechanical and Electrical Performance of SWCNTs/Fe3O4 Epoxy Nanocomposites: The Role of Filler Concentration and Alignment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1274/v1","date":1724123902000,"content":"The demand for polymer composites with improved mechanical and electrical properties is crucial for advanced aerospace, electronics, and energy storage applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and iron oxide (Fe₃O₄) nanoparticles are key fillers that enhance these properties, yet challenges like orientation, uniform dispersion, and agglomeration must be addressed to realize their full potential. This study focuses on developing SWCNTs/Fe₃O₄ epoxy composites by keeping the SWCNT concentration constant at 0.03 Vol.% and varying Fe₃O₄ concentrations at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 Vol.% with two different configurations: randomly orientated (R-) and magnetic field-assisted horizontally aligned (A-) SWCNTs/Fe3O4 epoxy composites and investigates the effects of filler concentration, dispersion, and magnetic alignment on the mechanical and electrical properties. The research reveals that both composite configurations achieve an optimal mechanical performance at 0.5 Vol.% Fe₃O₄, while A- SWCNTs/Fe3O4 epoxy composites outperformed at all concentrations. However, at 1 Vol.% Fe₃O₄, mechanical properties decline due to nanoparticle agglomeration, which disrupts stress distribution. In contrast, electrical conductivity peaks at 1 Vol.% Fe₃O₄, indicating that the higher density of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles enhances the conductive network despite the mechanical losses. This study highlights the need for precise control over filler content and alignment to optimize mechanical strength and electrical conductivity in SWCNTs/Fe₃O₄ epoxy nanocomposites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d94cc53f6e661d9fe10d3b47eddebf93aa893de9a8c36bc99dcc0e02b303c1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
