{"title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Supply Chain Responsiveness and Customer Loyalty in the E-commerce Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1616/v1","date":1719211364000,"content":"This qualitative study explores the relationship between supply chain responsiveness (SCR) and customer loyalty within the e-commerce sector. E-commerce has revolutionized global commerce, driven by technological advancements and shifting consumer behaviors. Central to e-commerce success is the ability to meet customer expectations swiftly and reliably, necessitating agile supply chain management (SCM) practices. SCR in e-commerce encompasses the capacity to adapt to dynamic market demands, minimize disruptions, and enhance customer satisfaction through efficient logistics, inventory management, and last-mile delivery. Through in-depth interviews with customers, e-commerce platform managers, and supply chain practitioners, this study investigates key themes, challenges, strategies, and impacts associated with SCR and customer loyalty. Findings reveal that customers prioritize fast order fulfillment, reliable service quality, personalized experiences, and trustworthy interactions, all of which significantly influence their loyalty and advocacy behaviors. Challenges identified include inventory management complexities, logistical hurdles in last-mile delivery, and the need for effective supplier communication. Strategic approaches to enhance SCR include leveraging data analytics for demand forecasting, adopting agile SCM practices, integrating customer feedback into service improvements, and fostering collaborative relationships with suppliers. These strategies not only optimize operational efficiency but also cultivate enduring customer relationships based on satisfaction, trust, and loyalty. The study concludes that improved SCR practices lead to increased customer satisfaction, repeat purchases, and positive word-of-mouth, thereby strengthening competitive advantage and sustainability in the e-commerce marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8e15fc2a4505cf25c108f324dcff77b6791c6d503882e4e998beb03798ebbd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
