{"title":"Single-cell insights into mouse testicular toxicity under peripubertal exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/200/2/287/7668449?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Male fertility depends on normal pubertal development. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a potent antiandrogen chemical, and exposure to DEHP during peripuberty can damage the developing male reproductive system, especially the testis. However, the specific cellular targets and differentiation processes affected by DEHP, which lead to testicular toxicity, remain poorly defined. Herein, we presented the first single-cell transcriptomic profile of the pubertal mouse testis following DEHP exposure. To carry out the experiment, 2 groups (<span>n</span> = 8 each) of 3-week-old male mice were orally administered 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt or 100 mg/kg body weight DEHP daily from postnatal day 21–48, respectively. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, a total of 31 distinct cell populations were identified, notably, Sertoli and Leydig cells emerged as important targets of DEHP. DEHP exposure significantly decreased the proportions of Sertoli cell clusters expressing mature Sertoli markers (<span>Sox9</span> and <span>Ar</span>), and selectively reduced the expression of testosterone synthesis genes in fetal Leydig cells. Through cell–cell interaction analyses, we observed changed numbers of interactions in Sertoli cells 1 (SCs1), Leydig cells 1 (LCs1), and interstitial macrophages, and we also identified cell-specific ligand gene expressions in these clusters, such as <span>Inha</span>, <span>Fyn</span>, <span>Vcam1</span>, and <span>Apoe.</span> Complementary in vitro assays confirmed that DEHP directly reduced the expression of genes related to Sertoli cell adhesion and intercellular communication. In conclusion, peripubertal DEHP exposure reduced the number of mature Sertoli cells and may disrupt testicular steroidogenesis by affecting the testosterone synthesis genes in fetal Leydig cells rather than adult Leydig cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"d0f3fecffe9305d2b52a1ae2dc2c7d43f77f54f018f0d6115109684b988e6735","category":"Environment"}
