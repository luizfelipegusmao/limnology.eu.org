{"title":"Association of Hormonal Contraceptives with Depression among Women in Reproductive Age-Groups- a Cross-Sectional Analytic Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1510/v1","date":1718957465000,"content":": Objective-Most women stop using hormonal contraceptives due to changes in their mood. The evidence regarding the association of hormonal contraception with depression shows mixed results. Therefore, we aim to establish the association between the use of hormonal contraception and depressive symptoms. Method- This cross-sectional study was conducted on 326 women of reproductive age using hormonal contraceptives for a week to one year referred to as \"hormonal contraceptive (HC) users\" (n=165), and those using non-hormonal methods and not using contraceptives referred to as \"HC non-users\" (n=161). Beck's depression inventory (BDI-II) was used to measure depression. Result-There was no discernible difference in mean Beck's depression inventory score and degree of depression between the two groups. However, individual symptoms of depression such as sadness(p=0.01), reduced libido(p=0.0002) feelings of pessimism (p=0.02), and failure (p=0.003) were found to be significantly high in the HC user group. Conclusion- We conclude that there was no significant difference in mean depression scores between groups. However, few individual symptoms of depression were high in HC users suggesting depression as a potential side effect of hormonal contraceptive use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e744a696d33dcf0a348a109663463d716339eba2ecb6dbdba0ec815ded4b0e6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
