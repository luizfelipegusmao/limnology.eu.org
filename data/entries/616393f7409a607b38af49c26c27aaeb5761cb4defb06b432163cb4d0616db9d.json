{"title":"Control of three-phase two-level inverters: A stochastic LPV model approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1721/v1","date":1729592760000,"content":"This paper aims to propose a stochastic linear parameter varying (LPV) model approach to design a state feedback controller for three-phase two-level inverters. To deal with the parameter changes, stochastic noise and delays faced by the inverter, it is modeled as a stochastic LPV system with time delay. The stability analysis and control synthesis are conducted for the LPV system. With parameter-dependent Lyapunov functionals, the sufficient stability condition for asymptotical mean-square stability is obtained. In addition, the slack matrix technique is employed to improve the feasibility and reduce the conservatism of the conditions. The obtained theoretical results are applied to the three-phase two-level inverter, whose currents are treated as state variables and controlled to reach the equilibrium point. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed theories and demonstrate the advantages of using the slack matrix.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"616393f7409a607b38af49c26c27aaeb5761cb4defb06b432163cb4d0616db9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
