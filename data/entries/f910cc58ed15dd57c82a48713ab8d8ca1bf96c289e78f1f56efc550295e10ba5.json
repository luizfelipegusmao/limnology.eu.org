{"title":"Sustainability Consciousness and Awareness of Sustainable Development Goals among Future Engineers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1920/v1","date":1727190022000,"content":"Since engineering discipline is at the forefront of latest innovations and developments, there is an increasing emphasis on the critical responsibilities of engineers towards sustainability. There are several studies investigating the incorporation of sustainability principles into engineering curriculum but studies analyzing the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of engineering students are lacking. A deeper understanding of the current state of studentsâ€™ knowledge, attitude, and behavior towards sustainability is crucial to determine the type of pro-sustainability trainings, strategies and pedagogical activities needed. Hence, the current study is aimed at assessing the level of sustainability cognizance of Mechanical Engineering students via an online Sustainability Consciousness Questionnaire. The final sample size was 134 students from a Higher Education Institute in India with 90% male responders and 52% from urban areas. Results indicate that 70% of the respondents have heard of the Sustainable Development Goals, only around 32% of the students demonstrate a positive behavior and attitude towards sustainability whereas 30% of the students do not hold any opinion towards sustainability principles. The current exploratory study contributes to the knowledge base about sustainability awareness and consciousness and advocates for measures to insert its principles in engineering courses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f910cc58ed15dd57c82a48713ab8d8ca1bf96c289e78f1f56efc550295e10ba5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
