An ideal SEI is expected to be electrically insulative to prevent persistently parasitic reactions between the electrode and the electrolyte and ionically conductive to facilitate Faradaic reactions of the electrode. Despite the critical importance of the electrical properties of the SEI, quantitative measurement of this parameter remains unsolved due to the lack of a proper and reliable method [<a href=\"#ozae044.1045-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1045-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"304ac9d262c26a4c807795501131b87d5fcf11f324e4290281fd30dda78e55b1","category":"Environment"}
