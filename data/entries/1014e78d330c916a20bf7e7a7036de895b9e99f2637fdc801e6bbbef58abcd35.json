{"title":"Comparison of physiological markers, behavior monitoring, and clinical illness scoring as indicators of an inflammatory response in beef cattle","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302172","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Aiden E.

Daigle</p>\r\n\r\nClinical illness (CI) scoring using visual observation is the most widely applied method of detecting respiratory disease in cattle but has limited effectiveness in practice. In contrast, body-mounted sensor technology effectively facilitates disease detection. To evaluate whether a combination of movement behavior and CI scoring is effective for disease detection, cattle were vaccinated to induce a temporary inflammatory immune response. Cattle were evaluated before and after vaccination to identify the CI variables that are most indicative of sick cattle. Respiratory rate (H<sub>2</sub> = 43.08, P &lt; 0.0001), nasal discharge (H<sub>2</sub> = 8.35, P = 0.015), and ocular discharge (H<sub>2</sub> = 16.38, P = 0.0003) increased after vaccination, and rumen fill decreased (H<sub>2</sub> = 20.10, P &lt; 0.0001). Locomotor activity was measured via leg-mounted sensors for the four days preceding and seven days following vaccination. A statistical model that included temperature, steps, lying time, respiratory rate, rumen fill, head position, and excess saliva was developed to distinguish between scores from before and after vaccination with a sensitivity of 0.898 and specificity of 0.915. Several clinical illness signs were difficult to measure in practice. Binoculars were required for scoring respiratory rate and eye-related metrics, and cattle had to be fitted with colored collars for individual identification. Scoring each animal took up to three minutes in a small research pen; therefore, technologies that can automate both behavior monitoring and identification of clinical illness signs are key to improving capacity for BRD detection and treatment.","author":"Aiden E.
