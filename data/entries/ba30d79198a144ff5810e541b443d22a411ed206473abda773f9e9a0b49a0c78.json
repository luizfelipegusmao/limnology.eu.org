{"title":"The inhibitory effects of free and bound phenolics from Phyllanthus emblica Linn. on α‐amylase: a comparison study","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13796?af=R","date":1723466644000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Phyllanthus emblica</i> Linn. (PE) is rich in polyphenols, which can be categorized into free and bound phenolics (PEFP and PEBP). This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of PEFB and PEBP on <i>α</i>-amylase for the first time. The mechanism of the inhibition effect of PEFP and PEBP on <i>α</i>-amylase was investigated by enzyme inhibition kinetics, multispectral analysis, thermodynamics, and molecular docking.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Free and bound phenolics inhibited <i>α</i>-amylase activity effectively in a mixed type of inhibition. Fluorescence quenching and thermodynamic analyses showed that the binding of PEFP and PEBP to <i>α</i>-amylase occurred through a static quenching process (<i>K</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>q</i>\n</sub> = 6.94 × 10¹² and 5.74 × 10¹² L mol<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), which was accompanied by a redshift (<i>λ</i>em from 343 to 347 nm), leading to a change in the microenvironment. This process was found to be a spontaneous exothermic reaction (ΔG &lt; 0). Circular dichroism (CD) analysis confirms that the secondary structure of <i>α</i>-amylase was altered, in particular a decrease in <i>α</i>-helixes and an increase in random coils. Molecular docking studies showed that PEFP and PEBP interacted with <i>α</i>-amylase through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study provides valuable insights into the mechanism of action of PEFP and PEBP on <i>α</i>-amylase, which will provide a theoretical basis for their possible use as novel natural <i>α</i>-amylase inhibitors. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mingxia Xing, \nFan Xie, \nGuangqiang Wang, \nChunmei Yuan, \nSiyan Huang, \nTingrun Zhou, \nZibo Song, \nLianzhong Ai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ba30d79198a144ff5810e541b443d22a411ed206473abda773f9e9a0b49a0c78","category":"Environment"}
