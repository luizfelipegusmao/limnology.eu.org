Community-led monitoring (CLM) is a rapidly proliferating health systems strengthening intervention for improving healthcare services and documenting human rights violations, through social empowerment and political accountability. Driven in part by increasing financial support from donors, a growing number of countries are implementing CLM programs. This study aimed to identify early challenges and lessons learned from CLM implementation, with the aim of informing and improving the implementation of CLM programs and ultimately achieving greater impact on the delivery of services. Twenty-five CLM implementors representing 21 countries participated in an interview. Early generation of buy-in from diverse stakeholders was noted as critical for CLM success. Leveraging existing networks of service users and community organizations to implement CLM also helped to maximize program reach and resources. Uncertainty around CLM’s purpose and roles among CLM stakeholders resulted in challenges to community leadership and ownership of programs. Respondents also described challenges with underfunded programs, especially advocacy components, and inflexible donor funding mechanisms. Critical capacity gaps remain around advocacy and electronic data collection and use. With the rapid expansion of CLM, this study serves as an important first step in characterizing challenges and successes in the CLM landscape. Successful implementation of CLM requires prioritizing community ownership and leadership, donor commitment to sustainable and reliable funding, and strengthened support of programs across the data collection and advocacy lifecycle.","author":"Alana R.
