{"title":"Peripheral Artery Disease (P.A.D.): Vascular Hemodynamic Simulation Using a Printed Circuit Board (P.C.B.) Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0855/v1","date":1728614685000,"content":"Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a significant health issue in developed countries. Stenosis of an artery produces substantial changes in blood flow and, consecutively, in its hemodynamics. By simulating the stenosis (obstruction) - arterial environment, valuable insights are obtained. Various methodologies are used to simulate an arterial flow distribution. In this study, a 0D  model using a printed circuit board (P.C.B.) is proposed. The model mimics a medium-sized single artery stenosis. Various degrees of stenosis are simulated. Results show that the P.C.B. model accurately predicts the hemodynamic changes produced by stenosis of a medium-sized artery. Also, the model is sensitive to the arterial wall stats. In conclusion, the P.C.B. design is a viable method for hemodynamic simula-tions. Moreover, to enhance the precision and intricacy of the simulation, the complexity and design of the P.C.B. must be augmented. Additionally, alongside subsequent computational fluid dynamics (C.F.D.) studies, the model will extract significant insights into the vascular dynamics of arterial stenosis","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"577449573d94051f476044a9983563ad39462b64d03360a27b8a1a9898e5cb3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
