{"title":"A Visualization Method of Large‚ÄêSize Vector Published Map","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1282/v1","date":1729068555000,"content":"Vector published map, as a result of pre-press printing of paper map digital publishing, is a page file in line with PostScript standards. With large amount of data and a large number of map page graphics objects, the browsing speed is slow and the hardware performance is very high, which seriously affects the breadth and depth of the application of vector published map. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a visualization method of large-size vector published map. This method adopts the idea of tiling. The vector published map is physically cropped into several PDF tiles to form a map logically. Data encoding and organization are based on the GeoSOT earth division grid to realize the rapid loading, scaling, display of map data and the correlation retrieval of map product \"map and spatial data integration\". The experiment shows that the response time of map data loading and browsing is much less than that of professional software, and the method is insensitive to data volume and has low requirement on hardware performance. This method can not only make up the disadvantages of image tiles in the existing network map service, but also make the vector published map can be used in embedded devices, mobile terminals, network modes and other cross-media applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"278cf695867ede44a8013e3c39418d09dd7a4ada152e18abb92a4a8164bd1665","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
