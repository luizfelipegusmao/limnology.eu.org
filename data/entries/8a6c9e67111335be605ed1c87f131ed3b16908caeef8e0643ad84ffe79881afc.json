{"title":"The Novel Impact of Augmented Reality and 3D Printing in the Diagnosis of Complex Acetabular Fractures: A Comparative Randomized Study in Orthopedic Residents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1994/v1","date":1714470288000,"content":"Augmented Reality (AR) and 3D printing (3DP) are novel technologies in the orthopedic field. Over the past decade, enthusiasm for these new digital applications is driving new perspectives in improving diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the field of traumatology. Currently, however, it is still difficult to quantify the value and impact in the medical-scientific field especially in the improvement of diagnostic in complex fractures. Acetabulum fractures have always been a challenge among orthopedics, for volumetric complexity and low diagnostic reliability.Background/Objectives: The goal of this study is to determine whether these methods can improve the learning aspect and diagnostic accuracy of complex acetabulum fractures compared to gold standard CT (computed tomography). Methods: Orthopedic residents of our department have been selected and divided into Junior (JUN) and Senior (SEN) groups. Associated fractures of acetabulum have been included in the study, obtaining : CT-scans, 3DP model, and AR model displayed on a tablet screen. In a double-blind questionnaire, each resident classified every fracture according to methods. Diagnostic accuracy (DA), response time (RT), agreement (R), and confidence (C) were measured. Results: 20 residents (JUN=10, SEN=10) classified five fractures. Overall DAs were 26% (CT), 18% (3DP), and 29% (AR). AR-DA resulted to be superior to 3DP-DA (p=0,04). DA means (JUN vs SEN respectively) were :CT-DA was 20% vs 32% (p&amp;lt;0.05), 3DP-DA was 12% vs 24% (p=0.08), and AR-DA was 28% vs 30% (p=0,80). Overall RT was 61.2 sec (±24,6) for CT, 35.8 sec (±20,1) for 3DP, and 46,7 sec (±20,8) for AR. R was fairly poor between methods and groups. 3DPs resulted to have superior overall C (65%). Conclusions: AR resulted to have the same Overall DA as CT, independent from experience, 3DP has minor DA and R, but it resulted to be the most confident and fast method. Intra and interobserver R between methods remain very poor in residents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a6c9e67111335be605ed1c87f131ed3b16908caeef8e0643ad84ffe79881afc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
