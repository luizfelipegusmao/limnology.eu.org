{"title":"Tribological and Hygroscopic Behavior of Polybutylene Terephthalate/Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (PBT/ASA) Nanocomposites with Graphene-based Nanofiller","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1865/v1","date":1729706979000,"content":"Fogging in automotive headlamps is a significant issue that affects both aesthetics and functionality. This study investigates the use of graphene-based nanocomposites to mitigate fogging by enhancing the hygroscopic properties of Polybutylene Terephthalate/Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (PBT/ASA) composites commonly used in headlamps. The incorporation of functional-ized graphene improved the tensile and flexural strength of the nanocomposites, though it led to a reduction in elongation and melt flow. Additionally, the solid lubrication properties and increased surface hardness of the graphene contributed to enhanced wear resistance. The presence of gra-phene in the nanocomposites also reduced moisture diffusion, lowering the rates of both hygro-scopic and desorption when compared to commercial PBT/ASA composites. Furthermore, the nanocomposites exhibited a reduction in maximum moisture uptake. These improvements are expected to reduce the absolute humidity inside the headlamp, thereby effectively mitigating the fogging issue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"807c7e0df9b35b4831fe11ec00f8a6993510409b0409a34e45df90cdc1ea61ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
