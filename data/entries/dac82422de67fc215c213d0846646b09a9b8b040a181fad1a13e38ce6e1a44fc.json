A semi-analytical algorithm, using reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands, was calibrated for Landsat and Sentinel-2 bands and tested using in situ turbidity measurements. The best performance was found using only the near-infrared band with 12.84% median accuracy and -12.84% bias when comparing in situ radiometric measurements and field data. When satellite-derived turbidity was compared to in situ values, the median accuracy was 31.8% and the bias 13.22%. Monthly climatological turbidity maps revealed spatial heterogeneity in Lake Chascomús, with differences observed between the north-west and south-east regions, particularly in summer and winter. Turbidity showed marked seasonal dynamics, with a minimum in autumn and a maximum in spring. Annual climatological turbidity maps showed significant inter-annual variability. Generalized linear models showed turbidity was positively associated with wind speed and photosynthetic active radiation (26.2% of the variability explained). Remote sensing was found to be a fundamental complement to traditional field-based methods for monitoring water quality parameters and allowing a better description of their spatio-temporal variability.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"dac82422de67fc215c213d0846646b09a9b8b040a181fad1a13e38ce6e1a44fc","category":"Environment"}
