Females appear to reduce detection by males by burying themselves in the sediments (top), reducing their activity, and by remaining at a more constant depth (bottom right).</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>How often males and females need to mate to maximize their fitness is a source of sexual conflict in animals. Sexual conflict over mating frequency can lead to antagonistic coevolution in which males employ tactics to coerce females into mating, while females resist or evade mating attempts by males. Here, we report on a novel burying behavior observed in female northern map turtles (<i>Graptemys geographica</i>) in Opinicon Lake, Ontario, Canada that appears to function as a tactic to avoid male detection during the mating season. Underwater videos indicated that females are heavily solicited during the mating season with over half the females being actively pursued by males. Biologgers indicated that females are less active and remain deeper than males during the mating season. Our data strongly suggest that female northern map turtles avoid intense solicitation and potential harassment by males by burying themselves in lake sediments. This behavior appears to be a low-cost solution for females to reduce the costs of resistance and mating while they are constrained to habitats with high male densities for overwintering.</p>","author":"Grégory Bulté, \nJessica A.
