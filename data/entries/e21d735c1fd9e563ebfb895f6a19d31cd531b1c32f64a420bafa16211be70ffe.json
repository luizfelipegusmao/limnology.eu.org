{"title":"Graphic Memoir Creation for Reconstructing the Dementia Narrative While Reducing Depression and Anxiety Associated Burnout in Informal Dementia Home Caregiving","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0304/v1","date":1717591138000,"content":"Informal dementia home caregiving is viewed negatively and can result in caregiver depression and anxiety from burnout, potentially compromising caregiving. Solutions are unclear, as caregiving relationships are unique—caregiver creation of a graphic memoir may help to mitigate the negative dementia narrative and reduce experienced burnout. This investigation examines the writing of a graphic memoir by one informal dementia home caregiver, created with the help of a cartoon illustrator and a publisher who edited, printed, and made the graphic memoir available at the psychiatric bookstore considered the largest in North America. Mother of the illustrator and the editor and publisher of this graphic memoir, this author provides the perspective taken in this investigation. The analysis, developed by this author, represents psychoanalytic narrative research, serving as the historical method. Aided by email threads between the publisher/caregiver, publisher/printer, and publisher/bookseller, and a published interview with the dementia caregiver are answers to how writing, illustrating, and publishing the graphic memoir affected the caregiver’s narrative reconstruction and burnout. Providing an example for other informal dementia home caregivers similarly to write and illustrate a publishable graphic memoir for their positive narrative reconstruction and to help decrease their depression and anxiety from burnout is the aim.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e21d735c1fd9e563ebfb895f6a19d31cd531b1c32f64a420bafa16211be70ffe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
