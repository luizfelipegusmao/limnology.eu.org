{"title":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Respiratory Failure: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0185/v1","date":1714722267000,"content":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for respiratory failure in the intensive care unit continues to have an expanded role in select patients. While acute respiratory distress syndrome remains the most common indication, ECMO may be used in other causes of refractory hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. The most common configuration is veno-venous (V-V) ECMO, however in specific cases of refractory hypoxemia or right ventricular failure, some patients may benefit from veno-pulmonary (V-P) ECMO or veno-venoarterial (V-VA) ECMO. Patient selection and extracorporeal circuit management are essential to successful outcomes. This narrative review explores the physiology of ECMO, indications and contraindications, ventilator management, extracorporeal circuit management, troubleshooting hypoxemia, complications, and ECMO weaning in patients with respiratory failure. As the footprint of ECMO continues to expand it is essential that clinicians understand the underlying physiology and management of these complex patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb1a9281d14424fdad1f44af6cb89f0b9f02436c5f6ccb06ec6d88bc45547578","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
