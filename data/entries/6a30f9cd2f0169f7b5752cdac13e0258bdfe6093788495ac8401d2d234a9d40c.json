{"title":"An Interdisciplinary Double-Diamond Design Thinking Model for Urban Transport Product Innovation: A Design Framework for Innovation Combining Mixed Methods for Developing the Electric Microvehicle &ldquo;Leonardo Project&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0388/v1","date":1725527078000,"content":"The increase in greenhouse gas emissions fosters the transport sector towards new technological perspectives on personal mobility. Addressing sustainable mobility through electric micromobility requires interdisciplinary design research methods and approaches. In the context of the LEONARDO project, funded under the Horizon 2020 framework, the paper addresses a critical literature review on the design thinking, design research models, tools, and mixed methods to be undertaken for driving product mobility innovation in a cross-disciplinary context. Following the “research through design” research strategy, the authors applied the Double-Diamond design thinking model to frame the design research process in 4 phases, aligning with 3 general objectives, 12 specific research objectives, and 24 tasks, supported by a total of 71 mixed methods and tools. As a result, the transdisciplinary process provides a co-designed energy-efficient stand-alone microvehicle and a scalable interdisciplinary design model for urban transport product innovation. In conclusion, this case study suggests the value of the Double-Diamond design thinking model as a design research instrument capable of addressing sustainable mobility and guiding interdisciplinary design research, design practice, and education in the Industrial Engineering and Design disciplinary sectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a30f9cd2f0169f7b5752cdac13e0258bdfe6093788495ac8401d2d234a9d40c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
