This finding holds great significance in fisheries economics and has garnered substantial attention over the years. In this study, a full-blown age-structured predator–prey model is developed and used to demonstrate that multispecies considerations may shift the optimal selection of predators towards smaller individuals, providing valuable counteractive insights. These new results offer a fresh perspective highly relevant to regulation and choice of selectivity patterns.</p>","author":"Rasmus Noss Bang, \nStein Ivar Steinshamn","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resource Modeling: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3719477483f67b16afdbb60e07461dbbb5827188dd5d72806069fb36caa95c59","entryHash":"25ebc47e02a05b52002514787af71fe6275aac064d750413378c7a2029d63ed2","category":"Environment"}
