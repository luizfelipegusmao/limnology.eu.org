{"title":"The MdHSC70–MdWRKY75 module mediates basal apple thermotolerance by regulating the expression of heat shock factor genes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3631/7691844?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Heat stress severely restricts the growth and fruit development of apple (<span>Malus domestica</span>). Little is known about the involvement of WRKY proteins in the heat tolerance mechanism in apple. In this study, we found that the apple transcription factor (TF) MdWRKY75 responds to heat and positively regulates basal thermotolerance. Apple plants that overexpressed <span>MdWRKY75</span> were more tolerant to heat stress while silencing <span>MdWRKY75</span> caused the opposite phenotype. RNA-seq and reverse transcription quantitative PCR showed that heat shock factor genes (<span>MdHsfs</span>) could be the potential targets of MdWRKY75. Electrophoretic mobility shift, yeast one-hybrid, β-glucuronidase, and dual-luciferase assays showed that MdWRKY75 can bind to the promoters of <span>MdHsf4</span>, <span>MdHsfB2a</span>, and <span>MdHsfA1d</span> and activate their expression. Apple plants that overexpressed <span>MdHsf4</span>, <span>MdHsfB2a</span>, and <span>MdHsfA1d</span> exhibited heat tolerance and rescued the heat-sensitive phenotype of <span>MdWRKY75-</span>Ri3. In addition, apple heat shock cognate 70 (MdHSC70) interacts with MdWRKY75, as shown by yeast two-hybrid, split luciferase, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and pull-down assays. MdHSC70 acts as a negative regulator of the heat stress response. Apple plants that overexpressed <span>MdHSC70</span> were sensitive to heat, while virus-induced gene silencing of <span>MdHSC70</span> enhanced heat tolerance. Additional research showed that MdHSC70 exhibits heat sensitivity by interacting with MdWRKY75 and inhibiting <span>MdHsfs</span> expression. In summary, we proposed a mechanism for the response of apple to heat that is mediated by the “MdHSC70/MdWRKY75-<span>MdHsfs</span>” molecular module, which enhances our understanding of apple thermotolerance regulated by WRKY TFs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"eb82a1e3cebffca991fee8b160171007706480903bb7b1ef55b712561f82dade","category":"Environment"}
