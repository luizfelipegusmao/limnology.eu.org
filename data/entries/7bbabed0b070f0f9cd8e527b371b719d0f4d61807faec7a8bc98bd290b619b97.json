{"title":"Augmented Therapeutic Potential of Anti-Oxidative Herbal Formula, SR033 in Integration with Chemo-Drugs: In-Vitro and In-Vivo Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1777/v1","date":1711630062000,"content":"Cancer being a multi-factorial disease, a multi-target approach is needed to treat it with minimal side-effects. Therefore, combined use of a proven herbal formula with chemo-therapy could be the better therapeutic. It may maintain homeostasis by synergistically targeting multiple signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis, thus circumventing recurrence, resistance, and immunosuppression. Here we aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of an FDA-approved herbal formula, SR033 in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and paclitaxel (PTX). We report chemo-sensitization and chemo-synergy in HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, immunomodulation of COX-2, PD-L1, VEGF and TGFβ and overall survival in-vitro and in-vivo via oral and topical delivery of SR033. In-vitro, SR033/5FU significantly reverses 5FU and PTX-resistance, lower COX-2, and PD-L1, resulting in TGFβ/ VEGF axis modulation. Furthermore, the study suggests that due to anti-oxidative potential of SR033, oral administration exerts chemo-preventive activity and restores cellular compartment in solid tumor and ascites-bearing mice models. Furthermore, the topical application, SR033L with low-dose 5FU increases survival rate, reduces tumor growth, and completely restores local and peripheral neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in solid tumor mice model. The study indicates that SR033 could be a strong candidate in combination with low-dose 5FU and PTX for a holistic approach to cancer management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bbabed0b070f0f9cd8e527b371b719d0f4d61807faec7a8bc98bd290b619b97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
