Up until about 1900, the automotive land speed record 1 was held by an electrical vehicle. Unfortunately, internal combustion engine vehicles did not do 2 well in the market due to their high cost, limited speed, and short range in the 20th century, which 3 resulted in a global fall in their use as private motor vehicles. Since there are no fuel emissions into 4 the environment, there are important uses for electrical vehicles, Electric cars, or EVs, have a closed 5 circuit, cheap operating costs, no maintenance requirements, and excellent performance. The goal 6 of this project is to assess the current state of electric vehicles and the issues surrounding the global 7 advancement of electric vehicle technology. Because of the changing climate.8","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a95c3de438116a8162540e6101fc24cbf021a56fc5ca40e4ac63c0b0db807e19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
