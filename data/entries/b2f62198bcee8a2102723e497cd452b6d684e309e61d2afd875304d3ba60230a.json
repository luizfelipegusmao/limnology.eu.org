{"title":"A Secure Learned Image Codec for Authenticity Verification via Self-Destructive Compression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1655/v1","date":1729558135000,"content":"In the era of deepfakes and AI-generated content, digital image manipulation poses significant challenges to image authenticity, creating doubts about the credibility of image. Traditional image forensic techniques often struggle to detect sophisticated tampering, and passive detection approaches are reactive, verifying authenticity only after counterfeiting occurs. In this paper, we propose a novel full resolution Secure Learned Image Codec (SLIC) designed to proactively prevent image manipulation by creating self-destructive artifacts upon re-compression. Once a sensitive image is encoded using SLIC, any subsequent re-compression or editing attempts will result in visually severe distortions, making the imageâ€™s tampering immediately evident. Because the content of a SLIC image is either original or visually damaged after tampering, images encoded with this secure codec hold greater credibility. SLIC leverages adversarial training to fine-tune a learned image codec that introduces out-of-distribution perturbations, ensuring that the first compressed image retains high quality while subsequent re-compressions degrade drastically. We analyze and compare the adversarial effects of various perceptual quality metrics combined with different learned codec. Our experiments demonstrate that SLIC holds significant promise as a proactive defense strategy against image manipulation, offering a new approach to enhancing image credibility and authenticity in a media landscape increasingly dominated by AI-driven forgeries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2f62198bcee8a2102723e497cd452b6d684e309e61d2afd875304d3ba60230a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
