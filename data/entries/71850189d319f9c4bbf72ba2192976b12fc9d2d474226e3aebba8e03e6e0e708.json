{"title":"Efficacy of a Comprehensive and Personalized Approach for Frail Older People in Valencia (Spain): A Pre-Post Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0763/v1","date":1720577868000,"content":"Frailty is a common condition in older adults that negatively impacts health and quality of life. This study evaluated a comprehensive, personalized, and coordinated intervention under the Value-Based Care approach to address frailty's multidimensional nature in older people. It em-ployed a pre-post randomized controlled design, involving frail individuals over 65 years in Valencia, Spain. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 12 months (immediately post-intervention), and 18 months. The intervention included a personalized care plan supported by technology, with monthly motivational follow-ups and plan updates by health professionals and participants. Outcomes were measured using an assessment questionnaire that included the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement dataset for the older population: physical health, physical functioning, general mental health, satisfaction with social activities and relationships, ability to carry out usual social roles and activities, pain, general quality of life, loneliness, physical frailty, psychological frailty and social frailty. The study found signifi-cant improvements in physical frailty, quality of life, reduced health resource use and hospitali-zations, and lower levels of pain and depression/anxiety compared to baseline. The findings suggest further research into value-based care approaches, emphasizing the development and activation of personalized, comprehensive programs for older individuals with frailty.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71850189d319f9c4bbf72ba2192976b12fc9d2d474226e3aebba8e03e6e0e708","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
