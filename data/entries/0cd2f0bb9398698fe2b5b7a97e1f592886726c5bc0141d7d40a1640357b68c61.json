{"title":"Degree of Hydration, Microstructure, and Mechanical Properties of Cement-Modified TiO2 Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1328/v1","date":1724058673000,"content":"Cementitious materials exhibit excellent binding properties and micropore structures that support the stabilization of TiO2 nanoparticles within the matrix. Therefore, these materials are ideal for the development of functional construction products with TiO2 nanoparticles. This study investigated the degree of hydration, microstructure, and mechanical properties of cement-containing TiO2 nanoparticles. The experimental results demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles accelerated the hydration rate of cement, reducing the setting times. Moreover, TiO2 nanoparticles changed matrix microstructure, decreasing the porosity and improving early-age strength. Although TiO2 nanoparticles function as nucleation sites in the cement hydration reaction, the tendency of the particles to clump implies that proper dispersion should be ensured when mixing in large quantities. When developing new building materials incorporating TiO2 nanoparticles, considering the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the hydration reaction of cementitious materials is crucial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cd2f0bb9398698fe2b5b7a97e1f592886726c5bc0141d7d40a1640357b68c61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
