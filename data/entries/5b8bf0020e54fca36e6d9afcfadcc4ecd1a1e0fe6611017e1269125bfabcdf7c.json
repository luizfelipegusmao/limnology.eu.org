Trimmer</p>\r\n\r\nParkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting nearly 10 million people worldwide. Ferroptosis, a recently identified form of regulated cell death characterized by 15-lipoxygenase-mediated hydroperoxidation of membrane lipids, has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Pharmacological inhibition of 15 -lipoxygenase to prevent iron- and lipid peroxidation-associated ferroptotic cell death is a rational strategy for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We report here the characterization of PTC-041 as an anti-ferroptotic reductive lipoxygenase inhibitor developed for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In these studies, PTC-041 potently protects primary human Parkinson’s disease patient-derived fibroblasts from lipid peroxidation and subsequent ferroptotic cell death and prevents ferroptosis-related neuronal loss and astrogliosis in primary rat neuronal cultures. Additionally, PTC-041 prevents ferroptotic-mediated α-synuclein protein aggregation and nitrosylation in vitro, suggesting a potential role for anti-ferroptotic lipoxygenase inhibitors in mitigating pathogenic aspects of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease. We further found that PTC-041 protects against synucleinopathy in vivo, demonstrating that PTC-041 treatment of Line 61 transgenic mice protects against α-synuclein aggregation and phosphorylation as well as prevents associated neuronal and non-neuronal cell death. Finally, we show that. PTC-041 protects against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced motor deficits in a hemiparkinsonian rat model, further validating the potential therapeutic benefits of lipoxygenase inhibitors in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.","author":"Angela Minnella","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5b8bf0020e54fca36e6d9afcfadcc4ecd1a1e0fe6611017e1269125bfabcdf7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
