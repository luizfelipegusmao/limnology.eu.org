Compositional quantification is limited by count statistics of x-ray photons within the allotted measurement time and by the standardless Cliff-Lorimer method. Quantitative metrology here means compositional mapping, at nanometre scale lateral spatial resolution, of microelectronic devices in Ultra Large-Scale Integration (ULSI) technology by an electron probe under non-channelling conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fd674156536c9e22fde6a26677efd3b036276c9eec1a2911032301fd8c3ee697","category":"Environment"}
