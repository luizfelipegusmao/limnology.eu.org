{"title":"A Region Monitoring Type Slitless Imaging Spectrometer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1739/v1","date":1714284058000,"content":"In the contemporary world of science, continuous observation of specific fixed regions is required, awaiting the emergence of targets or phenomena within those areas to locate and identify them. Astronomy requires continuous monitoring of stars, swiftly pinpointing occurrences, such as flares, and acquiring their spectral data to aid identification. In military contexts, continuous observation of specific areas is essential for promptly locating enemy movements and obtaining target spectral data for deciphering enemy disguises. Additionally, continuous observation of experimental samples in biochemistry is mandatory to pinpoint localized changes and acquire spectral data from those areas. Hence, this paper develops a novel imaging spectrometer solution to monitor localized regions continuously. Specifically, this paper first elaborates on the developed instrument’s characteristics and optical structure, followed by optical design software simulations. The instrument has an F-number of 5, a focal length of 100mm, and a field of view covering the wavelength range from 400nm to 600nm. The optical path diagram indicates that the system’s dispersion and imaging images can be separated, meeting the system’s requirements. Besides, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) graph confirms that the image quality meets the requirements. Furthermore, a region-monitoring type imaging spectrometer was constructed to assess the instrument’s capability for spectral observation of fixed regions. The instrument can detect a fixed area, with the target placed within the detection area. Spectral data were successfully obtained by conducting image processing on the acquired images. The correlation coefficient between this data and reference data was as high as 0.9226, indicating the instrument’s successful measurement of the target’s spectrum. Thus, the developed instrument demonstrated that it can image the observed areas and acquire spectral data from targets within those regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"381b78dcc3606c805b049b13ff990f3da3113cc1111aa0ca5d902453f5efb614","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
