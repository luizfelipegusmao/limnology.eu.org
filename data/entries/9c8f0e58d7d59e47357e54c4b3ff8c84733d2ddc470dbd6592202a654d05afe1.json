{"title":"Chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and H2O2 contents of Chinese tallow tree are dependent on population origin, nutrients and salinity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae024/7661112?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants from invasive populations often have higher growth rates than conspecifics from native populations due to better environmental adaptability. However, the roles of improved chlorophyll fluorescence or antioxidant defenses in helping them to grow better under adverse situations are insufficient, even though this is a key physiological question for elucidating mechanisms of plant invasion. Here, we conducted experiments with eight native (China) and eight introduced (USA) populations of Chinese tallow tree (<span>Triadica sebifera</span>). We tested how salinity, nutrients (overall amount or N:P in two separate experiments) and their interaction affected <span>T. sebifera</span> aboveground biomass, leaf area, chlorophyll fluorescence and antioxidant defenses. Plants from introduced populations were larger than those from native populations, but salinity and nutrient shortage (low nutrients or high N:P) reduced this advantage, possibly reflecting differences in chlorophyll fluorescence based on their higher PSII maximum photochemical efficiency (<span>F</span><sub>v</sub>/<span>F</span><sub>m</sub>) and PSI maximum photo-oxidizable P700 in higher nutrient conditions. Native population plants had lower <span>F</span><sub>v</sub>/<span>F</span><sub>m</sub> with saline. Except in high nutrients/N:P with salinity, introduced population plants had lower electron transfer rate and photochemical quantum yield. There were no differences in antioxidant defenses between introduced and native populations except accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which was lower for introduced populations. Low nutrients and higher N:P or salinity increased total antioxidant capacity and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Our results indicate that nutrients and salinity induce differences in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics between introduced and native populations of an invasive plant, illuminating adaptive mechanisms using photosynthetic physiological descriptors in order to predict invasions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"9c8f0e58d7d59e47357e54c4b3ff8c84733d2ddc470dbd6592202a654d05afe1","category":"Environment"}
