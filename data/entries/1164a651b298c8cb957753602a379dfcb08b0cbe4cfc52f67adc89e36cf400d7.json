{"title":"Investigating and Improving Pedestrian Safety in an Urban Environment of a LMIC: A Case Study of Yaound&eacute;, Cameroon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0764/v1","date":1710319628000,"content":"In Yaound√©, Cameroon, where walking is a leading transport mode, pedestrian safety remains an issue as they account for a fair share of road traffic casualties, partly due to the lack of walking policies and data on pedestrian facilities safety, hindering targeted intervention. This study investigated road segments using the Pedestrian Safety Index (PSI) and the Global Walkability Index (GWI) across 12 key roads frequented by diverse pedestrian groups, especially students. The indexes were graded from E to A and analyzed using description and rank correlation analysis. Only one segment (R7) achieved a grade C, while the remainder scored D or E, indicating poor pedestrian safety conditions and unpleasant walking experience. The strong correlation coefficient (0.69) between the PSI and GWI at a 99% significance level validated the safety assessment, providing confidence in the safety results. Leveraging these findings, a seven-year (2024-2030) safety strategy was developed aiming to upgrade all roads to grade B. This strategy contains interventions including engineering improvement, proven effective. The study offers evidence for city officials to improve pedestrian safety and informs walking policies development and upcoming projects implementation. Future research should include more road segments and validate indexes with crash or conflict data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1164a651b298c8cb957753602a379dfcb08b0cbe4cfc52f67adc89e36cf400d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
