{"title":"Response of the meso- and macro-zooplankton community to long-term environmental changes in the southern North Sea","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/3/526/7238660?rss=1","date":1691452800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The North Sea (NS) is changing rapidly. Temporal variations in fishing intensity and eutrophic conditions, along with the ongoing impact of climate change, act in synergy resulting in modifications in marine communities. Although zooplankton has been extensively investigated, studies often ignore the large-sized meso- and macro-zooplankton (&gt;500 µm), including holoplankton and meroplankton taxa. Here, we examined changes in abundances and community structure of these organisms between 1975 and 2018, using univariate and multivariate analysis, at different taxonomic levels. Abrupt changes in the abundances of (sub)communities occurred during different time periods and resulted in a significant restructuration of the entire community in 2006. These changes were consistent with the regime shifts reported in the NS and were a consequence of the environmental pressures on the whole community or on specific subcommunities. In the long term, the community shifted from higher abundances of hydrozoans and holoplankton taxa to an increasing abundance of decapods. Furthermore, we reveal the environmental variables that most explain the variability in the community dynamics, highlighting the importance of temperature and top-down processes. Our study underlines the relevance of investigations at different taxonomic levels, which elucidates how distinct responses to environmental changes ultimately shape the entire community structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"f4867bfbbe1b0476b8051f1a1cb9ee9a23783b50f0a2a1180223fab87c58bfd4","category":"Environment"}
