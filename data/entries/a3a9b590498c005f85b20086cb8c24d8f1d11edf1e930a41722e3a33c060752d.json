{"title":"Consideration of water policies in the urban development plans of Delhi: A collaborative planning perspective","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.94?af=R","date":1727108157000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This paper discusses collaborative planning principles as a means to improve water supply systems in the case of Delhi, India, through primary and secondary data analysis. The theory of collaborative planning is a well-established concept applied to obtain effective policies in planning through the collaboration of actors in a shared space. We use this framework to discuss strengths, weaknesses, and scope for collaboration in the current urban development plan formulation process of the city. Some of the principles of collaborative planning we use include communication, collective decision-making processes, and network power in a shared institutional environment. Our findings indicate a lack of consideration of water policies in the urban development plans. This underlines a major gap in the current process of plan formulation and provides evidence that the absence of collaboration between institutions in both sectors contributes to poor water supply for the population in Delhi. At the same time, it emphasizes the importance of collaborative practices between urban development and water institutions for better planning of water service provision in Indian cities.</p>","author":"Maheshwari Gupta, \nRabidyuti Biswas, \nAshok Kumar, \nCecilia Tortajada","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"a3a9b590498c005f85b20086cb8c24d8f1d11edf1e930a41722e3a33c060752d","category":"Environment"}
