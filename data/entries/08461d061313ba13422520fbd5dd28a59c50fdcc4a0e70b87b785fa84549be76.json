{"title":"Research on Elderly Intelligent Rehabilitation Products Based on Multimodal Sensory Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2023/v1","date":1721960619000,"content":"(1) Background: With the global population aging, the demand for effective rehabilitation products for the elderly is increasing. Traditional products often fail to meet the comprehensive needs of elderly users, who require solutions addressing physical, psychological, and social aspects; (2) Methods: Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, Quality Function Deployment, Axiomatic Design, and the System Usability Scale to identify and prioritize user needs, market research and user interviews were conducted to understand the preferences of the elderly and obtain design specifications. The focus was on multimodal sensory feedback, which was validated through the study; (3) Results: Elderly users have a strong preference for rehabilitation products that are durable, easy to use and have comprehensive sensory feedback. Intelligent rehabilitation bed as the carrier, strengthened structure, high strength material, ergonomic adjustment, integrated health monitoring system. Using digital technology for real-time health monitoring and personalized feedback to provide a comprehensive recovery experience, high user satisfaction was reported in the evaluation; (4) Conclusion: It is important to emphasize user-centered design and integrate multi-modal sensory feedback to meet the comprehensive rehabilitation needs of elderly users. Future studies should expand user samples and expert opinions to refine and validate the design and improve its effectiveness and usability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08461d061313ba13422520fbd5dd28a59c50fdcc4a0e70b87b785fa84549be76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
