{"title":"How strong is strong? The challenge of interpreting network edge weights","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311614","date":1727964000000,"content":"<p>by Zachary P.

Specifically, the meaning of a given edge’s weight is locally contingent, so that a given weight may be strong for one dyad, but weak for other dyad, even in the same network. I use backbone models to distinguish strong and weak edges in a corpus of 110 weighted networks, and used the results to examine the magnitude of this ambiguity. Although strong edges have larger weights than weak edges on average, a large fraction of edges’ weights provide ambiguous information about whether it is strong or weak. Based on these results, I recommend that strong edges should be identified by applying an appropriate backbone model, and that once strong edges have been identified using a backbone model, their original weights should not be directly interpreted or used in subsequent analysis.","author":"Zachary P.
