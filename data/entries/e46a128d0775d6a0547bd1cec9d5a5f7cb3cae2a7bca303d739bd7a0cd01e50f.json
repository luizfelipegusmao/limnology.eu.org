{"title":"Quantitative Monitoring of Cyclic Glycine-Proline in Marine Mangrove-Derived Fungal Metabolites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1850/v1","date":1729706149000,"content":"This study developed and validated a robust UPLC-MS/MS method for quantifying cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) in mangrove -derived Penicillium and Aspergillus strains. The method demonstrated excellent linearity, precision, and recovery, with detection limits as low as 4.8 ng/mL. When applied to fungal extracts, Penicillium pedernalense achieved 67.45  1.11 ng/mL (yielding 29.31  0.61 mg/L), surpassing Penicillium steckii at 31.71  0.31 ng/mL (yielding 8.51  0.15 mg/L). This quantitative approach for metabolite analysis provides a viable method for screening these fungal strains, highlighting their potential for sustainable production of cyclic glycine-proline (cGP).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e46a128d0775d6a0547bd1cec9d5a5f7cb3cae2a7bca303d739bd7a0cd01e50f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
