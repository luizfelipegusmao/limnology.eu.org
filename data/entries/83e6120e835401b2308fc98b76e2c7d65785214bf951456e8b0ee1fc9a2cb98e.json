Also, we typically have means to address cold temperatures, such as warm clothing and heating systems, reducing its impact on our daily life. However, for plants, coping with both extremes represents a challenge. They must adapt their physiology to withstand fluctuations in temperature, requiring them to employ intricate mechanisms to cope with their environmental conditions. Although plants can tolerate a certain range of temperatures, significant fluctuations, such as freezing, can have a profound impact on crop yield (<a href=\"#koae116-B4\">Thakur et al. 2010</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"83e6120e835401b2308fc98b76e2c7d65785214bf951456e8b0ee1fc9a2cb98e","category":"Environment"}
