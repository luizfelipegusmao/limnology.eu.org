{"title":"Detailed Profiling of the Tumor Microenvironment in Ethnic Breast Cancer, Using Tissue Microarrays and Multiplex Immunofluorescence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0099/v1","date":1717423633000,"content":"Breast cancer poses a global health challenge, yet the influence of ethnicity on the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains understudied. In this investigation, we examined immune cell infiltration in 230 breast cancer samples, emphasizing diverse ethnic populations. Leveraging tissue microarrays (TMAs) and core samples, we applied multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to dissect immune cell subtypes across TME regions. Our analysis revealed distinct immune cell distribution patterns, particularly enriched in aggressive molecular subtypes triple-negative and HER2-positive tumors. We observed significant correlations between immune cell abundance and key clinicopathological parameters, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and patient overall survival. Notably, immune cell location within different TME regions showed varying correlations with clinicopathologic parameters. Additionally, ethnicities exhibited diverse distributions of cells, with certain ethnicities showing higher abundance compared to others. In TMA samples, patients of Chinese and Caribbean origin displayed significantly lower numbers of B cells, TAMs, and FOXP3-positive cells. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between immune cells and breast cancer progression, with implications for personalized treatment strategies. Moving forward, integrating advanced imaging techniques, and exploring immune cell heterogeneity in diverse ethnic cohorts can uncover novel immune signatures and guide tailored immunotherapeutic interventions, ultimately improving breast cancer management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a83e55c46d18306b6e252a07b23d4721d79914e4d084d575eae51cd0e4379fa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
