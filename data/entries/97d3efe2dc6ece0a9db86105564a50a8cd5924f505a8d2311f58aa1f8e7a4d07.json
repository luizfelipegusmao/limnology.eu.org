{"title":"Soil seed bank dynamics of two invasive alien plants in Nigeria: implications for ecosystem restoration","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae003/7584765?rss=1","date":1705708800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The assessment of seed banks could provide useful hints towards ensuring restoration planning and invasive species management. In this study, the impacts of two invaders such as <span>Hyptis suaveolens</span> and <span>Urena lobata</span> on the soil seed banks were investigated. We also assessed the seed characteristics of the invaders at the invaded sites. This was achieved using 10 sites each for <span>H. suaveolens-</span> and <span>U. lobata-</span>invaded habitats and -non-invaded habitats making a total of 30 sites. We collected 200 soil samples from each habitat type. A seedling emergence method was used to determine the seed bank recruitment of both invasive plants. The diversity indices of the above-ground vegetation of sites invaded by the two plants were significantly lower than those of the non-invaded sites. Only two plant species emerged from the seed banks of <span>H. suaveolens</span> and five plants from those of <span>U. lobata</span> when compared with non-invaded sites where 53 species emerged. A larger portion of the seeds was located in the soilâ€™s lower layer at all the sites invaded by <span>H. suaveolens</span> while those of <span>U. lobata</span> and non-invaded sites were found in the upper layers and there are significant associations between the habitats. The lower soil layers of the two species have the highest percentage of viable seeds. These results help us to understand more about the invasiveness of both species as related to their impacts on the seed banks and native vegetation. It also indicates that the native species that emerged from the invaded seed banks could be used for the restoration of the invaded habitats.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"97d3efe2dc6ece0a9db86105564a50a8cd5924f505a8d2311f58aa1f8e7a4d07","category":"Environment"}
