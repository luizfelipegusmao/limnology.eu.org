{"title":"Sustainable Supply Chain Management In The Korean Electronics Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0624/v1","date":1710153171000,"content":"Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) represents a critical strategy for the electronics industry to balance economic objectives with environmental and social responsibility across complex global production networks. This multiple case study analysis investigates SSCM integration within leading Korean electronics manufacturers Samsung, LG, and Hyundai. In-depth qualitative data, focus groups, and sustainability report analysis reveals the policies, practices, results and implementation barriers related to incorporating sustainability criteria across procurement, manufacturing, distribution and recycling functions. Findings show sustainability considerations increasingly driven by cost, risk, reputational and regulatory factors, with vertical coordination initiatives helping transfer knowledge to assist suppliers on compliance and emissions reductions. Yet substantial obstacles persist around monitoring, coordination, transparency and technical capabilities, especially amongst lower tiers. The paper discusses how common reporting standards, ethical sourcing certification and partnerships can accelerate electronics supply chain sustainability. By mapping integration achievements and gaps, this study informs managerial best practices and policy reforms toward promoting socially and ecologically responsible models for Korea's vital export industry as it navigates rising stakeholder pressures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46a26b75723f550a2e72070a54386596f9b151471bfcf729e5a11690ef42de4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
