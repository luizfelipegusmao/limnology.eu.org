{"title":"Trend in Infective Endocarditis in Bulgaria &ndash; Characteristics and Outcome, 17- Years, Single Center Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0421/v1","date":1720092877000,"content":"Background: Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, with a persistently high mortality rate. There is a lack of recent data on IE in Bulgaria over the last decades.\nMethods: The study is retrospective, single centered, includes 270 patients diagnosed with IE, for the period 2005 - 2021. We compared the two periods 2005-2015 (n=119) and 2016-2021 (n=151) to find the characteristics changes.  \nResults: The median age was 65 (23) years and 65.5% (177) were male. In the second period, there is a significant increase in age from 62 (29) to 67 (22), (p=0.023); Charlson comorbidities index (CCI) from 3 (3) to 4 (4), (p=0.000); cases with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) from 12.6% (15) to 36.9% (55), (p=0.001); coronary arterial diseases (CAD) from16.85%  (20) to 29.1% (44), (p=0.018); atrial fibrillation (AF)  from 10.9% (13) to 23.8% (36), (p=0.006). Injection fraction decreased significantly in the second period from  63 (14) to 59 (15), (p=0.000). Almost half of the patients 45.6% (123) had no known predisposing cardiac condition and 46.3 (125) had an unknown port of entry. IE was community-acquired in 173 (64.1%), healthcare-associated in 26.7% (72), and injection drug use related IE in 9.3% (25).The study population included 67.8% (183) native valve IE, 31.5% (85) prosthetic IE, and 0.74% (2) intracardiac device­related IE. The hemoculture were positive in 59.6%, and the most frequent pathogenic agent was Staphylococcus - 33.3 % ( aureus – 16.5 % and coagulase negative - 16.8 %). Only 20% of patients underwent early surgery. The all­cause 30 days mortality rate was 24.8%. There is no significant difference between the two periods in terms of the characteristics listed above. \nConclusion: The profile of IE in Bulgaria has changed with increasing age and comorbidity, changing predisposing cardiac conditions and entry door. The most common pathogen was the Staphylococcus group. The 30 day mortality rate remains high.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5efb9237d96c3084fd34cfa8a75c4ff89c21f3a2f4de0b815252425b33dd2b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
