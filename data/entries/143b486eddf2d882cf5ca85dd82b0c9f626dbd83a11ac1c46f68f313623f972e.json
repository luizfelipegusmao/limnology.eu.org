{"title":"River Habitat Survey (RHS) method in the assessment of synecological characteristics of macroinvertebrates: Aquatic Heteroptera of the River Krąpiel valley","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1091/v1","date":1713333091000,"content":"The River Habitat Survey (RHS) is a method for assessing the conditions of a river channel and valley, taking into account hydromorphological factors, and assessing the degree of naturalness or the degree of anthropogenic alteration within the channel and valley based on physical and landscape data. The hypothesis tested in this study was that the quality of river habitats demonstrated using the RHS should translate into the composition of their fauna. We investigated aquatic bugs (Heteroptera Aquatica), which are a group with considerable dispersal abilities and, at the same time, composed of stenotopic species associated with a particular environment as well as of eurytopic elements inhabiting a wide range of environments (REF). The research was carried out in a small lowland river, the River Krąpiel (north-western Poland) at 6 sites with 43 sub-sites included. Our analyses suggest the RHS method can predict the composition and quality of the aquatic bug fauna inhabiting a given river. Indicators of river habitat quality (HQA and RHQ) will be associated with different habitat types depending on the geographic location and type of river, once indicating habitats associated with the mainstream river and mineral substrate (mountain and small lowland rivers) and at other times habitats covered by vegetation with relatively slow water flow (large and medium lowland rivers). Therefore, RHS may be a good method for estimating the water bug fauna, linking it to the size and character of the river.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"143b486eddf2d882cf5ca85dd82b0c9f626dbd83a11ac1c46f68f313623f972e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
