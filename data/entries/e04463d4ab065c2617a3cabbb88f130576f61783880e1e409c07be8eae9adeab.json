{"title":"On the Non-homogeneity of Markovian Manpower Model with Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1690/v1","date":1721634291000,"content":"The effect of the heterogeneity in sex factor is considered in the Markovian manpower modeling model. The estimation of the transition probability matrix of the staff flow was done using the maximum likelihood method. The expected future durations of the individuals in the manpower system were obtained under the aggregated and disaggregated (male and female) staff flow as well as their variances. Test for the heterogeneity of the staff based on sex factor was performed and the result of the heterogeneity test shows that there is difference between the disaggregated staff flows. The computed entrant probabilities also indicate that the male group has higher probabilities of attaining higher grades than the female group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e04463d4ab065c2617a3cabbb88f130576f61783880e1e409c07be8eae9adeab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
