State-of-the-art Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technologies are in high demand nowadays since they allow not only to perform nanoscale patterning, but also high-resolution ion imaging and analytical surface measurements with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) [<a href=\"#ozae044.237-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.237-B2\">2</a>]. SIMS is a powerful surface analysis technique where by impinging primary ions on the surface secondary ions are generated and separated by a mass analyzer to record chemical information. Advantages of SIMS are the high dynamic range and high sensitivity. Typical analysis modes in SIMS are mass spectrum recording, depth profiling, 2D imaging, 3D imaging (and also 4D imaging) [<a href=\"#ozae044.237-B3\">3</a>]. In the past, correlating FIB platforms for high-resolution ion microscopy with in-situ SIMS has allowed to acquire complementary information for a deeper topographic and chemical understanding of specimen in various fields, including materials sciences, biology and geology [<a href=\"#ozae044.237-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.237-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.237-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"58bdc6e49f2ef070d677141093a941c999d190f54cbb02398f8db3bbdcd3021a","category":"Environment"}
