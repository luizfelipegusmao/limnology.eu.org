{"title":"Imagination, Reality, and Reproduction: Comparing Perceptions of Coastal Sea Trout Anglers, Real Catches, and Sea Trout Spawning Activity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12745?af=R","date":1728479980000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Sustainable management of recreational fisheries requires balancing angler attitudes and behaviour with fisheries' biological potential. Herein, we investigated the balance in the sea-run brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) fishery around the Swedish island of Gotland using data collected through a creel survey, test fishing, and spawning returns to selected streams. Anglers accurately anticipated catches of large fish but underestimated the role of natural reproduction in supporting the stock. Female sea trout entering spawning streams and post-spawn sea trout caught on the coast were significantly larger than spawning males and non-spawned fish, and were particularly important for the fishery. Larger sea trout also faced a higher level of harvest pressure than other sizes. Small changes to angler preferences, harvest rates, or regulations could significantly influence characteristics and sustainability of this fishery. The scale and direction of these changes merit further investigation.</p>","author":"Samuel Blyth, \nStian Stensland, \nPatrik Rönnbäck","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"d353d8de245e18a144776c2e210fb21f75410a933d1de04f5d71d1c0f033dcea","category":"Environment"}
