{"title":"Contribution to the Statistical Mechanics of Static Triplet Correlations and Structures in Quantum Fluids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2079/v1","date":1727337404000,"content":"The current developments in the theory of quantum static triplet correlations and their associated structures (real r-space and Fourier k-space) in monatomic fluids are reviewed. The main framework utilized is Feynman’s path integral formalism (PI) and the issues addressed cover quantum diffraction effects and zero-spin bosonic exchange. The structures are associated with the external weak fields that reveal their nature, and due attention is paid to the underlying pair level structures. Without the pair level one cannot fully grasp the triplet extensions in the hierarchical ladder of structures, as both the pair and the triplet structures are essential ingredients in the triplet response functions. Three general classes of PI structures do arise: centroid, total continuous linear response, and instantaneous. Use of functional differentiation techniques is widely made and, as a bonus, this leads to identify an exact extension of the “classical isomorphism” when the centroid structures are considered. In this connection, the direct correlation functions, as borrowed from classical statistical mechanics, play a key role (either exact or approximate) in the corresponding quantum applications. Additionally, as an auxiliary framework, the traditional closure schemes for triplets are also discussed, owing to their potential usefulness for rationalizing PI triplet results. To illustrate some basic concepts, new numerical calculations (path integral Monte Carlo PIMC and closures) are reported. They are focused on the purely diffraction regime and deal with supercritical helium-3 and the quantum hard-sphere fluid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30a6a0db7460c37001cab2de366f067e2a1e18a9e0a8ef80d635d560d5c0ca0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
