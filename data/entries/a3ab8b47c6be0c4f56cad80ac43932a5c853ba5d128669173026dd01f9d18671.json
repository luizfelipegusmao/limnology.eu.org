{"title":"The Ramifications of Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\": From Eugenics to Modern Genomics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0367/v1","date":1725448547000,"content":"This article delves into the historical development and ramifications of divergent theories that have emerged since the publication of Darwin's seminal work, \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1856. It traces the evolution of thought from Darwin's revolutionary ideas through the controversial era of eugenics, the groundbreaking discovery of DNA, the elucidation of Mendelian genetics, and the subsequent development of modern genetic theories. The article also explores the critical role of mathematical models, statistics, and data science in advancing genomics research over the last decade. This comprehensive exploration highlights how these theories and methods have fundamentally shaped our understanding of biology, evolution, human genetics, and complex biological systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3ab8b47c6be0c4f56cad80ac43932a5c853ba5d128669173026dd01f9d18671","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
