{"title":"Topology Optimization of Quasi-periodic Cellular Structures Using a Hybrid MMC-Density Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0902/v1","date":1720679516000,"content":"Porous hierarchical structure has been widely used in engineering for its high specific strength and stiffness, improved corrosion-resistance and multifunctionality. The design of multi-scale topology optimization for such structures has been a hot topic during the past two decades. In this paper, a new hybrid MMC-density topology optimization method of cellular structures with quasi-periodic microstructures is proposed. The so-called ‘quasi-periodic’ means the microstructures in different macro points have similar topology but with different parameters. The key idea is to describe the microstructural topology using MMC and describe the micro layout using the variable density. Sensitivities of the structural compliance with respect to the two types of design variables are derived and gradient optimization method is applied to update the design variables. The presented numerical examples show that the quasi-periodic cellular structures have better performance than single-scale structures and periodic cellular structures. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47796e2a891655f295de8eaaf94f0d3c21b1253c89a023da729e921a9885370f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
