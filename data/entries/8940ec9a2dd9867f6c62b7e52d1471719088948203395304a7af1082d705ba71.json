{"title":"One Health Response for Rift Valley Fever Outbreak in Sudan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1358/v1","date":1724069631000,"content":"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease that infects both human and animals. This is a descriptive study summarizes investigation and response to RVF outbreak, using surveillance data. A RVF outbreak occurred in Berber locality in northern Sudan. We identified 246 cases of RVF including seven deaths among humans, 119 deaths and 82 abortions among Livestock. Our entomological surveillance confirmed the presence of Anopheles arabiensis, An. stephensi, Aedes aegypti, Ae. vexans, Culex pipiens, Cx. Quinquefasciatus, and Cx. theileri in the area during the outbreak. In a comparison with another outbreak of Rift Valley fever in nearby area while ago, a multisectoral One Health response strategy has resulted in strengthening the health system through re-innovating health facilities and centres and training about 200 healthcare and emergency responders. Additionally, it reduced cases and fatalities among humans by 78% and 63%, respectively, and loss in livestock due to deaths and/or abortions by 82%. The added-value of implementing One Health strategy was saving more lives and resources, while strengthening the health system. We recommend the systematic institutionalization of One Health strategy in the country as a core part of the national prevention and control strategy for zoonotic diseases epidemics and pandemics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8940ec9a2dd9867f6c62b7e52d1471719088948203395304a7af1082d705ba71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
