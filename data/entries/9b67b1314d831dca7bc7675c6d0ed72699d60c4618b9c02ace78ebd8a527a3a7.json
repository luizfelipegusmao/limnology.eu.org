{"title":"Self-Expansion Theory of Leadership: Leadership as Art of Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1647/v1","date":1729574091000,"content":"Interest in leadership skills and leadership development is burgeoning both in academic circles and business organizations. Leadership research has produced a large number of leadership models. The distinctions between leadership and management, skills required for leadership, and methods of leadership development are ongoing areas of study. An attempt is made to provide an overarching theory that showcases some crucial distinctions. The proposed theory holds that ‘managing’ is about improving a situation, and ‘leading’ is about improving a situation by stretching oneself either by exploiting unique personal characteristics or by exploring underdeveloped skills and/ or enabling others and organizations to do the same. Thus, leadership is an act of self-expansion, and everyone can lead, including followers. Leadership development requires a series of acts of leading and learning, leading to leadership positions in a Darwinian process. Thus, at the heart of leadership is experimentation, and hence, it can be rightly called the art of management. What leaders do successfully today becomes management science tomorrow. The ever-growing list of leadership skills and leadership theories with more prosocial views is evidence of leadership in theory and practice. We also propose holistic leadership as a new type of leadership.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b67b1314d831dca7bc7675c6d0ed72699d60c4618b9c02ace78ebd8a527a3a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
