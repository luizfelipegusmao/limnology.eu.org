{"title":"Impact of First- and Second-Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors on the Development of Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Individuals with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Retrospective Analysis on behalf of the Polish Adult Leukaemia Group","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1642/v1","date":1724337022000,"content":"Background: The implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has brought a significant improvement in the prognosis for CML patients and a decrease in the number of patients requiring allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Nevertheless, the impact of TKIs on allo-HCT outcomes have not been thoroughly explored. Objectives: The main endpoint of our research was to assess the impact of prior TKI treatment on acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD). Methods: In our retrospective analysis we included 240 patients treated between 1993 and 2013, and divided them into 3 groups according to the therapy administered prior to matched related or matched unrelated donor allo-HCT (imatinib group n=41, dasatinib/nilotinib group n=28, TKI na誰ve group n=171). Results: Both the cumulative incidence of aGvHD (p=0.044) and cGvHD (p&amp;lt;0.001) in individuals receiving second generation TKIs (2G-TKIs) prior to allo-HCT compared to patients receiving no TKIs or imatinib (IMA) (40.7% vs 61.4% vs 70.7%, p=0.044; 25.0% vs 76.4% vs 51.2%, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In case of the 2G-TKI cohort, the number of low-grade aGvHD and cGvHD was significantly lower compared to the IMA and TKI-na誰ve groups (p=0.018, p=0.004; p&amp;lt;0.001 versus TKI-na誰ve, respectively). In terms of 3-year overall survival (OS) there were no important variations between TKI-na誰ve, IMA and 2G-TKI (55% vs 49.9% vs 69.6%, p=0.740). Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that TKI treatment prior to allo-HCT may have protective impact on immune-mediated outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84556ddfdbf4a0ec8ff98fb0282d9907085e0970412ae827597d2698561df6e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
