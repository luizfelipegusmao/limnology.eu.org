{"title":"Bifunctional Effects of Lactoferrin (LFcinB11) in Inhibiting Neural Cell Adhesive Molecule (NCAM) Polysialylation and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NET) Release","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1534/v1","date":1711431062000,"content":"The expression of polysialic acid (polySia) on the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), is called NCAM-polysialylation, which is strongly related to the migration and invasion of tumor cells and with aggressive in the clinic. Thus, it’s important to select a proper drug to block tumor cell migration for clinic treatment. In this study, we proposed that lactoferrin (LFcinB11) may be a more ideal candidate for inhibition of NCAM polysialylation comparing with CMP and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), which were determined based on our NMR studies. On the other hand, because neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) is the most dramatic stage in cell death process, and NETs’ release are related to pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, with proposed involvement in glomerulonephritis, chronic lung disease, sepsis and vascular disorders. In this study, the molecular mechanism of inhibition of NETs’ release using LFcinB11 as inhibitor was also determined. Based on these results, LFcinB11 is proposed to be bifunctional inhibitor for inhibiting both NCAM polysialylation and NETs releases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8f1917f68df3802583ac6d6098d549d330c3196df41788e60b3fada3ccea461","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
