{"title":"Clinical Outcome of Patients with Escherichia coli Isolated from Catheter Lumens and/or Peripheral Blood Cultures: A Retrospective Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1549/v1","date":1713884234000,"content":"Background. Escherichia coli commonly causes catheter-related bloodstream infection (C-RBSI) in specific populations. The differential time to positivity (DTTP) technique is the recommended conservative procedure for diagnosing C-RBSIs. Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of episodes in which E. coli was isolated from catheter lumens obtained using the DTTP technique. We analysed microbiological and clinical data based on the DTTP technique as either catheter colonization, C-RBSI, or non-C-RBSI. Results. We included 89 catheter blood cultures classified as follows: catheter colonization, 33.7%; C-RSBI, 9.0%; and non-C-RBSI, 57,3%. Catheter withdrawal was 15.7% without positive catheter-tip cultures. We found no statistically significant differences in catheter type, antibiotic treatment, or clinical outcome among groups, except for the frequency of catheter lock therapy or in the frequency of successful treatment. Mortality was associated with C-RBSI in only 1 patient. Conclusion. E. coli bacteremia diagnosed by the DTTP technique was non-catheter related in most patients. As the majority of the catheters were retained, E. coli bacteremia could not be microbiologically confirmed or ruled out as catheter related by catheter-tip culture. Future studies are needed to assess the profitability of the DTTP technique for diagnosing E. coli C-RBSIs..","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd40fd5f2e5613404d4cb59b08a9d70f426f941645e89f3720790460b1bdfd13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
