Using a health beliefs model-informed framework, we analysed 8 semi-structured, gender-specific focus group discussions with 93 youth 15–24 years old (48% male, 52% female), drawn from the SEARCH trial in rural Kenya and Uganda in 2017–2018, coinciding with the widespread introduction of PrEP. Highly connected social networks and widespread uptake of antiretrovirals shaped youth HIV risk perception. Amid conflicting information about HIV prevention methods, youth felt exposed to multiple HIV risk factors like the high prevalence of HIV, belief that people with HIV(PWH) purposefully infect others, dislike of condoms, and doubts about PrEP efficacy. Young women also reported minimal sexual autonomy in the context of economic disadvantages, the ubiquity of intergenerational and transactional sex, and peer pressure from other women to have many boyfriends. Young men likewise reported vulnerability to intergenerational sex, but also adopted a sexual conquest mentality. Comprehensive sexuality education and economic empowerment, through credible and trusted sources, may moderate risk-taking. Messaging should leverage youth’s social networks to spread fact-based, gender- and age-appropriate information. PrEP should be offered alongside other reproductive health services to address both pregnancy concerns and reduce HIV risk.","author":"Lawrence Owino","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"0b8392725e3700de98f3f4dd541863eaa90e8f0a2e6fe703931a44a54ca5c06e","category":"Environment"}
