{"title":"399 Effect of feeding palm oil products on finishing cattle performance, carcass characteristics, and methane production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/349/7757048?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate feeding palm oil products on feedlot cattle performance and methane production. Steers (n = 320; 380 Â± 14.5 kg) were allocated to 40 pens in a randomized block design and assigned to 1 of 5 treatments consisting of different sources of supplemental fat: 1) No Oil; negative control containing 0.0% supplemental fat, 2) Corn Oil; positive control containing 4.0% supplemental corn oil, 3) Whole Palm; 4.0% supplemental whole palm oil, 4) Olein; 4.0% supplemental palm olein oil, or 5) Stearin; 4.0% supplemental palm stearin oil. Cattle consuming Corn Oil, Olein and Stearin all had greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04) final body weight (BW) and hot carcass weight (HCW) than cattle consuming no oil but were not different (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.11) from each other or from Whole Palm, which was intermediate. Dry matter intake (DMI) of cattle consuming No Oil, Whole Palm and Stearin oil was not different from each other; however, cattle fed Corn Oil had greater intake than Whole Palm (<span>P</span> = 0.03). Corn Oil, Olein, and Stearin all had greater average daily gain (ADG) than cattle consuming No Oil (<span>P</span> = 0.04) but were not different (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.12) from Whole Palm. Adding fat improved feed efficiency (gain to feed; G:F) as all diets including added fat had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) G:F than No Oil. Marbling scores were greater (<span>P</span> = 0.01) for Olein and Stearin than Corn and Whole Palm. There were no differences in backfat, ribeye area or liver abscess rate among any treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.74). Gas emissions were evaluated for only the No Oil and Whole Palm treatments. Total methane and methane produced per pound of dry matter intake was less for cattle consuming Whole Palm than No Oil by 14.8% (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.04) while cattle were in the methane chamber. Methane produced per kilogram of ADG for Whole Palm was also reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) by 21.4% compared with No Oil. The results of this study indicate feeding palm oil products as a source of supplemental fat in finishing diets increases final BW, ADG, and HCW compared with feeding no supplemental fat, but had minimal impact on DMI resulting in an improvement in G:F. Adding supplemental fat reduced methane emissions in cattle when feeding Whole Palm compared with No Oil. The value of palm oil products in feedlot finishing diets is comparable with feeding corn oil.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"36e0f352d8302b9362d52c37f808289d2c6e4e25df686f7990b22e454bf9ce00","category":"Environment"}
