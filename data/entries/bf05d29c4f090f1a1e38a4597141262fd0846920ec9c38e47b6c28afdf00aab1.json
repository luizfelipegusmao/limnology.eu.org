Arl2 regulates the asymmetric division of neural stem cells in <i>Drosophila</i> via microtubule growth. However, the function of mammalian Arl2 during cortical development was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Arl2 plays a new role in corticogenesis via regulating microtubule growth, but not mitochondria functions. Arl2 knockdown (KD) leads to impaired proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neuronal migration. Arl2 KD in mouse NPCs significantly diminishes centrosomal microtubule growth and delocalization of centrosomal proteins Cdk5rap2 and Î³-tubulin. Moreover, Arl2 physically associates with Cdk5rap2 by in silico prediction using AlphaFold multimer, which was validated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Remarkably, Cdk5rap2 overexpression significantly rescues the neurogenesis defects caused by Arl2 KD. Therefore, Arl2 plays an important role in mouse cortical development through microtubule growth via the centrosomal protein Cdk5rap2.","author":"Dongliang Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"bf05d29c4f090f1a1e38a4597141262fd0846920ec9c38e47b6c28afdf00aab1","category":"Environment"}
