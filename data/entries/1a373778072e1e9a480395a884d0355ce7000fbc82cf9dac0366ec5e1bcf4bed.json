{"title":"Comparison of the Performance of Machine Learning Models in Predicting ESI Triage Levels Using Data of Non‚ÄêTraumatic Patients from the Triage Point at the Emergency Medicine Department of Lampang Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0428/v1","date":1723032604000,"content":"Emergency departments (EDs) are critical in urgent care, where accurate triage optimizes patient flow and resource allocation. Manual triage faces challenges due to increasing volume and com-plexity. This study compares logistic regression, gradient boosting, neural network, and random forest models in predicting Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage levels for non-traumatic pa-tients at Lampang Hospital's ED. Using data from January 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, we ana-lyzed 45,245 complete records. The gradient boosting model achieved the highest accuracy (0.81), significantly outperforming logistic regression (accuracy 0.64). Pain scale, sex, and mean arterial pressure were key predictors. This is the first comparison of these models for ESI triage in a Thai hospital, highlighting their potential to improve triage accuracy and efficiency. Implementing these models could enhance patient outcomes and resource management in ED.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a373778072e1e9a480395a884d0355ce7000fbc82cf9dac0366ec5e1bcf4bed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
