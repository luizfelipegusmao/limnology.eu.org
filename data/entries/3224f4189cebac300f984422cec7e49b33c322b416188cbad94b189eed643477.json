{"title":"Prediction of Ground Reaction Forces and Moments and Joint Torques during Level Walking through Optical Motion Capture using a Multibody Dynamics Model and Foot Deformations without Optimization Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1077/v1","date":1710822806000,"content":"Predicting ground reaction forces (GRFs) and ground reaction moments (GRMs) through a biomechanical model-based approach offers advantages for biomechanical analysis, particularly in situations where the application of a statistical model is limited by insufficient training data. However, the current prediction method is unsuitable for clinical applications due to its long computational time. The present study developed a new optical motion capture (OMC)-based method to predict GRFs, GRMs, and joint torques. The proposed approach performed the estimation process by distributing external forces, as determined by the equation of motion, between the left and right feet based on foot deformations, thereby predicting the GRFs and GRMs without relying on machine learning or optimization techniques. We investigated the prediction accuracy during walking by comparing a conventional analysis using a force plate with the OMC results. The comparison revealed excellent or strong correlations between the prediction and measurement for all GRFs, GRMs, and lower limb joint torques. The proposed method, which provides practical estimation with low computational cost, facilitates efficient biomechanical analysis and rapid feedback of analysis results, thereby increasing its applicability for kinetics estimation in clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3224f4189cebac300f984422cec7e49b33c322b416188cbad94b189eed643477","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
