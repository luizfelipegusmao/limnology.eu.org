{"title":"Development of cost-effective Sn-free Al-Bi-Fe alloys for efficient onboard hydrogen production through Al-Water reaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1885/v1","date":1727165929000,"content":"Leveraging the liquid phase immiscibility effect and phase diagram calculations, a sequence of alloy powders with varying Fe content was designed and fabricated utilizing gas atomization method. Microstructural characterizations, employing SEM, EDS, and XRD analyses, revealed the successful formation of incomplete shell on the surfaces of Al-Bi-Fe powders, obviating the need for Sn doping. This study systematically investigated the microstructure, hydrolysis performance, and hydrolysis process of these alloys in deionized water. Notably, Al-10Bi-7Fe exhibited the highest hydrogen production, reaching 961.0 Nml/g, while Al-10Bi-10Fe demonstrated the peak conversion rate at 92.99%. The hydrolysis activation energy of each Al-Bi-Fe alloy powder was calculated using the Arrhenius equation, indicating a reduction in activation energy achieved through Fe doping.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e248984a75df8451c2d468aec95f9673f68bac54c26133ad9ca23d8f2fe8892f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
