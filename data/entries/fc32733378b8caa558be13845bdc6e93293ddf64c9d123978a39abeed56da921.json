{"title":"An Efficiency Examination of the DJI Mavic 2 Proâ€™s Precision Landings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2431/v1","date":1722404304000,"content":"In recent times, the application areas of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expanding, and autonomous functions are becoming increasingly prominent, eliminating the need for remote pilot control. Certain applications require the drone to use a docking station autonomously, even for wireless charging. This involves performing autonomous takeoff and landing, where high preci-sion is demanded. These maneuvers can be significantly influenced by environmental factors. The effectiveness of the precision landing function of the DJI Mavic 2 Pro UAV in strong winds is in-vestigated in this article based on experimental measurements conducted outdoors. New findings on the precision landing capabilities of the DJI Mavic 2 Pro UAV are presented in this paper, par-ticularly under windy conditions. The efficiency of precision landing is compared in cases when the precision landing function is enabled versus when it is disabled. It is investigated whether there is a statistically significant difference between the two landing modes in strong winds and it is examined whether the DJI Mavic 2 Pro can perform precision landing on a surface of a specific size in windy conditions. This helps to predict the suitability of the DJI Mavic 2 Pro for precise landing and wireless charging at a docking station in strong winds and high gusts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc32733378b8caa558be13845bdc6e93293ddf64c9d123978a39abeed56da921","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
