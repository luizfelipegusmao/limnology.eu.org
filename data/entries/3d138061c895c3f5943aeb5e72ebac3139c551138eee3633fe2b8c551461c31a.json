{"title":"Comparison of Vegetarian Sausages: Proximal Composition, Instrumental Texture, Descriptive Sensory Profile and Overall Liking with Consumers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1525/v1","date":1713933339000,"content":"The aims of this research were to know the physicochemical parameters, texture properties and sensory profile of vegetarian sausages through the flash profile, overall liking and purchase intention. Additionally, protein, fat and carbohydrate contents, pH, water activity, color, instrumental texture and descriptive profile were quantified with the overall liking and purchase intention of four sausages: ovo-vegetarian (SO), classic vegan (SC), fine herb vegan (SH) and vegan quinoa (SQ). Regarding the physicochemical properties, significant differences (p &amp;lt; 0.05) were obtained. Using the flash profile, consumers described SO with attributes of elasticity, tamale smell, strange smell, characteristic flavor, pastiness, softness, pastel color. SC described as soft, pale color, characteristic odor, characteristic flavor, porous and flexible; SH and SQ characterized by the presence of ingredients, stew flavor, spices, pale and soft color. The SO sample presented greater overall liking and purchase intention compared to the other samples, and had a better texture and higher protein content. Through the HMFA analysis, a positive correlation was obtained between the texture and descriptive sensory of the flash profile, and on the other hand, a correlation between the physicochemical characteristics pH, aw, color, overall liking and purchase intention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d138061c895c3f5943aeb5e72ebac3139c551138eee3633fe2b8c551461c31a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
