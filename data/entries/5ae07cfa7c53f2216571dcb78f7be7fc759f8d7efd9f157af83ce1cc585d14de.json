{"title":"Recent Advances in The Plant Genomic DNA Methylation Studies and Its Involvement in Regulating Drought Stress Response in Crops","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1381/v1","date":1711110648000,"content":"As the global arid climate intensifies and the groundwater becomes increasingly scarce, drought stress has become a major challenge to plant growth and development worldwide, especially causing yield reduction and extinction of cultivated crops. In a large number of drought resistance studies, DNA methylation has been found dynamically associated with response to drought stress in plants by regulating gene expression and developments in plants, but the specific mechanisms are not yet clear. In this article, the current advances of research have been summarized on DNA methylation response to drought stress in various plant species, in terms of methylation detection methods, mechanisms of pattern changes (DNA de novo methylation, DNA maintenance methylation, and DNA demethylation), and its response to drought stress. With Most of the studies showed significant changes in genome or gene promoter methylation levels in plants subjected to drought stress, but the identification of the genes and pathways involved is still in the minority. The aim is to provide references for in-depth research on the response of plants to drought stress through epigenetics, and to uncover drought resistance genes regulated by DNA methylation, specific signaling pathways, and molecular mechanisms of action.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ae07cfa7c53f2216571dcb78f7be7fc759f8d7efd9f157af83ce1cc585d14de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
