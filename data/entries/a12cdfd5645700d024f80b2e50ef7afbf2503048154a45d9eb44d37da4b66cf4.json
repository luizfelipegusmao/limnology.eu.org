{"title":"Two calcium sensor-activated kinases function in root hair growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1534/7709982?rss=1","date":1720483200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant pollen tubes and root hairs typically polarized tip growth. It is well established that calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) play essential roles in maintaining cell polarity and guiding cell growth orientation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are encoded by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and transporters and are decoded by a variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins often called Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, in which calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) proteins function by interacting with and activating a group of kinases and activate CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Some CBL-CIPK complexes, such as CBL2/3-CIPK12/19, act as crucial regulators of pollen tube growth. Whether these calcium decoding components regulate the growth of root hairs, another type of plant cell featuring Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated polarized growth, remains unknown. In this study, we identified <span>CIPK13</span> and <span>CIPK18</span> as genes specifically expressed in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) root hairs. The <span>cipk13 cipk18</span> double mutants showed reduced root hair length and lower growth rates. The calcium oscillations at the root hair tip were attenuated in the <span>cipk13 cipk18</span> mutants as compared to the wild-type plants. Through yeast 2-hybrid screens, CBL2 and CBL3 were identified as interacting with CIPK13 and CIPK18. <span>cbl2 cbl3</span> displayed a shortened root hair phenotype similar to <span>cipk13 cipk18</span>. This genetic analysis, together with biochemical assays showing activation of CIPK13/18 by CBL2/3, supported the conclusion that CBL2/3 and CIPK13/18 may work as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-decoding modules in controlling root hair growth. Thus, the findings that CIPK12/19 and CIPK13/18 function in pollen tube and root hair growth, respectively, illustrate a molecular mechanism in which the same CBLs recruit distinct CIPKs in regulating polarized tip growth in different types of plant cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a12cdfd5645700d024f80b2e50ef7afbf2503048154a45d9eb44d37da4b66cf4","category":"Environment"}
