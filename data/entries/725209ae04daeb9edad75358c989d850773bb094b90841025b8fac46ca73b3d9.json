{"title":"Low-Cost Open-Source Melt Flow Index System for Distributed Recycling and Additive Manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2305/v1","date":1727599418000,"content":"The increasing adoption of distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) has facilitated the revalorization of materials derived from waste streams for additive manufacturing. Recycled materials frequently contain impurities and mixed polymers, which can degrade their properties over multiple cycles. This degradation, particularly in rheological properties, limits their applicability in 3D printing. Consequently, there is a critical need for a tool that enables rapid assessment of the flowability of these recycled materials. This study presents the design, development, and manufacturing of an open-source melt flow index (MFI) apparatus. The proposed MFI tool offers a user-friendly and cost-effective solution for evaluating the flow properties of materials from waste streams, thereby enhancing their viability for additive manufacturing applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"725209ae04daeb9edad75358c989d850773bb094b90841025b8fac46ca73b3d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
