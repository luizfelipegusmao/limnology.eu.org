{"title":"Comparative Efficacy of Different Pharmacological Treatments for Pityriasis Rosea: A Network Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1570/v1","date":1726819913000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a self-limiting exanthematous disease associated with the endogenous reactivation of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and HHV-7. Classically, the lesions gradually resolve leaving no sequelae. Therefore, the best treatment is reassuring the patient and suggesting a resting period. However, atypical PR cases characterized by extensive, persistent lesions and systemic symptoms may impact the patientâ€™s quality of life, and, therefore, a treatment can be prescribed. There is limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for PR, therefore we performed a network meta-analysis to compare these interventions. Methods: Overall, 12 randomized control trials (RCTs) were identified. The outcomes were itch resolution and rash improvement. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We also calculated the relative ranking of the interventions for achieving the aforementioned outcomes as their surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Results: On network meta-analysis, only oral steroids and the combination of oral steroids+antihistamine resulted significantly superior to the placebo in terms of itch resolution (RR 0.44, CI 0.27-0.72 and RR 0.47, CI 0.22-0.99). Oral steroids resulted as the best treatment (SUCRA 0.90) for itch resolution. In terms of rash improvement, only acyclovir and erythromycin resulted significantly superior to placebo (RR 2.55, CI 1.81-3.58 and RR 1.69, CI 1.23-2.33), and acyclovir outperformed all the other tested interventions. Consequently, acyclovir ranked as the best intervention (SUCRA score 0.92). Conclusions: Acyclovir represents the best option in PR patients with extensive, persistent lesions or systemic symptoms. Steroids and antihistamines seemed the best treatment for itch resolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd18147b4d9c99b69bc872ec2e7b475b090c65ea01fe9660e548e8d7c20aaccd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
