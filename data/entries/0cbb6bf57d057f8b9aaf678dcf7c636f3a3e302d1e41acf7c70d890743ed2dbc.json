Its stoichiometric flexibility allows it to host a variety of defects. Structural faults like Ruddlesden-Popper, elastic distortions, and BX<sub>3</sub> octahedral tilts are commonly observed in these crystals and have been studied for their properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.566-B1\">1-2</a>]. However, it is still not well understood how these defects form in the material. In order to synthesize perovskite oxide with controlled density of defects, in-depth understanding of their formation is necessary. In this study, we discuss possible routes of formation of Ruddlesden-Popper faults including through conventional 1D topological line defects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0cbb6bf57d057f8b9aaf678dcf7c636f3a3e302d1e41acf7c70d890743ed2dbc","category":"Environment"}
