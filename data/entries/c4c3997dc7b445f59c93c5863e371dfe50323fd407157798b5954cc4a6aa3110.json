{"title":"Metabolic Engineering in Plants: Enhancing Crop Yield and Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1490/v1","date":1721292852000,"content":"Metabolic engineering in plants offers powerful strategies to enhance crop yield and quality, addressing global challenges in agriculture and food security. This study explores cutting-edge approaches in manipulating primary and secondary metabolic pathways, utilizing advanced genetic modification tools to improve key traits in crops. We examine successful applications that have enhanced photosynthetic efficiency, nutrient use, stress tolerance, and the production of valuable metabolites. The study also delves into emerging trends, such as synthetic biology approaches and multi-gene trait stacking, which are revolutionizing the field. By integrating omics technologies and computational modeling, researchers are optimizing metabolic engineering designs with unprecedented precision. As the field rapidly evolves, we consider the regulatory and biosafety aspects of genetically modified crops, providing insights into the future of sustainable agriculture and crop improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4c3997dc7b445f59c93c5863e371dfe50323fd407157798b5954cc4a6aa3110","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
