{"title":"Environmental Impact of Earthquake-Resistant Design: A Sustainable Approach to Structural Response in High-Seismic-Risk Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1490/v1","date":1729245614000,"content":"The ODS demonstrated the optimal structural response, showcasing equal storey drift compared to the EFS, while emitting 38% less pollution. Furthermore, it only induced approximately 5% more pollution than the system with the lowest contamination levels (OFS). This study concludes that earthquake-resistant design has a direct impact on CO2 emissions in the environment. An effective earthquake-resistant response could have lower levels of pollution; therefore, a balance could be achieved between a good structural response with a reduced environmental impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89df0c24c02c1153507b505f1a2a8f9f15525ca1125e614eeb36f8ab3879c6f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
