Recent government initiatives have recognized the importance of supplementary wildflower plantings to support native bee populations, yet little information exists on the attractiveness of recommended plant species to bees.\n\nWith the use of network analysis and generalized linear mixed models, we evaluated the attractiveness of 18 wildflower species belonging to 6 families (Apiaceae, Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae) planted in a randomized block design by conducting timed targeted sweep netting surveys. We also evaluated the floral preferences of four bee species (<i>Apis mellifera</i>, <i>Halictus poeyi/ligatus</i>, <i>Bombus griseocollis</i> and <i>Bombus impatiens</i>) to the planted wildflower species with the use of GLMs.\n\nWe found that <i>Asclepias tuberosa, Gaillardia pulchella</i> and <i>Verbena hastata</i> attracted the greatest abundance, richness and diversity of native bees compared to the other wildflower species. Collectively, <i>Asclepias tuberosa, Gaillardia pulchella</i> and <i>Verbena hastata</i> attracted 89% of all bee taxa in the study, which exemplifies the importance of including them in a wildflower mixture to attract native bees.\n\nWhile several wildflower species attracted low abundance, richness and diversity of native bees such as <i>Monarda fistulosa, Symphyotrichum pilosum</i> and <i>Eryngium yuccifolium</i>, they are still ecologically important for attracting uncommon or specialist bee species and should be included in seed mixes for this reason.\n\n<i>Solution</i>. Our results highlight that each species of native wildflower varies in the abundance, richness and diversity of native bees they attract; this could be considered in the decision-making of landowners and land managers to promote wildflower plantings to reflect the needs of certain groups of bees of conservation interest.\n</p>","author":"Anthony P.
