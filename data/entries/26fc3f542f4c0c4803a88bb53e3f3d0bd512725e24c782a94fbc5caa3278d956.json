{"title":"Preparation and Characterization of Superabsorbent Polymers (SAPs) Based on PUL-g- AM/AA by Microwave Irradiation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1913/v1","date":1716964424000,"content":"A microwave technique prepared a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) by grafting two hydrophilic monomers onto a polysaccharide substrate. The monomers used are acrylic acid (AA) or acrylamide (AM) to graft onto a pullulan substrate (PUL) to form PUL-g- AA (SAP1) and PUL-g- AM (SAP2), respectively. The monomers (AM/AA) graft together onto a PUL substrate to form PUL-g-(AM/AA) (SAP3). Grafting parameters such as grafting efficiency with percentage, conversion of monomer to polymer, gel content, water retention, water adsorption capacity, and swelling kinetics were determined. Additionally, the effect of environmental pH (2, 4, 7, 9, and 12) and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) surfactant was evaluated, where SDBS was added by 1,2,3,4 and 5 mM to form (SAP4 to SAP8). FTIR results show that AM grafted on PUL through an aliphatic C-N bond, while AA grafting occurred through a single C-C bond. The grafting efficiency with AM is higher than with AA, as well as their gel contents. Water absorbance capacity increased with grafting of AA or AM separately, and water retention was enhanced. The highest absorbent capacity, water retention, gel content, and grafting parameters values were obtained with 3 mM SDBS content and pH7. The swelling kinetics showed that the increases in the theoretical and experimental swelling equilibriums were 72 % and 82%, respectively, at SAP6 compared to the values of these parameters in SAP3. The water absorption capacity of the hydrogel increases with increasing pH to 7 and then gradually decreases. XRD improves the crystallinity and crystalline size of the hydrogel after grafting polymerization for AM/AA into PUL, in addition to enhancing thermal stability. On the contrary, FE-SEM demonstrated that SDBS improves the porosity and pore size of the hydrogel surface in SAP6.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26fc3f542f4c0c4803a88bb53e3f3d0bd512725e24c782a94fbc5caa3278d956","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
