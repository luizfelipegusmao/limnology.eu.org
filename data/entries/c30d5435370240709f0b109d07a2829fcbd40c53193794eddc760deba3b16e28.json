{"title":"Elementary Particles and Their Interaction with Space-Time Curvature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0809/v3","date":1712645718000,"content":"This article begins with exploring fundamental limits in the universe. It examines key principles, such as the uniformity of physical laws and Energy conservation, that lead to maximum speed, locality, and maximum density. These universal limits govern physical phenomena, leading to very interesting results.I demonstrate that quarks and leptons comprise smaller entities named \"Quantum Black Holes.\" These Quantum black holes are relativistically rotating miniature charged black holes consisting of a single core at the highest possible density. Quantum black holes are the only structures small enough in space-time capable of keeping all charges quantized (including gravitational charges.)By the end of the article, I prove that Quantum black holes explain the deficiencies of SM. They facilitate explanations of quantized gravity, the nature of Luminous and dark Matter, establishing the Mass, size, and (quantized) charges quantities of elementary particles, the nature of neutrino oscillations, and more. Elementary particles release their Energy outward, altering the curvature of nearby space-time and providing new insights into the nature of space-time curvature change. With this understanding, we can characterize movements and processes in local space-time using five sets of equations simultaneously: four representing the four charge types and one representing Dark Matter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c30d5435370240709f0b109d07a2829fcbd40c53193794eddc760deba3b16e28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
