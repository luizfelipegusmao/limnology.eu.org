{"title":"Conductivity at varying frequencies as a method for differentiating strawberry ripeness and association with colour acceptance of strawberry nectars","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13787?af=R","date":1722511450000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Identifying the best strawberries to produce colour stable nectars is a priority for the juice industry. Although riper strawberries produce nectars with better colour stability, variability between cultivars means that surface colour cannot be used as a single quality attribute to determine stability. Conductivity and bio-impedance measurements can be used to differentiate ripeness of strawberries. The commercially available PEF Control System (ELEA) can measure cell disruption by measuring conductivity at different frequencies. Updated software measured strawberry conductivity at 121 frequencies between 100 Hz and 1 MHz to determine whether conductivity at these frequencies could differentiate ripeness, and be compared with the colour acceptance and stability of nectars produced from these strawberries.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A high-low ratio (HLR) was calculated by dividing the conductivity at frequency 1 MHz by conductivity at 1 kHz. HLR could be used to separate five strawberry ripeness stages, with decreasing HLR associated with increasing ripeness. HLR was then compared with the colour of nectars produced from these strawberries. Although there was a good correlation between HLR and an acceptable colour to consumers on initial production (<i>r</i> = −0.823, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and after 12 weeks of storage (−0.759, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), cultivars differed greatly in both HLR and colour stability. Additionally, HLR had a strong correlation with firmness.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The PEF Control System could be used to differentiate ripeness of strawberries by HLR, and therefore was associated with colour stability. However, no additional information on colour stability was gained from conductivity beyond what could already be deduced from differentiating ripeness based on surface colour. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Helen Murray, \nFabio Stipkovits, \nMarlene Lindner, \nJasmin Wühl, \nHeidrun Halbwirth, \nManfred Gössinger","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7950d8b29d6ac0b2c2d6fdfc368ec88b0f77500324d72cc7ab97cb50362badaa","category":"Environment"}
