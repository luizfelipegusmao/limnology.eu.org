{"title":"Locating UO22+ in Metal Sulfide Ion Exchange Materials Utilizing Multimodal STEM Techniques","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.541/7720108?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Nuclear energy is an essential part of a sustainable solution to the worldâ€™s ever-increasing energy needs. Uranium capture and release is a crucial challenge for the nuclear fuel cycle because uranium is a highly radioactive element of great interest in nuclear energy generation, but it is also one of the primary environmental pollutants [<a href=\"#ozae044.541-B1\">1</a>]. Metal sulfide ion exchange materials (MSIEs) have emerged as the only selective ion exchangers for remediating uranyl ion (UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>). [<a href=\"#ozae044.541-B2\">2-3</a>] However, up until now, the interaction between the MSIE structure and UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> has only been documented with weakly crystalline powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), bulk spectroscopy methods, and SEM Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). This has left questions about how UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>, a linear ion, is incorporated into the parent structure, whether the exchanged material is truly homogenous, and why the theoretical capacity of the source material cannot be reached. Answers to these questions would improve the design of MSIE ion exchange materials toward UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> remediation for nuclear energy fuel and waste remediation. The answer to this probing question lies in high-resolution microscopy analysis. Here, we dive into the MSIE material Na<sub>2</sub>SnS<sub>3</sub> (NMS) structure before and after ion exchange.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2b6bd8b008a88ce8296d2dffbe80963234764d9c17fbbb336637be912c49d076","category":"Environment"}
