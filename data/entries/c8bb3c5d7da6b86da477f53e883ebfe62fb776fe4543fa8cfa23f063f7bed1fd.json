{"title":"HE-DEPSO Algorithm for Textures Optimization with Application in Particle Physics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1171/v1","date":1723788608000,"content":"Within the phenomenology of particle physics, the theoretical model of 4-zero textures is validated using a chi-square criterion that compares experimental data with the computational results of the model. Traditionally, analytical methods that often imply simplifications, combined with computational analysis, have been used to validate texture models. In this paper, we propose a new meta-heuristic variant of the differential evolution algorithm that incorporates aspects of the particle swarm optimization algorithm called \"HE-DEPSO\" to obtain chi-squared values are less than a bound value, which exhaustive and traditional algorithms cannot obtain. The results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize the chi-square function according to the required criteria. We compare simulated data with experimental data in the allowed search region, thereby validating the 4-zero texture model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8bb3c5d7da6b86da477f53e883ebfe62fb776fe4543fa8cfa23f063f7bed1fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
