{"title":"Bacterial Contamination of Environmental Surfaces of Veterinary Rehabilitation Clinics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0276/v1","date":1714981035000,"content":"The presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria on veterinary clinic surfaces may be problematic. In this study we collected swab samples (Fisherbrand, double transport swabs with Stuart’s liquid medium) and water samples from five veterinary rehabilitation clinics. Swabs and water samples were transported to a microbiology lab for processing. At the lab swabs were used to inoculated Hardy’s Cdiff Banana broth (for Clostridium difficile [Cdiff]), and five different types of bacterial growth media, including: Hardy CHROM MRSA agar (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], and S. pseudintermedius [SIM]), Mannitol Salt Agar (S. aureus), Eosin Methylene Blue agar (enterics [ENT]), Pseudomonas Isolation agar (Pseudomonas sp.), and Tryptic Soy Agar [TSA] (non-specific). The most prominent species cultured was Cdiff (on nearly 55% of swabs). Bacillus sp. and Enterics were encountered on nearly 35% of swabs, with MRSA and SIM on just over 10% of swabs. The most contaminated sample site was harnesses/life jackets used with the underwater treadmill (33% of swabs). Underwater treadmill water had total bacterial counts from 1.6 to 2.7 e3 cfu/ml. Of all bacterial species detected SIM tends to be more pathogenic for dogs. Targeted cleaning/disinfecting in these clinics could help reduce risks for both animals and caregivers utilizing these clinics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b55bb5d6f4ff92e51a90952e5a754d2e60caada7a5bd7889b836f3311419a43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
