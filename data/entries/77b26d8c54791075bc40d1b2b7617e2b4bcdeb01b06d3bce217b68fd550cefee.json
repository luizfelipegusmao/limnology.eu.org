{"title":"Development of Vacuum Plasma Strengthening Hard and Ultra Hard 3D Avinit Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1632/v1","date":1714028653000,"content":"New multilayer 3D nanocomposite wear-resistant ion-plasma hard and superhard coatings Avinit [(TiN-AlN)(Mo-Cr-V-Si)]n have been developed.The introduction of additional alloying elements (Mo, Cr, V, Si) into the Ti-Al-N coating composition, which have a high affinity for nitrogen and are capable of forming strong nitride nanoparticles in the Ti-N and Al-N layers.This makes it possible to obtain hard and superhard hardening coatings.The metallographic and tribological studies carried out indicate the prospects of the developed multicomponent multilayer nano- and microstructured Avinit coatings for increasing wear resistance and reducing friction coefficients.This paper is devoted to the development and implementation of Avinit vacuum plasma technologies for strengthening cutting and forming tools to improve tool performance.Production tests of cutting tools with Avinit's developed multilayer wear-resistant ion-plasma coatings in production conditions at many large machine-building enterprises have shown their high efficiency.In serial production, the wear resistance of tools increases by 3 to 30 times, stamps by 5 to 100 times, and parts rubbing against abrasive materials by 10 to 100 times.Avinit's vacuum plasma technologies have been successfully implemented in production in the aggregate and engine building, transport engineering, and power engineering industries.Positive experience in applying multicomponent coatings has been gained not only when applying hardening coatings to manufactured cutting tools, but also after regrinding to regrindable carbide cutting tools from domestic and foreign manufacturers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77b26d8c54791075bc40d1b2b7617e2b4bcdeb01b06d3bce217b68fd550cefee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
