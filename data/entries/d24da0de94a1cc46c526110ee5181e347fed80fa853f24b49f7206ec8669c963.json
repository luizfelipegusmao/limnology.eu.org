{"title":"Phubbing in Adolescents: Spanish Validation of the Phubbing Scale (PS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1387/v1","date":1724144364000,"content":"The Phubbing Scale (PS) is an instrument used to measure the frequency and extent of the behaviour of ignoring someone you are with and giving attention to your mobile phone instead. However, there is insufficient evidence about the psychometric adequacy of the Spanish version of the instrument. The main goal of this research was to analyse the psychometric properties of PS in a representative sample of Spanish adolescents and young adults. A total of 1351 participants comprised the sample. (42,78% females, age range = 12-21). The goodness-of-fit indices for the two-factor model were good. The McDonaldâ€™s Omega coefficient for the total score was 0.787. The phenomenon of phubbing was found to have statistically significant correlations with emotional well-being, other mental health indicators, and with Problematic Internet Use (PIU); with the sole exception of the hyperactivity subscale of the SDQ This study provided validity evidence for the Spanish version of the Phubbing Scale (PS), suggesting that PS is a reliable tool for quantifying phubbing in Spanish adolescents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d24da0de94a1cc46c526110ee5181e347fed80fa853f24b49f7206ec8669c963","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
