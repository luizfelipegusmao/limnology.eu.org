Material functional properties can be tuned according to nanometric characteristics of the material. Carrier mobility enhancement achieved via processed-induced strain in the semiconductor industry is the most relevant example of such property tuning [<a href=\"#ozae044.080-B1\">1</a>]. Strain characterization of nanomaterials is generally performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Geometric phase analysis, (dark-field) electron holography (DFEH), and 4D-STEM are some of the different methods for strain characterization in a TEM, each with advantages and drawbacks [<a href=\"#ozae044.080-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eacd9a8e59a6903edf02dd1267f44e6645fad203b8f26ac3701772a698b0b755","category":"Environment"}
