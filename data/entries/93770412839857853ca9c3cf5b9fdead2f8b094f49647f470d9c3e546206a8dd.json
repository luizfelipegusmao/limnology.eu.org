By employing an electron beam as a broadband excitation source, materials can be brought into an excited state. The subsequent relaxation of these excited states typically follows intricate pathways involving both radiative and nonradiative recombination mechanisms. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these dynamic processes is essential for the design and optimization of nanomaterials and devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"93770412839857853ca9c3cf5b9fdead2f8b094f49647f470d9c3e546206a8dd","category":"Environment"}
