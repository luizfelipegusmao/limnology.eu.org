{"title":"Revitalizing Heritage: A Digital Approach to Preserve and Document Historical Structures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1853/v1","date":1719394445000,"content":"This study explores the potential of digital technologies for preserving cultural heritage through the case study of the Raya Gopura, an incomplete monument in Melukote, India. Employing a combination of photogrammetry (terrestrial and drone-based) and terrestrial laser scanning, the research team captured highly detailed 3D models of the structure. This non-destructive approach offers a comprehensive digital record for future research and preservation. Furthermore, consultations with experts yielded two possible purposes for the Raya Gopura: an entrance to a planned fort or a gateway to a temple. These insights inform a conjectural architectural drawing of the potentially completed monument. The 3D models hold significant potential for various applications, including tourism, education, and architectural research, with the potential for immersive experiences through VR and AR technologies. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of digital tools in heritage preservation, not only safeguarding the Raya Gopura but also offering valuable insights for future research and public engagement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3962608771e18087e2619b3824da05d23c9e5191d96f986f6b6e55685ba5b72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
