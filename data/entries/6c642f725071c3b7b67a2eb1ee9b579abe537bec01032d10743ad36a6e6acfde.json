This research emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive characterization, recognizing that battery damage can manifest from the manufacturing phase down to the material level. To address this, we employ a synergistic approach utilizing non-destructive X-ray microscopy (XRM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate a wide spectrum of aging effects. In addition to conventional post-mortem analysis, we introduce a novel methodology involving an in-operando PEEK coin cell. This innovative cell design allows for the real-time exploration of battery effects during operation, including phenomena such as lithium plating, particle cracking, and volume expansion. The in-operando experiments provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of batteries under realistic conditions. The specialized cell design further facilitates realistic battery experiments, ensuring a close representation of operational scenarios. Moreover, the study establishes correlations between computed tomography (CT) and SEM, enhancing our ability to interpret complex structural changes within the battery. The presented research not only advances our fundamental understanding of battery aging but also provides a practical framework for conducting a broad spectrum of experiments in a realistic in-operando environment. By combining multi-scale correlative characterization techniques with in-operando cell experiments, we contribute to the development of more robust and efficient energy storage systems, addressing the challenges associated with battery aging and degradation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6c642f725071c3b7b67a2eb1ee9b579abe537bec01032d10743ad36a6e6acfde","category":"Environment"}
