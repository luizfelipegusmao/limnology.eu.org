The characteristics and dynamics of fDOM in urban surface water are influenced by the presence of microplastics. Notably, there is a significant correlation (Pearson's <i>r</i> = −0.7, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) between fragment-shaped microplastics and <i>p</i>-hydroxy acetophenone component.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The aim of the study is to investigate the leaching of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) from microplastics. In addition, this study identifies the connection between fDOM and microplastics in the aquatic environment. Three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix identified five fluorophores, that is, peak A, M, T, T<sub>uv</sub>, and W<sub>uv</sub>, and the parallel factor analysis modeling identified five components, that is, tryptophan-like, <i>p</i>-hydroxy acetophenone, humic acid (C-like), detergent-like, and fulvic acid (M-like) in the urban surface water. Mimic experiments using commonly used synthetic plastic (like microplastics) in Mili-Q water under solar radiation and dark environments demonstrate the release of fDOM from plastic. Two fluorophore peaks were observed at Ex/Em = 250/302 nm and Ex/Em = 260/333 nm for the expanded polystyrene plastic polymer and one fluorophore peak at Ex/Em = 260/333 nm for the low-density polyethylene. Fluorophore and component intensity exhibited notable associations with microplastics in the aquatic environment. These findings indicated that the characteristics and dynamics of fDOM in urban surface water are influenced by microplastics.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nFluorescent dissolved organic matters were identified in urban surface waters.\nExpanded polystyrene (EPS) had shown two fluorophores at Em/Ex = 250/302 and Em/Ex = 260/333.\nLow-density polyethylene (LDPE) had one fluorophore at Em/Ex = 260/333.\nFluorophore and component intensity in the aquatic settings exhibited associations with microplastics.\n</p>","author":"Md.
