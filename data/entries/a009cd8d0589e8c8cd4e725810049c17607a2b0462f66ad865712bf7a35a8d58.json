{"title":"Galdieria sulphuraria Cultivation on Saline Oilfield Water: Salinity Effect on Regulation of Light Harvesting System and Onmetabolites Accumulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0753/v1","date":1720579609000,"content":"Microalgae cultivation for biotechnological purposes is an expanding field. Their cultivation is usually performed on a liquid culture medium and require the presence of an energy source. Culture media are water-salt solutions containing nitrogen, sulfur, phosphate sources, with trace of transition metals. Light source supplies energy through photosynthesis process, resulting in metabolic reactions and cell growth. Thanks to the huge number of existing species and their diversity, it is possible to exploit alternative water sources with chemical and physical properties far from the commonly used freshwater media. Among these, oilfield or formation waters (AFW) are saline wastewater produced during oil drilling. They represent over 95 % of the total fluids collected from gas and oil wells during fuel extraction. This study exploits the adaptation capability of a Galdieria sulphuraria strain in different salinity conditions to build up a more feasible microalgae-based platform. Batch cultivation of G. sulphuraria was evaluated in a range from 0 to 20 g/L NaCl in terms of growth rate, metabolite content, photophysiology, and intracellular redox state. Moreover, the same strain has been tested for artificial formation water growth in semicontinuous cultivation mode. In these condition, NaCl preadaptation effect has been assessed too. Results clearly demonstrate that biomass composition is influenced from medium salinity. Strains preadapted in 0 to 20 g/L range of NaCl salinity show almost same cell growth profile and a slightly different ratio between lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. Pigments content and photophysiology point out that variations of osmotic pressure and ionic strength in medium affect Photosystem II (PSII). Regulation of light harvesting is necessary to trigger metabolism shift toward synthesis of metabolites required in the adaptation process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a009cd8d0589e8c8cd4e725810049c17607a2b0462f66ad865712bf7a35a8d58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
