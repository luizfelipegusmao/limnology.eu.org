During those years Lena’s enthusiasm and dedication to uncovering the physics of materials through cutting-edge electron microscopy was a constant motivating force. My research under her mentorship focused on mapping picometer- to Ångström-scale atomic distortions in a wide variety of functional materials. This was one of many areas in which Lena’s work had a significant impact. She pushed the limits of measuring lattice distortions linked to connections between charge, spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of freedom in quantum materials and expanded the technique to cryogenic and intermediate temperatures, enabling direct visualization of temperature-driven phase transitions [<a href=\"#ozae044.1064-B1\">1-3</a>]. One analysis method that has been particularly impactful is the extraction of picometer-scale periodic lattice distortions (PLDs) using atomic column fitting and comparison to a reference lattice generated by damping the modulation of interest from the atomic-resolution image FFT [<a href=\"#ozae044.1064-B1\">1</a>]. Since this technique requires selection of distinct sets of Fourier peaks to produce the reference image, it has the potential to extract distortions related to different phases in crystals with phase coexistence.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6fa51de541f6e5c33d7ee99b9f7149c9287536ee1ba82a61ff7c63b3692b28fa","category":"Environment"}
