{"title":"Two-Phase RAG-Based Chatbot for Italian Funding Application Assistance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1999/v1","date":1719543935000,"content":"Securing funding is a critical yet complex task for organizations and individuals. This study presents an innovative chatbot designed to streamline the process using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and, specifically, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline optimized for real-world applications. Our chatbot assists users in identifying suitable public tenders for financial support through natural language queries and a comprehensive public data database. The chatbot operates in a two-stage interaction model, initially providing summarized tender information for exploratory brainstorming, followed by detailed data upon user selection. A custom filtering mechanism ensures that the user interface elements responsible for swapping the interaction stages are consistent with the responses generated by the conversational agent. Human-evaluation tests demonstrated an average accuracy of 90.4% in document retrieval, with an average of 2.11 interactions required to find a specific tender. User satisfaction, rated on a scale of 1 to 5, averaged 3.14 (Â±1.73), indicating generally positive user experience with room for improvement. This approach addresses challenges of relevance, accuracy, and conversational flow, resulting in a reliable chatbot that simplifies the process of finding funding opportunities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f465254b47331bd56fe2686676ee8161f6ae36454f957b7e387eba963c5461f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
