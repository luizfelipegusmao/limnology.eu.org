{"title":"6 Transforming animal agriculture through hybrid modeling and quantum computing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/70/7757250?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Quantum computing (QC) is not a futuristic notion in agriculture, though its full potential has yet to be realized. QC is an emerging field at the intersection of physics and computer science that holds immense potential to revolutionize various sectors, including agriculture production and artificial intelligence (AI) modeling. While QC is still in the early stages of development and practical applications within agriculture are not yet widespread, researchers are actively exploring its potential benefits in various agricultural domains, including crop optimization, livestock breeding, and environmental monitoring. QC harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations using quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Unlike classical computers, which rely on binary bits representing 0 or 1, quantum computers exploit phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to process information in parallel, potentially offering exponential speedup for certain types of problems. In agriculture production, particularly in animal science, QC offers promising avenues for optimizing processes and enhancing productivity. Quantum algorithms can analyze vast amounts of genomic data to improve breeding programs, leading to the development of more resilient and productive livestock breeds. Furthermore, QC can facilitate precision farming techniques by modeling complex environmental factors and animal behavior to optimize feeding strategies, disease management, and overall farm management practices. Moreover, QC can significantly benefit AI modeling by accelerating computations and enabling more efficient training of AI models. Quantum algorithms can enhance the performance of AI algorithms in various tasks, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. By leveraging quantum-enhanced optimization algorithms, AI models can achieve better convergence and accuracy, leading to more effective decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. While hybrid intelligent models also represent a novel frontier in agriculture, QC has the potential to expedite the merging of mechanistic and AI modeling paradigms, facilitating a more holistic understanding of complex systems in agriculture and beyond. By integrating mechanistic models, which describe the underlying physical processes, with AI models, which learn patterns from data, quantum computing can enable comprehensive simulations and predictions of agricultural systems. This fusion of modeling paradigms can lead to more accurate and robust predictions of crop yields, livestock performance, and environmental impacts, facilitating informed decision-making for farmers and policymakers. The application of QC in agriculture, however, requires interdisciplinary collaborations between physicists, computer scientists, agronomists/animal scientists, and AI researchers. These collaborations can drive the development of quantum algorithms tailored to agricultural applications, the integration of quantum-enhanced AI techniques into existing modeling frameworks, and the deployment of QC resources in real-world agricultural systems. Ultimately, harnessing the power of QC holds the potential to revolutionize agriculture production practices, including regenerative agriculture, and advance AI modeling capabilities, paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient agricultural industry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f3bcad3d901dac8fdf6d6cd54484cb7e0de68a86ddb3ebb2d089ca82397565b2","category":"Environment"}
