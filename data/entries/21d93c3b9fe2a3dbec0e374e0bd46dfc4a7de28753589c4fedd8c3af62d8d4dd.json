{"title":"Mapping the Influence of Olympic Games&rsquo; Urban Planning on the Land Surface Temperatures: an Estimation Using Landsat Series and Google Earth Engine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2186/v1","date":1722058220000,"content":"The Olympic Games are a sporting event and a catalyst for urban development in the host city. In this study, we utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to examine the impact of the Olympic infrastructure on the surface temperature of urban areas. Using Landsat Series Collection 2 Tier 1 Level 2 data, cloud computing, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) methods, this study examines the effects of various Olympic Games facility urban planning in different historical moments and location typologies: monocentric, polycentric, peripheric and clustered Olympic ring. The GEE code applies to the Olympic Games from Paris’24 to Munich’72. However, this paper focuses specifically on the representative cases of Paris’24, Tokyo’20, Rio’16, Beijing’08, Sydney’00, Barcelona’92, Seoul’88, and Montreal’76. The study is not only concerned with obtaining absolute Land Surface Temperatures (LST), but rather the relative influence of mega-event infrastructures on mitigating or increasing the urban heat. As such, locally Normalized Land Surface Temperature (NLST) was utilized for this purpose. In some cities (Paris, Tokyo, Beijing, and Barcelona), it is identified that Olympic planning has resulted in the development of green spaces, creating \"green spots\" that contribute to lower-than-average temperatures. However, it should be noted that there is a significant variation in temperature within intensely built-up areas, such as Olympic villages and the surrounding areas of the Olympic stadium, which can become “hotspots”. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that different planning typologies of Olympic infrastructure can have varying impacts on city heat islands, with the polycentric and clustered Olympic ring typologies displaying a mitigating effect. This research contributes to a cloud computing method that can be updated for future Olympic Games or adapted for other mega-events and utilizes a widely available remote sensing data source to study a specific urban planning context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21d93c3b9fe2a3dbec0e374e0bd46dfc4a7de28753589c4fedd8c3af62d8d4dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
