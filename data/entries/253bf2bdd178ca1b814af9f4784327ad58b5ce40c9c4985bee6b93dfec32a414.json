{"title":"Unveiling Lithium&rsquo;s Preference to the Brain: Insights from Its Mechanism of Action","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1561/v1","date":1729504862000,"content":"Lithium has long been recognized for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of manic-depressive illness (MDI). Additionally, numerous reports highlight its protective properties against cell insults, with a remarkable majority of these effects documented in neurons. Utilizing the major mechanisms of its action, we bring insights that explain lithium's ability to preferentially promote survival in neurons. Specifically, we explore its interactions with magnesium at protein binding sites, with a particular focus on its impact on glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). We propose that lower intracellular free magnesium levels in the brain, coupled with the higher expression of GSK3β, which is an enzyme whose activity is magnesium-dependent, amplify its impact on brain cells, promoting neuronal survival.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"253bf2bdd178ca1b814af9f4784327ad58b5ce40c9c4985bee6b93dfec32a414","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
