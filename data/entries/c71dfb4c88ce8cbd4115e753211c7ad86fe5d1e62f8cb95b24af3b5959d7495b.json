{"title":"Cochlear Implant and its Complications: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1817/v1","date":1724657299000,"content":"Introduction\nCochlear implants are a modern approach for the treatment of multiple cases of profound sensorineural hearing loss. Factors such as the ethiology of hearing loss and the potential for achieving good postoperative outcomes are considered in cochlear implantation. Additionally, surgical strategies, protocols, the experience of the surgeon and audiologist, and the presence of postoperative issues and risks that may require revision surgery should also be taken into account. The surgeon specialized in cochlear implantation must inform the patient and his relatives not only about the surgical technique but also about possible complications. The literature shows different rates of complications evaluated both in adults and in children. An evaluation of adverse events in order to prevent complications can be made if the definition of medical complications and mistakes is strictly approached based on the CLAVIEN-DINDO classification system. The rate of complications can be compared with existing literature. Studies demonstrate the need for preoperative vaccination for pneumococcus, which can prevent complications, especially in patients with inner ear malformations who present  an increased postoperative risk\nRelevant Sections\nThis review is structured around the collection of specialized literature from PubMed, organized into subchapters related to intraoperative complications such as Gusher syndrome, foreign body reaction, endocochlear inflammation phenomena, issues related to electrode positioning and associated complications, vestibular phenomena related to cochlear implantation, as well as late complications related to the surgical wound and cochlear implant extrusion. The important sections in this review are: Inner Ear Malformations and Gusher Syndrome: Intraoperative Complication Risks, Electrode Insertion and Positioning Issues, Intracochlear Inflammation, Foreign Body Reaction, and Intracochlear Fibrosis: Phenomena That Can Occur with Cochlear Implantation, Vestibular Disorders, Tardive Postoperative Complications: Wound Injuries and Cochlear Implant Extrusion and Otitis Media and Cholesteatoma as Complications of Cochlear Implantation\nConclusions: \nPostoperative complications, although considered quite rare. The surgical limits and long-term evolution of cochlear implants cannot be concretely established, despite the fact that this intervention is considered safe in the medium and long term.\nFuture directions\nGiven that cochlear implants represent the most modern surgical technique for auditory rehabilitation in adults and children, with massive implications for quality of life, there is a tendency to extend surgical indications in the future, and especially to inform doctors in related specialties about the benefits of this medical device. Surgeons must be knowledgeable about cochlear implantation methods, as well as the methods for managing complications that can arise immediately postoperatively, as well as in the medium and long term.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c71dfb4c88ce8cbd4115e753211c7ad86fe5d1e62f8cb95b24af3b5959d7495b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
