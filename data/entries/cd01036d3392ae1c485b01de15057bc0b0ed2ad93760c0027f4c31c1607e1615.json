At the atomic level, this reversal is created by the movement of atoms and their accompanying charge from one stable position inside the crystallographic unit cell to another. Because both atomic arrangements are stable and reproducible, ferroelectric materials have the potential to form the basis of an ideal non-volatile electronic memory technology: one that is fast, low-power, robust, and highly scalable. Ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide (Hf<sub>0.5</sub>Zr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, HZO) is particularly attractive to the semiconductor industry, because it can be deposited with atomic layer deposition (ALD) and is 100% compatible with standard CMOS fabrication processing [<a href=\"#ozae044.679-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cd01036d3392ae1c485b01de15057bc0b0ed2ad93760c0027f4c31c1607e1615","category":"Environment"}
