The reversibility of this electrochemical cycling process governs the performance of Li metal batteries but is largely affected by the corrosion film, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), as the ionic conductivities of the SEIs are closely related to the Li<sup>+</sup> migration. While it is well-established that the SEI functions as an ionically conductive yet electronically insulating layer, conformally passivating the Li metal surface from electrolyte degradation and governing Li<sup>+</sup> transport between electrode and electrolyte [<a href=\"#ozae044.935-B2\">2</a>], its structure and chemistry remain mysterious [<a href=\"#ozae044.935-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.935-B4\">4</a>]. Thus, one of the most important yet unanswered questions in Li-based battery research still remains: how are components distributed across the SEI and how do they govern Li<sup>+</sup> transport? Direct imaging of local SEI structure would provide fundamental insight into Li<sup>+</sup> transport mechanism and unlock new design principles for electrolytes and batteries.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a127400b49a5eced2690e5333a396ac0c1ba5d2b72048dd3b5e5982e825fd8a0","category":"Environment"}
