{"title":"Assessment of Surface Roughness, Color, and Bonding Efficacy: Self-Adhesive vs. Conventional Flowable Resin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0559/v1","date":1723100728000,"content":"Abstract: This in vitro study aimed to analyze the surface roughness (Ra) and color stability (ΔEab, ΔE00) following simulated mechanical brushing, and to evaluate the microtensile (μTBS) to dentin of Self Adhering Resin Flowable (SARF). The selected materials were Constic, Yflow AS, and Tetric N flow (TNF/control). Thirty composite resin cylinders were fabricated for surface property evaluation. Ra and color were assessed both before and after simulated brushing. The thresholds of 50:50% perceptibility and acceptability of color difference of the evaluated resins were assessed. For μTBS analysis, fifteen molars were selected, sectioned to expose flat dentin surfaces, and restored according to manufacturers' instructions. Subsequently, they were sectioned into sticks for microtensile testing. Statistically significant differences in Ra among the groups, with Constic exhibiting the highest Ra value (p &lt; 0.05), while Yflow AS showed the lowest Ra value. No statistically significant difference in color was observed among the groups (p &gt; 0.05). The 50:50% perceptibility and acceptability thresholds set at 1.2 and 2.7 for ΔEab and 0.8 and 1.8 for ΔE 00. All the results fell within the acceptable limits. The mean μTBS values of Constic, Yflow AS, and TNF were 10.649 MPa, 8.170 MPa, and 33.669 MPa, respectively. The study revealed increased Ra and comparable color stability among all tested composite resins after abrasion. However, SARF exhibited lower μTBS compared to conventional using an adhesive system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9df891051405bc58def85549112ae80de30f72c52d9531a09aeb043ff08ebe38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
