{"title":"Gender and stigma in antiretroviral treatment adherence in Mozambique: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003166","date":1721052000000,"content":"<p>by Kirsi Viisainen, Marion Baumgart dos Santos, Ute Sunderbrink, Aleny Couto</p>\r\n\r\nBoth gender and HIV stigma are known to contribute to poor retention to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but little is known how they interact in decisions about adherence or default by people living with HIV (PLWH). This qualitative study explored HIV stigma and gender interaction in PLWH’s care decisions in Mozambique. Transcribed data from semi-structured interviews of 68 men and 71 women living with HIV, were coded and analyzed for themes of HIV stigma, gender norms and treatment continuation and interruption pathways, using both deductive and inductive coding approaches. Stigma experiences were found to be influenced by gender roles. Anticipation of stigma was common across the narratives of PLWH, while women had more experiences of enacted stigma, particularly by their intimate partners. Women’s treatment interruptions were influenced by fear of partner’s negative reaction. Men’s narratives showed internalized stigma and delayed treatment due to anticipated stigma and masculine norm of strength. Severe internalized stigma was found among single mothers, who without economic or moral support defaulted treatment. Women’s pathway to adherence was facilitated by their caregiver role and support from partner or kin family. Men’s adherence was facilitated by experience of severe symptoms, provider role and by support from their mother or partner. Results indicate that linkage of stigma to gender roles interact in treatment decisions in three main ways. First, HIV stigma and unequal gender norms can work jointly as a barrier to adherence. Secondly, those resisting restrictive gender norms found it easier to manage HIV stigma for the benefit of treatment adherence. Thirdly, some gender norms also facilitated adherence and stigma management. Programs targeted at HIV stigma reduction and improving ART adherence among heterosexual populations should be built on an understanding of the local gender norms and include socially and culturally relevant gender sensitive and transformative activities.","author":"Kirsi Viisainen","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"80cf6803bb1a135e47c20e199106bdc7f375f7029566aab5e9c5fe3c1dc647b1","category":"Environment"}
