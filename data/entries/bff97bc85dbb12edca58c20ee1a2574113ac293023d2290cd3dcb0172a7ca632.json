{"title":"Insights into Perimenopause: A Survey of Perceptions, Opinions on Treatment, and Potential Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0786/v1","date":1725958254000,"content":"Perimenopause, the transitional phase leading up to menopause, affects millions of women worldwide, yet remains poorly understood and under-addressed in healthcare. This report investigates the significant impact of perimenopause symptoms on women's lives, emphasizing the often debilitating effects such as anxiety, depression, weight gain, and hot flashes, which collectively cost an estimated $1.8 billion annually in lost work time. Despite the availability of treatment options like Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and non-hormonal alternatives, awareness and utilization of these options vary significantly among women. The report highlights the historical neglect of women's health issues and the need for improved communication between patients and healthcare providers. A cross-sectional survey conducted with 1,000 adults from the United States and Canada reveals widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of healthcare communication, underscoring the importance of personalized and comprehensive insights for women's health. The findings advocate for more at-home solutions and resources to empower women in managing perimenopause and menopause, promoting informed decision-making and reducing stigma. This study aims to enhance awareness and support for women during this critical life stage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bff97bc85dbb12edca58c20ee1a2574113ac293023d2290cd3dcb0172a7ca632","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
