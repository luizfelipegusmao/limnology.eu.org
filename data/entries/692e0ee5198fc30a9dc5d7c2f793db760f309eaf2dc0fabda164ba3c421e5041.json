{"title":"Call to action for cross‐border conservation of the critically endangered Lake Chala tilapia (Oreochromis hunteri)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4221?af=R","date":1721272171000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lake Chala straddles the Kenya–Tanzania border, with a narrow strip of terrestrial habitat around it. The steep rocky shores are bedecked in a backdrop of Kilimanjaro at sunrise, giving the area the aesthetic beauty of an important tourist destination. The lake has important conservation implications ranging from endemic species including a critically endangered and rapidly declining fish to other unique biodiversity. This calls for urgent action to prevent extinction and promote sustainable management, building on previous work and action plans such as a proposed new conservancy, as the best safeguard against the threats.</p>","author":"E.
