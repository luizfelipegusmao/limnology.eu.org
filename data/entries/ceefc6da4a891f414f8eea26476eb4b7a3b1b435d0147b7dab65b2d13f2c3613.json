{"title":"The relationship between money supply and inflation in Pakistan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301257","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Tasos Stylianou, Rakia Nasir, Muhammad Waqas</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates the long-run and short-run relationship between money supply and inflation in Pakistan, utilizing annual data spanning from 1981 to 2021. The key objective is to assess the impact of monetary policy, specifically money supply, on inflation dynamics in the country. To achieve this, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach is employed, which is suitable for analyzing cointegration among variables with mixed integration orders. The results reveal both short and long-run cointegration between inflation, money supply, unemployment, and interest rates. Notably, unemployment demonstrates a negative correlation with inflation, while money supply and interest rates exhibit a positive relationship. These findings underscore the importance of dedicated policy measures to manage inflation effectively. The paper concludes by recommending the establishment of a policy implementation body and collaboration between the government and the central bank to ensure financial stability and control inflation through well-calibrated monetary and fiscal policies.","author":"Tasos Stylianou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ceefc6da4a891f414f8eea26476eb4b7a3b1b435d0147b7dab65b2d13f2c3613","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
