{"title":"The impacts of COVID-19 on older adults in Uganda and Ethiopia: Perspectives from non-governmental organization staff and volunteers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003691","date":1725458400000,"content":"<p>by Satveer Dhillon, Isaac Luginaah, Susan J. Elliott, Justine Nagawa, Ronah Agaba Niwagaba</p>\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on older adults, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To support older adults during this time, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) coordinated programs to help provide for basic needs related to food and water security and healthcare. This research explores the attitudes, perceptions and experiences of NGO staff and volunteers who provided support to older adults in SSA in rural East Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. In-depth interviews (n = 28) were conducted with NGO staff and volunteers in Uganda and Ethiopia between September and December of 2022. Overall, NGO staff and volunteers reported high levels of knowledge surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and stated that one positive of the COVID-19 pandemic was the improved hygiene practices. However, the NGO staff and volunteers also reported that the pandemic and the associated public health measures exacerbated pre-existing social inequalities, such as increasing pre-existing levels of food insecurity. The exacerbation of pre-existing social inequalities may be one reason for the increased reliance on NGO services. The learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures can be utilized to create targeted strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of future public health crises on vulnerable populations.","author":"Satveer Dhillon","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"9526575206ae9e63293dc6bcb9470c50c5adf2c98578df1aba73270d09f2dc21","category":"Environment"}
