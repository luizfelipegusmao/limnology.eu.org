{"title":"Influence of Spirulina Extract on Physiological, Qualitative, and Productive Traits of Four Sugarcane Genotypes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0994/v1","date":1718347310000,"content":"The study was conducted at El-Sabahia Research Station (latitude 31°12'N, longitude 29°58'E), Alexandria, Egypt, to evaluate the effect of Spirulina platensis algae extract on the growth, yield, and juice quality of four sugarcane genotypes during the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons. The sugarcane genotypes tested (G.T. 54-9, G. 2003-47, G. 84-47, and G. 2004-27) were treated with four concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%) of Spirulina algae extract (SE) during their development as plant cane and first ratoon crops. At harvest, the growth, physiological, and juice quality characteristics were documented, while chlorophyll content was measured 210 days after sowing. Spraying canes with 0.2% of SE was the most effective treatment in enhancing all of the evaluated characteristics compared to those left without SE. Cane yield was more closely correlated with stalk weight (r = 0.88), followed by leaf area index (r = 0.82), chlorophyll content (r = 0.82), stalk length (r = 0.76), and number of tillers (r = 0.73), while recoverable sugar yield was closely correlated (P &lt; 0.01) with sugar content% (r = 0.76).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1070473cd6afc91e89658956024d023f941d8e4cbb32dfbb9d2930e3d031e1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
