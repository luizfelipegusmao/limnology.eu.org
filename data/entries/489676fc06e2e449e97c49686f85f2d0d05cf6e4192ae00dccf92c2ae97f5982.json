The establishment of episodic memory signatures may allow for biomarker mapping to inform diagnostic research and practiceMethods: Retrospective longitudinal mixed methods and cross-sectional effect size, to compare group differences, are applied to the Craft-21 memory scores from the preclinical years of persons who later developed AD (pre-AD) dementia , n = 175 with 112 females and 63 males. Their scores are  compared to cognitively normal controls (non-AD) n = 6,814 with 4,232 females and 2,582 males. Pre-AD and non-AD groups are further analyzed by biological sex. The dataset is from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center funded by NIA/NIH Grant U24 AG072122.  Results: The pre-AD episodic memory scores decreased  an average of -.510, p &lt; .001 versus (vs.) the non-AD annual increase by .127, p &lt; .001. The first Cohen’s d =  .482  and last Cohen’s d =  976, p &lt; .001.  The pre-AD females had an average annual decreased of -.762,  p &lt; .001 vs. non-AD females increase of .117, p &lt; .001. The first Cohen’s d = .576 and last Cohen’s d = 1.133, p &lt;.001.  The pre-AD males increased every year by .185,  p = .996 vs. the non-AD males annual increase of .185, p &lt; .001. The first Cohen’s d = 1.054 decreased by the last year to Cohen’s d = .680, p &lt;.001Discussion:  Distinct decline in episodic memory occurs for pre-AD females, but there is not a significant change in pre-AD males. However, the effect size difference between both pre-AD and non-AD groups suggests biomarker mapping in conjunction with memory trajectories may be feasible to determine potential navigational risks as well as biological and cognitive preclinical AD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"489676fc06e2e449e97c49686f85f2d0d05cf6e4192ae00dccf92c2ae97f5982","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
