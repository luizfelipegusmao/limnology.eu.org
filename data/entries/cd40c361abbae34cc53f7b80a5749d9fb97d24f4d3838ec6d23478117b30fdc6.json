Ossip</p>\r\n\r\nEvidence from <i>in vitro</i> and animal models has identified the pulmonary toxicity of flavors in electronic cigarettes (ECIGs); however, less is known from epidemiological studies about the effects of flavors in the respiratory health. This study examined the longitudinal association between exposure to ECIGs flavors and nocturnal dry cough among ECIGs users. A secondary analysis of data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (2014â€“2019) was conducted. The study population included adults who provided information (n = 18,925) for a total of 38,638 observations. Weighted-incidence estimates and weighted- generalized estimating equation models were performed to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations. The weighted incidence proportion (WIP) of nocturnal dry cough was significantly higher among current (WIP:16.6%; 95%CI 10.5, 21.2) and former fruit flavored ECIGs users (WIP:16.6%; 95%CI 11.3, 21.9) as compared to non-ECIGs users (WIP:11.1%; 95%CI 10.6, 11.6). Current ECIGs users of fruit flavors showed 40% higher risk of reporting cough than non-ECIGs users (aRR:1.40, 95%CI 1.01, 1.94). Former ECIGs users of multiple flavors and other flavors had 300% and 66% higher risk to develop cough, respectively (aRR:3.33, 95%CI 1.51, 7.34 and aRR:1.66, 95%CI 1.0.9, 2.51), relative to non-ECIGs users. We observed a significantly higher risk of developing nocturnal dry cough in the past 12 months in current and former ECIGs users of fruit flavors and in former ECIGs users of multiple flavors. To the extent that cough may serve as an early indicator of respiratory inflammation and potential disease risk, the association between ECIGs use and cough raises potential concerns.","author":"Zahira Quinones Tavarez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cd40c361abbae34cc53f7b80a5749d9fb97d24f4d3838ec6d23478117b30fdc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
