{"title":"Lactate dehydrogenase can be used for differential diagnosis to identify patients with severe polytrauma with or without chest injury—A retrospective study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308228","date":1722520800000,"content":"<p>by Weining Yan, Felix Bläsius, Tabea Wahl, Frank Hildebrand, Elizabeth Rosado Balmayor, Johannes Greven, Klemens Horst</p>\r\nBackground <p>Chest injury is an important factor regarding the prognosis of patients with polytrauma (PT), and the rapid diagnosis of chest injury is of utmost importance. Therefore, the current study focused on patients’ physiology and laboratory findings to quickly identify PT patients with chest injury.</p> Method <p>Data on 64 PT patients treated at a trauma center level I between June 2020 and August 2021 were retrospectively collected. The patients were divided into a PT group without chest injury (Group A) and a PT group including chest injury (Group B). The relationship between chest injury and the patients’ baseline characteristics and biochemical markers was analyzed.</p> Results <p>Heart rate, respiration rate, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, glutamate oxaloacetate aminotransferase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), leucocytes, hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, urine output, lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in groups A and B exhibited statistically significant differences at certain time points. Multifactorial analysis showed that blood LDH levels at admission were associated with chest injury (P = 0.039, CI 95% 1.001, 1.022).</p> Conclusion <p>LDH may be a promising indicator for screening for the presence of chest injury in patients with severe polytrauma.</p>","author":"Weining Yan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a7ff2ebdfe9b9f8a21ddfe502e3d535ab3d0da41472a73b275799cfd61aca169","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
