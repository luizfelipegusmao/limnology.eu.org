Many advances have centered on studying the intricate changes occurring at the atomic scale with high voltage, and usually aberration corrected, scanning transmission electron microscopes (AC-STEM). As revolutionary as these findings have been to understanding materials at high temperatures, many aspects of morphology and surface changes cannot be directly observed using these instruments. Advantageously, advances related to in situ scanning electron microscopes (SEM)/STEM, as well as improvements to imaging resolution, have led to systems using secondary electron (SE) detectors that can probe morphology changes occurring at larger length scales while also capturing the fine details of surface alterations, such as the Hitachi SU9000 SEM/STEM. Furthermore, the STEM capabilities of such a system means that internal structural changes can be monitored simultaneously with the bright field (BF) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detectors. The use of in situ SEM/STEM in thermal studies is enhanced by its capacity to operate in SE, BF, and HAADF modes, enabling three distinct applications: 1) capturing the details of surface alterations and correlating them with internal structural transformations; 2) serving as a screening tool to identify critical points in structural evolution prior to employing an aberration-corrected imaging system; 3) imaging thick regions of samples using the SE mode.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"163b3d9bd2fdada29771e86d18b2150e062f67eba1481c2e615a0ce0e8eaf76e","category":"Environment"}
