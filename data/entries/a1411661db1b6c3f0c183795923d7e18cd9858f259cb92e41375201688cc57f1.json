{"title":"Comparative metabolomic analysis reveals nutritional properties and pigmentation mechanism of tea‐scented rosehips","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13224?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The fruits of the genus <i>Rosa</i>, commonly known as rosehips, have attracted significant attention owing to their rich content of various bioactive compounds. However, their utility is generally secondary to the ornamental appeal of their flowers. This study aimed to explore the quality differences among tea-scented rosehips found in Yunnan, China, including those of <i>Rosa odorata</i> var. <i>odorata</i> (RO), <i>Rosa odorata</i> var. <i>gigantea</i> (RG), and <i>Rosa yangii</i> (RY). Morphological characteristics, chemical composition, and antioxidant activity of their fruits were evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The study revealed significant variability in composition and biological activities based on fruit color. RO exhibited the highest levels of polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and vitamin C, with the strongest antioxidant activity (10.99 μmol Trolox·g<sup>−1</sup>), followed by RG (7.91 μmol Trolox·g<sup>−1</sup>) and RY (6.52 μmol Trolox·g<sup>−1</sup>). This supports RO's potential as a functional food source. Untargeted metabolomics identified and quantified 502 metabolites, with flavonoids (171) and phenolic acids (147) as the main metabolites. The differential metabolites among the fruits are primarily enriched for flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. Insights into color formation supported the role of anthocyanins, flavones, and flavonols in fruit color variation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Tea-scented rosehips offer vibrant colors and high nutritional value with potent biological activities. <i>Rosa odorata</i> var. <i>odorata</i> stands out as a functional food source owing to its rich bioactive compounds. These findings lay the groundwork for utilizing rosehips in functional foods, health supplements, and food additives, emphasizing the practical and beneficial applications of <i>Rosa</i> spp. independent of their ornamental value. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Meichun Zhou, \nYanlin Sun, \nLe Luo, \nHuitang Pan, \nQixiang Zhang, \nChao Yu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a1411661db1b6c3f0c183795923d7e18cd9858f259cb92e41375201688cc57f1","category":"Environment"}
