In October 2018, we examined the isotopic values of fin and muscle tissue of <i>Gymnocypris chui</i> (<i>n</i> = 19) and <i>Gymnocypris scleracanthus</i> (<i>n</i> = 28) from Lake Langcuo of the Tibetan Plateau of China to determine whether non-lethally collected pectoral fin tissue could substitute for muscle tissue in stable isotope analysis. The results showed positive relationships (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.7) between fin and muscle tissue for both <sup>δ</sup>15N and <sup>δ</sup>13C of <i>G. chui</i> and <i>G. scleracanthus</i>. This study demonstrates the utility of a non-lethally technique to analyze time-integrated dietary habits and should be applicable to other fish species.</p>","author":"Zepeng Zhang, \nBo Ma, \nHongyu Jin, \nXing Jin, \nLei Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"3f975da73e37f0c04af6ded2bd4e88d3bf761b96820c78b1b1db436082e550d4","category":"Environment"}
