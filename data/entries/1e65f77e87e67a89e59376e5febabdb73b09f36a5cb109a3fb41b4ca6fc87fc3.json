{"title":"Spatial patterns in occupancy and density of larval lampreys in freshwater habitats restored to a Stage 0 condition","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4232?af=R","date":1709626003000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We examined occupancy and density of larval lampreys (<i>Entosphenus tridentatus</i> and <i>Lampetra</i> spp.) in two rivers in Oregon (USA) restored to a Stage 0 condition 1–5 years prior, using a multiscale occupancy model and a zero-inflated Poisson mixture model. We sampled lampreys using backpack electrofishing in randomly distributed, paired, 1-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats and recorded environmental data. Probabilities of occupancy and density were higher when water velocity was low, the substrate was noncompacted, and sediment was dominated by fines (&lt;4 mm). At mean water depth (0.34 m) and velocity (0.09 m/s), estimated densities in occupied quadrats were 4.8 lampreys/m<sup>2</sup> (95%: 3.4–6.9) when the substrate was compacted, and fines were not dominant, and 21.1 lampreys/m<sup>2</sup> (95%: 17.7–25.3) when the substrate was noncompacted and fines were dominant. Probabilities of detecting occupancy in a 1-m<sup>2</sup> quadrat sampled by backpack electrofishing were 0.76 (95%: 0.64–0.87) when captured after visual observation and 0.80 (95%: 0.71–0.88) with blind sweeps (i.e., constantly moving the net regardless of observation). The probability of capturing a single lamprey in a quadrat sampled by blind sweeps was 0.32 (95%: 0.27–0.37). Sampling in paired 1-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats facilitated concurrent examination of patterns in occupancy and density while accounting for capture probability, which could aid temporal monitoring of restored habitats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document occupancy and estimate densities of larval lampreys in habitats that underwent valley floor restoration to Stage 0. We observed both lamprey genera within 5 years of restoration. Aquatic restoration that increases low-velocity, noncompacted, fine sediment habitats could benefit lampreys.</p>","author":"Julianne E.
