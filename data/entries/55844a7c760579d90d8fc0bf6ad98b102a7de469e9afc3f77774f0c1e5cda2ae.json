{"title":"Prevalence of mycotoxins in raw materials and infant flours produced in Burkina Faso","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1840/v1","date":1721745825000,"content":"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites secreted mainly by molds. The contamination of the raw materials used in the production of infant flours by these mycotoxins presents a risk to the health of infants and young children who are the main consumers of these flours. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of mycotoxins in raw materials and in infant flours from Burkina Faso. Analyses were carried out on 39 samples of raw materials and 26 samples of infant flour collected from artisanal and semi-industrial production units. The contents of AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, FB1 and OTA were determined by LCMS/MS. The results indicated a variability in the contents of total aflatoxins (AFs), FB1 and OTA within the samples of raw materials. Also, 79.49% of the raw materials contaminated by total aflatoxins were above the maximum limit value and 61.54% of these raw materials had AFB1 levels above the recommended limit value. The highest levels of AFs were found in peanuts and maize. OTA was very present in soybean samples. The occurrence of mycotoxins was highly variable in infant flours within the same production unit (p &amp;lt; 0.001). and between different units (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Infant flours produced by artisanal production units had higher AFB1 contents than those produced by semi-industrial units. The need to control these mycotoxins is essential in order to considerably reduce their contamination and exposure in infants and young children and to preserve their health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55844a7c760579d90d8fc0bf6ad98b102a7de469e9afc3f77774f0c1e5cda2ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
