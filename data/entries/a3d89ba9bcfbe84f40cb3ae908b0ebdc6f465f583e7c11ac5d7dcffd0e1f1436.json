{"title":"Work Disparities and the Health of Nurses in Long-Term Care: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0290/v1","date":1725446853000,"content":"Work disparities experienced by nurses in long-term care (LTC) can impact the retention, well-being, and health of this workforce. Despite the significant impact disparities experienced by nurses have on the workforce and LTC sector, a review of the available literature on work disparities has not been conducted on work disparities experienced by nurses in LTC. Consequently, this scoping review aimed to explore the nature and extent of research on meso-level work disparities experienced by nurses in LTC and how such disparities are linked with nurse health and well-being. Five databases were searched: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), and CINAHL (EBSCO host). Of the 5,652 articles retrieved, 16 studies published between 1997 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria. The average number of work disparities within each study was 3.06 (minimum = 1, maximum = 6, SD = 1.62). Types of work disparities across the 16 studies were work opportunities (n = 19), work treatment (n = 18), job security (n = 8), and work compensation (n = 8). Only four articles investigated the association of a work disparity with a variable of health and well-being. Future research on how macro-level disparities intersect with meso-level work disparities may inform a contextual understanding of how disparities transpire in the work of nurses in LTC. Studies are required to address the gaps in knowledge regarding how work disparities negatively influence the health of nurses to inform better retention, well-being, and health of nurses in LTC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3d89ba9bcfbe84f40cb3ae908b0ebdc6f465f583e7c11ac5d7dcffd0e1f1436","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
