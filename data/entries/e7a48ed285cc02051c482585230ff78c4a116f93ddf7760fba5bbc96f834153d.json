{"title":"Toxicological Qualities and Detoxification Trends of Fruit Byproducts for Valorization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0213/v1","date":1725418140000,"content":"The abundant and renewable resources from fruit byproducts are getting emphasis on their valorization. These byproducts are suspected of possible toxications during cultivation, harvesting, transporting, preservation, or processing. Hence, presenting scientific overviews of the toxicological qualities and detoxification trends of these byproducts is critical to implicating their possible valorization. This review emphasized the toxicological qualities of byproducts from fruits for which the maximum global production occurred in 2022. In this review, heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Hg), mycotoxins, toxicant organic compounds, anti-nutritional factors, and pesticide/fungicide residues of the selected fruit byproducts were discussed. Current trends to reduce possible toxicants of these byproducts during their valorization were emphasized. Novel functional foods valorized from these fruit byproducts and future perspectives of detoxification were also focused on in this review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7a48ed285cc02051c482585230ff78c4a116f93ddf7760fba5bbc96f834153d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
