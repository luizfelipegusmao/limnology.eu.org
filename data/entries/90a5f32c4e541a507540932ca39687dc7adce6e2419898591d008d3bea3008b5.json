{"title":"A Method to Reverse Epimutations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1263/v2","date":1726542256000,"content":"For a number of reasons, a curative treatment for most chronic diseases is still unrealized [2–4] and the incidence of many chronic diseases is rapidly increasing [5–9].  A new model is offered as a solution; that being the individualized diagnosis of homeostasis, leading to the correction of epimutations. Homeostasis diagnosis and epimutation correction, HDEC. Individuals with chronic diseases are increasingly being defined by their epimutation signatures [10,11]. Modern innovations in toxicogenomic studies are also becoming more accurate in their ability to identify the unique epigenetic signature of each toxin [12–14]. Hormesis studies (over 5,000) [15] suggest a universal principle, that a small dose is always a stimulant [16–18].These three facts present an opportunity; a method to diagnose and reverse chronic disease tendencies.  This new model requires a paradigm shift in our understanding of disease origins: that dysfunctions in homeostasis [19,20] are the primary and deepest level of chronic disease causation. This is the level where the diagnosis needs to be made and where the corrections need to take place [21].","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90a5f32c4e541a507540932ca39687dc7adce6e2419898591d008d3bea3008b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
