Analysis by the standard Fabrizio Caputo approach established the model is well-posed and investigation on the stability of the model, Anthrax-free equilibrium as connected to the basic reproduction number R0","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04536538c865caef6b2c70639fa8cc42ef481a374ecb02547df1b7bd932019c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
