The LJE has been attributed to large nutrient fluxes, an increase in the size of the biosphere, a reorganization of the global carbon cycle, and oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, significant debate remains about its genesis, synchroneity, global-versus-local extent, and role in atmospheric oxygenation. Here we review existing models and mechanisms suggested for the LJE and analyze a compilation of ∼9,400 δ<sup>13</sup>C<span>carb</span> and associated contextual data. These data call into question the interpretation of the LJE as a globally synchronous carbon isotope excursion and suggest that any model for the LJE must account for both the absence of a clearly defined initiation and termination of the excursion and a facies-dependent expression of <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment.\n</p><ul>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>The Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) continues to challenge current understandings of the carbon cycle.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Understanding this excursion is critical for reconstructing biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric oxygenation through Earth history.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Some evidence indicates local rather than global changes in δ<sup>13</sup>C<span>DIC</span> and raises the possibility of asynchronous, local excursions.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Resolving whether the LJE was globally synchronous or asynchronous is essential for discriminating between different models.\n</li>\n</ul><p></p></div>","author":"Malcolm S.W.
