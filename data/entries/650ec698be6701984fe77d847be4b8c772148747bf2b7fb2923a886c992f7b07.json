However, common biotechnologies such as traditional transgenesis or genome editing do not provide an ideal solution, whereas transgenic crops free of selection markers such as cisgenic/intragenic crops might be suitable. In this study, after cloning and functional verification of the <span>Rcr1</span> gene for resistance to clubroot (<span>Plasmodiophora brassicae</span>), we confirmed that the genes <span>Rcr1</span>, <span>Rcr2</span>, <span>Rcr4</span>, and <span>CRa</span> from <span>Brassica rapa</span> crops and the resistance gene from <span>B. napus</span> oilseed rape cv. ‘Mendel’ on chromosome A03 were identical in their coding regions. We also determined that <span>Rcr1</span> has a wide distribution in <span>Brassica</span> breeding materials and renders potent resistance against multiple representative clubroot strains in Canada. We then modified a CRISPR/Cas9-based cisgenic vector system and found that it enabled the fast breeding of selection-marker-free transgenic crops with add-on traits, with selection-marker-free canola (<span>B. napus</span>) germplasms with <span>Rcr1</span>-rendered stable resistance to clubroot disease being successfully developed within 2 years. In the <span>B. napus</span> background, the intragenic vector system was able to remove unwanted residue sequences from the final product with high editing efficiency, and off-target mutations were not detected. Our study demonstrates the potential of applying this breeding strategy to other crops that can be transformed by <span>Agrobacterium</span>. Following the streamlined working procedure, intragenic germplasms can be developed within two generations, which could significantly reduce the breeding time and labor compared to traditional introgression whilst still achieving comparable or even better breeding results.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"650ec698be6701984fe77d847be4b8c772148747bf2b7fb2923a886c992f7b07","category":"Environment"}
