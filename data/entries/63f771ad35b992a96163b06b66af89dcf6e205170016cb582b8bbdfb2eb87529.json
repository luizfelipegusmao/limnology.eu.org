Most requirements analysis methods focus on expressing the requirements and ignore the uncertainty inherent in the process of requirements elicitation. This paper build on the work presented by the author in [1,10], where a method for requirements elicitation from multiple sources was presented. This paper gives an overview of the method and presents detailed case studies. The cases studies were designed to illustrate different aspects of the Source Control Method and to determine its feasibility and its practical utility as a problem investigation and information validation technique","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63f771ad35b992a96163b06b66af89dcf6e205170016cb582b8bbdfb2eb87529","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
