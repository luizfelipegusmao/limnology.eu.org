A pilot-scale hybrid treatment wetland (TW) equipped with local zeolite was employed, comprising a tidal flow TW and a horizontal subsurface flow TW. This system was efficient in treating pharmaceutical wastewater with removal efficiencies of 61.4%, 52.6%, 60.1%, and 61.9% for chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and NH<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>-N, respectively. The final effluent met Jordanian standards for the reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation (Class B). Five pharmaceuticals, namely, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lincomycin, and trimethoprim, demonstrated nearly completed removal (93.6–99.9%). Moderated removal performances (59.2–68.2%) were observed for two compounds, flumequine and sulfaquinoxaline. However, three pharmaceuticals, namely, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and sulfadimidine, showed limited removal performances (1.1–20.5%). This study supported the feasibility of using nature-based solutions for treating pharmaceutical wastewater and highlighted that future studies are required to optimize this strategy for removing a broader range of pharmaceuticals.</p>","author":"Othman Al‐Mashaqbeh, \nLayal Alsalhi, \nLana Salaymeh, \nTao Lyu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"b5dc7e099d19beecd918d9ea4bd27d7d243be90679e58c6c0fb0b41c148c686c","category":"Environment"}
