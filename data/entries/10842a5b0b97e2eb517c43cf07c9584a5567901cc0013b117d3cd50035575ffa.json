This study provides a high-resolution map of the global distribution of tree wood density at the 0.01° (~1 km) spatial resolution, derived from four decision trees machine learning models using a global database of 28,822 tree-level wood density measurements. An ensemble of four top-performing models combined with eight cross-validation strategies shows great consistency, providing wood density patterns with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. The global pattern shows lower wood density values in northern and northwestern Europe, Canadian forest regions and slightly higher values in Siberia forests, western United States, and southern China. In contrast, tropical regions, especially wet tropical areas, exhibit high wood density. Climatic predictors explain 49%–63% of spatial variations, followed by vegetation characteristics (25%–31%) and edaphic properties (11%–16%). Notably, leaf type (evergreen vs. deciduous) and leaf habit type (broadleaved vs. needleleaved) are the most dominant individual features among all selected predictive covariates. Wood density tends to be higher for angiosperm broadleaf trees compared to gymnosperm needleleaf trees, particularly for evergreen species. The distributions of wood density categorized by leaf types and leaf habit types have good agreement with the features observed in wood density measurements. This global map quantifying wood density distribution can help improve accurate predictions of forest carbon stocks, providing deeper insights into ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling such as forest vulnerability to hydraulic and thermal stresses in the context of future climate change.</p>","author":"Hui Yang, \nSiyuan Wang, \nRackhun Son, \nHoontaek Lee, \nVitus Benson, \nWeijie Zhang, \nYahai Zhang, \nYuzhen Zhang, \nJens Kattge, \nGerhard Boenisch, \nDmitry Schepaschenko, \nZbigniew Karaszewski, \nKrzysztof Stereńczak, \nÁlvaro Moreno‐Martínez, \nCristina Nabais, \nPhilippe Birnbaum, \nGhislain Vieilledent, \nUlrich Weber, \nNuno Carvalhais","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"10842a5b0b97e2eb517c43cf07c9584a5567901cc0013b117d3cd50035575ffa","category":"Environment"}
