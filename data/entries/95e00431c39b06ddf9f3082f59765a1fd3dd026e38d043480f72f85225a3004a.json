{"title":"Birth-Death Processes with Two-type Catastrophes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0545/v1","date":1712584958000,"content":"This paper concentrates on the general birth-death processes with two different types of catastrophes. The Laplace transform of transition probability function for birth-death processes with two-type catastrophes are is successfully expressed with the Laplace transform of transition probability function of the birth-death processes without catastrophe. The first effective catastrophe occurrence time is considered. The Laplace transform of its probability density function, expectation and variance are obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95e00431c39b06ddf9f3082f59765a1fd3dd026e38d043480f72f85225a3004a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
