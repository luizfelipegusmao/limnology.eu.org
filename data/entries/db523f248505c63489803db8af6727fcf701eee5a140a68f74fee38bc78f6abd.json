{"title":"Load-Aware and Priority Adaptive Traffic Congestion Control Method in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1728/v1","date":1719283854000,"content":"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) are a subset of mobile ad hoc networks used to communicate between vehicles and infrastructure. During vehicular congestion communication, nodes compete to acquire channels, causing the channels to become congested. The congestion on the vehicle network results in increased delay and packet loss, resulting in reduced VANET performance. To address this problem, we developed a load-aware and priority adaptive traffic congestion control method in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The proposed scheme identifies less-congested road segments based on the network's load and reduces traffic congestion by suggesting other routes between nearby roadside units (RSUs). This research aims to improve the efficiency of the vehicular environment by utilizing the movement of vehicles with (RSUs) and sharing the traffic load between them. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in reducing congestion and enhancing the overall performance of VANETs. To validate the proposed algorithm, we have implemented and tested the proposed algorithm using Network Simulator 3 (NS3) for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication scenarios and computed the performance of the algorithm on different parameters of the network. The simulation result of the proposed load aware and priority adaptive traffic congestion control method in VANET improved the packet delivery ratio, packet lost ratio, and end-to-end delay by 96%, 4.1%, and 1102 milliseconds, when compared to TDCCA value of 92%, 5.7%, and 1154 milliseconds, respectively","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db523f248505c63489803db8af6727fcf701eee5a140a68f74fee38bc78f6abd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
