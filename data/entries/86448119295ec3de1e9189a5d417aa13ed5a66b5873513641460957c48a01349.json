{"title":"Development of Reconfigurable High-Frequency Devices Using Liquid Crystal in Substrate-Integrated Groove Gap Waveguide Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2560/v1","date":1722585818000,"content":"This article presents the theoretical study, numerical simulation and the fabrication of a phase shifter and stub resonator in microstrip ridge gap waveguide (MGCW) technology with the use of liquid crystal (LC) in its substrate as a reconfigurable material. The phase shifter and the stub resonator are filled with LC and thanks to LC's dielectric anisotropy properties, the phase shift and resonance response can be easily controlled using an external electric or magnetic bias field. The phase shifter was designed to operate in the range of 10 to 20 GHz and the resonator was designed to operate in the range of 7.8 to 8.8 GHz. The phase shifter's insertion losses, associated with both parallel and perpendicular LC's permittivity, as well as the phase response were computed and measured. Finally, the figure of merit (FoM) was extracted. The resonator's frequency response, associated with both parallel and perpendicular LC's permittivity, was computed. The resonator's frequency responses, provided different polarization voltages, were measured and compared to the simulation results. The technological issues were discussed. The good agreement between simulation and measurement results establishes this technology as a viable approach to the development of RF reconfigurable devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86448119295ec3de1e9189a5d417aa13ed5a66b5873513641460957c48a01349","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
