{"title":"Seismic Capacity Evaluation of Reinforced Concrete Moment-Resisting Frames with Steel Damper Columns using Incremental Critical Pseudo-Multi Impulse Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0695/v1","date":1715363723000,"content":"Steel damper columns (SDCs) are energy-dissipating members that are suitable for reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames (MRFs) and those often used for multistory housing. In a previous study, an energy-based prediction procedure for the peak and cumulative response of an RC frame building with SDCs was proposed. In this procedure, the accuracy of the equivalent velocity of the maximum momentary input energy (VΔE1*)–peak equivalent displacement (D1*max) relationship is essential for improved prediction. In this article, the seismic capacity curve (VΔE1*–D1*max relationship) of RC MRFs with and without SDCs is evaluated using incremental critical pseudo-multi impulse analysis (ICPMIA). In the ICPMIA, which is based on a study by Takewaki and coauthors, the structure is subjected to various intensities of critical pseudo-multi impulsive lateral force. An ICPMIA of four 8- and 16-story RC MRFs with and without SDCs is performed to obtain their structural behaviors under various intensities of pulsive input. Then, the seismic capacity curve obtained from the ICMPIA results are compared with the predicted results based on the simplified equations. The main findings of this article are as follows. (i) The seismic capacity curve of RC MRFs without SDCs strongly depends on the number of impulsive lateral forces (Np). As Np increases, the seismic capacity decreases. The predicted seismic capacity curve severely underestimates that obtained from the ICMPIA in the case of large Np. This trend is notable when the level of pinching behavior in the RC members is severe. (ii) In the case of an RC MRF with SDCs, however, the influence of Np on its seismic capacity curve is small. The predicted seismic capacity curve agrees very well with that obtained from the ICMPIA. The influence of the level of pinching behavior in RC members on the seismic capacity curve is small.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ec1f08df42422c5901486afd4f11b1955a3e397c2cd63ae0b505e8932ee8edf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
