{"title":"How Accurately Topsoil Texture Is Shown on Agricultural Soil Maps? A Case Study of Eleven Fields Located in Poland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1110/v1","date":1726301615000,"content":"The agricultural soil maps (ASMs) showing the agricultural land of Poland were prepared in 1:5000 scale in 1960s’ and 1970s’. These maps show land suitability group, soil type and soil texture (ST) to a depth of about 150cm. Nowadays, these maps are being digitalized and might be a basis for the preparation of modern soil maps at local, regional, national and international level. The agreement between the ST of topsoil derived from ASMs and recently evaluated for eleven fields located in three voivodeships (regions) of Poland was studied. The study of soil considered the examination of soil profiles or augerings and laboratory analysis of the ST. The agreement between soil status in the field and according to maps was field-specific. Complete agreement (purity) within the field was assessed for 5-79% of ST classes and for 23-100% of agronomic categories (ACs) – a groupings of similar ST classes. However, the averaged agreement, which treated adjacent ST classes as having partial agreement, varied from 37 to 88% for ST classes and from 61 to 100% for the ACs among studied fields. These results indicate on the variable quality of the information shown on the ASMs and on the necessity of improvement of these maps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"130cf9559ff2a74bc7e4de507ea424c8f3b7918a86baeacb96d1ef9ed9cccab2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
