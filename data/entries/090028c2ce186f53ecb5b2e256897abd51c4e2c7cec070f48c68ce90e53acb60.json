This study explores the impact of digital technologies on inventory management, focusing on the adoption of IoT sensors, RFID tags, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based systems. Through a qualitative research approach encompassing interviews with industry professionals and secondary data analysis, the study examines key themes including enhanced inventory visibility, improved accuracy, advanced demand forecasting, and streamlined supply chain collaboration. Findings reveal that digital technologies significantly enhance inventory visibility by providing real-time tracking and data integration capabilities. This facilitates accurate inventory monitoring and decision-making, reducing errors and optimizing inventory levels to meet fluctuating demand effectively. AI-driven analytics and machine learning models emerge as pivotal tools for predictive demand forecasting, enabling businesses to anticipate market trends and adjust inventory strategies accordingly. Additionally, cloud-based systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) foster improved communication and coordination among supply chain partners, enhancing overall operational efficiency. Despite these benefits, challenges such as system integration complexities, high implementation costs, data quality management, cybersecurity risks, and regulatory compliance issues are prevalent. Successful adoption of digital inventory management solutions requires strategic planning, investment in technology infrastructure, and organizational readiness to navigate these challenges effectively. This study contributes to the understanding of how digital transformation reshapes inventory management practices, offering insights for researchers and practitioners alike to leverage digital technologies for enhanced supply chain performance and competitive advantage","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"090028c2ce186f53ecb5b2e256897abd51c4e2c7cec070f48c68ce90e53acb60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
