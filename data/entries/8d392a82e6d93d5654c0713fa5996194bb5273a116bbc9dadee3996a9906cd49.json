Understanding how these reproductive strategies are used is important for determining the ecological mechanisms that structure timing of reproduction and that drive interannual population fluctuations in animals.\n\nWe gathered a reproductive dataset for five small mammal species over a 12-year period in Northeastern USA during which six masting events of American beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>) and eastern hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) occurred. Masting created alternate years where seeds were either available late (masting year) or early (cached from the previous year) in the breeding season. The small mammal species differed in reliance on seeds and overwintering strategies. We quantified the diet using stable isotopes and recorded reproduction timing, proportion breeding and litter size in females and testes size in males.\n\nTiming of seed availability minimally affected litter size but strongly affected proportion breeding and timing of reproduction. During masting years (late seed availability), a higher proportion of females reproduced, with breeding taking place later in the season (lactation timed with peak seed availability), although the delay was restricted in <i>Napaeozapus insignis</i>, an obligate hibernator. After a fall mast, cached seeds were used as capital in the following spring (early seed availability) to support a litter that, depending on the species, occurred 24–79 days sooner than a mast year. No late-season reproduction occurred in years with early seed availability except for <i>Myodes gapperi</i> which produced a second litter, likely financed by fungal consumption. Males also showed strong responses to seed availability, mirroring female reproduction with testes size staying constant in years with late seed availability and sharply decreasing over the breeding season in years with early seed availability.\n\nOur results highlight that although photoperiod and temperature broadly set bounds of the breeding season in temperate environments, resource availability influences the reproductive strategies that species use, which in turn alters reproductive timing and can drive large inter-annual population fluctuations. Differences in overwintering strategies and diet may further modulate reproductive timing and output relative to resource pulses.\n</p>","author":"Ryan B. Stephens, \nJoshua S.
