{"title":"Temperature Dependence of the Thermo-Optic Coefficient of GeO2-doped Silica Glass Fiber","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0272/v1","date":1719995966000,"content":"In this paper we derived an expression that allows the determination of the thermo-optic coefficient of weakly-guiding germanium-doped silica fibers, based on the thermal behavior of optical fiber devices, such as, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). The calculations rely on the full knowledge of the fiber parameters and on the temperature sensitivity of FBGs. In order to validate the results, we estimated the thermo-optic coefficient of bulk GeO2 glass at 293 K and 1.55 m to be 18.3x10-6 K-1. The determination of this value required to calculate a correction factor which is based on the knowledge of the thermal expansion coefficient of the fiber core, the Pockels’ coefficients (p11=0.125, p12=0.258 and p44=-0.0662) and the Poisson ratio (=0.161) of the SMF-28 fiber. To achieve that goal, we estimated the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient of GeO2 and we discussed the dispersion and temperature dependence of Pockels’ coefficients. We have presented expressions for the dependence of the longitudinal and transverse acoustic velocities on the GeO2 concentration used to calculate the Poisson ratio. We have also discussed the dispersion of the photoelastic constant. An estimate for the temperature dependence of the thermo-optic coefficient of bulk GeO2 glass is presented for the 200-300 K temperature range.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb293bde58d28884cc2419eb86a0184b781911180a5965b4fc64a9ff1a8efbfb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
