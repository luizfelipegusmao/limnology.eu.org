{"title":"Barriers to USMLE Step-1 accommodations: Students with Type 1 Diabetes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304784","date":1718719200000,"content":"<p>by Emily L. Serata, Emily J. Noonan, Kristina H. Petersen</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Students who earn their medical doctorate (MD) in the U.S. must pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step-1. The application process for students with disabilities who seek Step-1 accommodations can be arduous, barrier-ridden, and can impose a significant burden that may have long-lasting effects. We sought to understand the experiences of medical students with Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) who applied for Step-1 accommodations.</p> Methods <p>A Qualtrics survey was administered to students enrolled in Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME)-accredited MD programs who disclosed having a primary diagnosis of T1D. Basic counts and qualitative inductive analyses were conducted.</p> Results <p>Of the 21 surveys sent, 16 (76.2%) participants responded. Of the 16 respondents, 11 (68.8%) applied for USMLE Step-1 accommodations, whereas 5 (31.2%) did not. Of the 11 who applied for accommodations, 7 (63.6%) received the accommodations requested, while 4 (36.4%) did not. Of those who received the accommodations requested, 5/7 (71.4%) experienced at least one diabetes-related barrier on exam day. Of those who did not apply for Step-1 accommodations, 4/5 (80%) participants reported experiencing at least one diabetes-related barrier on exam day. Overall, 11/16 (68.8%) students experienced barriers on exam day with or without accommodations. Qualitative analysis revealed themes among participants about their experience with the process: frustration, anger, stress, and some areas of general satisfaction.</p> Conclusions <p>This study reports the perceptions of students with T1D about barriers and inequities in the Step-1 accommodations application process. Students with and without accommodations encountered T1D-related obstacles on test day.</p>","author":"Emily L.
