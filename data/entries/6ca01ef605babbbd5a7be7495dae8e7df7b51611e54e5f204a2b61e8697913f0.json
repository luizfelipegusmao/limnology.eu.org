{"title":"Systematic Study of Reaction Conditions for Size Controlled Synthesis of Silica Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0025/v1","date":1725269638000,"content":"This study presents a reproducible and scalable method for synthesizing silica nanoparticles (SNPs) with controlled sizes below 200 nm, achieved by systematically varying three key reaction parameters: ammonium hydroxide concentration, water concentration, and temperature. SNPs with high monodispersity and controlled dimensions were produced by optimizing these factors. The results indicated a direct correlation between ammonium hydroxide concentration and particle size, while higher temperatures resulted in smaller particles with increased polydispersity. Water concentration also influenced particle size, with a quadratic relationship observed. This method provides a robust approach for tailoring SNP sizes, with significant implications for biomedical applications, particularly in drug delivery and diagnostics. Using eco-friendly solvents such as ethanol further enhances the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ca01ef605babbbd5a7be7495dae8e7df7b51611e54e5f204a2b61e8697913f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
