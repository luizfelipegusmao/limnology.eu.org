{"title":"Geomorphological assessment as basic complement of InSAR analysis for landslide processes understanding","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10346-024-02216-w","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Landslide research has benefited greatly from advances in remote sensing techniques. However, the recent increase in available data on land surface movement provided by InSAR techniques can lead to identifying only those areas that were active during data acquisition as hazardous, overlooking other potentially unsafe areas or neglecting landslide-specific geological settings in hazard assessments. Here, we present a case study that serves as a reminder for landslide researchers to carefully consider the geology and geomorphology of study areas where complex active movements are detected using InSAR technology. In an area extensively studied using InSAR and UAV-related techniques, we provide new insights by applying classical approaches. The area is the coastal stretch of La Herradura, and its importance lies in the fact that it has served as an illustrative example in the Product User Manual of the European Ground Motion Service, a platform that provides ground motion data on a European scale. Our approach is to revisit the area and carry out qualitative geological and geomorphological assessments supported by UAV surveys and GIS spatial analysis on a broader scale than previously published investigations. Our classical approach has yielded the following new observations, crucial for risk assessment and land management: active landslides identified by InSAR techniques since 2015 are bodies nested within large mass movements that affect entire slopes. A variety of processes contribute to slope dynamics, such as large slumps, marble rock spreading and block sliding, and surface rock falls and topples. The revised delineation of the landslide bodies reveals an area almost five times larger than previously mapped. These new findings in a well-known area highlight (1) the importance of updating and downscaling previous maps and (2) the ongoing importance of classical fieldwork and desk studies as basic complements to modern InSAR analyses.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"e2a47d689173e4dc66fd336b216b44e1993c5b2adb28d3cd5a9cb49a08b3c23f","category":"Environment"}
