{"title":"Unveiling the Potential of Phytocannabinoids: Exploring Marijuana&#039;s Lesser-Known Constituents for Neurological Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2224/v1","date":1727437248000,"content":"Cannabis sativa is known for producing over 120 distinct phytocannabinoids, with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most prominent, primarily in their acidic forms. Beyond Δ9-THC and CBD, a wide array of lesser-known phytocannabinoids, along with terpenes, flavonoids, and alkaloids, demonstrate diverse pharmacological activities, interacting with the endocannabinoid system (eCB) and other biological pathways. These com-pounds, characterized by phenolic structures and hydroxyl groups, possess lipophilic properties, allowing them to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively. Notably, their antioxidant, an-ti-inflammatory, and neuro-modulatory effects position them as promising agents in treating neu-rodegenerative disorders. While research has extensively examined the neuropsychiatric and neuroprotective effects of Δ9-THC, other minor phytocannabinoids remain underexplored. Given the well-established neuroprotective potential of CBD, there is growing interest in the therapeutic benefits of non-psychotropic minor phytocannabinoids (NMPs) in brain disorders. This review highlights the emerging research on these lesser-known compounds and their neuroprotective potential. It offers insights into their therapeutic applications across various major neurological conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2bdfec1fbf690c46879c5b5e26ae25386ed46d62ba7a8d5a4e96899a57b2a52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
