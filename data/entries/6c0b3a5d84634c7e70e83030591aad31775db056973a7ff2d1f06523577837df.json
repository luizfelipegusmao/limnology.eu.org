{"title":"Epidemiology of Pediatric Cardiomyopathy in a Mediterranean Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1075/v1","date":1715853308000,"content":"Background. Our knowledge regarding the epidemiology of pediatric cardiomyopathy is based on large national population studies reporting an annual incidence of 1 case per 100 000 children with a higher incidence observed in infancy and among selected populations. The aim is to document the epidemiology of pediatric cardiomyopathy in a Mediterranean population. Methods. Children younger than 18 years of age, living on the Mediterranean island of Crete, Greece and evaluated during 20 years since the establishment of tertiary pediatric cardiology services (2002-2022) were included in this retrospective study. Results. A total of 40 children were included, corresponding to an average annual incidence of pediatric cardiomyopathy of 1.59 cases (95% CI: 1.4-2,3) and a prevalence of 26 cases per 100.000 children. In decreasing order of frequency most cases corresponded to dilated cardiomyopathy (50%) followed by hypertrophic (42.5%), arrhythmogenic (5%) and restrictive (2.5%). An etiology was identified in 40%, including a genetic diagnosis in 22.5%. Conclusion. The incidence of pediatric cardiomyopathy in the Mediterranean island of Crete is higher compared with that reported previously for other Caucasian populations. Further study is needed to investigate the exact prevalence and specific genetic factors associated with the epidemiology of pediatric cardiomyopathy in Mediterranean populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c0b3a5d84634c7e70e83030591aad31775db056973a7ff2d1f06523577837df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
