To investigate its role in the glucose metabolism of common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio.</i> L), the <i>Ism1</i> sequence was cloned, and its expression and distribution in tissues were detected. In addition, we prepared and purified the recombinant Ism1 protein using the <i>E. coli</i> expression system and assessed changes in the expression of key genes related to glucose metabolism through both in vivo injection experiments and primary hepatocyte experiments in vitro. The results revealed that the open reading frame of <i>Ism1</i> was 1377 bp long, encoding 458 amino acids. Similarity analysis indicated that Ism1 exhibited a close evolutionary relationship with goldfish (<i>Carassius auratus</i>), sharing 98.35% amino acid similarity. <i>Ism1</i> was expressed in all tissues of common carp, with the highest level observed in the heart, followed by the gill, head kidney, and hepatopancreas. Distinct patterns of <i>Ism1</i> expression were identified during the oral glucose tolerance test and long-term high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet feeding experiments. In vivo studies demonstrated that the serum glucose concentration was reduced on treatment with Ism1, accompanied by a significant upregulation of mRNA levels for <i>gk</i>, <i>hk</i>, and <i>pfk</i> genes in hepatopancreas; conversely <i>pepck</i> and <i>g6pase</i> mRNA levels were significantly downregulated in the hepatopancreas under these conditions as well. Furthermore, our primary hepatocyte experiment confirmed that Ism1 could inhibit <i>pepck</i> and <i>g6pase</i> mRNA expression, while promoting <i>gk</i>, <i>hk</i>, and <i>pfk</i> mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, Ism1, in common carp, could participate in the glucose metabolism, which provides essential information for future studies on the function of Ism1.</p>","author":"Leya Qu, \nLiping Yang, \nYiran Wang, \nShaoyang Zhi, \nMengjuan Zhao, \nJinrui Xiong, \nXiao Yan, \nChaobin Qin, \nGuoxing Nie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"28bf0917177e67cdb74e404b0ee9d4ebca16a18261f82ae7a7909a899c6d7d6a","category":"Environment"}
