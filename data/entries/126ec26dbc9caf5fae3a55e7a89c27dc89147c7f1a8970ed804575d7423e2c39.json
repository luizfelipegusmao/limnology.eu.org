Methods: We performed an observational prospective multicentre study. Participants were classified according to their history of COVID-19: I) Patients with a past history of COVID-19; and II) Patients without a previous microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 361 patients (Past history of COVID-19, n=166; No past history of COVID-19, n=195) were assessed from January 2022 to March 2023. Patients with a past history of COVID-19 were assessed at 12 months following COVID-19 recovery. The primary outcome measure was ED, assessed through the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Data concerning epidemiologic variables, comorbidities and active treatment were also collected. We performed a binary logistic regression to develop a risk predictive model. Among the models developed, we selected the one with the higher Area Under the Curve (AUC). Results: The median age was 55 years in both groups. The ED prevalence was 55.9% in patients with past history of COVID-19 and 44.1% in those with no past history of COVID-19. The best predictive model developed for ED comprised 40 variables and had an AUC of 0.8. Conclusions: We developed a regression model for the prediction of ED 12 months after COVID-19 recovery. The application of our predictive tool in a community setting could eventually prevent the adverse effects of ED on cardiovascular health, and the associated unfavourable economic impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"126ec26dbc9caf5fae3a55e7a89c27dc89147c7f1a8970ed804575d7423e2c39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
