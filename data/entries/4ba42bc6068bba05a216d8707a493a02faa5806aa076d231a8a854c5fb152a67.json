{"title":"Seroepidemiology of Hepatitis B and C in a Medically Vulnerable Area: An Experience from the Ulleung Liver Cancer Prevention and Management Project","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0064/v1","date":1717404259000,"content":"Ulleung County, one of the most medically vulnerable areas in South Korea, requires public attention because of the high incidence of liver cancer. This study was conducted as a part of the Ulleung Liver Cancer Prevention and Management Project. The purpose of this study was to estimate the community prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses and to identify the associated risk factors. The Projectâ€™s interagency workgroup established a procedure for conducting blood sampling and health behavior surveys at the Ulleung Public Community Health Center. A total of 1,792 residents aged 40 years and older voluntarily participated in the study between 2019 and 2022. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) and hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) positive rates in Ulleung were 7.19% and 1.37%, respectively. Low education level and lifetime smoking were associated with HBsAg positivity, whereas cupping therapy at non-medical institutions was associated with anti-HCV positivity. The odds of HBs Ag positivity were lower among those with tattoos than among those without. There was a difference in the risk factors associated with hepatitis B and C viral infection. While a high HBs Ag positivity rate alone may not fully explain the high incidence of liver cancer in Ulleung, it may be a contributing factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ba42bc6068bba05a216d8707a493a02faa5806aa076d231a8a854c5fb152a67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
