The foregut initiates and coordinates a series of digestive processes, such as secreting saliva and producing specific digestive enzymes, to ensure an efficient pre-digestion before the ingestion enters subsequent sections of the digestive system. Furthermore, the foregut epithelia interact with microorganisms, both symbionts and pathogens, that are an integrated part of the digestive system. These microorganisms, collectively termed the gut microbiome, can significantly impact intestinal and overall physiology of the organism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1706a00b251e9614b0ed814b12ac3b909d7b2872efa407b3dd3f49d2cdeb09cc","category":"Environment"}
