{"title":"Potential Performance of Two New RT-PCR and RT-q PCR Methods for Multiplex Detection of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1-4 and Chikungunya Virus in Mosquitoes Allowing Efficient Entomological Surveillance of Both Vector-Borne Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0991/v1","date":1720766626000,"content":"Mosquitoes genus Aedes are the most important arthropod disease vector. Dengue Virus (DENV) and Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) are the main arboviruses distributed in the world. Based on entomo-virological surveillance, appropriating public health strategies can be addressed to contain cases and control outbreaks. This study aims to show the potential performance of two new molecular methods for detecting DENV serotypes and CHIKV in mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected in urban areas and sylvatic areas between July to August 2023, DENV and CHIKV were screened using new multiplex RT-PCR and RT-q PCR. A total of 2150 mosquitoes were trapped including 976 Aedes (959 Ae. egypti, 6 Ae. furcifer and 11 Ae. Vittatus) and 1174 Culex from 39 pools of a maximum of 30 mosquitoes each, tested by molecular screening, 7.7% (3/39) were positive for DENV, DENV-1 was detected in one pool (1/3), and DENV-3 in two pools (2/3). All the pools were negative for CHIKV. The overall minimum infection rate (MIR) of DENV in this study was 3.07 (95% CI: 2.24 â€”19.86). This study shows the usefulness of our new molecular tools in DENV serotypes and CHIKV surveillance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec99debb87529b8e08b87ae0dff4abd173c731660f85737e380c9b5b2b7a70b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
