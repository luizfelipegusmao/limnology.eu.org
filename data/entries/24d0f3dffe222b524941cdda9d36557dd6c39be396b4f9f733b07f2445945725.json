{"title":"Research on the Principle of Relative Variation of Light Speed and the Effect of Vacuum Mechanics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0554/v1","date":1725874822000,"content":"Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative postulate based on experimental observations, namely, that the speed of light can vary between two inertial reference systems. This postulate is defined as the principle of relative change in the speed of light, which refreshes the concept of absolute speed of light in traditional physics. By integrating the principle of the invariance of the speed of light with the principle of relativity in relativity theory, several important conclusions are derived: space and time must be capable of and proportionally expand and contract. Between two inertial reference systems with different relative speeds of light, objects have an energy difference of k^2 times, which induces a natural tendency for objects to move towards a state of lower energy. The acceleration is only related to the relative change rate of the speed of light in vacuum space and is independent of the mass of the object. The kinetic energy obtained by the object comes from the reduction of internal energy of the object, emphasizing the key role of energy conversion in this process. The paper provides a new theoretical perspective for explaining the physical mechanisms of universal gravitation and dark energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24d0f3dffe222b524941cdda9d36557dd6c39be396b4f9f733b07f2445945725","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
