However, to deliver a long-term sustainable solution, it is essential to develop innovative nuclear technologies for improving the fuel utilization and reducing the nuclear waste disposal challenge. Zero Power Reactors (ZPR) are an essential initial step for developing new nuclear technologies because they allow for testing and refinement in a safe environment before large-scale deployment. This paper discusses the design of a ZPR experiments for the development of iMAGINE, a novel chloride-based molten salt reactor technology. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the neutronic design for the shutdown and control systems of an experimental ZPR based on the iMAGINE molten salt reactor technology. The study concludes that a split-core design with a lower corner reflector as an extension of the lower annular reflector offers the most robust ZPR configuration, offering optimum operational margins and maneuverability. This design ensures safety, regulatory compliance, and sufficient control and shutdown performance for the successful development of the iMAGINE technology.","author":"Lakshay Jain","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e719ef0c975f219eb4640a5c2d00492d36b3e3e56e0195797f34608735eb7eed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
