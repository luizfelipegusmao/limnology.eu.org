{"title":"Program for Calculating Wind Loads on Rectangular High-Rise Buildings Using Wind Tunnel Test Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1778/v1","date":1716841562000,"content":"In the context of the Korean building structure standard KDS2022, wind loads can be readily calculated in terms of the along-wind, across-wind, and torsional components, based on a single wind direction. However, this approach falls short in accurately and safely evaluating the impact of winds from various directions. Therefore, in this study, we developed a Wind Load Calculation Program (WCP) capable of predicting wind loads with relative precision during the preliminary design phase. First, wind tunnel tests were conducted to identify the essential factors necessary for calculating wind loads and the variables influencing these factors. The building shape considered was a square, and the wind force coefficients and power spectral density were measured by combining 4 ground roughness values, 11 side ratios (), 4 aspect ratios (), and wind directions ranging from 0° to 90°. Subsequently, a generalized formulation was devised to facilitate wind load calculations across diverse conditions and a method for calculating load combination coefficients, considering response correlation and load simultaneity, was presented. Finally, the wind loads obtained from the wind tunnel tests were compared with those predicted by the WCP using an actual project model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9481df63f44796e0c77bdb625841749d4d79c1edc155e71c68a7528234f5c10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
