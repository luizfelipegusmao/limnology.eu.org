{"title":"An Analytical Approach to Power Optimization of Concentrating Solar Power Plants with Thermal Storage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0548/v1","date":1715304748000,"content":"This paper deals with the problem of determining the optimal capacity of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, especially in the context of hybrid solar power plants. This work presents an innovative analytical approach to optimize the capacity of concentrated solar plants. The proposed method is based on the use of additional non-dimensional parameters, in particular the design factor and the solar multiple factor. The paper presents a mathematical optimization model that focuses on the capacity of concentrated solar power plants where thermal storage plays a key role in the energy source. The analytical approach provides a more complete understanding of the design process for hybrid power plants. In addition, the use of additional factors and the combination of the proposed method with existing numerical methods allows for a more refined optimization, which allows for a more accurate selection of the capacity for specific geographical conditions. Importantly, the proposed method significantly increases the speed of computation compared to traditional numerical methods. Finally, the authors present the results of the analysis of the proposed system of equations for calculating the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for hybrid solar power plants. The nonlinearity of the LCOE on the main calculation parameters is shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84c6a9532332e18ea66d93b4da760daf61649eee0f88d920c5d32a39b396304b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
