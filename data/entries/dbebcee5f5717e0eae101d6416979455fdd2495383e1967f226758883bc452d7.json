{"title":"Antigen Delivery Platforms for Next-Generation Coronavirus Vaccines:\nThe Superiority of Nucleoside-Modified mRNA Encapsulated in Lipid Nanoparticles Vaccine Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1560/v1","date":1729504877000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is in its 5th year and is being maintained by the inability of current spike-alone based COVID-19 vaccines to prevent transmission leading to the continuous emergence of variants and sub-variants of concern (VOCs). This underscores the critical need for next-generation broad-spectrum pan-Coronavirus vaccines (pan-CoV vaccine) to break this cycle and end the pandemic. The development of a pan-CoV vaccine offering protection against a wide array of VOCs requires two key elements: (1) identifying protective antigens that are highly conserved between passed, current and future VOCs; and (2) developing a safe and efficient antigens deliver system for induction of broad-based B- and T-cell immunity. This review will (1) present the current state of antigen delivery platforms involving a multifaceted approach, including bioinformatics, molecular and structural biology, immunology, and advanced computational methods; (2) discuss the challenges facing development of safe and effective antigen delivery platforms; and (3) highlight the potential of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) as the platform that is well suited to the needs of a next-generation pan-CoV vaccine, such as the ability to induce broad-based immunity and amenable to large-scale manufacturing to safely provide durable protective immunity against current and future Coronavirus threats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbebcee5f5717e0eae101d6416979455fdd2495383e1967f226758883bc452d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
