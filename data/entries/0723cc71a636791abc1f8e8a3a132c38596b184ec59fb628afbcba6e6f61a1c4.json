{"title":"Parametric Analysis and Numerical Optimisation of Root-Cutting Shovel of Cotton Stalk Harvester Using Discrete Element Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1517/v1","date":1721363565000,"content":"Aiming at the problems of high cost of manual pulling, low reliability of existing pulling devices, high breaking rate and high leakage rate in the process of cotton stalk reuse after leaving the field in Xinjiang cotton area, a loosening soil and root-cutting cotton stalk pulling the setting machine has been researched and designed, established the root-cutting force model, calculated and optimized the key parameters of the V-shaped root-cutting knife, and determined the range of slide cutting angle, cutting edge angle and soil entry angle. The shoveling process simulation of V-shaped root-cutting knife and root-soil complex was constructed, and the working mechanism of V-shaped root-cutting knife was clarified. In order to verify the reliability and operation performance of the V-shaped root-cutting knife, the slide cutting angle, cutting edge angle and soil entry angle were used as the test factors, the response surface test of three-factors and three-levels was carried out with root-breaking force and mean value of the cutting resistance as the test index. The test results were analyzed by variance analysis, the significant of influencing factors on the root-breaking force are in a descending order as: slide cutting angle, cutting edge angle, soil entry angle; the degree of influence on the mean value of the cutting resistance are as follows: slide cutting angle, soil entry angle, cutting edge angle. In order to make the V-shaped root-cutting knife achieve the optimal working state, the parameters of the test index were optimized, and the optimal design parameters of the V-shaped root-cutting knife were set as follows: the slide cutting angle was 48.3°, cutting edge angle was 43.4°, and soil entry angle was 26.2°. The field uprooting test showed that the average pass rate of root breakage was 94.8% and the average pull-out rate of the cotton stalk was 93.2%. This study provides theoretical guidance for the development of root breaking mechanism of cotton straw harvester.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0723cc71a636791abc1f8e8a3a132c38596b184ec59fb628afbcba6e6f61a1c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
