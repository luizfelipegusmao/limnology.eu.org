{"title":"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Oncological Ultrasound Image Analysis: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0036/v1","date":1719817716000,"content":"This review provides an overview of eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for oncological ultrasound image analysis and compares their performance evaluations. A systematic search of Medline Embase and Scopus between March 25 and April 14 2024 identified 17 studies describing 14 XAI methods, including visualization, semantics, example-based, and hybrid functions. These methods primarily provided specific, local, and post-hoc explanations. Performance evaluations focused on AI model performance, with limited assessment of explainability impact. Standardized evaluations incorporating clinical end-users are generally lacking. Enhanced XAI transparency may facilitate AI integration into clinical workflows. Future research should develop real-time methodologies and standardized quantitative evaluative metrics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd998b0a397128b01a64ed0ed13b3f88d653a3802691ba3593b737def794c0ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
