{"title":"Polar AUV Challenges and Applications: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1913/v1","date":1721802425000,"content":"This study presents a comprehensive review of the development and progression of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in polar regions, aiming to synthesize past experiences and provide guidance for future advancements and applications. We extensively explore the history of notable polar AUV deployments worldwide, identifying and addressing the key technological challenges these vehicles face. These include advanced navigation techniques, strategic path planning, efficient obstacle avoidance, robust communication, stable energy supply, reliable launch and recovery, and thorough risk analysis. Furthermore, the study categorizes the typical capabilities and applications of AUVs in polar contexts, such as under-ice mapping and measurement, water sampling, ecological investigation, seafloor mapping, and surveillance networking. We also briefly highlight existing research gaps and potential future challenges in this evolving field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca39999d7e1de4991c207b7c862f36150788bc5fd3dc281969b2b467953510c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
