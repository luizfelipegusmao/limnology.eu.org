Solar farms have long operational lifespans, experience low levels of disturbance during operation and can be managed for ecosystem services beyond low-carbon electricity generation, including food production and biodiversity conservation.\n\nHere, we briefly synthesise the mechanisms by which solar farm development and operation may impact natural capital and ecosystem services, and provide policy recommendations for policymakers and the solar farm sector.\n\nSolar farms can deliver environmental benefits for hosting ecosystems while minimising negative impacts, with outcomes depending on location, construction techniques, and land management practices. However, the historical misalignment between climate, nature, and land use policies has hindered efforts to simultaneously address the climate and biodiversity crises through land use change for solar farms. For instance, existing public financial incentives in the UK that encourage landowners and developers to manage land for biodiversity largely exclude land with solar farms.\n\n<i>Policy implications</i>: We call for public policymakers to identify appropriate opportunities to amend existing national laws that address climate and biodiversity separately to improve integration of multiple aspects of the climate-nature-land use nexus into policymaking by: (1) formulating ecological and socio-economic indicators and metrics that are appropriate to underpin the development, implementation, and assessment of public policies; (2) adopting a cross-sectoral and cross-government approach to form public policies; (3) ensuring solar farms can access public financial incentives that encourage sustainable land use; (4) implementing land use policies that incentivise funding from non-government sources (e.g. private sector) into nascent nature markets; (5) embedding solar farms in biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning policies and decision-making; and (6) building equity and clarity into responsibilities and benefits for all actors involved.\n</p>","author":"Fabio Carvalho, \nHing Kin Lee, \nHollie Blaydes, \nLucy Treasure, \nLaura J.
