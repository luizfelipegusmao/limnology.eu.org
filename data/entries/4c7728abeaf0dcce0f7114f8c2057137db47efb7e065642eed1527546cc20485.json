{"title":"A Green Pharmacy: Quantifying Medicinal Plant Use in the Sohagi Wildlife Sanctuary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0910/v1","date":1713196828000,"content":"Tribal healers and local practitioners possess knowledge about plant uses passed down through generations. However, habitat loss, unsustainable harvesting, and declining traditional knowledge threaten this valuable resource. India, a global biodiversity hotspot, is rich in medicinal plants. Documenting the traditional knowledge prevents it from being lost and ensures the preservation of this cultural heritage. Recording traditional practices helps bridge the gap between traditional and modern medicine. This study quantifies the ethnomedicinal uses of plants within the Sohag Wildlife Sanctuary. The findings contribute to preserving traditional knowledge and promoting the sustainable use of medicinal plants. The study documented 95 medicinal plant species from 39 families, highlighting the importance of ethnomedicinal studies for preserving traditional knowledge and ensuring the sustainable use of medicinal plants. In the future, scientific studies can be organized to understand their efficacy, leading to developing new, potentially safer, and more effective medications.  Identifying and documenting medicinal plants is crucial in safeguarding cultural heritage, fostering scientific discovery, and promoting sustainable healthcare practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c7728abeaf0dcce0f7114f8c2057137db47efb7e065642eed1527546cc20485","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
