{"title":"Sweet potato yield and quality characteristics affected by different late‐season irrigation levels","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13350?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Seasonal late-season water deficits negatively affect the yield and quality of sweet potatoes in northern China. However, the amount of late-season irrigation to achieve high yield and consistent quality storage root remains undetermined. We assessed the yield and some qualitative traits of sweet potatoes such as size, shape, skin/flesh colour and nutritional content, as influenced by five irrigation levels (T<sub>0</sub>: unirrigated control; T<sub>1</sub>: 33% ET<sub>c</sub>; T<sub>2</sub>: 75% ET<sub>c</sub>; T<sub>3</sub>: 100% ET<sub>c</sub>; and T<sub>4</sub>: 125% ET<sub>c</sub>).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Late-season irrigation significantly increased yield and marketable yield. Yields for T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> were significantly higher than other treatments, whereas T<sub>2</sub> had the highest Grade A rating in a 2-year test. The vertical length of storage roots gradually increased with an increase in irrigation level, whereas the maximum width remained unchanged. The proportion of long elliptic and elliptic storage roots also increased, whereas the proportion of ovate, obovate and round storage roots gradually decreased. The skin and flesh colours became more vivid as the level of irrigation increased, with the skin colour becoming redder and the flesh colour becoming more orange–yellow. The levels of carotenoids, vitamin C and soluble sugar were significantly higher in irrigated crops, with the highest vitamin C and soluble sugar levels in T<sub>2</sub> and the highest carotenoid levels in T<sub>3</sub> treatment.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of moderate irrigation in the late-season to improve both yield production and quality potential. The results are of great importance for improving the market value of sweet potatoes and increasing grower profits. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mingjing Zhou, \nSusu Hu, \nShaoxia Wang, \nTao Yin, \nQing Liu, \nHuan Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8eff8d09d1c0ff0417ac561e2ccbf65ba45edaa4de9ab1e8b0cdab71638cef6f","category":"Environment"}
