{"title":"Accurate recognition of rice plants based on visual and tactile sensing","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13311?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Crop recognition is the basis of intelligent agricultural machine operations. Visual perception methods have achieved high recognition accuracy. However, the reliability of such methods is difficult to guarantee because of the complex environment of paddy fields. Tactile sensing methods are not affected by background or environmental interference, and have high reliability. However, in an ideal environment, the recognition accuracy is not as high as that of the visual method.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>To balance the accuracy and reliability of rice plant recognition, a combined visual–tactile method was proposed in this study. A rice plant recognition device was developed with a poly(vinylidene fluoride) sensor embedded inside the device as a tactile perceptron and a graphic designed as a visual perceptron. The primary role of the tactile perceptron is to initially recognize rice plants and provide a time point for image capture for visual perception. The main role of the visual perceptron is to extract features from the captured images and recognize rice plants again. The results of tactile and visual recognition were eventually fused to achieve accurate recognition of rice plants.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The contact speed between the recognition perceptron and rice–weed was selected for the field performance test based on the real situation of paddy field operation. The results showed that the accuracy and reliability of rice plant recognition decreased as the travelling speed of the paddy field operation machine increased. The results of this study provide a basis for intelligent farm machinery operations in rice fields. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xueshen Chen, \nPeina Dang, \nEnzao Zhang, \nYanxue Chen, \nCunyao Tang, \nLong Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c3b8c55307d58b0588b90a6f695a7b195fb94bf2f92bfddb37d5cd45780b0d74","category":"Environment"}
