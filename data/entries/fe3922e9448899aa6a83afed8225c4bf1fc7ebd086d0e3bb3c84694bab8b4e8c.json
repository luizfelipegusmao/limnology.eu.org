Stunting, characterized by impaired growth and development in children due to insufficient psychological stimulation, frequent infections, and inadequate nutrition, remains a critical issue. Although economic growth alone cannot fully address the prevalence of stunting, there exists a robust correlation between a countryâ€™s income level and childhood stunting rates. Countries with higher incomes tend to have lower rates of childhood stunting. Notably, while childhood stunting is declining worldwide, it remains persistent in Africa. Consequently, this study aims to assess the prevalence of childhood stunting and its determinants in low- and lower-middle-income African countries</p> Method <p>This study conducted a secondary analysis of standard demographic and health surveys in low- and lower-middle-income African countries spanning the period from 2010 to 2022. The analysis included a total sample of 204,214 weighted children under the age of five years. To identify the determinants of stunting, we employed a multilevel mixed-effect model, considering the three levels of variables. The measures of association (fixed effect) were determined using the adjusted odds ratio at a 95% confidence interval. Significance was declared when the association between the outcome variable and the explanatory variable had a p-value less than 0.05.</p> Result <p>In low and lower-middle-income African countries, 31.28% of children under five years old experience stunting, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 31.08% to 31.48%. The results from a multilevel mixed-effect analysis revealed that 24 months or more of age of child, male gender, low and high birth weight, low and high maternal BMI, no and low maternal education, low household wealth index, multiple (twin or triplet) births, rural residence, and low income of countries were significantly associated with childhood stunting.</p> Conclusion <p>Stunting among children under five years of age in low- and lower-middle-income African countries was relatively high. Individual, community, and country-level factors were statistically associated with childhood stunting. Equally importantly, with child, maternal, and community factors of stunting, the income of countries needs to be considered in providing nutritional interventions to mitigate childhood stunting in Africa.</p>","author":"Tadesse Tarik Tamir","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fe3922e9448899aa6a83afed8225c4bf1fc7ebd086d0e3bb3c84694bab8b4e8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
