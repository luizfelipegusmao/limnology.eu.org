{"title":"Serine protease inhibitor 3 (Serpin3) from Penaeus vannamei selectively interacts with Vibrio parahaemolyticus PirAvp","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13935?af=R","date":1708925121000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) represents a significant challenge in the field of shrimp aquaculture. This disease is primarily caused by <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> strains harbouring the pVA1 plasmid encoding the PirA<sup>vp</sup> and PirB<sup>vp</sup> toxins. To combat this epidemic and mitigate its devastating consequences, it is crucial to identify and characterize the receptors responsible for the binding of these pathogenic toxins. Our studied discovered that <i>Penaeus vannamei'</i>s Serine protease inhibitor 3 (<i>Pv</i>Serpin3) derived from shrimp hepatopancreatic tissues could bind to recombinant PirA<sup>vp</sup>, confirming its role as a novel PirA<sup>vp</sup>-binding protein (P<sub>A</sub>BP). Through comprehensive computational methods, we revealed two truncated PirA<sup>vp</sup>–binding proteins derived from <i>Pv</i>Serpin3 called Serpin3(13) and Serpin3(22), which had higher affinity to PirA<sup>vp</sup> than the full-length <i>Pv</i>Serpin3. The P<sub>A</sub>BP genes were amplified from a cDNA library that was reversed from total RNA extracted from shrimp, cloned and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Three P<sub>A</sub>BP inclusion bodies were refolded to obtain the soluble form, and the recovery efficacy was found to be 100% for Serpin3 and Serpin3(13), while Serpin3(22) had a recovery efficacy of roundly 50%. Co-Immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and dot blot assays substantiated the interaction of these recombinant P<sub>A</sub>BPs with both recombinant PirA<sup>vp</sup> and VP<sub>AHPND</sub> (XN89)-producing natural toxins.</p>","author":"Thanh‐Nguyen Le, \nThuan‐Thien Dinh, \nThuy‐Dung Mai‐Hoang, \nEbrahim Razzazi‐Fazeli, \nHieu Tran‐Van","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"5793a08631774d54981f730b2e9d62568d0b2bde6783ce3106a4f3dfe5e20d73","category":"Environment"}
