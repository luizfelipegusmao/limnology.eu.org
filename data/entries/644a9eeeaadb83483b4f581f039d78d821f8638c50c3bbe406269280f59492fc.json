{"title":"From Origin to Present: Establishment, Mechanism, Evolutions and Biomedical Applications of CRISPR/Cas-based Macromolecular System in Brief","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1715/v1","date":1724400557000,"content":"Advancements in biological and medical science are intricately linked to the biological central dogma. In recent years, gene editing techniques, especially CRISPR/Cas systems, have emerged as powerful tools for modifying genetic information, supplementing the central dogma and holding significant promise for disease diagnosis and treatment. Extensive research has been conducted on the continuously evolving CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly in relation to challenging diseases, such as cancer and HIV infection. Consequently, the integration of CRISPR/Cas-based techniques with contemporary medical approaches and therapies is anticipated to greatly enhance healthcare outcomes for human. This review begins with a brief overview of the discovery of the CRISPR/Cas system. Subsequently, using CRISPR/Cas9 as an example, a clear description of the classical molecular mechanism underlying the CRISPR/Cas system was given. Additionally, the development of the CRISPR/Cas system and its applications in gene therapy and high-sensitivity disease diagnosis were discussed. Furthermore, we address the prospects for clinical applications of CRISPR/Cas-based gene therapy, highlighting the ethical consideration associated with altering genetic information. This brief review aims to enhance understanding of the CRISPR/Cas macromolecular system and provide insight into the potential of genetic macromolecular drugs for therapeutic purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"644a9eeeaadb83483b4f581f039d78d821f8638c50c3bbe406269280f59492fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
