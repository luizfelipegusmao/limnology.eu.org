{"title":"Characterization of Aerosols Elementary Composition Emitted by Fires in the North of the Pantanal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0504/v1","date":1715169312000,"content":"The Pantanal region in the state of Mato Grosso suffers from intensive biomass burning at the dry season. A great volume of anthropogenic emissions affects the ecosystem, damaging the richest fauna and flora internationally recognized. The collect and characterization of natural aerosols is important to accompany the variations in the composition and concentration of these particles, this work determined the total mass concentration of fine inhalable particles, concentration of aerosol compound Black Carbon (BC) and the presence of 25 chemical elements in the samples. Maximum total mass inhalable fine (PM2.5) and BC concentration was, respectively, 83.66 μg m-3 and 4.52 μg m-3, and the median values of both was 36.62 ± 31.69 μg m-3 and 1.83 ± 1.65 μg m-3. The Pb element concentration demonstrated a great maximum value of 25 ng m-3, around twenty-one times bigger than a similar study realized ten years ago in the same area. The results indicate a low correlation between aerosols concentration and environmental parameters, nonetheless, we verify a considerable increase in concentration of PM2.5, BC and chemical elements S, K, Fe, Si and heavy metals compared with previous studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b014c19a3b671c78e4de9d70aa5c90e3ab778042f549515036bef77b1eadefe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
