{"title":"Influence of Chemical, Morphological, Spectroscopic and Calorimetric Properties of Agroindustrial Waste Cellulose on Drainage Behavior in SMA Asphalt Mixtures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0829/v1","date":1728558244000,"content":"New asphalt mixtures have been improved by using fibers (polypropylene, polyester, asbestos, carbon, glass, nylon, lignin, coconut, sisal, recycled rubber, PET, wood, bamboo and cellulose), reducing the temperature and compaction energy for their collocation, minimizing the impact on the environment, increasing the tenacity and resistance to cracking of hot mix asphalt (HMA), preventing asphalt drainage in a Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA). Hence, this paper aims to evaluate the influence of the chemical (lignin content, ash, viscosity, degree of polymerization and elemental analysis), morphological (SEM), spectroscopic (FTIR-ATR and XRD) and calorimetric (ATG and DSC) properties of celluloses from bagasse Agave tequilana Weber var. Azul (ABP), corrugated paperboard (CPB) and commercial cellulose fiber (CC) as Schellenberg drainage (D) inhibitors of the SMA. The ABP was obtained through a chemical process by alkaline cooking, while CPB by a mechanical refining process. The chemical, morphological, spectroscopic and calorimetric properties were similar among the analyzed celluloses, but CPB and ABP cellulose are excellent alternatives to CC cellulose for inhibiting drainage. However, CPB is the most effective at low concentrations. This is attributed to its morphology, which includes roughness, waviness, filament length, orientation and diameter, as well as its lignin content and crystallinity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e6b447f49c68df1938cb499c4c8a8158a656a7793662676ad10ac97cf9e0640","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
