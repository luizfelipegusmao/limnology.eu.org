{"title":"Selecting Appropriate Model Complexity: An Example of Tracer Inversion for Thermal Prediction in Enhanced Geothermal Systems","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036146?af=R","date":1719471600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A major challenge in the inversion of subsurface parameters is the ill-posedness issue caused by the inherent subsurface complexities and the generally spatially sparse data. Appropriate simplifications of inversion models are thus necessary to make the inversion process tractable and meanwhile preserve the predictive ability of the inversion results. In this study, we investigate the effect of model complexity on fracture aperture inversion and thermal performance prediction in a field-scale EGS model. Principal component analysis was used to map the aperture field to a low-dimensional latent space. The complexity of the inversion model was quantitatively represented by the percentage of total variance in the original aperture fields preserved by the latent space. Tracer, pressure and flow rate data were used to invert for fracture aperture through an ensemble-based inversion method, and the inferred aperture field was used to predict thermal performance. With an over-simplified aperture model, ensemble collapse occurred. The inverted aperture models failed to resolve necessary flow and transport features, leading to a biased thermal performance prediction. A complex aperture model involved excessive features and was prone to overinterpreting the inversion data. Both the tracer/pressure/flow rate data reproduction and thermal prediction showed significant uncertainties, making it difficult to properly estimate long-term thermal performance. Fortunately, our results indicate that there exists an appropriate model complexity which can simultaneously match inversion data and predict thermal performance with an acceptable uncertainty. The quality of the fit of tracer data appears to be a useful indicator of such an appropriate model complexity.</p>","author":"Hui Wu, \nZhijun Jin, \nSu Jiang, \nHewei Tang, \nJoseph P.
