{"title":"Knowns and unknowns about the neurobiology of stuttering","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002492","date":1708610400000,"content":"<p>by Nicole E. Neef, Soo-Eun Chang</p>\r\n\r\nStuttering occurs in early childhood during a dynamic phase of brain and behavioral development. The latest studies examining children at ages close to this critical developmental period have identified early brain alterations that are most likely linked to stuttering, while spontaneous recovery appears related to increased inter-area connectivity. By contrast, therapy-driven improvement in adults is associated with a functional reorganization within and beyond the speech network. The etiology of stuttering, however, remains enigmatic. This Unsolved Mystery highlights critical questions and points to neuroimaging findings that could inspire future research to uncover how genetics, interacting neural hierarchies, social context, and reward circuitry contribute to the many facets of stuttering.","author":"Nicole E.
