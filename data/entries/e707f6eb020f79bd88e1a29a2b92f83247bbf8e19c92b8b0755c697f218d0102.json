{"title":"The dynamic response mechanism of crops to manganese uptake and transfer mediated by different intercropping crop attributes","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13795?af=R","date":1723031375000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>An issue of pressing concern is the manganese contamination in farmland soils adjacent to industrial areas. To address this, intercropping hyperaccumulator plants with crops emerges as a sustainable approach to ensuring food security. This study aims to investigate the influence of intercropping <i>Sedum alfredii</i> with maize or soybean on their growth and the dynamics of manganese accumulation through field experiments.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that compared with monoculture, the <i>Sedum alfredii</i>–maize intercropping system exhibited a land equivalent ratio (LER) of 1.89, signifying a 71.13% augmentation in bioaccumulation amount (BCA). Additionally, it led to a significant reduction in manganese content in various organs, ranging from 17.05% to 25.50%. However, the <i>Sedum alfredii–</i>soybean intercropping system demonstrated a LER of 1.94, accompanied by a 66.11% increase in BCA, but did not significantly reduce the manganese content in the roots, stems, and pods of soybeans. Furthermore, manganese accumulation in maize and soybean grains was primarily attributed to the aboveground translocation of manganese. The intercropping effect on blocking manganese absorption of maize during growth and maturity is primarily attributed to the earlier manganese accumulation in intercropped maize by 2.63 to 4.35 days, and a reduction of 21.95% in the maximum manganese accumulation rate.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The study found that manganese accumulation dynamics vary significantly depending on the crop family. Intercropping <i>Sedum alfredii</i> with maize enhances land-use efficiency and reduces manganese uptake by crops, making it a promising strategy for remediating manganese-contaminated farmland near industrial areas. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zhixian Li, \nQiuyao Shang, \nLi Zou, \nZhenan Xing, \nGuoliang Chen, \nZhang Chen, \nJianlin Zhou, \nXiling Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e707f6eb020f79bd88e1a29a2b92f83247bbf8e19c92b8b0755c697f218d0102","category":"Environment"}
