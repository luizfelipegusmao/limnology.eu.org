{"title":"Dual roles of the MPK3 and MPK6 mitogen-activated protein kinases in regulating Arabidopsis stomatal development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4576/7727742?rss=1","date":1722816000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>An Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade composed of YODA (YDA)-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 plays an essential role downstream of the ERECTA (ER)/ER-LIKE (ERL) receptor complex in regulating stomatal development in the leaf epidermis. STOMAGEN (STO), a peptide ligand produced in mesophyll cells, competes with EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR2 (EPF2) for binding ER/ERL receptors to promote stomatal formation. In this study, we found that activation of MPK3/MPK6 suppresses <span>STO</span> expression. Using <span>MUTE</span> and <span>STO</span> promoters that confer epidermis- and mesophyll-specific expression, respectively, we generated lines with cell-specific activation and suppression of MPK3/MPK6. The activation or suppression of MPK3/MPK6 in either epidermis or mesophyll cells is sufficient to alter stomatal differentiation. Epistatic analyses demonstrated that <span>STO</span> overexpression can rescue the suppression of stomatal formation conferred by the mesophyll-specific expression of the constitutively active MKK4<sup>DD</sup> or MKK5<sup>DD</sup>, but not by the epidermis-specific expression of these constitutively active MKKs. These data suggest that STO is downstream of MPK3/MPK6 in mesophyll cells, but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in epidermal cells in stomatal development signaling. This function of the MPK3/MPK6 cascade allows it to coordinate plant epidermis development based on its activity in mesophyll cells during leaf development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"172b7c5a3400962d16a7c9dae90d632254a478d431204d80dcd3f24f33cd96e1","category":"Environment"}
