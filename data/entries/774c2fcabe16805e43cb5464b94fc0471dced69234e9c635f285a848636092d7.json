{"title":"Antimicrobial Effects of Photodynamic Therapy Delivered via Hydrogels for Inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0925/v1","date":1720686148000,"content":"Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-negative bacterium that causes superficial and deep infections that can be mild or potentially fatal. Recently, the bacterium has gained significant attention due to the increased incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains that make treatment with antibiotics dif-ficult. Owing to the MDR strains, alternative therapies such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) have emerged as good options to treat non-systemic infections. PDT combines a photosensi-tiser (PS) with light and oxygen to generate free radicals that destroy bacterial structures such as the plasma membrane, matrix, and genetic material. This systematic review aimed to identify the ef-fectiveness of PDT delivered using different types of hydrogels for treating wounds, burns, and contamination by S. aureus. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Bibliographic research was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Only full articles published in English between 2013 and 2024 from any country of origin (without restrictions) were included. The research was carried out from 15 June 2023 to 15 June 2024 and did not use any automatic biblio-graphic search tool. The articles collected were identified using keywords and selected using in-clusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with the PRISMA protocol. Seven articles were in-cluded that presented a good set of evidence associated with the use of PDT against S. aureus in in vitro and in vivo studies. To conclude, PDT can effectively complement antimicrobial therapy against S. aureus, in the healing of wounds and burns. The effectiveness of this technique depends on the PS used, hydrogel type, and lesion location. Some studies have already demonstrated the ef-fectiveness of PDT but most were in vitro and a few in vivo. Further studies are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PDT delivered via hydrogels in in vivo models of bacterial infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"774c2fcabe16805e43cb5464b94fc0471dced69234e9c635f285a848636092d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
