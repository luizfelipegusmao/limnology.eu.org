{"title":"Tie Memories to E-Souvenirs: Personalized Souvenirs with Augmented Reality for Interactive Learning in the Museum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1536/v1","date":1729504655000,"content":"This paper presents an educational application called AR Firework designed for an interactive science museum exhibition in the wild. We adopted STEAM and a game-based education approach for the major visitors and children to teach them the mechanisms of fireworks. Augmented reality is used to simulate dangerous laboratory environments and visualize abstract concepts. DIY souvenirs featuring fireworks are created in the process of interacting with the exhibits. This hybrid souvenir combines a physical firework launcher and AR models. The visitors can present it as a gift to others or display it in the digital gallery. This souvenir establishes a long-lasting connection between visitors and their personal visiting experiences through digital media. This paper promotes an improved understanding of personalization, socialization, AR, and STEAM education. It can be an inspiration for souvenir designers and education products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33dbaccdad05316e6935df2f984960dae651d5e84857c83be5b824b07075cfeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
