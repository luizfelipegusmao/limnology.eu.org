{"title":"Endoplasmic reticulum protein ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM 1 negatively regulates senescence in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/273/7680502?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant senescence is a highly regulated developmental program crucial for nutrient reallocation and stress adaptation in response to developmental and environmental cues. Stress-induced and age-dependent natural senescence share both overlapping and distinct molecular responses and regulatory schemes. Previously, we have utilized a carbon-deprivation (C-deprivation) senescence assay using Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) seedlings to investigate senescence regulation. Here we conducted a comprehensive time-resolved transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis wild type seedlings subjected to C-deprivation treatment at multiple time points, unveiling substantial temporal changes and distinct gene expression patterns. Moreover, we identified <span>ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM 1</span> (<span>AMP1</span>), encoding an endoplasmic reticulum protein, as a potential regulator of senescence based on its expression profile. By characterizing loss-of-function alleles and overexpression lines of <span>AMP1</span>, we confirmed its role as a negative regulator of plant senescence. Genetic analyses further revealed a synergistic interaction between <span>AMP1</span> and the autophagy pathway in regulating senescence. Additionally, we discovered a functional association between AMP1 and the endosome-localized ABNORMAL SHOOT3 (ABS3)-mediated senescence pathway and positioned key senescence-promoting transcription factors downstream of AMP1. Overall, our findings shed light on the molecular intricacies of transcriptome reprogramming during C-deprivation-induced senescence and the functional interplay among endomembrane compartments in controlling plant senescence.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"6bfc596b84f59c9ad76665b00955b76749fe58579ef119511801cc60bc9a5418","category":"Environment"}
