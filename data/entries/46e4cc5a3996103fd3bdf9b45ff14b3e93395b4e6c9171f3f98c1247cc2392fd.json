{"title":"TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2 defines trichome cell shape by modulating actin cytoskeleton in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1256/7613085?rss=1","date":1708646400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) <span>TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2</span> (<span>TTG2</span>) gene encodes a WRKY transcription factor that regulates a range of development events like trichome, seed coat, and atrichoblast formation. Loss-of-function of <span>TTG2</span> was previously shown to reduce or eliminate trichome specification and branching. Here, we report the identification of an allele of <span>TTG2</span>, <span>ttg2-6</span>. In contrast to the <span>ttg2</span> mutants described before, <span>ttg2-6</span> displayed unique trichome phenotypes. Some <span>ttg2-6</span> mutant trichomes were hyper-branched, whereas others were hypo-branched, distorted, or clustered. Further, we found that in addition to specifically activating R3 MYB transcription factor TRIPTYCHON (TRY) to modulate trichome specification, TTG2 also integrated cytoskeletal signaling to regulate trichome morphogenesis. The <span>ttg2-6</span> trichomes displayed aberrant cortical microtubules (cMTs) and actin filaments (F-actin) configurations. Moreover, genetic and biochemical analyses showed that TTG2 could directly bind to the promoter and regulate the expression of <span>BRICK1</span> (<span>BRK1</span>), which encodes a subunit of the actin nucleation promoting complex suppressor of cyclic AMP repressor (SCAR)/Wiskottâ€“Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE). Collectively, taking advantage of <span>ttg2-6</span>, we uncovered a function for TTG2 in facilitating cMTs and F-actin cytoskeleton-dependent trichome development, providing insight into cellular signaling events downstream of the core transcriptional regulation during trichome development in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"46e4cc5a3996103fd3bdf9b45ff14b3e93395b4e6c9171f3f98c1247cc2392fd","category":"Environment"}
