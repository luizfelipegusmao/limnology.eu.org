{"title":"Plant quiescence strategy and seed dormancy under hypoxia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/19/6047/7646181?rss=1","date":1713225600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant quiescence and seed dormancy can be triggered by reduced oxygen availability. Under water, oxygen depletion caused by flooding can culminate in a quiescent state, which is a plant strategy for energy preservation and survival. In adult plants, a quiescent state can be activated by sugar starvation, leading to metabolic depression. In seeds, secondary dormancy can be activated by reduced oxygen availability, which creates an unfavourable state for germination. The physical dormancy of some seeds and buds includes barriers to external conditions, which indirectly results in hypoxia. The molecular processes that support seed dormancy and plant survival through quiescence under hypoxia include the N-degron pathway, which enables the modulation of ethylene-responsive factors of group VII and downstream targets. This oxygen- and nitric oxide-dependent mechanism interacts with phytohormone-related pathways to control growth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7a261714a984902442638a13bb84a7215c96c3111d5db997b8ed55de93d81d0b","category":"Environment"}
