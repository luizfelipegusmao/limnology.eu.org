In this study, we report the synthesis and crystal growth of calcium and magnesium carbonate phases by using coprecipitation and hydrothermal methods. The obtained crystals were evaluated through structural, morphological and composition studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer, with the microscope JEOL JSM-7100F Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), using a JEOL JXA 8200 equipment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7b8300242174591aade553579cf29ad1bf9d8a8b6d9a8643b021fcddca70d733","category":"Environment"}
