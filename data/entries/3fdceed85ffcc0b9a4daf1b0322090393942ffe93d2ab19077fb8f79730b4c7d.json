{"title":"Perceiving Etruscan Art: AI and Visual Perception","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1086/v1","date":1728910315000,"content":"This research is part of the NeuroArtIfAct project []aimed at exploring the cognitive and emotional processes involved in perceiving Etruscan artifacts. This case study is focused on the Sarcophagus of the Spouses at the National Etruscan Museum in Rome. The study utilized AI and eye-tracking technology to analyze how viewers engage with the Etruscan Sarcophagus of the Spouses, revealing key patterns of visual attention and engagement. Open AI ChatGBT 4o was used in conjunction with Python in order to elaborate all the spreadsheets and data coming from the eye0tracking recording. Results showed that viewers primarily focused on the central figures, especially the faces and hands, indicating a high level of interest in the human elements of the artifact. The longer fixation durations on these features suggest that viewers find them particularly engaging, likely due to their detailed craftsmanship and symbolic significance. The eye-tracking data also highlighted specific gaze patterns, such as diagonal scanning across the sarcophagus, which reflects the composition's ability to guide viewer attention strategically. These findings suggest that the artifact's design effectively captures and directs viewer attention, emphasizing its cultural and emotional significance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fdceed85ffcc0b9a4daf1b0322090393942ffe93d2ab19077fb8f79730b4c7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
