This study tested specific hypotheses using portable and fixed passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagging systems to characterize the species’ long-term movement patterns. We hypothesized that movement would be size-dependent and exhibit seasonality. Our findings confirmed these hypotheses, showing most tracked individuals either migrated upstream, reflecting a size-dependent movement, remained stationary near the release point, or ventured downstream. Analysis revealed the total movement range to be approximately 69 m, consisting of a maximum upstream movement of 47.4 m and a downstream movement of 21.6 m. Notably, the cumulative and maximum distances traveled were positively correlated with the size of both male and female crayfish throughout the observation period. Seasonal patterns emerged as well, with some individuals, especially males, moving downstream during overwintering. This pioneering study reveals the seasonal movement patterns of Japanese crayfish for the first time, supporting the hypothesis of size-dependent and seasonal movement. These insights are crucial for developing targeted habitat and species conservation strategies.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"daf1115d0bfbf750c774e6de48e37c4360cd537dbdb5da7b2ff2fcd9bc33e6f6","category":"Environment"}
