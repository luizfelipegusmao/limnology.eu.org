{"title":"21 Trace mineral nutrition for grain-fed feedlot cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/73/7757090?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Trace minerals are essential dietary components for feedlot cattle diets. They are integral components for normal carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism and have been shown to be involved in hormone production, immunity, oxidation/reduction reactions, and cellular homeostasis. The functions of trace minerals in metabolic processes are extremely complex. In general, trace minerals function primarily as activators or components of enzymes that assist with enzyme structural integrity and/or substrate binding. Enzymes involved in the protection of cells from oxidative stress, electron transport, oxygen transport, bone metabolism, gene expression, and nutrient metabolism all have been shown to require certain trace elements for proper function. Trace minerals typically supplemented to feedlot cattle diets are cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iodine (I), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn). Although chromium (Cr) is not considered an essential nutrient in the Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle: National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, 2016) publication, it is currently being included in some feedlot diets. Absorption of trace minerals from the gastrointestinal tract and tissue distribution of trace minerals are tightly regulated. However, many factors can impact the response of an animal to trace mineral supplementation, such as the dose and duration of supplementation, physiological status of an animal, the absence or presence of dietary antagonists, basal diet trace mineral concentrations, environmental factors, microbial-mineral interactions, and stress. Several research groups have compared the impact of supplementing increased concentrations (greater than the NASEM requirements) of Co, Cu, Mn, Zn, I, Se, and Zn (concurrently) on feedlot cattle performance and carcass characteristics. Results of these experiments have been variable, and caution should be taken when comparing experiments. Increasing trace mineral concentrations above published requirements does not always improve feedlot performance and carcass characteristics but has been reported, in some studies, to increase dry matter intake and average daily gain during certain intervals of the feeding period. The variability in animal numbers, the inclusion or omission of a negative control treatment, dietary ingredients, growth technologies used, and basal diet availability of trace minerals make comparing these types of experiments difficult.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b9354bb729bdf3e37ceb28e7989dd559c7ab0f321d21161f63451fc721a6302c","category":"Environment"}
