{"title":"Influence of Knowledge and Cultural Beliefs on Attitudes Toward HPV Vaccination Among Israeli Nurses and Nursing Students: Implications for Vaccine Advocacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1212/v1","date":1726475696000,"content":"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) poses a significant health burden, yet the vaccine which successfully prevents HPV and its associated cancers remains underutilized. Nurses play a crucial role in patient education and advocacy for HPV vaccination. This study explores how knowledge, along with cultural, religious, and social beliefs, shapes the attitudes of Israeli nurses and nursing students toward the HPV vaccine and their advocacy efforts.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2023 to January 2024 using an anonymous online questionnaire distributed via Facebook groups targeting Israeli nurses and nursing students. The questionnaire assessed demographic data, HPV-related knowledge, and attitudes toward HPV vaccination.\nResults: The study included 458 participants (229 nurses and 229 nursing students). Significant knowledge gaps were found, with 52% of participants incorrectly believing that the vaccine can cure existing infections and 47% mistakenly believing that it is administered in a single dose. Logistic regression revealed that nurses working in community settings were more likely to have positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination (OR=2.98, 95% CI: 1.84–4.85). Higher levels of HPV-related knowledge (OR=3.35, 95% CI: 2.10–5.35) and secular or traditional religious affiliations (OR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.52–3.97) were strongly associated with positive attitudes toward and advocacy for the vaccine.\nConclusions: Targeted educational programs addressing knowledge gaps, especially those tailored to Israel's cultural and religious diversity, are crucial for empowering nurses and nursing students as advocates for HPV vaccination. Enhancing their understanding of HPV can increase vaccine uptake, reduce the incidence of HPV-related diseases, and strengthen public health initiatives in Israel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab6ac1ba7e075f365413cd2fdfcf8dd9e6ad04b4913e814bf0e8ff169e1889e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
