With the increasing complexity and frequency of security incidents, there is an escalating demand for development of innovative solutions beyond current human capabilities pertaining to cybersecurity measures.  Artificial Intelligence or AI can be utilized in a myriad of areas of cybersecurity.  It emerged as a technological innovation to enhance cyber protection by facilitating faster and real-time threat detection for known and unknown threats, automating processes to minimize human error, and optimal decision-making.  Harnessing the power of AI in cybersecurity creates formidable defense capabilities against the constantly changing cyber threats of future while empowering the cybersecurity personnel with threat intelligence and proactive foresight to safeguard critical assets and confidential information with unparalleled precision and effectiveness.  This research paper aims to investigate the potential of AI-enabled cybersecurity systems and focuses on deducing the benefits of using AI  in enhancing cybersecurity processes for organizations seeking to manage their risk profile.  Through a comprehensive literature review, the wide-ranging applications of AI in cybersecurity have been analyzed such as intrusion detection, predictive simulation, and automated emergency response management.  The study examines the benefits of implementing AI-based cyber defenses such as improved promptness and accuracy in vulnerability assessment and threat management, reduced false positives, and recognize patterns.  The future potential of AI in cybersecurity will take a leap forward in expanding protection mechanisms to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of attack vectors to prevent an adversarial attack.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bfe94070bf93eeaf2c38537ceed19eec4dbe04a87cf1398470731890f5b0ae9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
