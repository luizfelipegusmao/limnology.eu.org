{"title":"Diel Variations in Abundance of Microbial Communities in the Coastal Waters of the Subtropical Western Pacific in Spring: Potential Role of Picoeukaryotes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1866/v1","date":1716899235000,"content":"We used flow cytometry to follow diel variations of viruses, picoplankton, and nanoflagellates for 2 days with about 4 hours of temporal sampling in spring 2024 in coastal surface waters of the subtropical western Pacific. An event of wind change, associated with rainfall and increased turbulence, disrupted diel patterns of the overall microbial communities during the second cycle. We observed that bacterial abundance did not follow a consistent diel pattern and that viral abundance was positively correlated with bacterial abundance. Synechococcus spp. and Prochlorococcus spp. grew during the light period and with peak abundance at night, exhibited marked diel variability, however, opposite patterns were observed in picoeukaryotes. According to Synechococcus spp. and Prochlorococcus spp. diel changes, nanoflagellate grazing could control their abundances and may explain temporally varying picocyanobacterial abundances. As we observed in the culture experiments, the results showed a significant increase in picoeukaryotic abundance from noon to nighttime, and a decrease in bacterial abundance during nighttime, to show the prey-predator cycle. Our study suggests picoeukaryotes could serve as bacteria predators by being mixotrophs. Future studies aiming to understand the interactions between prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes within marine microbial communities should take these differences into account.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39400594095ab8ce024c56ea27427bb5c54efd6fe6a6de32bd5880861da67fa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
