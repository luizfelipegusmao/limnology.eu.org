{"title":"On the Damped Pinney Equation from Noether Symmetry Principles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1121/v1","date":1726378371000,"content":"There are several versions of the damped form of the celebrated Pinney equation, which is the natural partner of the undamped time-dependent harmonic oscillator. In this work these dissipative versions of the Pinney equation are briefly reviewed. We show that Noetherâ€™s theorem for the usual time-dependent harmonic oscillator as a guiding principle for derivation of the Pinney equation also works in the damped case, selecting a Noether symmetry based damped Pinney equation. The results are extended to general nonlinear damped Ermakov systems. A certain time-rescaling always allows to remove the damping from the final equations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f52b04304012c79862751c3ec55239e0e3ab90650a02d5aa41c72d0f1c794dbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
