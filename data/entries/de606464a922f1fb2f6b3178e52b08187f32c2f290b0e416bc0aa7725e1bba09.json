In this regard, field experiments were conducted in three phases <i>viz</i>., fertility gradient experiment, main experiment and validation experiment through a soil test crop response approach to develop and validate fertilizer prescription equations for sweet corn in comparison with general recommended dose and soil fertility rating approach. The soil data, fresh cob yield, and NPK uptake were used for establishing four important basic parameters, <i>viz</i>., nutrient requirement (kg t<sup>-1</sup>), contribution of nutrients from fertilizers, soil, and organic manure. The results revealed that nutrients required to produce one tonne of fresh cob yield (NR) were 5.85 kg, 0.87 kg and 4.31kg for N, P and K, respectively under the STCR NPK alone approach and 6.07 kg, 0.92 kg and 4.33 kg for N, P and K, respectively under STCR NPK+FYM approach. In the validation experiment, STCR NPK+FYM approach for the targeted yield of 25 t ha<sup>−1</sup> recorded higher fresh cob yield (23.38 t ha<sup>−1</sup>) and dry stover yield (35.07 t ha<sup>−1</sup>) which were significantly higher compared to general recommended dose and soil fertility rating approach. The developed STCR equations for the aforesaid crop are valid as the percent deviation of cob yield from the targeted yield was within ±10%. Similarly, highest nutrient use efficiency was achieved with the STCR approach, specifically when targeting a lower yield through an NPK+FYM mode. Thus, implementation of the STCR approach of fertilizer prescription, with or without FYM, at targeted yields of 25 and 22 t ha<sup>−1</sup>, not only surpassed the effects of the other fertilizer recommendation approach in terms of cob yields, but also increased NPK uptake, improved nutrient use efficiency and greater economic returns.","author":"Krishna Murthy Rangaiah","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"de606464a922f1fb2f6b3178e52b08187f32c2f290b0e416bc0aa7725e1bba09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
