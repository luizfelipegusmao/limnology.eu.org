{"title":"Post-Arthroplasty Spatiotemporal Gait Parameters in Patients with Hip Osteoarthritis or Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip: An Observational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0208/v1","date":1717566393000,"content":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a preferred treatment for primary osteoarthritis (OA) or secondary due to developmental hip dysplasia (DDH). Gait analysis is considered a golden standard for evaluating post-arthroplasty walking patterns. This study compared post-THA spatiotemporal gait parameters (SGPs) between OA and DDH patients and explored correlations with demographic and clinical variables. Thirty patients (15 per group) were recorded during gait, and their SGPs were analyzed. Functionality was evaluated with the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). The OA patients were significantly older than DDH (pr&lt; 0.51, all p&lt; 0.05). The preoperative gait alterations associated with OA or DDH were improved to similar levels in both groups after THA. Post-arthroplasty SGPs and OHS correlations indicate limitations in certain activities. These find-ings must be correlated with kinetic gait analysis data to fully evaluate gait and functionality dif-ferences among patient groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d9ae057b98a6d8455347703a92173aeaa7f51c409a012c8d91afa3c6be14ea5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
