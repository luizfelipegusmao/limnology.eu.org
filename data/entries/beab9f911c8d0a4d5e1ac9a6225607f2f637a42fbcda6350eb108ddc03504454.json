{"title":"Metastasis patterns and prognosis in young gastric cancer patients: A propensity score‑matched SEER database analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301834","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Hong Zhang, Xia Cheng, Wenqin Guo, Cheng Zheng, Yue Zhang, Xiaoying Jing, Hui Qiao</p>\r\nBackground <p>Whether young patients with metastatic gastric cancer (GC) had distinct metastasis patterns and survival outcomes from older patients remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to explore the metastasis patterns and prognostic factors in young patients and evaluate the survival outcome in comparison to their older counterparts.</p> Materials and methods <p>We identified patients with metastatic GC in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015. The patients were divided into two groups based on age at diagnosis: younger (≤40 years old) and older (&gt;40 years old). We employed the chi‐squared test to compare the clinicopathological characteristics between the two age groups. Furthermore, we conducted survival analyses using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses. To balance disparities in baseline characteristics, we employed propensity score matching (PSM).</p> Results <p>We identified 5,580 metastatic GC patients from the SEER database, with 237 (4.2%) classified as younger and 5343 (95.8%) as older patients. A total of 237 pairs of patients were generated after adjustment by PSM. Patients in the younger group exhibited a higher proportion of bone-only metastases and a lower proportion of liver-only metastases compared with patients in the older group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that youth was an independent protective factor for overall survival (OS) before and after PSM, but not for gastric cancer-specific survival (GCSS). Among the younger group, patients with liver-only metastasis demonstrated the best prognosis, whereas patients with lung-only metastasis exhibited significantly worse survival outcomes compared with liver-only metastases, even comparable to that of bone metastasis.</p> Conclusions <p>Compared with the older group, the metastatic GC patients in the younger group exhibited more aggressive tumors but better prognoses. The metastasis pattern and its effect on the prognosis of GC varied by age group.</p>","author":"Hong Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"beab9f911c8d0a4d5e1ac9a6225607f2f637a42fbcda6350eb108ddc03504454","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
