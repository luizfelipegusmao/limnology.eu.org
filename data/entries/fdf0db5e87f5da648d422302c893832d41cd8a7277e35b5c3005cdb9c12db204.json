{"title":"Integrated Analysis of Urban Heat Islands in Historical Heritage Contexts: The Case of Matera","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0860/v1","date":1720607979000,"content":"This study investigates the environmental parameters contributing to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in historically built environments, focusing on Matera's Street Canyon. The primary objective is to enhance understanding of heritage centers' ecological sustainability and management frameworks. The study involves two main phases: the initial research and development phase, including a comprehensive literature review and methodology development, followed by the empirical data gathering and analysis phase, utilizing advanced techniques such as 3D laser scanning, satellite imagery, and meteorological data integration. Key findings reveal significant correlations between urban morphology, material properties, and UHI intensity, suggesting stra-tegic urban planning interventions to mitigate UHI effects. This research provides actionable in-sights for urban planners and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of balancing heritage preservation with modern sustainability needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdf0db5e87f5da648d422302c893832d41cd8a7277e35b5c3005cdb9c12db204","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
