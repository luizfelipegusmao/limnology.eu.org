{"title":"A Decision Support Tool Integrating Data and Advanced Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1869/v1","date":1727171995000,"content":"\"Politography\" refers to the study or portrayal of political events, figures, and systems. It is used to analyze political trends, to visualize data, and create a data driven narrative. Decision support tools (DST) for policy makers tend to be narrowly defined in terms of specific domain applications. In this work, we describe the design and construction of a DST related to intergroup conflict management and resolution, focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It provides a case study that can be generalized to other applications. The DST, labeled T-Politography, integrates over 9000 indicators pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in a hierarchical structure that begins with the specific geographical areas influenced by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These include geographical areas: A, B, and C in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The designated areas have distinct legal status specified in the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians Authority (PA). The second level of the DST hierarchy consists of three domains that characterize Israeli and Palestinian levels of control, in each one of the geographic areas: security, geo-spatial, and economic. In addition, the T-Politography DST contains contextual data relevant to the Israeli and Palestinian control such as political, diplomatic, social, and legal domains. Each domain is designated as influencing either Israeli or Palestinian Authority (PA) control and is further subdivided into categories. For example, the geo-spatial domain is one of the categories covering Israeli demographics in Area C. Each category is represented by a set of specific indicators, e.g., Israeli birth rates in Area C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"835661b3fae7a542652ba8d9d4a64ef16ec55722d808a56ad7cee9d1d3022c09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
