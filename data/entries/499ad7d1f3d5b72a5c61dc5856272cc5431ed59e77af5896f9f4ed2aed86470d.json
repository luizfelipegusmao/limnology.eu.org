{"title":"Geometric Analysis of Superquadrics in Small-Angle Scattering: A Comprehensive Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0018/v1","date":1722502500000,"content":"This study presents a detailed investigation of the application of superquadrics in small-angle scattering (SAS), a technique essential in materials science, biology, and physics for investigating structural properties at the nanoscale and microscale. Superquadrics, a family of geometric shapes known for their versatility in representing a wide range of forms, are employed to model complex structures in SAS studies. We examine the parametric nature of superquadrics and their ability to efficiently describe shapes from simple balls to intricate star-like forms. We demonstrate the application of superquadrics through a rigorous analysis of SAS simulated data, including scattering intensity patterns and pair-distance distribution functions. This allows us to reveal insights into key structural characteristics of various materials, such as the size and shape. We also demonstrate the efficacy of superquadrics in accurately modeling experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data from a chimeric protein complex, showcasing their potential in biological systems analysis. The findings offer a robust framework for future research and application in diverse fields, including materials science, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"499ad7d1f3d5b72a5c61dc5856272cc5431ed59e77af5896f9f4ed2aed86470d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
