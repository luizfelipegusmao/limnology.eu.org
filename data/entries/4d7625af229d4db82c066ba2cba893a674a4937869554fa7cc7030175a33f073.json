{"title":"Synergistic Effects of Incobotulinum Toxin and Physiotherapy in a Rare Case of Paraparesis in a 7-Years-Old Affected by Klippel-Feil Syndrome Related to MYH3 Gene Mutation: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0766/v1","date":1725974454000,"content":"Klippel-Feil disease is a condition characterized by a defect in the spine, consisting in the fusion or non-separation of two or more vertebrae of the cervical tract. It usually affects 1 every 50.000 newborns, and the pathogenesis remains unknown to date, although the role of certain genes deputed in segmentation processes is being studied. A single case of gene Myosin Heavy Chain 3 (MYH3) mutation is described by researchers. Affected patients are often characterized by a relatively short neck and, therefore, poor mobility, a low hairline and obesity and may have other health problems of different nature. The frequent presence of comorbidities worsens the quality of life of these young patients. The following case describes the synergistic effect of Incobotulinum toxin type A and physiotherapy in a small patient with MYH3 mutation-related Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS) complicated by bilateral paraplegia, to improve the spasticity condition of the lower limbs. To assess improvements over time, the patient underwent rating scales to determine spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale: MAS), the neck’s range of motion (ROM), and muscle tone by using MyotonProÒ. Specifically, measurements were taken on the day of the first medical examination (T0), the month after the injection and the startup of therapeutic exercise (T1), at three months (T2), and then once a month for a total of 6 months (T3, T4 and T5). This therapeutic approach led to entirely satisfactory results with the child’s well-being, prolonged until the sixth month and with a total absence of any side effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d7625af229d4db82c066ba2cba893a674a4937869554fa7cc7030175a33f073","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
