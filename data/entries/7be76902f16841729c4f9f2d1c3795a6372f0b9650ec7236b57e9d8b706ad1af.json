{"title":"Perceptions and attitudes towards unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) use for delivery of HIV medication among fisher folk communities on the Islands of Kalangala, Uganda","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003468","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Jackie Lydia N. Ssemata, Rachel King, Patrick Ssesaazi, Agnes Bwanika Naggirinya, Joshua Beinomugisha, Rosalind Parkes-Ratanshi</p>\r\n\r\nThe study aimed to assess the attitudes of stakeholders towards the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (medical drones) for delivering antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Kalangala district of Uganda, which is comprised of 84 islands and has approximately 18,500 People Living with HIV (PLHIV). A qualitative baseline study was conducted to assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a medical drone for ART delivery in the island settlements of Kalangala Islands. The data revealed four emerging themes: knowledge about the drones, perceived benefits of medical drone delivery, perceived risks of medical drone use, and recommendations for future use. The study found that most participants, especially healthcare workers and key opinion leaders, were aware of the medical drones, which could reduce transport costs, deliver medication on time, and reduce healthcare workersâ€™ workload. However, there were also perceived risks related to the use of medical drones, such as stigma, reduced contact with healthcare providers, and maintenance and security issues. The study provided evidence that medical drones would be acceptable and have support from various stakeholders in the island settlements for ART delivery. However, concerns were raised about potential stigma and less health worker interaction. This qualitative work allowed the team to address these concerns during the pilot phase.","author":"Jackie Lydia N.
