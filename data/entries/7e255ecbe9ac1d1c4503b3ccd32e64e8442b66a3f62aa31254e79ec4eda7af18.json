{"title":"Cadmium Ion Removal From Wastewater Utilizing Biomass-Based Materials: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1368/v1","date":1721198136000,"content":"The world is struggling with the increasing rate at which water bodies are constantly polluted due to rapid modernization and industrialization. The different types of water contaminants include both anthropogenic and natural contaminants. Environmentalists are mainly concerned about heavy metals such as cadmium ions, as they are considered poisonous and carcinogenic even if they are present at a minimum concentration, and they are considered an immediate concern, according to the World Health Organization. Recently, many methods, such as solvent extraction, ion exchange, electrochemical precipitation, and reverse osmosis, have been developed to remove heavy metals from wastewater. These methods have been reported to be expensive and inefficient; hence, more cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative strategies are needed. Amidst these challenges, a ray of hope emerges in the form of biosorbents. These abundant, eco-friendly, and cost-efficient materials have shown promise as an alternative method for removing heavy metals from wastewater. They are equipped with functional groups that can effectively absorb metal ions onto their surfaces, offering a potential solution to our water contamination woes. This review is significant as it delves into the potential use of several biosorbents to decontaminate cadmium ions from wastewater.
