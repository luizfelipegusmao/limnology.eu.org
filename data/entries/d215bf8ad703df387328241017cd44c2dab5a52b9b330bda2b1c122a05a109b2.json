{"title":"414 Design thinking for engaged learning (DTEL) in animal science: Data-driven considerations to improve student and instructor experiences","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/419/7757327?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Design thinking for engaged learning (DTEL) is a framework developed to structure learning experiences based on collaborative project-based instruction and to engage students in creative problem solving. Despite being successful in providing meaningful learning experiences, the logistics of DTEL implementation can be difficult, especially in large courses (100+ students). Research is warranted to elucidate and facilitate DTEL utilization in different disciplines. Based on this, the present study utilized a design-based research approach involving 5 semesters of implementing DTEL in an animal science capstone course. Briefly, the main learning objectives of the course were for students to develop skills in collaborative work, independent research, communication (written and oral) and, especially, to be able to demonstrate transferrable knowledge from their previous coursework. Across 5 semesters (spring 2021 to spring 2023), student reflections assignments (n = 276) were coded and analyzed qualitatively to identify aspects that worked well or that students struggled with. Network analysis was utilized to visualize relationships (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05; Q &gt; 0.4) between codes representing strengths, struggles, and alignment with principles from learning theories. Utilizing the relationships between strengths and theory-based principles to address struggles, resulted in changes to the design of the capstone course each semester, consecutively. Alignment of student experiences with principles from learning theories grew from the first semester to the last (theory-related nodes representing 11.4% vs. 24.4% in each network map, respectively), with learning theories also occupying more central positions in the map resulting from the last semester analysis (spring 2023) compared with earlier ones (spring 2021 through fall 2022). These changes suggest student experiences increasingly aligned with principles of cognitive constructivism, social constructivism, constructionism, situated learning, and transformative learning. Additionally, the analysis of studentsâ€™ reflections throughout these 5 semesters of animal science senior capstone resulted in generalizable design principles to facilitate the implementation of DTEL in other animal science courses, especially in large class sizes (100+ students). The design principles derived from this 5-semester study include: 1) allocating most time to hands-on lab work versus lecture, 2) designating a coordinator faculty, 3) scaffolding for instructors unfamiliar with DTEL, 4) emphasizing consistency in processes over grades, and 5) intentionally developing teamwork skills. The study demonstrates the value of design-based research for iteratively refining and studying learning experiences to foster critical skills for undergraduate students in animal science.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d215bf8ad703df387328241017cd44c2dab5a52b9b330bda2b1c122a05a109b2","category":"Environment"}
