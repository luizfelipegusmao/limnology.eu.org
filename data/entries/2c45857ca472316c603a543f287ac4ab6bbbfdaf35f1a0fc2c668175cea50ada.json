{"title":"Identification of the Carboxylesterase, Nl-EST1 Gene Expression Regulation Possibly Involved in Carbamate Insecticide Resistance in Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1100/v1","date":1723771997000,"content":"Carbamate insecticides have been used for over four decades to control brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, but resistance has been reported in many countries, including Korea. The test results on resistance to fenobucarb showed that the LC50 values were 3.08 for the susceptible strain, 10.61 for the 2015 population, and 73.98 for the 2019 population. Compared to the susceptible strain, the 2015 and 2019 populations exhibited resistance levels 3.4 and 24.2 times higher, respectively. To elucidate the reason for the varying levels of resistance to fenobucarb in these populations, mutations in the ace1 gene, the target site of carbamate, were investigated, but no previously reported mutations were confirmed. Through RNAseq analysis focusing on the expression of detoxification enzyme genes as an alternative resistance mechanism, it was found that the carboxylesterase gene Nl-EST1 was overexpressed 2.4 times in the 2015 population and 4.7 times in the 2019 population compared to the susceptible strain. This indicates a strong correlation between the level of resistance development in each population and the expression level of Nl-EST1. Previously, Nl-EST1 was reported in an organophosphorus insecticide-resistant strain of Sri Lanka 2000. Thus, Nl-EST1 is crucial for developing resistance to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides. Resistance-related genes such as Nl-EST1 could serve as expression markers for resistance diagnosis, and it can apply to integrated resistance management of N. lugens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c45857ca472316c603a543f287ac4ab6bbbfdaf35f1a0fc2c668175cea50ada","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
