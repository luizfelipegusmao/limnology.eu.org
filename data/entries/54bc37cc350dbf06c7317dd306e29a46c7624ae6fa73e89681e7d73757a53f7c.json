{"title":"Influence of Environmental Factors on the Dynamics and Toxicology of Microcystis and Anabaena in Eutrophic Ponds","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/8826738?af=R","date":1721308884000,"content":"<p>Blooms of <i>Microcystis</i> are common in fish ponds in Bangladesh which vary distinctly with season to season. A study on the seasonal changes of <i>Microcystis</i> and <i>Anabaena</i> was carried out over a period of 12 months from March 2021 to February 2022 in two rural fish ponds to see the effect of environmental factors on the seasonal dynamics of these two species. Cyanobacterial community comprised of seven genera and 15 species of which <i>Microcystis</i> was found to be the most dominant genus. Overabundance of <i>Microcyctis</i> may suppress the growth of <i>Anabaena</i> and other microalgal species. In both ponds, <i>Microcyctis</i> was found to be the dominant during the summer and the spring, whereas <i>Anabaena</i> was only characterized in summer. Moderately higher temperature, nitrate–nitrogen, and phosphate–phosphorus enrichment increased the biomass of both <i>Microcystis</i> and <i>Anabaena</i>. Microcystin was found in all the seasons with the highest quantity in summer in the cyanobacteria samples collected from both of the ponds. The highest concentrations of MCs were 22 and 65 <i>μ</i>g/L of the sampled water during the peak bloom period of blue-green algae in pond 1 and pond 2, respectively. The high concentration of microcystin in water seems to be a pernicious warning for aquatic organisms as well as human health. Further studies in detail on the relationship between microcystin and cyanobacterial growth under different environmental factors seem to be necessary.</p>","author":"Sunzida Sultana, \nSaleha Khan, \nZinia Rahman, \nSadia Momota Hena, \nMd Sayem Ahmed, \nMd Mahfuzul Haque, \nYahia Mahmud, \nChristyn Bailey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"54bc37cc350dbf06c7317dd306e29a46c7624ae6fa73e89681e7d73757a53f7c","category":"Environment"}
