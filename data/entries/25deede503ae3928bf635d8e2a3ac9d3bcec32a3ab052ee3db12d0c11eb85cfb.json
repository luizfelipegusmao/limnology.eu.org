{"title":"A LiDAR-based Yaw Control for Wind Turbines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0366/v1","date":1728292424000,"content":"In this study, we investigate a yaw control strategy in a two-turbine wind farm with 3.5 MW turbines, aiming to optimize power management. The wind farm is equipped with a nacelle-mounted multi-plane LiDAR system for wind speed measurements. Using an analytical model and integrating LiDAR and SCADA data, we estimate wake effects and power output. Our results show a 2% power gain achieved through optimal yaw control over a year-long assessment. The wind predominantly blows from the southwest, perpendicular to the turbine alignment. The optimal yaw and power gain depend on wind conditions, with higher turbulence intensity and wind speed leading to reduced gains. The power gain follows a bell curve across the range of wind inflow angles, peaking at 1.7% with a corresponding optimal yaw of 17 degrees at an inflow angle of 12 degrees. Further experiments are recommended to refine the estimates and enhance the performance of wind farms through optimized yaw control strategies, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25deede503ae3928bf635d8e2a3ac9d3bcec32a3ab052ee3db12d0c11eb85cfb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
