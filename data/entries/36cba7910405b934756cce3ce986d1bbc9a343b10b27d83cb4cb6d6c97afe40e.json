{"title":"The Response of Cloud Precipitation Efficiency to Warming during a Rainstorm Corridor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0761/v1","date":1726018763000,"content":"Due to model errors caused by local variations in cloud precipitation processes, there are still significant uncertainties in current predictions and simulations of short-duration heavy rainfall. To tackle this problem, the effects of warming on cloud-precipitation efficiency was analyzed utilizing a weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The analysis focused on a rainstorm corridor event that took place in July 2020. Rainstorm events from July 4 to 6 formed a narrow rain belt with precipitation exceeded 300 mm in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Temperature sensitivity tests revealed that warming intensified the potential temperature gradient between north and south, leading to stronger upward motion on the front. It also strengthened the southwest wind, which also resulting in more pronounced precipitation peaks. Warming led to a stronger accumulation and release of convective instability energy. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) increased correspondingly with the temperature. The precipitation efficiency increased sequentially with 2â„ƒ warming to 27.4%, 31.2% and 33.1%. Warming can affect the cloud precipitation efficiency by both promoting and suppressing convective activity, which may be one of the reasons for the enhancement of extreme precipitation under global warming. The diagnostic relationship between upward moisture flux and lower atmospheric stability during precipitation evolution was also revealed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36cba7910405b934756cce3ce986d1bbc9a343b10b27d83cb4cb6d6c97afe40e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
