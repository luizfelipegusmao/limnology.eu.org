{"title":"Composites of Betalain Dye and Wide-Energy Gap Polymers for Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0132/v1","date":1712035364000,"content":"Organic solar cells are contributing extensively to the production of future large area and cost-effective sources of renewable energy with a compact environmental impact. Moreover, due to tunable optical properties of the active medium, the semi-transparent organic solar cell can be fabricated and become a promising nominee for building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), vehicles, and mobile electronic devices. Therefore, three newly synthesized polymers used as were host materials for the active medium and blended with beetroot dye. Hence, based on BHJ structure two ternary systems have been constructed and utilized to fabricate semitransparent solar cells and characterized. The results show that the natural dye has a crucial impact on solar cell characteristic parameters. Consequently, large value of V_OC close to 1V were obtained for ternary systems and acceptor material named PINDOLE exhibits potentials for electron transport layer (ETL) and shows an improvement in both fill factor and device efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1eef60afa33aa103d16680185ca6a0b6207dd9b06a13e28064fff3a11f34185c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
