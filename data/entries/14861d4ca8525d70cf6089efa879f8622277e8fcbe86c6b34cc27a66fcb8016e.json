{"title":"Enhanced Microgrid Control through Genetic Predictive Control: Integrating Genetic Algorithms with Model Predictive Control for Improved Non-Linearity and Non-Convexity Handling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0637/v1","date":1723155416000,"content":"Microgrid (MG) control is essential for efficient, reliable, and sustainable energy management in distributed energy systems. Genetic Algorithm-based energy management systems (GA-EMS) can optimally control a MG by finding global optima and handling complex, non-linear, and non-convex problems, but they can be computationally intensive, making real-time control challenging. Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based EMS predicts future behaviour over a defined horizon, ensuring optimal performance and constraint satisfaction but typically relies on linear models. This paper proposes a novel Genetic Predictive Control (GPC) method, combining GA and MPC to enhance resource allocation, balance multiple objectives, and adapt dynamically to changing conditions. Integrating GA with MPC significantly improves the handling of non-linearities and non-convexity in the system model, leading to more accurate and effective control. Comparative analysis shows that GPC significantly reduces excess power production—surplus power generated beyond load demand—improving resource allocation efficiency. For instance, in the Mutation–Random Selection scenario, GPC reduced excess power to 76.0W compared to 87.0W with GA. Additionally, GPC balances cost, emissions, and power efficiency. In the Crossover-Elitism scenario, GPC achieved a daily cost of $113.94 compared to GA's $127.80, and carbon emissions of 52.83 kg CO2e compared to GA's 69.71 kg CO2e, demonstrating GPC's cost efficiency and environmental benefits. While MPC optimizes a weighted sum of objectives, designing appropriate weights can be challenging and may result in non-convex problems. GA handles multiple, conflicting objectives through multi-objective optimization, providing Pareto-optimal solutions. GPC's dynamic adaptability maintains optimal performance by forecasting future load demands and adjusting control actions. GPC consistently achieves lower emissions than GA across various scenarios and, although it sometimes incurs higher costs, such as $113.94 compared to $131.90 in the Crossover–Random Selection scenario, its holistic approach balances these costs with other metrics, making it cost-effective in the long run. By reducing excess power production and emissions, GPC contributes to economic savings and promotes sustainable practices. These findings underscore GPC's potential as a versatile, efficient, and environmentally beneficial optimization tool for power generation systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14861d4ca8525d70cf6089efa879f8622277e8fcbe86c6b34cc27a66fcb8016e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
