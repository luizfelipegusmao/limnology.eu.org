{"title":"Niche structure and habitat shifts for coastal sharks of the US Southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12676?af=R","date":1716095052000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding spatial ecology and predicting animal movements in response to environmental changes, such as anthropogenic climate change and multidecadal variability, is critical for effective conservation strategies. Niche structuring is key to some coastal shark species and size classes coexisting in the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico to limit interspecific and intraspecific interaction. Data from four fishery-independent bottom longline surveys were used to evaluate the abiotic ecological niches of eight species of small and large coastal sharks. Gaussian mixture models separated length composition data into 14 size categories for ecological niche analysis. Generalized additive mixed effect models were fit and coupled with output from dynamic high-resolution ocean models to predict suitable abiotic habitats, evaluate potential shifts in distribution, and explore the impacts of large-scale climatological trends on abiotic habitats from 1994 to 2019. The abiotic niche for small coastal sharks generally tended toward warmer, high salinity, shallow bottom waters close to shore. No overarching niche was found for large coastal sharks, but appreciable ontogenetic differences were seen. Most taxa analyzed exhibited declining annual trends in higher quality habitats, particularly during fall months. The analysis provided evidence of shifts north along the Atlantic, to deeper offshore waters in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, and the potential to redistribute in response to multidecadal climate variability for multiple species. The analytical framework described could aid in developing various spatiotemporal management measures, and results provide insight into the habitat characteristics of several species over broad spatiotemporal ranges and through ontogeny.</p>","author":"Kaitlyn A.
