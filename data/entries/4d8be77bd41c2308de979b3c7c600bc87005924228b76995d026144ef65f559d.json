{"title":"Microplastics and Their Impact on Human Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0032/v1","date":1725275811000,"content":"Abstract\nIncreasing awareness of the potential health risks associated with microplastics (MPs) presence in the environment has led to significant rise in research focused on these particles over the past few years. This review focuses on research on MPs presence and spread, pathways of exposure and toxicological effects on human health and legal framework related to MP challenges. Several research projects have aimed to assess their potential harm to human health. Toxicological effects have been noticed at high concentrations of MPs, specifically polystyrene, the most widespread typical MP, but only short-term effects have been mostly studied. Significant quantities of consumed MP have been discovered to have diverse detrimental effects, posing a threat to human welfare. The exact concentrations of microplastics that are inhaled and swallowed and then build up in the human body are still not known. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the impact of MP contamination at minimal concentrations and for prolonged durations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d8be77bd41c2308de979b3c7c600bc87005924228b76995d026144ef65f559d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
