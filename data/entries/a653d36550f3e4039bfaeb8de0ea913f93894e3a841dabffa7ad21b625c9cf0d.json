{"title":"The Soft Palate Enables Extreme Feeding and Explosive Breathing in the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae026/7710111?rss=1","date":1720483200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The evolution of lunge feeding in rorqual whales was associated with the evolution of several unique morphological features that include non-synovial ligamentous temporomandibular joints, a tongue that can invert and extend backward to the umbilicus, walls of the oral cavity that can dramatically expand, and muscles and nerves that are stretchy. Also, among the acquired features was an enlargement of the rostral end of the soft palate into an oral plug that occludes the opening between the oral cavity and pharynx and prevents water incursion into the pharynx during the engulfment phase of a feeding lunge. During this engulfment phase of a lunge, the volume of water entering the oral cavity can exceed the volume of the whale itself. Here, using dissection of fetuses and adults and a magnetic resonance imaging dataset of a fetus, we examine the detailed anatomy of the soft palate in fin whales. We describe several innovative features relative to other mammals, including changes in the attachment and positions of the major extrinsic muscles of the palate, alterations in the morphology of the pterygoid processes related to the palate and pharynx, and the presence of distinct muscle layers in the part of the palate caudal to the oral plug. Based on the anatomy, we present a model for how the soft palate is positioned at rest, and how it functions during feeding, breathing, and swallowing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"a653d36550f3e4039bfaeb8de0ea913f93894e3a841dabffa7ad21b625c9cf0d","category":"Environment"}
