Over the last years, AFM-IR has been developed with different AFM modes: the Resonance Enhanced and the Surface Sensitive modes are based on contact mode, while Tapping AFM-IR is built on tapping mode of the AFM probe [<a href=\"#ozae044.292-B1\">1</a>]. Peak Force Tapping based Peak Force infrared (PFIR) microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.292-B2\">2</a>] also joined as one major AFM-IR mode. All these AFM-IR modes inherit the advantages and limitations of their respective AFM base mode. In this work, we focus on the capabilities offered by a PFIR-related approach, and illustrate those with results on a variety of polymer samples. We discuss (i) the capability to perform simultaneous multimodal imaging collecting both chemical information and mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, (ii) methods to understand and decouple artifacts induced by variations in mechanical properties from the AFM-IR data, and (iii) the combination with other AFM-IR techniques such as the Surface Sensitive mode while, at the same time, minimizing lateral forces to allow one to study soft &amp; fragile samples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"73039c8dbda5e8be0f6f86cdd00c4b321aafa40f72457f07d0ae52f33c9ae704","category":"Environment"}
