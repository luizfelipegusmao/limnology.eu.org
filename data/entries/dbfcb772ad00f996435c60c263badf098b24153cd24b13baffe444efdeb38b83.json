{"title":"311 Effect of feeding butyric acid on growth performance and metabolic indicators of dairy calves before weaning: A meta-analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/61/7757109?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding butyric acid (BA) on growth performance and metabolic indicators in dairy calves. A literature search was conducted to identify in vivo research studies carried out on BA supplementation in dairy calves. Inclusion criteria were in vivo studies, dairy calves, weaning, BA, and inclusion doses of BA. Twenty-three papers with 80 data and 1,132 calves were selected. Data extracted included the number of calves in control and treatment groups and measures of variance of responses (standard error or standard deviation). The response variables were production performance including body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) feed efficiency (FE), and metabolic indicators including blood glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations. A random effect of model was used to examine the raw mean difference and standardized mean difference between BA supplementation and the control group. The analysis was conducted using the metafor package of Rstudio. Butyric acid moderately improved the growth performance and metabolic indicators responses of calves with substantial heterogeneity (59 &lt; I<sup>2</sup> &lt; 73%, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Final BW and ADG were increased by 2.7 kg and 48.1 g/day, or &gt; 0.6 and &gt; 0.4 standard deviation units (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), respectively. However, FE was increased by BA supplementation but not significantly different. For metabolic indicators, glucose concentration was greater with BA supplementation with &gt; 0.4 standard deviation unit, (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). However, BA supplementation did not affect the blood concentration of BHB (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, the meta-analysis results demonstrated that BA constitutes an important energy source for dairy calves. Butyric acid is effective in promoting growth performance and intestinal health and, yet, increasing production profits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dbfcb772ad00f996435c60c263badf098b24153cd24b13baffe444efdeb38b83","category":"Environment"}
