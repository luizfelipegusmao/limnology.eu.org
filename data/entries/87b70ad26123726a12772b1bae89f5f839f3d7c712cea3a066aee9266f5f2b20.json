{"title":"Investigation of the Effects of Process Variables on Compressive Strength and Shatter Index of Briquettes Produced from Abura (Mitrogyna ciliata) Sawdust using Response Surface Methodology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0617/v1","date":1715266804000,"content":"Efficient utilization of biomass requires conversion into forms that can be optimally applied in energy generation. Briquetting involves compaction of biomass into solid blocks that are more efficient than raw biomass and provides for ease of transport and handling. These are improved when the briquettes possess high shatter index and compressive strength. Due to difference in nature and composition, it is imperative to define optimum conditions for the production of quality and durable briquettes for individual biomass compacted into briquettes. This study studied the effects of process variables on the strength and durability of biomass briquettes produced using Abura sawdust. The lateral compressive strength and drop shatter index were investigated whilst varying the temperature (100-150 Â°C), pressure (9-15 MPa) and hold time (15-30 min). The compressive strength ranged between 2.06 and 5.15 MPa whilst the shatter index was between 50 and 600. The pressure was significant to the determination of the compressive strength (p &amp;lt; 0.1) and the shatter index (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Mechanical characteristics of the binderless Abura sawdust briquettes can be improved by optimizing the densification variables during the briquetting process when moderate pressures are used for compaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87b70ad26123726a12772b1bae89f5f839f3d7c712cea3a066aee9266f5f2b20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
