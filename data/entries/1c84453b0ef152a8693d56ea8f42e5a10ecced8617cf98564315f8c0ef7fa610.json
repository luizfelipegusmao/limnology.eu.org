{"title":"Nuclear Evidences for Confirming the Physical Existence of 585 GeV Weak Fermion and Galactic Observations of TeV Radiation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1643/v1","date":1726873047000,"content":"Background: In our recent publications pertaining to 4G model of final unification and based on strong and electroweak interactions, we have proposed the existence of a weak fermion of rest energy 585 GeV. Objective: To confirm the physical existence of the proposed 585 GeV weak fermion by analyzing weak and strong interactions in a unified approach via 4G model of final unification, super symmetry and string theory. Method: Considering the proposed nuclear charge of 2.95e, proton, electron mass ratio, specific charge ratios of proton and electron, Fermi’s weak coupling constant, Reduced Planck’s constant, nucleon magnetic moments, nuclear stability, nuclear binding energy, nuclear mass and neutron lifetime, it is planned to confirm the physical existence of the proposed 585 GeV weak fermion. Results: All proposed logics and formulae clearly establish the physical existence of 585 GeV weak fermion directly and indirectly. Conclusion: Believing in the physical existence of the proposed 585 GeV weak fermion, there is a scope for observing galactic TeV radiation coming by virtue of annihilation of 585 GeV fermions and radiation associated with various astrophysical acceleration mechanisms of 585 GeV fermions. Appeal: As we are beginners of astrophysics domain, we appeal the science community to see the possibility of considering the proposed 585 GeV weak fermion with a charge of $\\pm\\left(e\\right)$ in place of electron and proton.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c84453b0ef152a8693d56ea8f42e5a10ecced8617cf98564315f8c0ef7fa610","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
