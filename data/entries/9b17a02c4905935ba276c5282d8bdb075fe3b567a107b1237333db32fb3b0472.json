These devices are typically composed of a series of nanoscale quantum wells with varying alloying and dopant concentrations to achieve specific bandgap values. Although optical methods can provide better energy resolution, measuring the local bandgap in these devices requires the high spatial resolution provided by the nanoscale probe in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Extraction of the bandgap from EELS is complicated and time-consuming due to the presence of other low loss signals such as surface plasmons, Cherenkov radiation and guided light excitation. It is critical to establish a quick way to check the bandgap at nanoscale without interrupting the fast-paced workflow required in industry. The complexity of this task increases when dealing with structures consisting of different materials. In this work, we demonstrate an automated bandgap measurement process applied to a complex semiconductor heterostructure composed of three types of materials commonly found in optoelectronic devices: a III-nitride multilayer stack, indium tin oxide (ITO) and SiO<sub>2</sub>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9b17a02c4905935ba276c5282d8bdb075fe3b567a107b1237333db32fb3b0472","category":"Environment"}
