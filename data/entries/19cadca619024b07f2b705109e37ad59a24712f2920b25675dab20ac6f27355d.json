Here, we present high-resolution planktic foraminiferal proxies combined with Artificial Neural Network based-sea-surface temperature (SST) and ice-rafted detritus records from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1385, SW Iberian Margin for the intervals representing MIS 8 deglaciation, MIS 7 interglacial complex and MIS 6 glacial inception. The long-term SST pattern is modulated by insolation and precession parameters across the MIS 7 interglacial complex and is superimposed by the millennial-scale variability (stadials at ∼250, ∼243, ∼230, ∼221, ∼203, ∼196 and ∼192 ka). The regional SST records indicate high temperature gradient (∼6°C) between the sub-polar North Atlantic Ocean and the SW Iberian Margin during MIS 7d which enhanced the moisture transport from mid-to-high latitudes. Further, low obliquity with low insolation induced cooling at high latitudes and promoted the expansion of ice-sheets during MIS 7d. Comparison of our faunal proxies with the published marine and terrestrial records from SW Europe and western Mediterranean Sea suggested a weakening and southward shift of Azores High (AH) pressure system, similar to the present-day (−) NAO-like atmospheric configuration during the early phases of MIS 7e, MIS 7c and MIS 7a, resulting reduced surface productivity of SW Iberian Margin. During the late phases of MIS 7e, MIS 7c and MIS 7a, the AH pressure system strengthened and shifted northward causing the intensification of the trade winds, a scenario similar to present-day (+) NAO-like atmospheric configuration, which resulted in high surface productivity of SW Iberian Margin.</p>","author":"Harshit Singh, \nArun Deo Singh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"19cadca619024b07f2b705109e37ad59a24712f2920b25675dab20ac6f27355d","category":"Environment"}
