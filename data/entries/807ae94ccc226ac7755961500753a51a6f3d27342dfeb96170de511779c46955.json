{"title":"Development of a Sensitive and Reliable Immunoassay to Quantify TDP-43 in Human Biofluids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0984/v1","date":1726125366000,"content":"Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a major component of pathological inclusions in various neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The detection of TDP-43 in biofluids is crucial for the development of diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease and therapeutic development for TDP-43 related proteinopathies. Despite its potential as a biomarker for numerous neurological disorders, the lack of a sensitive and reproducible TDP-43 assay hinders progress in TDP-43-based therapy development, underscoring the need for an effective and standardized method for accurate quantification. In this study, we developed and validated a sensitive immunoassay for the detection of TDP-43 in human biofluids using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. We used this immunoassay to quantify TDP-43 levels in the plasma and serum of healthy controls and ALS patients. Our results indicate a reduction of total TDP-43 in the blood of ALS patients compared to healthy controls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"807ae94ccc226ac7755961500753a51a6f3d27342dfeb96170de511779c46955","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
