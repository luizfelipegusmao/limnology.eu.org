{"title":"A Hybrid Conv-LSTM-Attention Framework for Short-Term PV Power Forecasting Incorporating Data from Neighboring Stations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0318/v1","date":1715042617000,"content":"To enhance the safety of power grid operations, this study proposes a high-precision short-term photovoltaic power prediction method that integrates information from surrounding pho-tovoltaic stations and the Conv-LSTM-ATT model. In the deep learning prediction model, not only is numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the target photovoltaic station used as input features, but also highly correlated features from nearby photovoltaic stations are incor-porated. The research begins by analyzing the correlation between irradiance and power se-quences, along with distance factors, to calculate a composite similarity index between the target and other regional photovoltaic stations. Stations with high similarity indices are then selected as data sources. Subsequently, Bayesian optimization techniques are employed to find the optimal data fusion ratios. Ultimately, using the selected data, power prediction mod-eling is conducted via the Conv-LSTM-ATT deep neural network. Experimental results con-firm the superiority of the proposed model, which demonstrates higher predictive accuracy compared to three other classical models. The data fusion strategy determined by Bayesian optimization significantly enhances prediction accuracy, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) of the test set by 20.04%, 28.24%, and 30.94% for three weather types, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"772e5ef70f588f462bfcf23e95c328064eb8fd93dc749297e8e3c4822e8b72cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
