{"title":"Ecophysiological and genomic approaches to cyanobacterial hardening for restoration","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13436?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cyanobacteria inhabit extreme environments, including drylands, providing multiple benefits to the ecosystem. Soil degradation in warm drylands is increasing due to land use intensification. Restoration methods adapted to the extreme stress in drylands are being developed, such as cyanobacteria inoculation to recover biocrusts. For this type of restoration method to be a success, it is crucial to optimize the survival of inoculated cyanobacteria in the field. One strategy is to harden them to be acclimated to stressful conditions after laboratory culturing. Here, we analyzed the genome and ecophysiological response to osmotic desiccation and UVR stresses of an Antarctic cyanobacterium, <i>Stenomitos frigidus</i> ULC029, which is closely related to other cyanobacteria from warm and cold dryland soils. Chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations showed that preculturing ULC029 under moderate osmotic stress improved its survival during an assay of desiccation plus rehydration under UVR. Additionally, its sequential exposure to these stress factors increased the production of exopolysaccharides, carotenoids, and scytonemin. Desiccation, but not osmotic stress, increased the concentrations of the osmoprotectants trehalose and sucrose. However, osmotic stress might induce the production of other osmoprotectants, for which the complete pathways were observed in the ULC029 genome. In total, 140 genes known to be involved in stress resistance were annotated. Here, we confirm that the sequential application of moderate osmotic stress and dehydration could improve cyanobacterial hardening for soil restoration by inducing several resistance mechanisms. We provide a high-quality genome of ULC029 and a description of the main resistance mechanisms (i.e., production of exopolysaccharides, osmoprotectants, chlorophyll, and carotenoids; DNA repair; and oxidative stress protection).</p>","author":"Beatriz Roncero‐Ramos, \nValentina Savaglia, \nBenoit Durieu, \nIsabelle Van de Vreken, \nAurore Richel, \nAnnick Wilmotte","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"e90078ba928755acf5a8ada1dd1c43b12f6a2e14391777225f72f71a25a6ec25","category":"Environment"}
