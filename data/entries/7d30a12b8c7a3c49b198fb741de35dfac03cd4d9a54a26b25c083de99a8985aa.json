{"title":"Nursing Attitudes Questionnaire: Testing the Psychometric Characteristics of the Italian Version (NAQ-IV)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1119/v1","date":1715863958000,"content":"Introduction: The image of the nurse is a source of concern because of its impact on recruitment to the profession, policy decisions about the profession, funding of nursing services, consumer use of nursing services and how the image of the nurse affects nursing practice.\nAim: This study aims to assess the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Nursing Attitudes Questionnaire (NAQ-IV).\nMethods: 564 persons between the years 2022 and 2023 with heterogeneous ages and occupations from Northern, Central and Southern Italy participated in the study. Cronbach's alpha, item versus total correlations, skewness and kurtosis were calculated; factor analysis was performed using principal axis factoring and the viramax rotation method. Results: The results showed a Cronbach's alpha of 0.89 on the scale and between 0.88 and 0.89 between the factors; all items tested for correlation between the item and the total and the criteria for variance in the responses. Factor analysis showed a 4-factor model explaining more than 59.91% of the variance, with the largest variance being explained by the 'Role &amp; professionalism' factor (25.96%).\nConclusion: These results allow for a discussion regarding the theoretical framework of the NAQ-IV and provide a reliable and valid instrument for the comparison of welfare, organisation of health services, role, professionalism, stereotypes, values, advocacy, motivation and perceived satisfaction with the figure of the nurse and nursing care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d30a12b8c7a3c49b198fb741de35dfac03cd4d9a54a26b25c083de99a8985aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
