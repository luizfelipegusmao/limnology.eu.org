Digital cement study is an image-based computational technique that can be used to study the mechanical properties of cement. They offer valuable insights into the internal processes and modes of operation of materials that laboratory tests often cannot provide. Development costs for materials are significantly reduced as the number of necessary experiments and prototypes is reduced. Digital cement studies require accurate segmentation of the micro-computed tomography (microCT) volumes to effectively model laboratory-scale measurements. Accuracy of the segmentation depends on our understanding of the cement microstructure. Cement microstructure consists of complex multiscale features, some of which are below the resolution obtained by microCT (typically &lt;10 Âµm/voxel). These features are sensitive to both physical and chemical conditions making it challenging to image the in-situ structure using techniques that require dry samples such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We utilize a solvent exchange method to arrest hydration and preserve the pore structure of cement at a certain time. Shape, size, and location of the various phases, especially with respect to the pores should be considered while labeling for realistic representation of the cement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2eadc9d5a7ef881522b066d1c250d2cb35032cfa3de32c653fd3354ff31bb8da","category":"Environment"}
