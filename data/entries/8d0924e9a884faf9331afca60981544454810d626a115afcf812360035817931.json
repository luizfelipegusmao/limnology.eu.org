{"title":"Current-Induced Field-Free Switching of Co/Pt Multilayer via Modulation of Interlayer Exchange Coupling and Magnetic Anisotropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0489/v1","date":1728301776000,"content":"Current-induced field-free magnetic switching using spin-orbit torque has been an important topic for decades due to both academic and industrial interest. Most research has focused on introducing symmetry breakers, such as geometrical and compositional variation, pinned layer, and symmetry-broken crystal structures, which add complexity to the magnetic structure and fabrication process. We designed relatively simple magnetic structure, composed of a [Co/Pt] multilayer and a Co layer with perpendicular and in-plane magnetic anisotropy, respectively, with a Cu layer between them. Current-induced deterministic magnetic switching was observed in this magnetic system. The system is advantageous for its easy control of the parameters to achieve the optimal condition for magnetic switching. The balance between magnetic anisotropic strength and interlayer coupling strength is found to provide the optimal condition. This simple design and easy adjustability opens various possibilities for magnetic structures in spin-based electronics applications using spin-orbit torque.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d0924e9a884faf9331afca60981544454810d626a115afcf812360035817931","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
