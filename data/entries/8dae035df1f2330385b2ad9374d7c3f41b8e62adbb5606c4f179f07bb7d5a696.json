{"title":"Advancing Personalized Medicine in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1203/v1","date":1710947301000,"content":"Rectal cancer presents a significant burden globally, often requiring multimodal therapy for locally advanced cases. Long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) and short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by surgery have been conventional neoadjuvant approaches. Recent trials favor LCRT due to improved local control. However, tumor distant recurrence remains a concern, prompting exploration of Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) as a comprehensive treatment strat-egy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show promise, particularly in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, potentially revolutionizing neoadjuvant regimens. Non-operative management (NOM) represents a viable alternative post-neoadjuvant therapy for selected patients achieving clinical complete response (cCR). Additionally, monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) emerges as a non-invasive method for treatment response assessment. This review synthesizes current evidence on TNT, ICIs, NOM and ctDNA, elucidating their implications for rectal cancer management and highlighting avenues for future research and clinical application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8dae035df1f2330385b2ad9374d7c3f41b8e62adbb5606c4f179f07bb7d5a696","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
