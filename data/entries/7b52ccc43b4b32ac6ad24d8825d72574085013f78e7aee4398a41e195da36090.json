{"title":"A Review on Radiopaque Polyurethanes: Materials, Processing, and Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1406/v1","date":1718866572000,"content":"It's been a growing concern that many microbes are developing resistance against many antibiotics, lowering the effectiveness and progress expected from that treatment option. To overcome the re-sistance developed by microbes, metallic and non-metallic-based nanoparticle treatments are starting to present a very promising approach. Furthermore, polyurethanes are used in a wide range of biomedical applications due to their variety of physical-chemical, mechanical, and structural properties, and biotic and abiotic degradation. They are widely used in bio-imaging procedures when metallic-based filler particles are incorporated, making the final product radiopaque. It would be advantageous, however, if polyurethanes with intrinsic radiopacity could be produced in their synthesis, avoiding a series of disadvantages in the processing and final product and also presenting potential antimicrobial activities. This reviewâ€™s objective was to study the radiopacifying charac-teristics of nanoparticles as well as the physical principles of radiopacity and the variety of medical applications of polyurethanes with nanoparticles. It was found in this study that the synthetization of radiopaque polyurethanes is not only possible but also that the efficiency of synthetization was improved when using atoms with high electron density as part of the back chainbone or grafted, making them great multipurpose materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b52ccc43b4b32ac6ad24d8825d72574085013f78e7aee4398a41e195da36090","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
