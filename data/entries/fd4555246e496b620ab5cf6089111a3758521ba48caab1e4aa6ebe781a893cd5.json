{"title":"Strengthening of Existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) Columns using Ultra High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) Jackets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1771/v1","date":1716810805000,"content":"The strengthening of existing columns using additional Reinforced Concrete (RC) jackets is one of the most popular techniques for the enhancement of columnâ€™s stiffness, load bearing capacity and ductility. Important parameters affecting the effectiveness of this method are the strength of the additional concrete, the concrete shrinkage and the connection between the old and the new con-crete. In this study the application of Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) jackets for the structural upgrade of RC columns has been examined. Extensive numerical study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of parameters such as the thickness of the jacket, the concrete shrinkage and the addition of steel bars and comparisons have been made with conventional RC jackets. The results of this study indicate that the use of UHPFRC can considerably im-prove the strength and the stiffness of existing RC columns. The combination of UHPFRC and steel bars in the jacket leads to the most effective strengthening technique as a significant enhancement of the stiffness and the ultimate load capacity has been achieved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd4555246e496b620ab5cf6089111a3758521ba48caab1e4aa6ebe781a893cd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
