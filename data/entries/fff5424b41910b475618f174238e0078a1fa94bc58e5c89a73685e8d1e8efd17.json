{"title":"Unveiling the Nexus: Sulphur Dioxide Exposure, Proximity to Mining, And Respiratory Illnesses in Kankoyo: A Mixed-Methods Investigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1555/v1","date":1713945554000,"content":"The emission of sulphur dioxide (SO2) from mining activities presents a substantial risk to public health, especially in populations located near mine industrial regions. This study investigated the potential correlation between exposure to sulphur dioxide (SO2) and its effects on respiratory health in Kankoyo Township, Zambia. A variety of methodologies were employed in this study, encompassing community participation, expert interviews, spatial analysis, and a retrospective examination of health and SO2 data for Kankoyo spanning 15 years. The results of our research indicated a worrisome correlation between the community and the presence of SO2, which has had a significant impact on their lives. The expert interviews also emphasized the effects of SO2, with respiratory cases accounting for approximately 75% of the reported cases. Additionally, the clinic officer observed that asthma cases have decreased following the implementation of a monitoring station in the community. Furthermore, overall emissions of SO2 have decreased since the upgrade of the smelter operation. A probable association was identified in the retrospective analysis between exposure to SO2 and the occurrence of asthma, respiratory non-pneumonia, and pneumonia infections. The findings of the retrospective research revealed a substantial association between SO2 concentrations and the susceptibility of individuals aged 5 years and older to asthma, respiratory non-pneumonia, and pneumonia infections. The results of the spatial study indicated that Kankoyo exhibited a significant level of SO2 pollution, above the established limitations set by the Zambian Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) by an alarming margin of 1713%. In response to the challenges identified, this study proposed several measures. These measures encompassed the implementation of a requirement for regulators such as ZEMA and local communities to have access to real-time pollution data from mines, to enhance transparency. Additionally, the deployment of affordable air quality sensors, the resolution of medication shortages, the establishment of specialized respiratory health clinics, the initiation of IT-driven public awareness campaigns, and the expansion of research to investigate additional pollutants and confounding factors were also recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fff5424b41910b475618f174238e0078a1fa94bc58e5c89a73685e8d1e8efd17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
