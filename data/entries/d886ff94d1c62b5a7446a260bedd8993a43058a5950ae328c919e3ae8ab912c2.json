{"title":"Focus-marking in a tonal language: Prosodic differences between Cantonese-speaking children with and without autism spectrum disorder","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306272","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Si Chen, Yixin Zhang, Fang Zhou, Angel Chan, Bei Li, Bin Li, Tempo Tang, Eunjin Chun, Zhuoming Chen</p>\r\n\r\nAbnormal speech prosody has been widely reported in individuals with autism. Many studies on children and adults with autism spectrum disorder speaking a non-tonal language showed deficits in using prosodic cues to mark focus. However, focus marking by autistic children speaking a tonal language is rarely examined. Cantonese-speaking children may face additional difficulties because tonal languages require them to use prosodic cues to achieve multiple functions simultaneously such as lexical contrasting and focus marking. This study bridges this research gap by acoustically evaluating the use of Cantonese speech prosody to mark information structure by Cantonese-speaking children with and without autism spectrum disorder. We designed speech production tasks to elicit natural broad and narrow focus production among these children in sentences with different tone combinations. Acoustic correlates of prosodic focus marking like <i>f</i><sub>0</sub>, duration and intensity of each syllable were analyzed to examine the effect of participant group, focus condition and lexical tones. Our results showed differences in focus marking patterns between Cantonese-speaking children with and without autism spectrum disorder. The autistic children not only showed insufficient on-focus expansion in terms of <i>f</i><sub>0</sub> range and duration when marking focus, but also produced less distinctive tone shapes in general. There was no evidence that the prosodic complexity (i.e. sentences with single tones or combinations of tones) significantly affected focus marking in these autistic children and their typically-developing (TD) peers.","author":"Si Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d886ff94d1c62b5a7446a260bedd8993a43058a5950ae328c919e3ae8ab912c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
