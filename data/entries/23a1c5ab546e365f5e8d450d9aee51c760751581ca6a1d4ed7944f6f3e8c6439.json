{"title":"Treatment of Plantar Warts with Nitric-Zinc Complex Solution: A Review of 72 Cases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1115/v1","date":1721031651000,"content":"Background: There are multiple conservative treatment options for plantar warts, but none have proven to be universally effective. Nitric acid is often used empirically by podiatrists in the treatment of plantar warts. A novel medical device or topical solution of nitric-zinc complex solution (NZCS) could potentially offer an effective and safe alternative for the targeted treatment of plantar warts.\nObjective: To observe the rate of complete healing of NZCS in a series of plantar wart cases, and to establish the minimum number of product applications and time needed for healing. This will help standardize and protocolize its use.\nMethods: A descriptive study was conducted involving 72 patients who exhibited symptoms of plantar warts. These patients underwent chemical treatment using a nitric-zinc complex.\nResults: The cure rate with NZCS was 59.2%. The average number of NZCS applications was 5.9 ± 3.0 and the mean duration of treatment was 9.4 ± 7.1 weeks. A recurrence rate of 6.7% (4/72 patients) was observed.\nConclusion: The topical solution of nitric-zinc complex is an effective treatment for plantar warts, which can be considered as a first-line treatment option in the general population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23a1c5ab546e365f5e8d450d9aee51c760751581ca6a1d4ed7944f6f3e8c6439","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
