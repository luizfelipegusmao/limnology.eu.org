{"title":"Amplifying Religious Literacy Education through the Frameworks of Global Competence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0563/v3","date":1723588200000,"content":"Since the turn of the millennium, many individuals and groups, including Diane Moore (2007), Stephen Prothero (2007), the American Academy of Religion (2010), and The National Council for the Social Studies (2014, 2017, 2021), have advocated for better religious literacy education (RLE) in K-12 curriculum and public schools. Despite these calls, RLE has yet to make significant inroads in K-12 curriculum and public schools. This paper aims to define religious literacy and RLE, provide current rationales for its inclusion in K-12 curriculum and public schools, identify barriers to RLE, and explore the potential of global competence in promoting RLE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d544ca22f056fe4e3e1ddcab2aa1357192874ee4b39c0e1bc4371c67174a2d33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
