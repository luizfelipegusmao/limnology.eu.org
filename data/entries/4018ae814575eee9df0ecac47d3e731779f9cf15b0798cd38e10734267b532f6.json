{"title":"Breeder age and hatching egg storage duration: effects on post-hatch performance of FUNAAB- α broiler chickens","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae070/7658516?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This trial was designed to evaluate the influence of hatching egg storage length and broiler breeder hens’ age on post-hatch growth performance and physiological responses of FUNAAB-α chickens. Five hundred fertile eggs from each of 60 and 32-wk-old FUNAAB-α breeder hens were collected and assigned to five storage durations (0, 3, 7, 11, and 15 d). The hatching eggs were incubated using the conventional protocol. Data were collected on the growth performance and physiological responses. A 2 × 5 factorial design was used for the experiment. The results revealed that there was a decline in the final body weight in chickens from eggs of 15 and 11 d storage compared to the chickens from 7, 3, and 0 egg storage days. Chickens of 32-week-old breeder hens had higher (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell, heterophil, and pack cell volume values compared to 60-week-old breeder hens. Hatchlings from 60-week-old breeders had a higher liver percentage (3.0% yolk-free body weight [YFBW]) than those from 32-week-old breeders (2.8% YFBW). It was concluded that an extended storage duration of 15 d adversely affected the carcass traits and growth performance of chickens from egg storage above seven days.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"4018ae814575eee9df0ecac47d3e731779f9cf15b0798cd38e10734267b532f6","category":"Environment"}
