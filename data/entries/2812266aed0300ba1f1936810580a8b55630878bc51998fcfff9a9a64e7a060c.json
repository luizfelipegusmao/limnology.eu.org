This study focused on the Ig-G anti-RBD marker, analyzing its potential correlations with sex, vaccine type, body fat percentage, metabolic risk, perceived stress, and previous COVID-19 exposure. In this study, data (available in S1 Data) were obtained from 108 participants from the ESFUERSO cohort, who completed questionnaires detailing their COVID-19 experiences and stress levels assessed through the SISCO scale. IgG anti-RBD concentrations were quantified using an ELISA assay developed by UNAM. Multiple regression analysis was employed to control for covariates, including sex, age, body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), and perceived stress. This sample comprised young individuals (average age of 21.4 years), primarily consisting of females (70%), with a substantial proportion reporting a family history of diabetes, hypertension, or obesity. Most students had received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, and 91% displayed a positive anti-RBD response. A noteworthy finding was the interaction between body fat percentage and sex. In males, increased adiposity was associated with decreased Ig-G anti-RBD concentration; in females, the response increased. Importantly, this pattern remained consistent regardless of the vaccine received. No significant associations were observed for dietary habits or perceived stress variables. This research reports the impact of sex and body fat percentage on the immune response through Ig-G anti-RBD levels to COVID-19 vaccines. The implications of these findings offer a foundation for educational initiatives and the formulation of preventive policies aimed at mitigating health disparities.","author":"Adriana L.
