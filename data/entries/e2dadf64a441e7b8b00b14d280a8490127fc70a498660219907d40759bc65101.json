We evaluated the influence of relative abundance of fish functional groups and watershed characteristics on the slope of the CSS or ecological efficiency. Both ecological efficiency and capacity were strongly influenced by relative abundance of fish functional groups and the degree of water level variation. Steeper slopes indicated overfished gamefish populations, whereas flatter slopes indicated systems dominated by undesirable invasive large-bodied low trophic position fish. We hypothesize that a desirable fishery would have a target range of CSS slopes that provides a deterministic community-based framework of predictable responses to environmental and food web changes that can be used to evaluate outcomes of management actions and a means to assess annual progress toward desirable conditions.</p>","author":"Brent A.
