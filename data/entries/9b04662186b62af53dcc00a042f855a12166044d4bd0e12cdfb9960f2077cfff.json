Lena F. Kourkoutis recognized how compelling both qualitative and quantitative visual images are for exploring materials and talked about “seeing with electrons”, her Cornell group’s informal logo. Lena was aware of the importance of characterizing not only static materials’ structures/compositions but also structural dynamics. Indeed, one of her first papers was an <span>in situ</span> electron microscopy study on the kinetics of Er diffusion on Si [<a href=\"#ozae044.1070-B1\">1</a>]. She used photoelectron emission spectroscopy to perform elegant experiments to investigate strain and diffusion on nucleation and growth processes. The images provided a compelling view of the surface processes taking place and, with suitable image processing, she was able to come up with kinetic parameters to quantify the observations. As her career developed, she became an expert in many techniques available in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and successfully applied these to a wide range of problems in energy and quantum materials. Like her mentor, David Muller, she was never happy with the microscopy instrumentation status quo and enjoyed pushing the techniques to higher levels. Her pioneering work on atomic resolution STEM imaging and spectroscopy of complex oxides at cryogenic temperatures demonstrated her willingness to push the tools to the limits. She was passionate about developing cryo-STEM techniques for the exploration of quantum materials and I am sure she would have been an international leader in this emerging field. She provided great service to the microscopy community including several leadership roles in the Microscopy Society of America and was also active in providing feedback and guidance at the federal level to funding agencies. It was my great privilege to work with Lena on organizing an NSF workshop to explore future directions for electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.1070-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9b04662186b62af53dcc00a042f855a12166044d4bd0e12cdfb9960f2077cfff","category":"Environment"}
