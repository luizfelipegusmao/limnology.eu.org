{"title":"Glucocorticoid Receptor Alpha: Origins and Functions of the Master Regulator of Homeostatic Corrections in Health and Critical Illness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1823/v1","date":1727162550000,"content":"The glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRα), a pivotal component of the ancient glucocorticoid (GC) signaling system that emerged nearly 450 million years ago, has been instrumental in directing vertebrate evolution and is essential for survival, regulating fertility and fetal development, the function of every organ and circulating cells, metabolism, immune responses, and adaptation to stress. While its anti-inflammatory properties have been recognized since the mid-20th century, GRα’s broader role as the master regulator of homeostatic corrections, particularly in health and critical illness, has only recently been fully appreciated.GRα orchestrates three key phases of homeostatic correction: the Priming Phase, where it rapidly activates early immune responses, mobilizes energy reserves, and prepares the body to mount an immediate defense against various physiological stressors, including infection and injury. During this phase, GRα enhances glucose metabolism, supports mitochondrial function, and facilitates the release of key immune cells to the site of damage, ensuring the body is equipped to handle the initial assault. The Modulatory Phase follows, in which GRα fine-tunes the inflammatory response to prevent excessive tissue damage. By balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory signals, GRα helps contain the immune response, preventing the harmful effects of prolonged inflammation while maintaining immune surveillance. This phase also involves the regulation of oxidative stress, vascular tone, and the preservation of cellular integrity to protect vital organs from injury. Finally, in the Restorative Phase, GRα plays a critical role in resolving inflammation and initiating tissue repair. During this phase, GRα supports cellular regeneration, promotes the clearance of apoptotic cells and debris, and restores anatomical and physiological balance. It aids in rebuilding tissue architecture and returning the neuroendocrine-immune system to its baseline state, ensuring long-term recovery and stability.Throughout these phases, GRα manages complex interactions, including recently discovered co-regulation with pro-inflammatory transcription factors, while also regulating mitochondrial function to ensure bioenergetic and metabolic stability during stress. In critically ill patients, depletion of bioenergetic and micronutrient reserves severely impairs GRα’s capacity to regulate immune responses, heightening the risk of morbidity and mortality.This review, in light of this new understanding, underscores the need to re-evaluate current glucocorticoid (GC) treatment strategies, emphasizing the incorporation of micronutrient support to optimize GRα function across all phases of homeostatic correction. This integrated therapeutic approach has the potential to enhance both immediate immune responses and long-term recovery in critically ill patients, offering a more comprehensive strategy for managing the complex pathobiology of critical illness. Furthermore, this integrative approach could decrease glucocorticoid dose and duration requirements and potential side effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e3e670827a306a35117dea3a061ed509fb6165129fd93570a175891a74d890e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
