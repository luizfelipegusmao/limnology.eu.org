However, research in ad hoc teamwork is predominantly focused on agent-only teams, but not on agent-human teams, which we believe is an exciting research avenue and has enormous application potential in human-robot teams. This paper will tap into this potential by proposing HOTSPOT, the first framework for ad hoc teamwork in human-robot teams. Our framework comprises two main modules, addressing the two key challenges in the interaction between a robot acting as the ad hoc agent and human teammates. First, a <i>decision-theoretic module</i> that is responsible for all task-related decision-making (task identification, teammate identification, and planning). Second, a <i>communication module</i> that uses natural language processing to parse all communication between the robot and the human. To evaluate our framework, we use a task where a mobile robot and a human cooperatively collect objects in an open space, illustrating the main features of our framework in a real-world task.","author":"João G.
