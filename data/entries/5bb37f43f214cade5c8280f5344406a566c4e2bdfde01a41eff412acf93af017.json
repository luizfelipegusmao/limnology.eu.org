{"title":"Application of sliding mode variable structure control algorithm in PMSM vector control system in complex environment","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308417","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Haoran Cui</p>\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the increasing demand of high-performance control in industrial production, a new sliding mode variable structure control algorithm, Asymptotic Sliding Mode Control (ASMC), is designed in this study to solve the serious chattering problem of sliding mode control. Firstly, a traditional sliding mode exponential approximation law control model and a state space and control function are constructed based on sliding mode control. Secondly, by eliminating the jitter factor, ASMC algorithm is combined with sliding mode control to achieve precise control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and improve its performance. The experimental results indicated that in the simulation experiment, the research system tended to stabilize within 0.2â€“0.3 seconds, and the system chattering was significantly suppressed. And its output was smoother, the jitter amplitude was significantly reduced by 1/3, and the output torque was more stable. In addition, when the parameter <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> changed to 2<i>H</i><sub>0</sub>, the overall speed curve did not change much, with only a slight overshoot. The overshoot was only 2.8%, and the change amplitude was maintained at around 25r/min, indicating that the research system had strong self stability performance. In actual experiments, the current command oscillation of the research system was significantly reduced. The local graph showed that the output fluctuation amplitude of the asymptotic approach law actual control was significantly smaller under no-load disturbance. When the <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> changed towards 2<i>H</i><sub>0</sub>, the actual adjustment time was about 0.1 seconds, which was consistent with the simulation experiment. Therefore, the contribution of the research is that the ASMC algorithm can suppress the chattering problem of the system and improve the approaching speed, thus improving the speed regulation quality of the system. This new algorithm has great theoretical and practical significance for improving the performance of PMSM, and is practical in the actual vector control system of PMSM.","author":"Haoran Cui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5bb37f43f214cade5c8280f5344406a566c4e2bdfde01a41eff412acf93af017","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
