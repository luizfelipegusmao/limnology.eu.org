{"title":"<i>Seriphidium herba-alba</i> (Asso): A comprehensive study of essential oils, extracts, and their antimicrobial properties","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302329","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Hazem Aqel, Husni Farah</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Seriphidium herba-alba (Asso)</i>, a plant celebrated for its therapeutic qualities, is widely used in traditional medicinal practices throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In a detailed study of <i>Seriphidium herba-alba</i> (Asso), essential oils and extracts were analyzed for their chemical composition and antimicrobial properties. The essential oil, characterized using mass spectrometry and retention index methods, revealed a complex blend of 52 compounds, with santolina alcohol, α-thujone, β-thujone, and chrysanthenone as major constituents. Extraction yields varied significantly, depending on the plant part and method used; notably, methanol soaking of aerial parts yielded the most extract at 17.75%. The antimicrobial analysis showed that the extracts had selective antibacterial activity, particularly against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and broad-spectrum antifungal activity against organisms such as <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Aspergillus spp</i>. The methanol-soaked extract demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial properties, indicating its potential as a natural antimicrobial source. This study not only underscores the therapeutic potential of <i>Seriphidium herba-alba</i> (Asso) in pharmaceutical applications but also sets a foundation for future research focused on isolating specific bioactive compounds and in vivo testing.","author":"Hazem Aqel","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ded4ab9524a7e923c0fda630696d36c52d6827d9afef60b5a91ee63177cb0566","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
