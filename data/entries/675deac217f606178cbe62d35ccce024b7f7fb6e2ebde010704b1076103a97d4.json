{"title":"Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5 Clade 2.3.4.4b Virus Infection in Birds and Mammals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1123/v1","date":1713336239000,"content":"Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are highly contagious respiratory viruses of birds, lead-ing to significant morbidity and mortality globally and causing substantial economic losses to the poultry industry. Since their first isolation in 2013, the Asian-origin H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) of clade 2.3.4.4b have undergone unprecedented evolution and re-assortment of internal gene segments and have spread to Asia, Europe, Africa, and America, caus-ing outbreaks in all the poultry categories. Novel epidemiological and pathobiological character-istics, distinct from other clades, are specific of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. Wild waterfowl, the natu-ral reservoir of AIVs, are frequently found infected with clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, which can also cause high morbidity and mortality in these birds. The sustained clade 2.3.4.4b virus circulation in waterfowl has also led to virus infection in other wild bird species, with implications for the conservation of endangered species. Furthermore, clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have been isolated in var-ious wild and domestic mammals worldwide, and critical mutations related to virus adaptation to mammalian species have been identified, raising concerns about virus spillover to humans. The main clinical signs, and anatomopathological findings associated to clade 2.3.4.4b virus infection in birds and non-human mammals are hereby summarized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"675deac217f606178cbe62d35ccce024b7f7fb6e2ebde010704b1076103a97d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
