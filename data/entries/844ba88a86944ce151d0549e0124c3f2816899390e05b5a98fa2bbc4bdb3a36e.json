{"title":"Millennial‐Scale Carbon Flux Variability in the Subantarctic Pacific During Marine Isotope Stage 3 (57–29 ka)","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023PA004776?af=R","date":1711004400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Antarctic ice cores reveal a glacial climate state during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS-3; 57–29 ka) punctuated by millennial-scale warming events and pulses of CO<sub>2</sub>. This study further explores how changes in Southern Ocean carbon cycling contributed to these millennial-scale fluctuations in climate. Evidence from South Atlantic sediment cores suggests that warming events were associated with decreased dust-borne iron flux, reduced export production, and increased upwelling from the deep Southern Ocean (SO). These processes are considered to have contributed to rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during periods of rapid warming<sub>.</sub> Here we investigate whether the same processes occurred in the southwest Pacific sector of the SO at TAN1106-28. We show that reduced New Zealand glaciation and localized iron limitation in the southwest Pacific led to reduced export production during millennial-scale warming events. Decreases in foraminifera-bound δ<sup>15</sup>N during all MIS-3 warming events may reflect increased nutrient supply by upwelling. Increased calcium carbonate flux during MIS-3 warming events likely reflects coccolithophore production in response to sea surface temperatures, which, would increase carbonate counter pump strength and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration. Concomitant decreases in bottom water oxygen, inferred from redox-sensitive U and Mn sediment concentrations, and increases in the <sup>14</sup>C age of deep waters, suggest that old, nutrient-rich waters influenced southwest Pacific middepth waters during warming events. This signature may reflect an expansion of Pacific Deep Water into the SO during warming. Taken together, our multi-proxy data set reveals that the southwest subantarctic Pacific acted as a source of CO<sub>2</sub> during millennial-scale warming events of MIS-3.</p>","author":"H. J.
