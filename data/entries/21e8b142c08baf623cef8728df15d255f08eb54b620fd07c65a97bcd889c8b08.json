{"title":"Needs and capabilities for improving poultry production and health management in Indonesia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308379","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Lorraine Chapot, Rebecca Hibbard, Kurnia Bagus Ariyanto, Kusnul Yuli Maulana, Havan Yusuf, Widya Febriyani, Angus Cameron, Mathilde Paul, Timothée Vergne, Céline Faverjon</p>\r\n\r\nIn Indonesia, the development of the poultry industry is facing numerous challenges. Major constraints include high disease burdens, large fluctuations in farm input and output prices, and inadequate biosecurity. Timely and reliable information about animal production and health can help stakeholders at all levels of the value chain make appropriate management decisions to optimize their profitability and productivity while reducing risks to public health. This study aimed to describe the challenges in the Indonesian poultry industry, assess stakeholders’ needs and capabilities in terms of generating and using poultry information for making production and health management decisions, and identify levers for improvement. Interviews were conducted with a diversity of key informants and value chain actors in five Indonesian provinces. Thematic analysis was applied with an interpretivist approach to gain an in-depth understanding of the lived experiences of various stakeholders and their opinions as to what might constitute appropriate solutions. Our findings indicate that market and political instability, ineffective management of poultry data, and limited inter-sectoral collaboration are limiting the development of the sector. Increased intersectoral cooperation is needed to implement standards for data collection and sharing across the industry, provide education and practical training on the use of information technologies for farm management, and accelerate research and innovation. Our study can contribute to the development of data-driven tools to support evidence-based decision-making at all levels of the poultry system.","author":"Lorraine Chapot","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"21e8b142c08baf623cef8728df15d255f08eb54b620fd07c65a97bcd889c8b08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
