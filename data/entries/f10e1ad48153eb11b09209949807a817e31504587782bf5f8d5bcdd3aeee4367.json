For Micro-XRF, fluorescent X-rays are excited by high-energy X-rays emitted from the X-ray tube, while SEM-EDS utilizes X-rays generated after electron beam-sample interaction. Modern Micro-XRF and EDS systems use Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) for X-ray detection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f10e1ad48153eb11b09209949807a817e31504587782bf5f8d5bcdd3aeee4367","category":"Environment"}
