{"title":"Regulation of GeCu/Zn-SOD, GeMn-SOD, GeHsp90, and GeMT in Gymnocypris eckloni in Response to Copper and Lead Ion Challenges","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5716920?af=R","date":1709798400000,"content":"<p>The contamination of aquatic environments by heavy metals can have detrimental effects on fish, impacting their growth and overall health, including the regulation of antioxidant genes. An investigation was carried out to assess the distribution and habitat of <i>Gymnocypris eckloni</i> in the Yellow River basin. Simultaneously, heavy metal concentrations in its habitat and in selected locations within the upper Yellow River were measured. In an effort to explore the potential roles of specific genes in antioxidant responses, <i>G. eckloni</i> was exposed to low concentrations of copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) and lead (Pb<sup>2+</sup>) for varying durations (12, 24, and 48â€‰hours). The mRNA levels of <i>GeCu/Zn-SOD</i>, <i>GeMn-SOD</i>, <i>GeHsp90</i>, and <i>GeMT</i> were quantified in the gills, kidneys, and liver through qRT-PCR. The findings suggest that the habitat of <i>G. eckloni</i> is generally safe; however, occasional exceedances of safety standards could pose a potential threat to its growth. Importantly, the expression of <i>GeCu/Zn-SOD</i>, <i>GeMn-SOD</i>, <i>GeHsp90</i>, and <i>GeMT</i> exhibited responses to the low concentrations of copper-induced and lead-induced stress. Notably, <i>GeCu/Zn-SOD</i>, <i>GeMn-SOD</i>, and <i>GeMT</i> demonstrated heightened sensitivity to lead compared to copper. Furthermore, the expression of these genes displayed tissue-specific responses under identical metal stress conditions. These results indicate that <i>GeCu/Zn-SOD</i>, <i>GeMn-SOD</i>, <i>GeHsp90</i>, and <i>GeMT</i> genes have the potential to serve as early, sensitive biomarkers for the detection of metal toxicity induced by Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup>. This study also provides valuable insights into the functioning of antioxidant genes under oxidative stress in fish.</p>","author":"Jing Zhao, \nZixuan Li, \nChangzhong Li, \nRong Wang, \nZifeng Zhao, \nHuayu Gou, \nLanying Li, \nAnbin Xie, \nHaotian Ren, \nBo Qiu, \nXiaodie Li, \nYanxia Chen, \nZhenji Wang, \nGuojie Wang, \nWenjie Jin, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"fe1361a0066cf08c16b88dad9213faa0738d4ac7554262f96c0a9264e573dc30","category":"Environment"}
