{"title":"Spatial and temporal variability of the two main caught species of an artisanal trap fishery in an oceanic island","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4090?af=R","date":1710140400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nThis study analysed the catches of trap fishing in the Canary Archipelago, NE Atlantic Ocean. This study was conducted from October 2016 to September 2017, April to November 2018 and September 2020, in five ports (San Cristóbal, Taliarte, Castillo del Romeral, Arguineguín and Mogán).\nThe primary gear were traps with small mesh size (31.6 mm) and large mesh size (50.8 mm). A total of 2587 small mesh size traps and 141 large mesh size traps were analysed from 20- to 130-m depth.\nThe main target species were <i>Dentex gibbosus</i> and <i>Stephanolepis hispidus</i>.\nCatches of traps with large mesh size showed <i>D. gibbosus</i> above first maturity and <i>S. hispidus</i> in small mesh size traps. Both species exhibit larger specimens during reproductive periods.\nThe most effective traps for D. gibbosus (large mesh) were located on the western coast (&gt;30-m depth), with the highest catch per unit of effort (CPUE) in Mogán (857.7 g trap<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>). The most effective traps for S. hispidus (small mesh) were located in southern areas, especially in sandy habitats (124.9 g trap<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in Castillo del Romeral, 102.9 g trap<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in Arguineguín).\nThe highest catchability of <i>D. gibbosus</i> was observed in April (CPUE of 962.8 g trap<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), and the highest catchability of <i>S. hispidus</i> was found in June (CPUE of 165.9 g trap<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>).\nThe traps with small mesh size showed a great selectivity of sizes for <i>S. hispidus</i>; though high catch rates of immature specimens of <i>D. gibbosus</i> pose a threat to species conservation.\nThe management recommendations' proposed measures include revising minimum catch sizes for both species. Additionally, we suggested depth limitations for mesh sizes of traps.\nThe study highlights the need for new management strategies to ensure the conservation of targeted demersal species, with special emphasis on addressing the threat posed by small mesh sizes to immature <i>D. gibbosus</i>.\nThe findings provide valuable insights for adapting fishery management practices to sustainably conserve the targeted species in the Canary Archipelago.\n</p>","author":"Lorenzo Cruces, \nMyriam Rodríguez, \nÓscar Monterroso, \nOmar Álvarez, \nÓscar Pérez, \nRodrigo Riera","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"c92d132faee15bce9e68df0c5b4390c1ca12838525cd31999ac1ff0c0472b3e3","category":"Environment"}
