{"title":"Cost Effectiveness Analysis of Optimal Rabies Control Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1724/v1","date":1711605399000,"content":"A mathematical model that incorporates human attacks on dogs is presented to explore the dynamics of rabies transmission. The model divided the infection rate into two categories: dog-to-dog transmission rates during the prodromal phase (βdP) and the furious phase (βdF). It has been determined that the model is well-posed and that all of the solutions are positive, as well as the feasibility and positivity of the model's solutions.  Both the basic reproduction number (R0) and the effective reproductive number (Re) are computed, and it is demonstrated that the model has a unique disease-free equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable whenever Re &lt; 1.  To identify the model's most sensitive parameters and the ones that intervention efforts should focus on, sensitivity analysis of the effective reproduction number is carried out.  We can construct an optimal control system using the state equations, the adjoint equations, and the optimality condition that determines the controls by applying Pontryagin's Maximum/Minimum principle. To help decision-makers in allocating funds for rabies interventions, cost-effectiveness analyses are conducted. To determine the degree to which the intervention strategies are advantageous and cost-effective, this study performs a cost-effective analysis of one or all possible combinations of the optimal rabies control strategies (pre-exposed and post-exposed vaccination for both dog and human populations) for the four different transmission settings. After arranging the techniques to increase effectiveness (total infections prevented), a cost-effective analysis using the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was conducted. The result supports the function that the four intervention options are performing to either completely eradicate or significantly reduce rabies disease among the populations. The dynamical behavior of the system is studied through simulations using the ode45 numerical technique from MATLAB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8309af7ac909c9f286d03341887ea0879d37bfff376fa81dfd0c715e7995a436","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
