{"title":"Fire-Resistant Fabrics for Special Applications &ndash; Analysis of Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1757/v1","date":1711619663000,"content":"Fires constitute a significant threat due to the pollutants emitted and the destruction they cause. People who take part in fire-fighting operations must be equipped with appropriate tools, including special clothing that will allow them to work and guarantee safety. One of the threats are compounds from the PAH group, which are characterized by high toxicity and carcinogenicity. Therefore, it is important that the materials used constitute a barrier to contamination. Various materials from which individual elements of special firefighter's clothing are made were tested. Additionally, the importance of height on the possibility of sorption of PAH compounds on a given type of material was analyzed. Based on the results obtained, it was found that the type of material and the zone in which the clothing items are used are important in the sorption processes of pollutants. Data in this area may be important for taking further actions regarding the modification of materials used in special fire brigade clothing and in their cleaning processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06e241fafca9394fa2a9df75be19789ae14c638a58ca9513057033a71faf924e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
