{"title":"Investigating the Effects of Gamification Elements on Student Motivation, Engagement, and Academic Performance in Higher Education Courses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0428/v1","date":1715153321000,"content":"This study investigated how different gamification elements in mobile apps influence users' basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) and subsequent engagement outcomes. Survey data was analyzed using PLS-SEM. Social gamification elements enhanced autonomy and competence needs, while immersive elements boosted autonomy and relatedness. Achievement/progression components increased competence and relatedness perceptions. Interestingly, personal traits did not significantly impact psychological needs. Crucially, satisfying autonomy and relatedness predicted higher user satisfaction and continued usage intentions, highlighting their importance for sustained engagement. Competence influenced satisfaction but not continuance intention. The findings demonstrate the motivational roles of distinct gamification features in fostering need-supportive experiences. Designers should incorporate varied social, immersive, and achievement components to address users' psychological requirements holistically. Prioritizing autonomy and relatedness support appears vital for achieving enjoyable, self-motivated, and persistent user engagement across gamified systems and domains. The study provides actionable insights for optimizing motivational affordances through psychologically-informed gamification implementations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5d482e5f9c3f14bc27f4611b9fa4426754a4d05e6759ce36f7c18d2d9eebfb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
