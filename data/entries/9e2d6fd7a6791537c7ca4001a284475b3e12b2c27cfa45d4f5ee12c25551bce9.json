{"title":"Direct Current To Digital Converter (DCDC): A Current Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1054/v1","date":1726208700000,"content":"This paper introduces a systematic approach to the design of Direct Current-to-Digital Converter (DCDC) specifically engineered to overcome the limitations of traditional current measurement methodologies in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. The proposed DCDC addresses critical challenges such as high power consumption, large area requirements, and the need for intermediate analog signals. By incorporating a current mirror in a cascode topology and managing the current across multiple binary-sized branches with the Successive Approximation Register (SAR) logic, the design achieves precise current measurement. A simple comparator, coupled with an isolation circuit, ensures accurate and reliable sensing. Fabricated using the TSMC 180 nm process, the DCDC achieves 8-bit precision without the need for nonlinearity calibration, showcasing remarkable energy efficiency with an energy per conversion of 1.52 pJ, power consumption of 117 µW, and a compact area of 0.016 mm². This innovative approach not only reduces power consumption and area, but also provides a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation semiconductor technologies. The ability to conduct online measurements during both standard operations and in-field conditions significantly enhances the performance and reliability of SoCs, making this DCDC a promising advancement in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e2d6fd7a6791537c7ca4001a284475b3e12b2c27cfa45d4f5ee12c25551bce9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
