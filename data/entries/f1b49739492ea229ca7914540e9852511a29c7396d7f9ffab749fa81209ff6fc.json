A recent study by <a href=\"#CIT0002\">Burress and Hart (2024)</a> shows that the transition of North American minnows from a competitive and complex benthic habitat to a noncompetitive and homogeneous pelagic habitat is associated with an increase in speciation rates but a decrease in rates of morphological evolution. These results demonstrate that different dimensions of evolutionary change may respond to different ecological factors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"f1b49739492ea229ca7914540e9852511a29c7396d7f9ffab749fa81209ff6fc","category":"Environment"}
