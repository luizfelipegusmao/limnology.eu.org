{"title":"Nutritional and Sensory Optimization of Functional Crackers with the Incorporation of Arthrospira platensis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1555/v1","date":1721374538000,"content":"Arthrospira platensis, which is known as the most important food supplement of the future due to its high nutritional value, was the focus of this study. The main objective of this study was to develop a functional cracker enriched with proteins, essential amino acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids with the incorporation of A. platensis. Therefore, this research aimed to improve the texture (including moisture and firmness) and sensory properties (such as color, taste, and smell) of crackers by adding A. platensis at three different levels (0%, 2.5%, and 5.0%). The sensory attributes of crackers were evaluated by twenty taste testers and thirty consumers, assessing color, odor, taste, crispness, and overall preference. The highest hardness value among the studied trials was observed in trial 14, which contained 5% A. platensis with 577 N. According to the results of the panel test, among the crackers with 5% A. platensis addition, trial 14 had the highest color value. To obtain the optimum formula, dough with 50 mg/g A. platensis, 625 mg/g flour, and 220 mg/g water was recommended. The addition of A. platensis has great potential to improve the nutritional, textural, and sensory properties of crackers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1396c92f809a109126048bda8b10df62b568564f821bf7d8e534aee3f3d73396","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
