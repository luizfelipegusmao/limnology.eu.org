{"title":"Chaperone Hsp70 helps <i>Salmonella</i> survive infection-relevant stress by reducing protein synthesis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002560","date":1712239200000,"content":"<p>by Carissa Chan, Eduardo A. Groisman</p>\r\n\r\nIn all domains of life, Hsp70 chaperones preserve protein homeostasis by promoting protein folding and degradation and preventing protein aggregation. We now report that the Hsp70 from the bacterial pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium—termed DnaK—independently reduces protein synthesis in vitro and in <i>S</i>. Typhimurium facing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation, a condition encountered during infection. This reduction reflects a 3-fold increase in ribosome association with DnaK and a 30-fold decrease in ribosome association with trigger factor, the chaperone normally associated with translating ribosomes. Surprisingly, this reduction does not involve J-domain cochaperones, unlike previously known functions of DnaK. Removing the 74 C-terminal amino acids of the 638-residue long DnaK impeded DnaK association with ribosomes and reduction of protein synthesis, rendering <i>S</i>. Typhimurium defective in protein homeostasis during cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation. DnaK-dependent reduction in protein synthesis is critical for survival against Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation because inhibiting protein synthesis in a <i>dnaK</i>-independent manner overcame the 10,000-fold loss in viability resulting from DnaK truncation. Our results indicate that DnaK protects bacteria from infection-relevant stresses by coordinating protein synthesis with protein folding capacity.","author":"Carissa Chan","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"ec0c68f7947a9f822488dc6566941d0bcc80e42e25f6afd218bc5425300bd737","category":"Environment"}
