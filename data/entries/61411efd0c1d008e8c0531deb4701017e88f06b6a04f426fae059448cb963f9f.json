{"title":"Preventing Bone Loss in Breast Cancer Patients: Designing a Personalized Clinical Pathway in a Large-Volume Research Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0670/v1","date":1710226865000,"content":"Background: Assessing the impact of bone health clinical management in breast cancer (BC) patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy and designing a personalized clinical pathway to reduce bone loss, in an Italian research hospital. Methods: The primary endpoint was to assess (through the process improvement organizational method) the clinical pathway that post-surgical BC patients prescribed with endocrine therapy undergo to prevent bone loss. The secondary endpoint was to design a personalized clinical pathway for a prompt implementation of guidelines, to assess and possibly prescribe antiresorptive therapy. Results: During the first year of the new diagnostic therapeutic assistance pathway execution, an 60% increase in Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry evaluations within 30 days and a 39.5% increase in antiresorptive therapy prescription within 90 days (since prescription of endocrine therapy) were shown, thus increasing patients’ compliance. Conclusion: Case managers and bone health specialists in this context can improve patients’ adherence to therapies and bone health, helping physicians to expand their collaboration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61411efd0c1d008e8c0531deb4701017e88f06b6a04f426fae059448cb963f9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
