{"title":"Protective effects of Azilsartan against cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian toxicity in rats model","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae027/7618665?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an effective alkylating anticancer agent that is widely used in cancer chemotherapy, and it can cause ototoxicity and infertility in women.<div>Objectives</div>So, this study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Azilsartan (AZ) as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in a rat model of CP-induced ovarian toxicity.<div>Materials and Methods</div>After receiving the 28 female Wister rats, they were acclimatized in proper environmental conditions for a week and then randomly divided into four groups based on the study protocol. After 15 days of the experiment, they were sacrificed, and organs were collected for biomarker detection (Using the ELISA technique) and histopathological analysis.<div>Results</div>The level of IL-10 was significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) decreased in all treated groups compared to control hostile groups, while the TNF-α level was significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) increased in AZ (220.67 ± 7.88 ng/mL) and AZ + CP groups (221.78 ± 9.11 ng/mL) compared to control negative/CP groups. Regarding the oxidative biomarker level, a significant increase was only found in the AZ + CP group (176.02 ± 6.71 nmol/mL) compared to the control negative group. On the other hand, histopathological findings revealed that ovarian sections in animals that received a single dose of CP had severe ovarian atrophy with significant follicular regression and deterioration, as well as depletion of stromal supportive tissues.<div>Conclusions</div>Azilsartan drastically reduced CP-induced ovarian toxicity in vivo by enhancing oxidative stress and inhibiting inflammatory effects in ovarian cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"b3b982a589959cc1c570db3d66e6fa0feda88cc1db58eb9d11921655711f7a83","category":"Environment"}
