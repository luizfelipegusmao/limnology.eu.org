{"title":"Four New Families of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi within the Order Glomerales","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1661/v1","date":1724378907000,"content":"Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, but also considering morphological characters, four new families are separated from the family Glomeraceae within the Glomerales and the class Glomeromycetes. The revised family Glomeraceae comprises only four genera: the type genus Glomus, Complexispora, Sclerocarpum and Simiglomus. Septoglomeraceae fam. nov. comprises, besides Septoglomus, also Funneliformis, Funneliglomus, Blaszkowskia and Viscospora. Sclerocystaceae fam. nov. is represented by the type genus Sclerocystis, but also by Halonatospora, Oehlia, Parvocarpum, Rhizoglomus and Silvaspora. Kamienskiaceae fam. nov. encompasses Kamienskia, Microkamienskia and Epigeocarpum. Finally, Dominikiaceae fam. nov. includes the genera Dominikia, Macrodominikia gen. nov. Microdominikia, Nanoglomus and Orientoglomus. The genera Oehlia and Halonatospora form two other clades well separated from Silvaspora, Sclerocystis and Rhizoglomus and might represent two further families within the Glomerales. Such deeper-going separation is to our opinion fully supported by molecular phylogeny, but in view of the low numbers of taxa, this separation is not yet needed at this stage of research progress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5e9a9e09e87d23f2e97e5ea19bd6f1f0b2e8dbcdfbddfcf3c3d21baf7404c3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
