The loss of coral reefs not only threatens marine life but also the communities that depend on them. Dire predictions that at 1.5°C warming, a mark which we might have already missed, the majority of warm-water coral-dominated systems will be non-existent leaves an uncertain future for coral reefs and the communities that rely on them. The well-being of the environment, humans, and animals is interlinked, co-dependent, and even co-produced, and consequently we propose the need for a human rights-based approach to coral reef protection.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The intensifying loss of coral reefs from global climate change and local stressors has seen international commitments targeted at conservation and repair, for example the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Fulfilling these targets requires decisions to be made on where, when, and how to act, ultimately dictating where limited resources will be deployed. Every choice on action or inaction toward our ocean has direct and indivisible consequences not only for the health of marine ecosystems but also for the health of humans, particularly those who directly depend on marine habitats, both culturally and economically. The well-being of the environment, humans, and animals is interlinked, co-dependent, and even co-produced, as has already been acknowledged by One Health approaches, which endorse a cross- and trans-disciplinary view to health. Coral reefs epitomie how tightly intertwined ecosystem health and the fate of the human and nonhuman communities that depend on them are. A field that thus far remains poorly considered is a human rights-based approach to coral reef protection. A human rights-based approach implements human rights obligations, including the recently affirmed right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, while embedding principles of accountability, nondiscrimination, participation, and empowerment for local and Indigenous communities that ensure effectiveness and meaningful stakeholder engagement. Tying the protection of coral reef ecosystems to human rights emphasises the importance of healthy ecosystems to human well-being and thus the inevitable connection between nonhuman and human life. The general failure to consider coral reef protection through a human rights-based approach is a missed opportunity to expedite reef protection while simultaneously advancing climate justice for both humans and nonhumans.</p>","author":"Emma F.
