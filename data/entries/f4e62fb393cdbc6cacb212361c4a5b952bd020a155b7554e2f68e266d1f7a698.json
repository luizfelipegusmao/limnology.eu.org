{"title":"A Novel Method for Online Diagnosis of Aging State of High-voltage (HV) Cables Based on Impedance Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1732/v1","date":1721667133000,"content":"In order to serve the online monitoring of the aging state of high-voltage (HV) cables, a novel method based on impedance spectroscopy has been proposed. Firstly, the method uses the Debye model to restore the dielectric response of the insulating material from the mechanism. Secondly, based on the transmission line equation, a calculation model for the impedance spectroscopy of HV cables was established. Then, the characteristics of the impedance spectroscopy under different overall aging and local deterioration states were analyzed. Further, the simulation analysis of the influence of factors such as load factor, length, metal resistivity, and geometric parameters on the impedance spectroscopy was carried out. Finally, diagnostic criteria were proposed, which are divided into two major categories: known cable parameters and unknown cable parameters. If the geometric parameters are known, the aging state can be determined using the resonance peak values and the resonance peak frequencies. If the geometric parameters are unknown, it is necessary to test the impedance spectroscopy in the healthy condition of the cable as the baseline curve. By comparing the impedance spectroscopy of the cable under test with the baseline curve, the aging development trend of the cable can also be determined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4e62fb393cdbc6cacb212361c4a5b952bd020a155b7554e2f68e266d1f7a698","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
