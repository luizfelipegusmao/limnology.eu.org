{"title":"Challenges and Opportunities for Waste-to-Energy Integration in Tamale&#039;s Waste Management System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1923/v1","date":1716958842000,"content":"Ghana Tamale's current waste management system is overwhelmed by the growing waste crisis, necessitating the exploration of Waste-to-Energy technologies as an innovative solution. This study explores challenges and opportunities for integrating Waste-to-Energy (WtE) technologies into Tamale's existing waste management system. Qualitative research identified policy hurdles, financial constraints, social concerns, and institutional weaknesses as key barriers. Conversely, stakeholder collaboration, public education, and capacity building emerged as some success fac-tors. A proposed implementation plan emphasizes feasibility studies, public engagement, pub-lic-private partnerships (PPPs), and technology selection based on waste composition. Addition-ally, a novel framework for WtE integration within a broader Integrated Solid Waste Manage-ment (ISWM) system is presented. This framework incorporates waste sorting, recycling, WtE alternatives, and responsible management of residuals. Validation by key stakeholders con-firmed the framework's potential to improve waste management in Tamale. By overcoming identified challenges and implementing the proposed framework, Tamale can achieve environ-mental sustainability, energy generation, and progress towards UN SDGs 7, 11, and 12. This re-search offers valuable insights for policymakers and paves the way for a cleaner and more sus-tainable future for Tamale, potentially serving as a model for other developing cities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e31debd3b81787185b9e2f07581526d00bc8f9ad48cb22991a12c21730de8a73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
