{"title":"Interannual variability of secondary production: long-term study of subarctic population of Monoporeia affinis (Amphipoda)","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05428-8","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The long-term dynamics of production of the glacial relict amphipod <em>Monoporeia affinis</em> was examined in a small subarctic lake. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the production of amphipods with their biomass; (2) to relate the changes in amphipod population with environmental variables. I hypothesized secondary production could provide better insight into <em>M. affinis</em> population dynamics, than abundance and biomass alone. Production (increment-summation method) and its standard error were estimated based on benthic samples taken at a sublittoral site from June 2002 to May 2019 (as a rule, 4â€“5 times a year). Production and biomass were highly correlated with each other. The annual P/B ratio varied twofold. However, the majority of estimates did not differ significantly from the mean P/B value for the study period. Effects of environmental variables (water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration) were pronounced for offspring and juvenile amphipods only. The older amphipods showed no significant correlation with any environmental variables. Despite the initial prediction, no reliable evidence was found that production revealed greater insight into population dynamics of <em>M. affinis</em>. This long-term study confirms that benthic production is mainly a function of biomass.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"b2df1bfad5d20e6cdcfe35bf7eba6123d2c7aa8245b07441b1f392c91df8c1ec","category":"Environment"}
