An aptamer, Cr-15, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i>\n<sub>d</sub>) of 4.42 ± 0.44 μmol L<sup>−1</sup> was obtained after only eight rounds of selection. Further innovative methods combining molecular docking, dynamic simulation and thermodynamic analysis revealed that CrO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup> could bind to the 19th and 20th guanine bases of Cr-15 via hydrogen bonds. Crucially, a label-free fluorometric aptasensor based on SYBR Green I was successfully constructed to detect CrO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup>, achieving a linear detection range of 60–300 nmol L<sup>−1</sup> with a lower limit of detection of 44.31 nmol L<sup>−1</sup>. Additionally, this aptasensor was able to quantitatively detect CrO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup> in grapes and broccoli within 40 min, with spike recovery rates ranging from 89.22% to 108.05%. The designed fluorometric aptasensor exhibited high selectivity and could detect CrO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup> in real samples without sample processing or target pre-enrichment.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The aptasensor demonstrated its potential as a reliable tool for monitoring Cr(VI) contamination in fruit and vegetable products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jiangxiong Zhu, \nHao Yin, \nSisi Zheng, \nHong Yu, \nLinnan Yang, \nLumei Wang, \nXueqing Geng, \nYun Deng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"905ba65fbd0a2137e35bcf1b69d8e3da2f3cec7baf1bd3c8afc237b9e23bb547","category":"Environment"}
