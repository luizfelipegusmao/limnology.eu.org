{"title":"Quantum Collapse in an Isolated Laboratory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1434/v2","date":1724726219000,"content":"A simple model of a measurement in a laboratory isolated from the environment is analyzed in detail, demonstrating the features of the collapse effect. Such an experiment can readily be implemented today under the idealization of an observer's memory as a simple quantum system. The central role of loss of information is emphasized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80d684d83b443b604fe2e23132094d50ac6f7fc29695c443dfc7583b03d20ed9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
