PCC 6803","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/621/7687704?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Photomixotrophic growth A (PmgA) is a pleiotropic regulator essential for growth under photomixotrophic and prolonged high-light (HL) conditions in the cyanobacterium <span>Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803. The overall similarity with the antisigma factor of the bacterial partner-switching system indicates that PmgA exerts a regulatory function via phosphorylation of its target proteins. In this study, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay and protein–protein interaction analysis and found that PmgA interacts with 4 antisigma antagonist homologs, Ssr1600, Slr1856, Slr1859, and Slr1912, but specifically phosphorylates Ssr1600. Phenotypic analyses using the set of gene disruption and overexpression strains of <span>pmgA</span> and <span>ssr1600</span> revealed that phosphorylation by PmgA is essential for the accumulation of Ssr1600 protein in vivo. The <span>ssr1600</span>-disrupted mutant showed similar phenotypes as those previously reported for the <span>pmgA</span>-disrupted mutant, namely, no obvious phenotype just after the shift to HL, but higher chlorophyll content, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis activity, and <span>psaAB</span> transcript levels than those in the wild type after 6 h. These findings indicate that the phosphorylated form of Ssr1600 works as the output of the partner-switching system to coordinately repress chlorophyll biosynthesis and accumulation of photosystem I during HL acclimation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4721f341182a2c6912da7f8fda0d6ca24671835305020837d9d9335cb78a99ac","category":"Environment"}
