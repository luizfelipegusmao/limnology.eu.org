{"title":"Opportunities and risks involved in using ChatGPT to create first grade science lesson plans","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305337","date":1718632800000,"content":"<p>by Wardell Powell, Steven Courchesne</p>\r\n\r\nGenerative AI can potentially support teachers in lesson planning by making the process of generating an outline more efficient. This qualitative study employed an exploratory case study design to examine a specific lesson design activity involving a series of prompts and responses from ChatGPT. The desired science lesson on heredity was aimed at first grade students. We analyzed the processâ€™s efficiency, finding that within 30 minutes we could generate and substantially refine a lesson plan that accurately aligned with the desired curriculum framework and the 5E model of instruction. However, the iterations of the lesson plan included questionable components, missing details, and a fake resource. We discussed the implications of these findings for faculty looking to train pre-service teachers to appropriately use generative AI in lesson planning.","author":"Wardell Powell","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"37d364cbba8e8221fd3037d6e495dd2a19b912140df1c47a4487f2b0881a51c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
