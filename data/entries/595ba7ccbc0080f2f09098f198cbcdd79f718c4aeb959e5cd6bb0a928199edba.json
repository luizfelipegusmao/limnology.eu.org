{"title":"A Multi-Analytical Approach to Identify Colorants in the Qajar Painted Wooden Decorative False Ceilings, From Northwest Iran","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/401/7641391?rss=1","date":1712275200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The purpose of this study was to analyze the pigments used in the wooden paintings of Zarir Mosque, dating back to the Safavid era in Maragheh, Iran. These paintings, known as “Pardu,” were commonly used for decorative false ceilings in various regions of Iran, particularly the northwest, during the Safavid and Qajar periods. Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, multiband imaging, and optical microscopy were employed to examine the pigments. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was also used to investigate the binder. The results indicated the use of orpiment, red lead, artificial ultramarine, carbon black, and gypsum for yellow, red, blue, black, and white pigments, respectively. Light blue colour was achieved by mixing gypsum and indigo, and gypsum was used as the primer layer in the painting. The presence of a protein-based binder, likely egg tempera, was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy. The presence of artificial ultramarine suggests that these paintings were created after 1828, when it was first synthesized, placing them in the Qajar period. The presence of an inscription from 1280 AH suggests that these panels may have been produced during the extensive renovations of the mosque in 1280 AH (1864 AD), during the Qajar era.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"595ba7ccbc0080f2f09098f198cbcdd79f718c4aeb959e5cd6bb0a928199edba","category":"Environment"}
