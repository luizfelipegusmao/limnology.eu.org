{"title":"Tectonic Inversion and Deformation Differences in the Transition From Ionian Basin to Apulian Platform: The Example From Ionian Islands, Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0917/v1","date":1718268842000,"content":"The studied area (the Ionian Islands: Paxoi, Lefkas, Kefalonia and Zakynthos), is situated in the western ends of Ionian Basin (IB) in contact with the Apulian Platform (AP) and named as Apulian Platform Margins (APM). The proposed model is based on fieldwork, previously published data and balanced geologic cross-sections. Late Jurassic characterizes Ionian Basin to Early Eocene NNW–SSE extension followed by Middle Eocene to Middle Miocene compression (NNW–SSE directed). The space availability, the distance of Ionian Thrust from the Kefalonia strike-slip fault (KSSF) and the altitude between Apulian platform and Ionian basin that produced during extensional regime were the main factors for the produced structures due to inversion tectonic. In Zakynthos Island, the space availability (far from KFT), and the reactivation of normal bounding faults formed an open geometry anticline (Vrachionas anticline) and a foreland basin (Kalamaki thrust foreland basin). In Kefalonia Island, the space from FKT was limited and the tectonic inversion formed anticline geometries (Aenos Mountain), nappes (within the Aenos Mountain) and small foreland basins (Argostoli gulf), all within the margins (APM). In Lefkas Island, the lack of space, very close to KFT, lead to the movement of the Ionian basin over the margins, attempting to overthrust the Apulian platform. Because the obstacle between basin and platform was very large, the moving part of Ionian Basin strongly deformed producing nappes and anticlines in the external part of the Ionian basin, and a very narrow foreland basin (Ionian Thrust foreland basin).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b43d2b60d1216ba33586ddc497ae02e3babfb9e262c20a4b3eb8065aee3b061d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
