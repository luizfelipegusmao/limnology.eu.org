{"title":"Multiplicity Counting Deadtime Corrections for Correlated Neutron Pulse Streams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0260/v1","date":1727950087000,"content":"We offer a generalization of the conventionally used dead-time correction formulas, provided by Dytlewski, for neutron multiplicity counting. This aims to take into account the conditional effects of gate opening and in-gate neutron losses, and thus, extends to correlated pulse streams. The provided formulas are simple and include explicitly corrected rates obtained with the conventional method. In the limit of weakly correlated pulses with low count rates the generalized formulas reduce to Dytlewskiâ€™s expressions. We also performed the numerical validation of the method by simulating pulse-trains sets, evaluating the generalized dead-time correction accuracy and comparing it to the conventional one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6f9f7aac10b28f6b30fd0ec492b7f0218bbb56d1da6e13c06239657a77d5628","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
