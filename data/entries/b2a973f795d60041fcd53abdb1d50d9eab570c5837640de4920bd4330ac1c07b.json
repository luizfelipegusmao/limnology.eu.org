{"title":"Characteristic Metabolites and Antioxidant Activities of Essential Oils from Phlomoides rotata (Benth. ex Hook. f.) Mathiesen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0584/v2","date":1717408795000,"content":"Limited research has been conducted on the metabolites present in the essential oils (EOs) of Phlomoides rotata (Benth. ex Hook. f.) Mathiesen (PR, syn. Lamiophlomis rotata (Benth.) Kudô), and their potential pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant properties, are often overlooked. We conducted a metabolomics-based screening to identify the characteristic metabolites (CMs) in the EOs extracted from PR. Meanwhile, we evaluated their in vitro antioxidant activities (AOAs). The EOs obtained through hydro-distillation are characterized by a light yellow color and a fresh, elegant fragrance. Cryoprecipitation was used to separate the crystals (Crs) from the EOs, resulting in the crystal-free EOs (CFs). A total of 121 components are identified and quantified in the EOs, Crs, and CFs. Among them, 84 were reported for the first time from such EOs. The major compounds include long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and their esters, such as palmitic acid (PA), myristic acid (MA), linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), stearic acid, and methyl palmitate (MP). Furthermore, 11 kinds of apocarotenoids (also called norisoprenoids) were first systematically investigated. Among them, eight C13-norisoprenoids, with trans-β-damascenone (DN) being particularly notable for its flavor, were identified. A sum of 11 CMs are screened , including PA, MA, LA, OA, MP, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, phytol (PT), DN, stearic acid, linalool, and hexanal. These CMs are biosynthesized through FAs and 2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathways. The in vitro AOAs of EOs, Crs, CFs, and seven selected CMs (PA, MA, LA, OA, MP, PT, and DN) were evaluated. Generally, PA and MA exhibited pro-oxidant activities (POAs) or weak AOAs. LA and OA demonstrated POAs or weak AOAs at lower concentrations, but at higher concentrations, they displayed medium to strong AOAs. Importantly, the CFs typically exhibited stronger AOAs compared to the corresponding EOs and Crs, potentially due to variations in their PA content. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential utilization of EOs from PR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2a973f795d60041fcd53abdb1d50d9eab570c5837640de4920bd4330ac1c07b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
