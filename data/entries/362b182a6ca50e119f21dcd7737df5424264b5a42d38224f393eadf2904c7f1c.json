{"title":"A Model of Individual BMI Trajectories","link":"https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/41/1/1/7505278?rss=1","date":1704153600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A risk factor model of body mass index (BMI) is an important building block of health simulations aimed at estimating government policy effects with regard to overweight and obesity. We created a model that generates representative population level distributions and that also mimics realistic BMI trajectories at an individual level so that policies aimed at individuals can be simulated. The model is constructed by combining several datasets. First, the population level distribution is extracted from a large, cross-sectional dataset. The trend in this distribution is estimated from historical data. In addition, longitudinal data are used to model how individuals move along typical trajectories over time. The model faithfully describes the population level distribution of BMI, stratified by sex, level of education and age. It is able to generate life course trajectories for individuals which seem plausible, but it does not capture extreme fluctuations, such as rapid weight loss.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"362b182a6ca50e119f21dcd7737df5424264b5a42d38224f393eadf2904c7f1c","category":"Environment"}
