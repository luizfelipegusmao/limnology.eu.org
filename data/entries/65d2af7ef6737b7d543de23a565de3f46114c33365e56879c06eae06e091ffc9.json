They have garnered increasing attention because of their potential for both the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The diversity of sEVs derives from their biological composition and cargo content. Currently, the isolation of sEV subpopulations is primarily based on bio-physical and affinity-based approaches. Since a standardized definition for sEV subpopulations is yet to be fully established, it is important to further investigate the correlation between the biomolecular composition of sEVs and their physical properties. In this study, we employed a platform combining single-vesicle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning to examine individual sEVs isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The biomolecular composition of each vesicle examined was reflected by its corresponding SERS spectral features (biomolecular “fingerprints”), with their roots in the composition of their collective Raman-active bonds. Origins of the SERS spectral features were validated through a comparative analysis between SERS and mass spectrometry (MS). SERS fingerprinting of individual vesicles was effective in overcoming the challenges posed by EV population averaging, allowing for the possibility of analyzing the variations in biomolecular composition between the vesicles of similar and/or different sizes. Using this approach, we uncovered that each of the size-based fractions of sEVs contained particles with predominantly similar SERS spectral features. Indeed, more than 84% of the vesicles residing within a particular group were clearly distinguishable from that of the other EV sub-populations, despite some spectral variations within each sub-population. Our results suggest the possibility that size-based EV fractionation methods produce samples where similarly eluted sEVs are correlated with their respective biochemical contents, as reflected by their SERS spectra. Our findings therefore highlight the possibility that the biogenesis and respective biological functionalities of the various sEV fractions may be inherently different.","author":"Zirui Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"65d2af7ef6737b7d543de23a565de3f46114c33365e56879c06eae06e091ffc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
