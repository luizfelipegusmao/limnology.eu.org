{"title":"Galactinol synthase 2 influences the metabolism of chlorophyll, carotenoids, and ethylene in tomato fruits","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3337/7629182?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Galactinol synthase (GolS), which catalyses the synthesis of galactinol, is the first critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) and contributes to plant growth and development, and resistance mechanisms. However, its role in fruit development remains largely unknown. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) to create the <span>gols2</span> mutant showing uniformly green fruits without dark-green shoulders, and promoting fruit ripening. Analysis indicated that galactinol was undetectable in the ovaries and fruits of the mutant, and the accumulation of chlorophyll and chloroplast development was suppressed in the fruits. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that genes related to chlorophyll accumulation and chloroplast development were down-regulated, including <span>PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE</span>, <span>GOLDEN 2-LIKE 2</span>, and <span>CHLOROPHYLL A/B-BINDING PROTEINS</span>. In addition, early color transformation and ethylene release was prompted in the <span>gols2</span> lines by regulation of the expression of genes involved in carotenoid and ethylene metabolism (e.g. <span>PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1</span>, <span>CAROTENE CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE</span>, and <span>1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLIC ACID SYNTHASE2/4</span>) and fruit ripening (e.g. <span>RIPENING INHIBITOR</span>, <span>NON-RIPENING</span>, and <span>APETALA2a</span>). Our results provide evidence for the involvement of <span>GolS2</span> in pigment and ethylene metabolism of tomato fruits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"e8d0541918dea219225ea81d80532d9d48bea7d567853af4401c882bba99e8db","category":"Environment"}
