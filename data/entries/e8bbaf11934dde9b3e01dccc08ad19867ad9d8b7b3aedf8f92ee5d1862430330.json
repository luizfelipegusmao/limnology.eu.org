{"title":"PSVII-14 Influence of dam parity and weaning strategy in previous lactation on feedlot performance of Nellore steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/617/7757780?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In tropical beef cattle production systems, the impact of seasonality may be particularly challenging for young cows (primiparous or secondiparous) due to their increased nutritional requirements, encompassing maintenance, growth, gestation, and, in the case of secondiparous cows, lactation. Literature indicates that extending the duration of lactation during gestation is associated with decreased performance of progeny in their postnatal life. Therefore, implementing an early weaning approach can be an effective strategy to alleviate the nutritional demands of lactation in dams, thereby allocating more nutrients for fetal growth. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of early weaning on the feedlot performance of progeny that were in utero at the time of weaning intervention. To create experimental units, secondiparous and multiparous Nellore cows were assigned to one of two weaning strategies, where suckling calves were either; 1) early weaned 150 d (EW); or 2) conventional weaned at 240 d (CW). All calves were weaned at 150 d of lactation in 2022. Three bulls were used: Bull 1: had 13 calves with multiparous cows, had 7 calves with secondiparous cows, comprising 11 EW and 9 CW; Bull 2: had 10 calves with multiparous cows, had 6 calves with secondiparous cows, comprising 6 EW and 10 CW; and Bull 3: had 7 calves with multiparous cows, had 15 calves with secondiparous cows, comprising 11 EW and 11 CW. All cows were managed similarly after weaning, and through parturition, and weaning of subsequent calf, with resulting calves used for the current experiment. Nellore bulls (n = 57) with an initial body weight (BW) of 417.23 ± 9.12 kg and 18 mo of age were allocated to feedlot pens (equipped with Intergado equipment) and fed a common total mixed ration (80:20; concentrate:corn silage) for 97 ± 1.60 d. Bulls were distributed in a randomized complete block in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, considering dam weaning strategy in the previous lactation (EW and CW) and dam parity at subsequent calving (multiparous or secondiparous cows, MC and SC, respectively). Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS 9.4, with a model including the effects of dam weaning strategy, dam parity, and their interaction. Data were considered significant when <span>P</span> values were less than 0.05 and indicated a trend when 0.05 &lt; <span>P</span> ≤ 0.10. There was an interaction between weaning strategy and cow parity, with calves born to SC-CW having reduced initial (<span>P</span> = 0.04) and final BW (<span>P</span> = 0.01) compared with all other groups (Figure 1 and 2). Steers from MC had greater dry matter intake (<span>P</span> = 0.003), and greater biological efficiency (<span>P</span> = 0.03; Table 1). Early weaning improved the final BW of steers born to secondiparous cows, suggesting it could be a strategy to enhance the performance of offspring and the reproductive performance of both secondiparous and multiparous cows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e8bbaf11934dde9b3e01dccc08ad19867ad9d8b7b3aedf8f92ee5d1862430330","category":"Environment"}
