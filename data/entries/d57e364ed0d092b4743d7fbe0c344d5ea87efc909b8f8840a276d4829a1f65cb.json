In recent years, despite their notorious brittleness, mechanical deformation has been employed to introduce dislocations into ferroelectric as structural defects in order to control their macroscopic properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.564-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.564-B2\">2</a>]. This approach has revealed a gap in the comprehension of the mechanical deformation of these materials and the interactions of dislocations with other structural features of ferroelectrics, such as domain walls, i.e. interfaces separating parts of the same direction of spontaneous polarization [<a href=\"#ozae044.564-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d57e364ed0d092b4743d7fbe0c344d5ea87efc909b8f8840a276d4829a1f65cb","category":"Environment"}
