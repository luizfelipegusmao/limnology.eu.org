{"title":"Paper-Based Analytical Devices Based on Amino-MOFs (Mil-125, UiO-66 and Mil-101) as Platforms towards Biosensing Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2100/v1","date":1724916255000,"content":"In this study, we have designed a promising platform based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to develop paper-based analytical devices (PADs) to immobilize biomolecules for application in biosensors. PADs have become increasingly popular in sensing applications in recent years due to their portability, low cost, simplicity, efficiency, fast detection capability, excellent sensitivity, and selectivity. In addition, MOFs are an excellent choice for developing highly sensitive and selective sensors. Their ability to reversibly and reproducibly adsorb and desorb specific molecules allows using these materials as sensors for various applications. They also offer the possibility to modify their structure and properties, making them highly versatile and adaptable to different environments and sensing needs. In this research, we synthesized and characterized three different amino-functionalized MOFs: UiO66-NH2 (Zr), MIL125-NH2 (Ti), and MIL101-NH2 (Fe). These MOFs were used to fabricate PADs capable of sensitive and portable monitoring of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Overall, amino-derivated MOF platforms demonstrate significant potential for integration into biosensor PADs, offering key properties that enhance their performance and applicability in analytical chemistry and diagnostics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acef46cbf7f5bd6ce247edc6df016fb71b52631bf954c351817eb103f46d54d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
