{"title":"The Kirkhouse Trust: Successes and Challenges in Twenty Years of Supporting Independent, Contemporary Grain Legume Breeding Projects in India and African Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1462/v1","date":1713870417000,"content":"This manuscript reviews two decades of projects funded by the Kirkhouse Trust (KT), a charity registered in the UK. KT was established to improve the productivity of legume crops important in African countries and in India. KTâ€™s requirements for support are: 1) the research must be done by national scientists in their home institution, either a publicly funded agricultural research institute or a university; 2) the projects need to include a molecular biology component, which to date has mostly comprised the use of molecular markers for the selection of one or more target traits in a crop improvement programme; 3) the projects funded are included in consortia, to foster the creation of scientific communities and the sharing of knowledge and breeding resources. This account relates to the key achievements and challenges, reflects on the lessons learned and outlines future research priorities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62a144cdfae0da2a1418e8ba5799dd1d288e9cd1bd1748f6ff2af6721093db05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
