{"title":"Enhancing Inner Area Reevaluation Through Optional Control Programmes for Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis and Ruminant Paratuberculosis Potentially Linked to Crohn’s Disease in Humans","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1987/v2","date":1728638727000,"content":"Regulation (EU) 2016/429 establishes new extensive guidelines for managing transmissible animal diseases, including zoonoses. The Commission Implementing Regulation 2018/1882 classifies diseases into five categories based on their prevalence and the required response, ranging from eradication to surveillance. Key aspects of the regulations concern emphasis on animal traceability, biosecurity, wildlife pathogen control, sustainable farming, and the reduction of the impact of diseases on both public and animal health, as well as on the environment. These align with the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the One Health approach. In Italian inner areas—similarly to other European regions that are fragile, remote from major service centers, and often neglected—agropastoral and agri-food activities are beneficial for tourism, commercialization of typical foods, and recreational activities. In these areas including the Molise Region, the activation of optional programmes within the framework of the aforementioned regulations could help control infectious animal diseases that are not subject to mandatory eradication but cause income loss and trade restrictions, such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and paratuberculosis, a suspected zoonosis potentially linked to Crohn's disease in humans. These programmes could boost the economic income of local extensive breeding, counteract depopulation, and protect human and animal health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57ad6c48e3e951ed658cb3c34b623dc7ec1b10d6790be71d712b3e177d2c42ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
