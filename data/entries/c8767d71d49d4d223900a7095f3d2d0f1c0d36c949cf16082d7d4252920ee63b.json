{"title":"Performance Based Design of Alkali Activated Concrete for High Thermal Load Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0829/v1","date":1726045349000,"content":"The optimal combination of five components to develop a concrete for high-temperature applications was studied through a response surface methodology known as mixture design of experiment. The selected components were water, an alkali-activated binder based on ferronickel slag activated with potassium silicate and potassium hydroxide, and three aggregate sizes corresponding to 0-4 mm, 4-8 mm, and 8-16 mm. Selected response parameters were slump and compressive strength before and after heat exposure. Six cubes of side 150 mm were cast for each concrete mix, three for ambient and three for residual (post-heat exposure) compressive strength. All 20 concrete mixes were exposed to a thermal load of 600 Â°C for two hours. The optimal concrete mix was adapted for large-scale applications, by increasing slump and replacing limestone with olivine aggregates for enhanced residual compressive strength. The adapted mix resulted in concrete with 76 MPa and 32 MPa compressive strength before and after high-temperature exposure. The CO2 emissions were found to be 77 % lower when compared to traditional OPC concrete.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8767d71d49d4d223900a7095f3d2d0f1c0d36c949cf16082d7d4252920ee63b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
