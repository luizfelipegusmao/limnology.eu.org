{"title":"Complete Chloroplast Genome Assembly of Garcinia indica (Thouars) Choisy: Comparative Genomics and Identification of Potential Barcode Markers for Kokum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0494/v1","date":1723012714000,"content":"Garcinia indica (Thouars) Choisy (commonly known as Kokum) is an important medicinal plant in Ayurvedic medicine and belonging to the Clusiaceae family. Kokum is a highly traded medicinal plant species of India, dried rind of fruits and butter from seeds are traded in the markets. This study aimed to assemble the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of G. indica and compare it with the previously published cp genome within the Garcinia taxa to identify the potential species-specific barcode marker for Kokum authentication. The assembled cp genome, with a size of 1,56,891 bp, exhibits a typical quadripartite structure. The large single-copy (LSC) region spans 85,580 bp, and the small single-copy (SSC) region spans 17,181 bp, together comprising 64.5% of the genome. The pair of inverted repeats (IRA and IRB) are each 27,065 bp, covering the remaining 35.5% of the genome. A total of 126 unique genes were identified, including 86 protein-coding genes, 32 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis using complete cp genomes from 12 species in the Clusiaceae family indicated that 10 Garcinia species form a sister clade. Notably, the ycf1 gene in the LSC region was more divergent within the Garcinia species. This study presents the first report on the chloroplast genome of G. indica. This chloroplast genome resource provides a basis for identifying new DNA barcode marker as well as species-specific marker for herbal drug authentication of Kokum, and species delineation within the Garcinia genus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"440ae24c5d68eba9f0be5a77cb629cdd3af087fb061135f25358a80049e34c5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
