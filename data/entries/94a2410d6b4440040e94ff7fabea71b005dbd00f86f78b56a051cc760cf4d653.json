{"title":"Antifungal Synergy: Mechanistic Insights into the R-1-R Peptide and Bidens pilosa Extract as Potent Therapeutics against Candida spp. through Proteomics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0462/v1","date":1720099252000,"content":"It was previously reported that the peptide derived from LfcinB, R-1-R exhibited anti-Candida activity and this activity was enhanced in combination with an extract from the Bidens pilosa plant. However, the mechanism of action has not been studied. In the current study, a proteomic study was carried out, followed by a bioinformatic analysis and biological assays in both SC5314 strain and a fluconazole-resistant isolate of Candida albicans, after incubation with R-1-R. The proteomic data showed that after treatment with R-1-R in the two study strains, most of the differentially expressed proteins in comparison to controls were up-regulated. These proteins were mainly involved in membrane and cell wall biosynthesis, membrane transporters, oxidative stress, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and response to DNA damage. Besides, the proteomic analysis of C. albicans parental strain SC5314 treated with R-1-R in combination with an ethanolic extract of B. pilosa was also undertaken. The proteins differentially expressed after this treatment were involved in similar functional processes as the proteins differentially expressed after treatment with R-1-R peptide alone, but at different levels and were mostly down-regulated. The biological assays allowed validation of the proteomic results, evidencing damage to the cell surface, generation of reactive oxygen species and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. The results provide information to begin to unlock the understanding of the complex antifungal mode of action of the R-1-R peptide, its combination with the extract, and possibly other derivatives of natural products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94a2410d6b4440040e94ff7fabea71b005dbd00f86f78b56a051cc760cf4d653","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
