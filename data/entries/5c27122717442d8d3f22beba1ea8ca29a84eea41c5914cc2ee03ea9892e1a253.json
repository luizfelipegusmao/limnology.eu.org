{"title":"Anodic Production and Characterization of Biomimetic Oxide Layers on Grade 4 Titanium for Medical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0093/v1","date":1714644279000,"content":"Biomaterials are the basis for the development of medicine because they allow safe contact with a living organism. The aim of this work was to produce innovative oxide layers with a porous microstructure on the surface of commercially pure titanium Grade 4 (CpTi G4), and to characterize their properties as drug carriers. Anodization of the CpTi G4 subjected to mechanical grinding and electrochemical polishing was carried out in a solution of 1M ethylene glycol with the addition of 40 g of ammonium fluoride at a voltage of 20 V for 2, 18, 24 and 48 hours at room temperature. It was found that the longer anodization time, the greater the number of pores formed on the CpTi G4 surface as revealed by FE-SEM method, and the greater the surface roughness determined in profilometric tests. As the anodizing time increases, the amount of the drug in the form of gentamicin sulfate incorporated into the resulting pores decreases. The most favorable drug release kinetics profile determined by UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy was found for the CpTi G4 anodized for 2 h making them the best choice when it comes to the drug carrier allowing full use of the therapeutic dose of the drug.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c27122717442d8d3f22beba1ea8ca29a84eea41c5914cc2ee03ea9892e1a253","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
