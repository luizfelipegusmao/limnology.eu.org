{"title":"Machine Learning Algorithm for Predicting Distant Metastasis of T1 and T2 Gallbladder Cancer Based on Seer Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1736/v1","date":1721662261000,"content":"(1) Background: We aim to construct a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict the risk of distant metastasis (DM) of T1 and T2gallbladder cancer (GBC); (2) Demographic and clinical pathological data of T1 and T2 GBC patients were extracted from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)â€™s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2015 to develop seven ML algorithm models. Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1- score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); (3) Results:A total of 4371 patients were included in the study, of whom 764 (17.4%) developed DM. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age, histology, tumor size, T and N stages were independent factors in GBC with DM. A novel nomogram was established to predict distant metastasis in early T stage GBC patients. Evaluation indicators of the best model Random Forest (RF) were as follows: accuracy (0.828), recall rate (0.862), precision (0.811), F1- score (0.836), and AUC value (0.913); (4) Con-clusions: The RF model constructed in this study could accurately predict distant metastasis in GBC patients, which may provide clinicians with more personalized clinical decision-making recom-mendations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55d8ba2f98223a8498bd92e9fb59c8a4bd34180fc7b2abbc929c9c88a3ce99ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
