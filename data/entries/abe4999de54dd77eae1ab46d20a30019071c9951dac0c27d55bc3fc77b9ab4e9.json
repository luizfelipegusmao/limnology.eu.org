{"title":"Universal mRNA-based HIV Vaccine for Acute and Latent Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1035/v1","date":1710757483000,"content":"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and its latent recurrent infection make vaccine development a significant challenge for traditional vaccines; however, the mRNA delivery of multiepitope antigens capable of creating antibodies against the surface proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 along with their respective Nef proteins, responsible for the latent infection can bring a most effective, as well as affordable solution to the unresolved epidemics of HIV. In this paper, we present the complete design of a multiepitope vaccine to prevent acute infections and inactivate Nef proteins that block the MHC-1 and MHC-2 pathways to hide the virus for later reinfection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abe4999de54dd77eae1ab46d20a30019071c9951dac0c27d55bc3fc77b9ab4e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
