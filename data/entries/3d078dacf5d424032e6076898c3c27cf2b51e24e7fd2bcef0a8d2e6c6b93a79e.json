{"title":"Multifactor agitation: Several minor stresses severely compromise crop growth when combined","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1248/7420155?rss=1","date":1699920000000,"content":"<span>“The stresses imposed by climate change will limit agricultural production during the next century.” A version of this alarming but vague sentence can often be seen in news, media, and scientific journals, but precisely how climate change affects crops is not well understood due to the complex and variable ways climate change manifests. For simplicity, the impact of abiotic stress is usually evaluated using one stressor in isolation (e.g. how does drought stress affect growth?), but in a farmer's field, multiple stressful conditions often occur together, such as simultaneous heat and drought stress or flooding and high salinity during a tropical storm. Furthermore, the erratic nature of climate change events imposes unpredictable combinations of stressful conditions. How multiple stresses affect plant performance is called multifactorial stress combination (MFSC), and in this issue of <span>Plant Physiology</span>, <a href=\"#kiad608-B2\">Sinha et al. (2023)</a> uncover how this phenomenon affects rice and maize.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3d078dacf5d424032e6076898c3c27cf2b51e24e7fd2bcef0a8d2e6c6b93a79e","category":"Environment"}
