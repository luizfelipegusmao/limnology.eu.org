{"title":"Title: Detecting Gaps in Knowledge: The Case of the Anisakis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1418/v1","date":1718887250000,"content":"In the marine environment, fish parasites are present in most species of seafood. The most com-mon is Anisakis spp. a nematode that can parasitize human tissues causing anisakiasis and al-lergies, in some cases with a strong reaction such as anaphylactic shock in sensitive people. This happens when people ingest live or dead larvae present in the muscles or viscera of a wide range of seafood, fish and cephalopods. Consumer education has been positioned as one of the most ef-fective alternatives for its prevention. This study sought to identify the species that present the greatest risk of anisakiasis for consumers taking into account sex, age and their knowledge about this parasitosis. The objective was to offer recommendations for better consumer information to-wards the prevention of infections by worm larvae. The results revealed that the species most at risk were hake and cod and that young participants know more about the risks of anisakiasis from raw seafood. The gaps detected in the knowledge about the ability of thermal treatments to eliminate parasites, especially in allergic people, must be addressed for better prevention, sug-gesting campaigns adapted by sectors of the population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22d69f13307fa6ada6c671b1d09c36835dafcc107133d9f6d80541abf30b0c5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
