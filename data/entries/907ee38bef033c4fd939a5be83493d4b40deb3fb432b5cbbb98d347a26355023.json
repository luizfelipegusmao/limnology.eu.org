{"title":"Analysis of Aromatic Fraction of Sparkling Wine Manufactured by Second Fermentation and Aging in Bottle Using Different Types of Closures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0523/v1","date":1723033418000,"content":"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different closures used in second fermentation on the aromatic fraction of sparkling wine. Six types of closures (cork stoppers and screw cap) and 94 months of aging in bottle were investigated. Head-space-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and thermal desorption (TD) procedures coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMSMS) analysis was applied. The vectors containing the relative abundance of the volatile compounds are compositional vectors. The statistical analysis of compositional data requires specific techniques that differ from standard techniques.101 volatile compounds were identified. HS-SPME extracted highest percentage of ester, ketones and other compounds while TD was a useful tool for the obtention of alcohol, acid, ether and alkanes compounds. Esters was the most abundant family of compounds. Compositional data analysis applied to study the impact of different closures used in bottle-aging after second fermentation on the volatile composition of sparkling wine concluded that there are differences in the relative abundance of certain volatile compounds between cork stoppers and screw cap closures group. Overall, the most abundant part in screw cap closures was Ethyl hexanoate and, Ethyl octanoate in cork stoppers. Also, the proportion amount of Dimethylamine was higher in screw cap closures than cork stoppers group relative to the entire of the sample.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"907ee38bef033c4fd939a5be83493d4b40deb3fb432b5cbbb98d347a26355023","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
