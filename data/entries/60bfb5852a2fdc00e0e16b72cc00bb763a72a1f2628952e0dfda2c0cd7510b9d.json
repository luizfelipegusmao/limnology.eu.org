{"title":"The Fisher-Tully Law solely with 1915 General Relativity and Dark Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0669/v1","date":1712658620000,"content":"Observation of the distribution of the velocity of galactic rotation curves differed from their expected centripetal form and lead to the notion of Dark Matter or modifications to Newtonian and General Relativity, such as MOND, TeVeS and the like and even Quantised Inertia. We aim to show that General Relativity with Dark Energy/the Cosmological Constant is all that is needed, with the proviso that the Cosmological Constant can increase in the presence of a light flux or some other factor from galaxies and become gravitating; the need for Dark Matter may be abated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60bfb5852a2fdc00e0e16b72cc00bb763a72a1f2628952e0dfda2c0cd7510b9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
