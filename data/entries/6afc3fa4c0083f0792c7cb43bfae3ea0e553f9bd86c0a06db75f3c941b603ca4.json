{"title":"Sputnik V-induced Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Variants during the Dissemination of the Gamma Variant in Venezuela","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0308/v1","date":1720016317000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by the emergence and succession of SARS-CoV-2 variants able to evade the antibody response induced by natural infection and vaccination. In this study, IgG reactivity and neutralizing capacity of the serum of individuals vaccinated with Sputnik V was determined against the spike glycoprotein (S) of the ancestral and different viral variants. At 42 daysâ€™ post vaccination, the frequency of recognition and reactivity to S protein of the omicron variant was lower compared to the other variants. There was higher reactivity to Alpha and Delta S protein compared to ancestral S protein. A higher neutralization titer was seen against the ancestral variant compared to the variants, especially Omicron. Some sera exhibited a higher neutralization titer to the Gamma variant, compared to the ancestral variant. This may be due to exposure to this variant during the period of its spread in the country, which coincided with the period of the clinical trial. A correlation was found between reactivity to S and neutralization titer to each variant. These results suggest that antibodies induced by Sputnik-V can recognize, persist and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Venezuela, with Omicron being the one that best evades this response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6afc3fa4c0083f0792c7cb43bfae3ea0e553f9bd86c0a06db75f3c941b603ca4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
