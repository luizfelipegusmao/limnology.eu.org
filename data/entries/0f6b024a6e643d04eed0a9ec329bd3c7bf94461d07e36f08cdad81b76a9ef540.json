{"title":"Polysaccharide extract of <i>Spirulina</i> sp. increases effector immune-cell killing activities against cholangiocarcinoma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312414","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Aussara Panya, Methi Wathikthinnakon, Chutamas Thepmalee, Chutipa Chiawpanit, Suthida Panwong, Yupanun Wutti-in, Preeyanat Vongchan, Phennapha Klangsinsirikul, Pachara Sattayawat, Jeeraporn Pekkoh</p>\r\n\r\nCyanobacteria and algae serving as promising food supplements have recently garnered attention for their emerging potential in anti-cancer activity. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) or bile duct cancer is one of the top-leading cancers affecting people, particularly in Asian continent. With patients exhibiting no or minimal symptoms in the early stages, advanced CCA is often diagnosed, and primary treatments such as surgery may not be suitable. Discovery of natural bioactive compounds for cancer treatments have, thus, attracted attention as one of the effective means to combat CCA or to supplement primary treatments. In this work, ethanolic and polysaccharide extracts of cyanobacteria and algae were tested for their cytotoxicity against 2 CCA cell lines (KKU055 and KKU213A). The ethanolic extracts from <i>Leptolyngbya</i> sp. and <i>Chlorella</i> sp. demonstrated growth inhibition of both CCA cell lines, with IC50 values of 0.658 mg/mL and 0.687 mg/mL for KKU055, and 0.656 mg/mL and 0.450 mg/mL for KKU213A. In contrast, only the polysaccharide extracts from <i>Sargassum</i> spp. exhibited a remarkable cytotoxic effect, while the polysaccharide extract from <i>Spirulina</i> sp. showed slight effect only at a higher concentration (2 mg/mL). All tested extracts were further investigated for improving immune cell killing ability and showed that <i>Spirulina</i> sp. polysaccharide extract was able to improve the immune cell killing ability. This extract was then investigated for its effects on the immune cell population, which demonstrated to have positive impact on NK cell population. To further explore the potential use, synergistic effect of <i>Spirulina</i> sp. polysaccharide extract with an already-in-use chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, on immune cell cytotoxicity was investigated. The results showed that the immune cell cytotoxicity was enhanced in the co-treatment compared to the use of each treatment separately. The most apparent difference was observed in KKU055 cells where % living cells were reduced from 78.96% (immune cell alone) to 20.93% when the combined gemcitabine and <i>Spirulina</i> sp. extracts were used.","author":"Aussara Panya","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f6b024a6e643d04eed0a9ec329bd3c7bf94461d07e36f08cdad81b76a9ef540","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
