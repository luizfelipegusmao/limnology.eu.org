{"title":"Enhancing Patient-Centered Care: Front-End Integration of Phenotypic and Genotypic Data With Medical Ontology Conceptual Frameworks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0184/v1","date":1719892047000,"content":"In the context of modern healthcare, the concept of patient-centered care (PCC) has emerged as a crucial aspect, prompting the need for innovative frameworks to empower patients and enhance healthcare outcomes. This paper introduces the Patient-Oriented Medical Ontology Conceptual Framework (POMOCF), a powerful framework aimed at giving patients control over their personal and healthcare information. It prioritizes patient independence by allowing for direct control of electronic health records (EHRs) and facilitates the gathering of information through document upload or scanning. In the POMOCF front-end framework, we propose to maintain scalability, along with robust authorization, authentication, and secure data protocols, all of which are detailed within the framework. This approach enhances data accuracy and security, improving data management efficiency. As part of our ongoing development, we are planning to implement an innovative inference system that will automatically analyze and extract relevant details from the uploaded authorized document, provide real-time updates, and maintain data accuracy. This approach further strengthens data accuracy and prevents unauthorized modifications, thereby making the data management process more efficient. POMOCF leverages medical ontology principles to ensure standardized clinical concepts and improved semantic interoperability. Our integration plans involve integrating genotypic data for personalized medicine initiatives and strengthening the front-end infrastructure. By linking front-end interfaces with advanced technological solutions, we aim to provide effective healthcare delivery, promoting personalized care and enhancing patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"666cee913d3d79ee7a3f630626e74dcad27ae3dfaf117a05f2832caa26538864","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
