{"title":"Randomized Controlled Trial on the Effects of Home-based Breathing Exercise on Respiratory Funtion and Fatigue in COVID-19 Cured Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0450/v1","date":1720131641000,"content":"This study investigates the effects of home-based Kakao health care breathing exercises and stretching on respiratory function and fatigue in COVID-19 cured patients. A total of 35 participants performed four movements of home-based breathing exercise and five respiratory muscle stretching exercises four times a week for four weeks. Respiratory function was measured using FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and PEF. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Data analysis was performed using Independent Samples and Paired Samples T-tests in SPSS 24, with a significance level set at p &amp;lt; 0.05. After four weeks of Home based Kakao health care Breathing Exercise, there were significant increases in respiratory FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and PEF function values observed in the training group (T.G.) after the exercise intervention (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Such an increase was observed when comparing these values with the pre-exercise measurements. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in respiratory function outcomes before and after exercise in the control group (C.G.) (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The FSS scores were statistically significant within the training group (T.G.). (p &amp;gt;0.05). The 4-week Kakao health care Breathing Exercise was found to be capable of improving some respiratory functions in COVID-19-recovered patients, but it showed no significant improvement in fatigue levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41675f9cb035ecc80bcdf6ee65228d8b429c3314271e80cef2416fbbe9d0c0f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
