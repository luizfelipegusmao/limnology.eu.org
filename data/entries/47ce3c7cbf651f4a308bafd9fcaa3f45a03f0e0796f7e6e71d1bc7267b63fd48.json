{"title":"Improved Brain Function with Deep Spectrum Biotherapeutics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1073/v1","date":1710821585000,"content":"In this case series, we examine the impact of the Titan-iR ProÂ® deep spectrum biotherapeutic device on brain function in healthy individuals. Here we present 15 participants, aged 26-68 years, who enrolled in this open-label study, designed to assess the effect of a single 15-minute course of deep spectrum biotherapy on brain function. Although symptom-free upon enrollment, participants had diverse medical histories with some displaying early signs of cognitive decline. As part of the evaluation, all participants engaged in electroencephalogram (EEG) recording sessions that focused on assessing event-related potential (ERP) evaluations, including audio P300 amplitudes and latencies (speeds), neurocognitive testing, and physical reaction times. Following the Titan-iR Pro intervention an improvement in EEG-based cognitive markers was observed. These results underscore the importance of further investigation into the potential of advanced and deep spectrum photobiomodulation in the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and other neurological disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47ce3c7cbf651f4a308bafd9fcaa3f45a03f0e0796f7e6e71d1bc7267b63fd48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
