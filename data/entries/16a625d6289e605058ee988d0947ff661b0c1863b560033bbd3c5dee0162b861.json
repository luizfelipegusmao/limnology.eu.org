{"title":"Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding air pollution and health effects among general people: A multi-divisional cross-sectional study in Bangladesh","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305075","date":1718114400000,"content":"<p>by Abu Bakkar Siddique, Md. Safaet Hossain Sujan, Sanjida Ahmed, Kifayat Sadmam Ishadi, Rafia Tasnim, Md. Saiful Islam, Md. Shakhaoat Hossain</p>\r\nBackground <p>Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with more than one-third of its people living in cities, and its air quality is among the worst in the world. The present study aimed to measure knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) towards air pollution and health effects among the general population living in the large cities in Bangladesh.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional e-survey was conducted between May and July 2022 among eight divisions in Bangladesh. A convenience sampling technique was utilized to recruit a total of 1,603 participants (55.58% males; mean age: 23.84 ± 5.93 years). A semi-structured questionnaire including informed consent, socio-demographic information, as well as questions regarding knowledge (11-item), attitudes (7-item) and practice (11-item) towards air pollution, was used to conduct the survey. All analyses (descriptive statistics and regression analyses) were performed using STATA (Version 15.0) and SPSS (Version 26.0).</p> Results <p>The mean scores of the knowledge, attitudes, and practice were 8.51 ± 2.01 (out of 11), 19.24 ± 1.56 (out of 21), and 12.65 ±5.93 (out of 22), respectively. The higher scores of knowledge, attitudes, and practice were significantly associated with several socio-demographic factors, including educational qualification, family type, residential division, cooking fuel type, etc.</p> Conclusions <p>The present study found a fair level of knowledge and attitudes towards air pollution; however, the level of practice is not particularly noteworthy. The finding suggests the need to create more awareness among the general population to increase healthy practice to reduce the health effects of air pollution.</p>","author":"Abu Bakkar Siddique","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"16a625d6289e605058ee988d0947ff661b0c1863b560033bbd3c5dee0162b861","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
