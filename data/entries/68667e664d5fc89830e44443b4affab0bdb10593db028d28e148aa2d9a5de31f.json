{"title":"Carbapenems Resistant Nocardia ?! - A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1605/v1","date":1726814188000,"content":"Nocardia is an emerging bacterial disease that often affects patients with compromised immune systems. As survival increases, more and more patients are receiving solid organ transplantations, and more patients are cancer survivors and receiving long-term immune system modifying agents or corticotherapy and immunosuppressive agents, organisms that are not harmful in usual circumstances become a public health problem.\nCarbapenems are usually a second-line therapy in the setting of Nocardia infections. We present the case of a patient who had an immunocompromised status and was diagnosed with Nocardia farcinica, which showed in vitro resistance to carbapenems. The symptoms were non-specific and had a common presentation, although the infection was disseminated and had severe CNS and ocular involvement.\nThe clinical course was more severe when the carbapenem was withdrawn based on the provided antibiogram and markedly improved when clinical judgment considered it might be beneficial.\nThe first case in our region to describe an „in vitro” carbapenem-resistant Nocardia species, that responded „in vivo” differently and we believe it is important to remind clinicians of this potentially severe disease in difficult cases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68667e664d5fc89830e44443b4affab0bdb10593db028d28e148aa2d9a5de31f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
