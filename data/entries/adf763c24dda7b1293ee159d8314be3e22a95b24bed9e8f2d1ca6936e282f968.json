Rhizobial recognition triggers a plant symbiotic signaling pathway that activates 2 coordinated processes: infection and nodule organogenesis. How these processes are orchestrated in legume species utilizing intercellular infection and lateral root base nodulation remains elusive. Here, we show that <span>Aeschynomene evenia</span> OROSOMUCOID PROTEIN 1 (AeORM1), a key regulator of sphingolipid biosynthesis, is required for nodule formation. Using <span>A. evenia orm1</span> mutants, we demonstrate that alterations in AeORM1 function trigger numerous early aborted nodules, defense-like reactions, and shorter lateral roots. Accordingly, <span>AeORM1</span> is expressed during lateral root initiation and elongation, including at lateral root bases where nodule primordium form in the presence of symbiotic bradyrhizobia. Sphingolipidomics revealed that mutations in <span>AeORM1</span> lead to sphingolipid overaccumulation in roots relative to the wild type, particularly for very long-chain fatty acid-containing ceramides. Taken together, our findings reveal that AeORM1-regulated sphingolipid homeostasis is essential for rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis, as well as for lateral root development in <span>A. evenia</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"adf763c24dda7b1293ee159d8314be3e22a95b24bed9e8f2d1ca6936e282f968","category":"Environment"}
