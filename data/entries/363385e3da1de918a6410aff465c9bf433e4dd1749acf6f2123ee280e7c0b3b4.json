{"title":"Computational Methods to Predict Conformational B-cell Epitopes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0943/v1","date":1720685627000,"content":"Accurate computational prediction of B-cell epitopes can greatly enhance biomedical research and rapidly advance efforts to develop therapeutics, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and immunodiagnostic reagents. Previous research efforts have primarily focused on the development of computational methods to predict linear epitopes rather than conformational epitopes, although the latter is much more biologically predominant. Several conformational B-cell epitope prediction methods have recently been published, but their predictive performances are weak. Here, we present a review of the latest computational methods and assess their performances on a diverse test set of 29 non-redundant unbound antigen structures. Our results demonstrate that ISPIPab outperformed all other methods. Finally, we suggest new strategies and opportu-nities to improve computational predictions of conformational B-cell epitopes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"363385e3da1de918a6410aff465c9bf433e4dd1749acf6f2123ee280e7c0b3b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
