{"title":"The Diagnostic Challenge of Cystic Echinococcosis in Humans: First Assessment of Underreporting Rates in Mongolia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0920/v1","date":1718283292000,"content":"Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, is significantly underreported in Mongolia due to geographical remoteness, lack of early diagnostics, and poor clinical management. This study aimed to provide a more accurate estimate of CE in Mongolia by comparing data of surgical (reported) and diagnosed (unreported) cases, and assessing the challenges faced by rural doctors in disease management and surveillance. We collected data on surgical cases hospitalized between 2006-2016 and newly diagnosed CE cases in 2016 from eight provinces. Using a quasi-Poisson regression model of the collected data, we used extrapolation to estimate the number of diagnosed cases for the entire country. Additionally, fourty health professionals from all 21 provinces rated local clinical management for CE through a questionnaire. Results reveal that surgical cases (2.2 per year) represent only one-eighth of diagnosed cases (15.9 per year). The laboratory facilities, disease reporting, and cyst classification usage scored below 2. These results highlight the significant underreporting of CE in Mongolia and urges human and animal health experts, along with policymakers, to invest into combating CE, particularly in remote provincial areas. It also emphasizes the need for standard clinical management involving cyst classification according to WHO-IWGE, seamless integration of CE reporting and monitoring mechanisms, which can significantly contribute to the national and global burden estimation of CE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4119b77593df887474218390d89c6e987f48ba95bd1a1f77a6b1f6e5425e7398","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
