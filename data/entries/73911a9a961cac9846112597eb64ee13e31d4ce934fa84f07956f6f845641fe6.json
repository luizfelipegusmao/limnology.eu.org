{"title":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Dipole Antenna with Compact Size and Low-Pass Filtering Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1496/v1","date":1716453837000,"content":"This paper presents a compact wideband circularly polarized cross dipole antenna with low-pass filter response. It consists of two pairs of folded crossed dipole arms printed separately on both sides of the top substrate, and the two dipole arms on the same surface are connected by an annular phase-shifting delay line to generate circular polarization. A bent metal square ring and four small metal square rings around the cross dipoles are employed to introduce new resonant frequencies, effectively extending the impedance and axial ratio bandwidth. Four square patches printed on the middle substrate are connected to the ground plane by the vertical metal plates, in order to reduce the antenna height. Thus, a compact wideband circularly polarized antenna is realized. In addition, a transmission zero can be introduced at the upper frequency stopband by the bent metal square rings, without using extra filter circuits. For verification, the proposed model is implemented and tested. The overall size of the model is 90mm×90mm×33mm(0.37λ0×0.37λ0×0.14λ0, λ0 denotes the center operating frequency). The measured impedance bandwidth and 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth are 53.3% and 41%, respectively. More than 15 dB upper-band radiation suppression level is realized, indicating a good low-pass filter response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73911a9a961cac9846112597eb64ee13e31d4ce934fa84f07956f6f845641fe6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
