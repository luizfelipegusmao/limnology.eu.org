{"title":"Effect of Omega 3 Fatty Acids on Inflammation Resolution in Pa-Tients with Obesity: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2041/v1","date":1719634493000,"content":"Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Polyunsaturated fatty ac-ids such as omega-3 (n-3), are essential in the pro-resolution of inflammation. An 8-week double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted with a n-6:n-3, 5:1 ratio, along with daily 1.8 g of n-3 supplementation vs. placebo. A total of 40 subjects were included, 21 in omega 3 group and 19 in placebo group. The n-3 supplementation had a superior effect compared to placebo increasing levels of Resolvin D1 [129.3 (-90.1 - 193.5) vs. -16.8 (-237.8 - 92.5) pg/mL, p=0.041], IL-10 [1.4 (-0.7 - 4.6) vs. -2.0 (-5 - 0.05) pg/mL, p=0.001], and decreasing IL-6 [-0.67 (2.72 - -0.59) vs. 0.03 (-0.59 - 1.84) pg/mL p=0.015], and MCP-1 [-29.6 (-94.9 - 5.50) vs. 18.3 (-97.3 - 66.35) pg/mL, p=0.040]. In con-clusion, n-3 supplementation promoted resolution of inflammation by increasing sys-temic levels of Resolvin D1, IL-10, and decreasing IL-6 and MCP-1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a794fb39e5c83c2c7461bee6e5c30c0f68233ed52c98f5b4d64bdd0abac3229","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
