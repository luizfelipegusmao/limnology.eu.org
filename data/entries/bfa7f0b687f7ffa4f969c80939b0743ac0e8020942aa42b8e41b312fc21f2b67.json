For the six detected PFAS in the pilot feed water, the long-chain PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS], and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid [PFHxS]) were well removed with only PFOA, which is a perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCA) eventually breaking through as the media became exhausted. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), a short-chain perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA), was also well removed, whereas short-chain PFCAs (perfluoropentanoic acid [PFPeA] and perfluorobutanoic acid [PFBA]) were not removed (i.e., immediate breakthrough). Overall, IX and AA demonstrated superior removal of PFSAs compared to PFCAs (i.e., later breakthrough of PFSAs translating to longer media life). Media life varied, ranging from 6 to 15 months before adsorbents reached a significant PFOA breakthrough. The performance of the two adsorbents piloted at shorter EBCT reasonably predicted the longer (representative) pilot EBCT results (within ±20–30%) for the same adsorbents following data scaling. This suggests that pilot-scale testing may be conducted at a faster pace and therefore more economically.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nLong-chain PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS) were well removed by five ion exchange and one alternative adsorbent tested herein.\nOne short-chain PFAS (PFBS) was well removed with no removal of two other short-chain PFAS (PFBA and PFPeA).\nPerformance of the two adsorbents piloted at shorter EBCT reasonably predicted the longer (representative) pilot EBCT results for the same adsorbents following data scaling.\n</p>","author":"Manmeet W.
