University students frequently struggle with anxiety, which is frequently made worse by social expectations, academic demands, and the adjustment to living on one's own. This article review aims to give collective ideas from relevant research articles to solidify such solutions in eradicating anxiety among students at the tertiary level. Eliminating anxiety in higher education necessitates a multifaceted strategy that includes identifying the problem, offering extensive support networks, encouraging a balanced lifestyle, fostering inclusivity, reducing financial stress, fostering a sense of community, fostering open communication, routinely evaluating tactics, and working with outside organizations. By implementing these measures, universities and colleges may foster a more positive, healthy environment where students can succeed academically and personally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20fc6aac8a1138f9ddcbd845a5832cc05d966e419b1ceac921d7154be0268163","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
