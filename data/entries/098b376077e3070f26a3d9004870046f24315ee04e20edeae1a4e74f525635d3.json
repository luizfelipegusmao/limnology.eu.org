{"title":"Research on the Spatial-temporal Evolution of the Coupling and Coordination of Ecology and Economy in Ordos From the Perspective of Sustainable Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0435/v1","date":1717721088000,"content":"Sustainable development advocates for an environmentally friendly and resource-saving approach, fostering a new quality of productivity that is green and sustainable, and achieving a sustainable development where the economy and the environment are in harmony. The paper is based on clarifying the effects of coordinated development between the economy and the environment, and by establishing an indicator system, applying a remote sensing ecological index, entropy weight method, gray relational degree model, and a coupling coordination model, the relationship of coordinated development of Ordos in 2016-2022 is analyzed from a spatial-temporal perspective. The results are as follows: ① The years of coordinated development between the ecological environment and the economy are in the majority, while the uncoordinated years are fewer.  ② The level of coordinated development between the ecological environment and the economy in the various regions of Ordos has been increasing year by year, but it still remains at the barely coordinated and primary coordinated levels. ③ The types of coordinated development between the ecological environment and the economy in Ordos exhibit significant spatial differentiation in terms of spatial distribution and clustering.Therefore, it is necessary to formulate coordinated development policies and measures according to the constraining factors of different regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"098b376077e3070f26a3d9004870046f24315ee04e20edeae1a4e74f525635d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
