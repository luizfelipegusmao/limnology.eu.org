The lower frequencies have greater penetration and transfer more power. Unfortunately, not only diseased tissue is treated but healthy tissue suffers collateral damage. Below ∼1 MH no tissue damage occurs. A HIFU problem currently is the treatments cannot be monitored resulting in under or over treatment causing damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eae3ba58ccdbb2088a43c06bc9782ff892f4406c98992a989455b2acd33718f2","category":"Environment"}
