{"title":"Development of Analog Rice Made from Cassava and Banana with The Addition of Katuk Leaf (Sauropus androgynous L. Merr.) and Soy Lecithin for Lactating Women","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0660/v1","date":1712658784000,"content":"The development of analog rice, apart from being an effort to diversify food, also has the potential to be develop as functional food in fulfilling the nutrients needed by a community. Katuk leaf is known for its ability to accelerate breast milk production for lactating women which is inseparable from sterol as bioactive content. This study aimed to determine the best formulation of analog rice made from cassava flour, banana flour, Katuk leaf powder and soy lecithin that was sensory acceptable, in a shape resembling rice, and able to fulfill the nutritional needs of lactating women. Analog rice was produced using extruder machine before the physical and sensory properties analyses were carried out, followed by the chemical properties analysis. Formulation C (80% cassava flour, 20% banana flour, 3% Katuk leaf powder and 0.5% soy lecithin) was obtained as the best or most preferred formulation based on sensory analysis which the grain shaped oval round resembling original rice and had green-brownish color, fluffy texture, distinct aroma and taste derived from the raw material used. Therefore, this research is expected to support the development of analog rice for providing the main staple food for fulfilling the lactating womenâ€™s nutrition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58371a403eb1b69814cc0dd7433cd3edb72a79f2a9ae2482e241136aabcc8f2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
