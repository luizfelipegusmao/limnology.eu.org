Maintaining bone density is crucial for reducing the risk of fractures and improving overall mobility and quality of life in later years. Understanding the potential benefits of habitual egg consumption on bone mass density among older people is essential, given that the natural decline in bone mass density occurs with age. This area of research has not garnered sufficient attention basically because of the mixed reactions and conflicting reports about the safety of egg consumption especially among the older adults. This scoping review aims to systematically examine the existing literature to map the evidence regarding the association between habitual egg consumption and bone mass density in older adults’ individuals. The scoping review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. Five electronic databases were searched for published pieces of literature. While high egg intake has been linked to increased mortality and dyslipidemia, eggs contain compounds like Ovo transferrin and carotenoids that may benefit bone health. As aging increases vulnerability to bone fragility and fractures, it’s crucial to provide comprehensive dietary recommendations. The complex relationship between egg consumption, cholesterol, and health highlights the need for nuanced assessment. Overall, eggs present a potentially valuable dietary component for promoting bone health in aging populations. Limited research on the link between egg consumption and bone mass density in older adults highlights the need for further investigation. Concerns about cholesterol have overshadowed potential benefits. Given aging populations and bone health challenges, exploring eggs’ role in preventing falls and fractures is essential for a proactive approach to older adults’ well-being.","author":"Mobolaji T.
