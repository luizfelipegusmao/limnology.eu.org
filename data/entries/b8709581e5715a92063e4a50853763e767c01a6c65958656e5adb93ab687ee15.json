{"title":"Deposition Kinetics of Human Serum Albumin Functionalized Spheroidal Particles at Abiotic Surfaces: Mimicking Bacteria Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0525/v1","date":1720169133000,"content":"Human serum albumin (HSA) corona formation at polymer microparticles of a spheroidal shape was studied using dynamic light scattering and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Physicochemical characteristics of the albumin comprising, the zeta potential and the isoelectric point were determined as a function of pH for various ionic strengths. Analogous characteristics of the polymer particles were carried out. The adsorption of albumin on the particles was monitored by electrophoretic mobility measurements (LDV). The stability of the HSA functionalized particle suspensions under various pHs and their electrokinetic properties were determined. The deposition kinetics of the particles on mica, silica and gold sensors were determined in situ by optical microscopy, AFM and by the quartz microbalance (QCM) under diffusion and flow conditions. The obtained results were interpreted in terms of the coarse-grained random sequential adsorption model that allowed to estimate the range of applicability of QCM for determining deposition kinetics of virus and bacteria at abiotic surfaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8709581e5715a92063e4a50853763e767c01a6c65958656e5adb93ab687ee15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
