One of the most prospective hypothesis on the ALS pathogenesis suggests that excessive inflammation and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulation play a crucial role in the development of ALS in patients and SOD1 G93A mice. Hence, we may speculate that RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end-products and its proinflammatory ligands such as: HMGB1, S100B and CML contribute to ALS pathogenesis. The aim of our studies was to decipher the role of RAGE as well as provide insight into RAGE signaling pathways during the progression of ALS in SOD1 G93A and RAGE-deficient SOD1 G93A mice. In our study, we observed alternations in molecular pattern of proinflammatory RAGE ligands during progression of disease in RAGE KO SOD1 G93A mice compared to SOD1 G93A mice. Moreover, we observed that the amount of beta actin (ACTB) as well as Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was elevated in SOD1 G93A mice when compared to mice with deletion of RAGE. These data contributes to our understanding of implications of RAGE and its ligands in pathogenesis of ALS and highlight potential targeted therapeutic interventions at the early stage of this devastating disease. Moreover, inhibition of the molecular cross-talk between RAGE and its proinflammatory ligands may abolish neuroinflammation, gliosis and motor neuron damage in SOD1 G93A mice. Hence, we hypothesize that attenuated interaction of RAGE with its proinflammatory ligands may improve well-being and health status during ALS in SOD1 G93A mice. Therefore, we emphasize that the inhibition of RAGE signaling pathway may be a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.","author":"Natalia Nowicka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"63548ae6021bd5a7f20fae65079e1cf2601b8876510207674d4b2d62dbe7cc4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
