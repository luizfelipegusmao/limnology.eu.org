{"title":"The effects of environmental factors on the synthesis of water‐soluble Monascus red pigments via submerged fermentation: a review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13517?af=R","date":1713416352000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Monascus</i> pigments (MPs) have been used as natural food pigments for many years. There is a high demand for <i>Monascus</i> red pigments (MRPs) to enhance color and for antibacterial and cancer prevention therapies in food and medicine. Most MRPs are not water soluble, and the yield of water-soluble MRPs is naturally low. On the other hand, water-soluble MRP is more cost effective for application in industrial mass production. Therefore, it is important to improve the yield of water-soluble MRPs. Environmental factors have a significant influence on the synthesis of water-soluble MRPs, which is crucial for the development of industrial production of water-soluble MRPs. This review introduces the biosynthetic pathways of water-soluble MRPs and summarizes the effects of environmental factors on the yield of water-soluble MRPs. Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a precursor for MPs synthesis. Carbon and nitrogen sources and the carbon/nitrogen ratio can impact MP production by regulating the metabolic pathway of acetyl-CoA. Optimization of fermentation conditions to change the morphology of <i>Monascus</i> can stimulate the synthesis of MPs. The appropriate choice of nitrogen sources and pH values can promote the synthesis of MRPs from MPs. Additives such as metal ions and non-ionic surfactants can affect the fluidity of <i>Monascus</i> cell membrane and promote the transformation of MRPs into water-soluble MRPs. This review will lay the foundation for the industrial production of water-soluble MRPs. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ping Li, \nYin Zhou, \nYingying Wu, \nXiao Jiang, \nXuan Wang, \nXinyun Shi, \nWeiping Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6fa8ace1f262848af0974991602775f63698b9effd06382e6eafe0850ce89407","category":"Environment"}
