However, the evolution of vaccine resistance, exemplified by vaccine resistance in SARS-CoV-2, remains a concern. Here, we model complex vaccination strategies against a pathogen with multiple epitopesâ€”molecules targeted by the vaccine. We found that a vaccine targeting one epitope was ineffective in preventing vaccine escape. Vaccine resistance in highly infectious pathogens was prevented by the full-epitope vaccine, that is, one targeting all available epitopes, but only when the rate of pathogen evolution was low. Strikingly, a bet-hedging strategy of random administration of vaccines targeting different epitopes was the most effective in preventing vaccine resistance in pathogens with the low rate of infection and high rate of evolution. Thus, complex vaccination strategies, when biologically feasible, may be preferable to the currently used single-vaccine approaches for long-term control of disease outbreaks, especially when applied to livestock with near 100% vaccination rates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"830a304a83ac24f547667c50a98763c4804e64a601a45e630bb0f14e3e2140fb","category":"Environment"}
