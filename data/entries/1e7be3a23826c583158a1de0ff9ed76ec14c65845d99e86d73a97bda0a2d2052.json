The 6th-generation iPad mini sports a complete redesign with a bigger display, Touch ID on the power button, USB C instead of Lightning, and an upgraded front camera. This represented the first major change to the design since the iPad mini was first introduced back in 2012. The mini celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2022 without an update, but a new iPad mini 7th generation is rumored to be in the works and could be here before the end of October 2023. Here’s what we know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 release date: When will the new iPad mini arrive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been nearly two years since the 6th generation iPad mini launched, and, based on the dates when other iPad mini models have launched, a fall update for the iPad mini would make sense. However, since the “Scary Fast” event came and went without a mention of a new iPad mini, it seems likely that it will launch in the spring. Apple typically uses the fall to update the mini but it’s not unprecedented to announce a new model in the spring:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668142/ipad-mini-6-2021-review.html\">iPad mini 6th generation</a>: September 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667891/ipad-mini-2019-review.html\">iPad mini 5th generation</a>: March 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667283/ipad-mini-3-review.html\">iPad mini 4th generation</a>: September 2015</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 3: October 2014</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 2: October 2013</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini: October 2012</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in December 2022, respected Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1443654/ipad-mini-7-release-folding-screen-processor.html\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the new iPad mini won’t arrive until late 2023 or early 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>(3/3)<br />Additionally, Apple is currently working on a new version of the iPad mini equipped with a new processor as the main selling point, and the mass shipment is expected to start by the end of 2023 or in 1H24.</p>— éƒ­æ˜ŽéŒ¤ (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1607714641987407872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">December 27, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also rumors that Apple is working on a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a>, possibly including a 14-inch version, for 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 price: How much will the new iPad mini cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of the redesigned iPad mini 6th generation saw a $100 increase in price over the previous model to $499. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That price increased even further outside the U.S. including in the U.K. where the price increased another £90. However, with Apple reducing prices for the iPhone 15 around the world following 2021/2022 price hikes outside the U.S. it may be the case that prices drop in some markets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how the prices of the 6th and 5th generations compared:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad mini 6th generation: $499/£479 (Now £569 in the U.K) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 5th generation: $399/£379</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the iPad mini 7 will be similar to the iPad mini 6 we think it’s likely that the price will stay the same for the 7th generation although we hope to see more favorable pricing around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 specs: What features will the iPad mini have?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll have noticed from Kuo’s tweet above that there is an expectation the new iPad mini will feature a more impressive processor than it does currently. We are also hoping for some small internal improvements. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Improved processor </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini 6 offers the A15 Bionic chip as found in the iPhone 13, mini, Pro and Max, however, this chip is down-clocked compared to the one inside the iPhone 13 series. Here’s how that chip compares to the rest of the range and what is expected for the next generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPad Pro</strong>: M2. <em>Next generation is expected to get an M3 chip.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad Air</strong> (5th gen): M1. <em>Next generation is expected to get an M2 chip.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini</strong> (6th gen): A15 chip, as found in iPhone 13 series. <em>Next generation is expected to get A16, as found in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad</strong> (10th gen): A14 chip, as found in iPhone 12 series. <em>Next generation is expected to get A16, as found in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad</strong> (9th gen): A13, as found in iPhone 11 series.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo reported in December that the iPad mini’s “main selling point” would be the new processor. He didn’t specify which processor at the time, but it is now expected to be the A16 chip found in the iPhone 14 Pro and Max and the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be looking at the iPad Air and wondering if the iPad mini might get an M1 chip like that found in the iPad Air. Perhaps it’s something Apple might consider down the line, but the rumors around the launch of the iPad Air indicated that Apple’s reason for using the M1 was actually the reduced of availability of the A16 at the time, as per this tweet from Mark Gurman. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Could also be another explanation for why the iPad Air got the M1 (supply). <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/lrvuVR0QkW&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/lrvuVR0QkW</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1503060913527558144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">March 13, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Increased storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the current iPad mini 6th generation, the base model starts off with a rather paltry 64GB of storage. For a device like an iPad, where you can store movies, TV shows, books, comics, magazines, games, and a wide range of apps, that amount can often become a problem, especially if you want to take your iPad away on holiday or use it for your commute without needing to manage the storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Apple has something of a history of giving base models low storage capacities, we think it would be a wise move to upgrade the entry-level iPad mini 7th generation to at least 128GB. File sizes are growing all the time, due to higher-quality cameras and software, so doubling the existing 64GB would be a very consumer-friendly solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along these lines, there’s also the possibility that the upper limit of the storage could be increased. At the time of writing, the most storage available on the iPad mini 6th generation is 256GB. Moving up to 512GB would be the logical step, especially if the baseline storage moves to 128GB.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 design: Will the iPad mini have a new look?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been surprisingly quiet on the rumor front, which probably means the iPad mini 7 design will be largely the same as the 6th-gen model. Here’s what we’ve managed to uncover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unlikely that the design will change, but the new iPad mini is expected to include a new display controller designed to mitigate a problem described as a “jelly scrolling issue” that reportedly makes content look laggy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been reports for a while that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2102929/ipad-air-mini-pro-oled-display-rumors.html\">move the display technology to OLED</a> but this looks like it won’t happen until later on. Apple is apparently talking to LG, Samsung, and other companies regarding active matrix OLEDs (AMOLEDs). But, according to market research company Omdia: “Apple is continuously discussing the possibility of widely adopting OLED technology for the iPad mini and iPad Air lineup as the next phase of its strategy from 2026 onward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Screen size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini screen was 7.9-inches up until the current iPad mini 6th generation launched in 2021. The iPad mini 6th generation screen is 8.3-inch thanks to the removal of the Home button, and this isn’t expected to change for the 7th generation iPad mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Folding display</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been rumored to be working on an iPad with a folding display, but it’s unlikely to come to this model. In December 2022, Ming-Chi Kuo said that reports of a folding iPad mini in development were wrong “because a foldable iPad will have a markedly higher price than an iPad mini, so such a replacement is not reasonable.” (See tweet above).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ProMotion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen isn’t expected to change from the current 8.3-inch, but there may be new screen technology. A post on a South Korean forum in November 2021 indicated Apple had ordered 8.3-inch displays from Samsung that support <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678043/next-ipad-mini-will-get-120hz-screen.html\">120Hz maximum refresh rates</a>. If true, the post on Clien (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www-clien-net.translate.goog/service/board/park/16657430?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">translated here</a>) could mean the next mini offers the ProMotion ultra-smooth scrolling feature currently seen on the iPad Pro, iPhone 13 Pro models, and 14- &amp; 16-inch MacBook Pro. This would address the minor issue of “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677851/apple-ipad-minis-jelly-scroll-is-normal.html\">jelly scrolling</a>” that some users have complained about with the current iPad mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I would be surprised since it is currently an a-Si LCD which isn't compatible with ProMotion. Only their Pro models support ProMotion as they use an Oxide LCD.</p>— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1541613225631895552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">June 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s not looking that this particular rumor is accurate. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Analyst Ross Young</a>, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, doesn’t believe that Apple will be giving the iPad mini a ProMotion display yet. He indicates that doing so would require significant hardware changes. This would require a “whole new level of engineering,” according to Young. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We remain skeptical of a ProMotion upgrade as it’s one of the main differentiators between the standard and Pro devices Apple sells.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors</h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/reviews/3809323/apple_ipad_mini_2021_review_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad mini front and back\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iPad mini will likely keep the same design for several generations.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most obvious changes to the iPad mini 6th generation was the new palette of colors that Apple made available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can currently select between space gray, pink, purple, and starlight, there are several interesting hues available on the iPad Air when it received its new look in fall 2021, including silver, rose gold, green, and sky blue. It would therefore seem reasonable to assume that some of these make it to the mini. Plus now that the iPad 10th generation brought a bold selection of colors, the iPad mini may get a completely new palette. However, the iPhone 15 introduced an extremely light palette of colors so it’s unclear which direction Apple will go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll update this article as more details become available, but until then, be sure to read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670670/which-ipad-best.html\">iPad buying guide</a> to see which models we’d recommend if you want to buy one of Apple’s tablets today.
