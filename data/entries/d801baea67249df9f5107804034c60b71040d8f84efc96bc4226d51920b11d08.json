{"title":"Design of an Active Axis Wind Turbine (AAWT) That Can Balance Centrifugal and Aerodynamic Forces to Reduce Support Infrastructure While Maintaining a Stable Flight Path","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0906/v1","date":1728646670000,"content":"This research introduces a novel approach to improving wind energy's LCOE (Levelised Cost of Energy). Specifically, this research aims to reduce the LCOE from wind turbines by investigating a novel Active Axis Wind Turbine (AAWT) design. The turbine is neither a horizontal nor vertical axis wind turbine but has an axis of operation that can actively change during operation. The design features a rotor with a single blade capable of dynamic pitch and tilt control during a single rotor rotation. This study examines the potential to balance the centrifugal and aerodynamic lift forces acting on the rotor blade assembly, significantly reducing blade, tower, foundation and infrastructure costs in larger-scale devices and decreasing the LCOE for wind. The design of a laboratory prototype rotor assembly is optimised by varying the masses and lengths in a lumped mass model to achieve equilibrium between centrifugal and lift forces acting on the turbine's rotor assembly. The method involves an investigation of the variation of blade pitch angle to provide a balance between centrifugal and aerodynamic forces, thereby facilitating the cost advantages and opening the opportunity to improve the turbine efficiency across a range of operation conditions. The implication of this study extends to different applications of wind turbines, both onshore and offshore, introducing insight into innovation for sustainable energy and cost-effective solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d801baea67249df9f5107804034c60b71040d8f84efc96bc4226d51920b11d08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
