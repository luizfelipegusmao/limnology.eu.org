{"title":"Effect of Material and Structure of UHMWPE Body Armor on Ballistic Limit Velocity: Numerical Simulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2212/v1","date":1724988200000,"content":"The material properties and structural characteristics of ballistic composites are crucial to their ballistic performance. Investigation for the influence of the material and structural parameters of UHMWPE body armor on anti-fragmentation penetration performance has been made by numerical simulation in this paper, with a numerical modeling simulating the penetration of a 1.1 g FSP into the target plate of UHMWPE body armor, by which the simulation results demonstrate that the failure process of the body armor target plate primarily involves shear damage, interlayer delamination, and tensile damage. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effects of elastic modulus, tensile strength, shear strength, number of layers, and interlayer strength on the ballistic limit velocity of UHMWPE body armor. The findings reveal that the ballistic limit velocity is most sensitive to changes in shear strength, with variation rates ranging from -18.02% to 10.81%, showing an approximate positive correlation, while the elastic modulus has the smallest impact on ballistic limit velocity, with variation rates ranging from -1.8% to 3.6%. Additionally, appropriate interlayer strength can improve the ballistic limit velocity of the body armor to a certain extent. This study provides theoretical methods and recommendations for optimizing anti-penetration performance of UHMWPE body armor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65d002b1a61c400d2092188b3f5e80ac5243081bd026dc2bfb3a383eca6250d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
