{"title":"Cervical Lymphadenopathy: Could it be prostate cancer?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1653/v1","date":1716796897000,"content":"One of the most prevalent malignancies in males is prostate cancer, which most often metastasizes to the liver, thorax, bone, and local lymph nodes. The current case describes development of cervical lymphadenopathy; which remains a rather rare initial presentation, seen in &lt;0.1% of the patients diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma. The current report describes a 55-year-old man with complaints of lower back pain and swelling on the left side of his neck for the previous two months. Physical examination revealed several swollen cervical lymph nodes that measured 2 cm, were nontender, firm, and adhered to the skin above. A poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was found during cytological examination of the lymph nodes in the left lower cervical region. Findings from the ensuing Computed Tomography scan pointed to the possibility of spread prostatic cancer. PSA values were determined to be 364.762 ng/ml after additional analysis. The patient was then planned for hormone ablation therapy as per Institute protocol, in view of metastatic prostate cancer. The current report highlights the importance of timely detection of malignancies, particularly those such as Prostate cancer, that are slow growing and have well-established screening tools (such as PSA assays). Involvement of the cervical lymph nodes in prostate cancer, particularly for older individuals, is nearly always linked to extensive metastatic disease. As a result, it is a poor prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients, whose survival rates are markedly lower. Although hormone therapy has advanced significantly as the cornerstone of care for metastatic prostate cancer, the prognosis for these cases is still quite poor, especially when there has been distant lymph node metastases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffa4b55725f1c06219bfe2bf55be91884cd0e6907a30c2f471ed9e3c67a6c785","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
