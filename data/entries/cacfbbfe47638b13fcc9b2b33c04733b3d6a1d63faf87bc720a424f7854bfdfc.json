{"title":"Review on the Increasing Role for PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy in Prostate Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0035/v1","date":1717392746000,"content":"Abstract: Background: In 2021, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), TheraP and VISION, demonstrated that 177Lu-PSMA-617 as monotherapy was more effective for enhancing the decline of PSA than the comparator third-line treatments. Methods: Our review summarizes new RCTs that add to the use of radioligand therapy (RLT) for patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Results: Five past and present RCTs include 1139 patients. A RCT, ENZA-p, studied first-line treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC). A combination of enzalutamide (ENZA) and 177Lu-PSMA-617 gave longer progression-free survival than ENZA as monotherapy. Other RCTs of patients with mCRPC, including the PSMAfore, and SPLASH trials, showed 177Lu-PSMA-617 as second-line treatment gave better progression-free survival than androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (combined p value 6 x 10-8). Conclusion: Patients with PCa may gain if they are given PSMA-RLT early in the treatment of PCa and as part of combination therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cacfbbfe47638b13fcc9b2b33c04733b3d6a1d63faf87bc720a424f7854bfdfc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
