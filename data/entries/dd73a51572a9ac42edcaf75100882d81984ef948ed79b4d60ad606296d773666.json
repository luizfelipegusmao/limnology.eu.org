Nevertheless, no optimal and concrete disinfection protocol has been proposed to inactivate the viruses as quickly as possible. In this study, we experimentally evaluated various ventilation and disinfection protocols based on the combination of negative-pressure ventilation, ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, and Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) spray against three active virus species in a 3.5 cubic meters isolation unit. This small-size unit has gained attention during the pandemic due to the high demand for compact mobile laboratory systems capable of rapid disease diagnosis. In accordance with the WHO laboratory biosafety guidance, which states that all enclosed units where diagnostic work is conducted must ensure proper ventilation and disinfection activities, we aim to propose virus removal protocols for units compact enough to be installed within a van or deployed outdoor. The results confirmed the superiority (in terms of virus removal rate and time required) of the virus removal methods in the order of UV light, ventilation, and HOCl spray. Ultimately, we propose two optimal protocols: (i) UV light alone for three minutes, and (ii) UV light with ventilation for three minutes, followed by one-minute ventilation only. The time span of three minutes in the latter protocol is based on the clinical practice such that the medical staffs have a sufficient time to process the samples taken in transition to next patient to care.","author":"Jooyeon Park","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dd73a51572a9ac42edcaf75100882d81984ef948ed79b4d60ad606296d773666","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
