This information can be used in a classifier to make an instantaneous assessment of the type of material present, enabling a shot-by-shot prediction of the material type and distance to the target.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e21d8326b38e71a64adc8f881e63c7bbc920066889c7e11e4fa8127856d9b3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
