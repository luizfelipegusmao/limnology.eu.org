{"title":"Integrated Assessment of the Quality of Functioning of Local Electric Energy Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1600/v1","date":1729523998000,"content":"The article discusses the formation of local electric energy systems (LEES) based on renewable energy sources (RSE) as balancing groups in the electric power system (EPS). These systems can function autonomously, providing electricity even in extreme conditions. LEES incorporate small hydroelectric, photovoltaic, and wind power plants, whose output is unstable due to varying natural conditions. To address this, energy storage systems are included to ensure stability and balance. LEES may vary significantly in terms of reliability, power losses, and quality, making it essential to choose the optimal configuration. Optimizing power supply by focusing on individual indicators is discouraged, as it may negatively affect others. To evaluate LEES performance, an integral indicator has been developed, combining the theory of Markov processes and similarity. This indicator compares actual performance with an \"ideal\" standard, simplifying the assessment of complex systems. It allows comparison of different transmission and distribution options without needing to evaluate all technical and economic details. The proposed integral indicator effectively reflects real operating conditions and assesses the efficiency, quality, and optimality of power supply, while remaining adaptable to partial indicators.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"188dac6d630889d71d8c92508b68840e2c0ee529964c9c91e7548738b43fa9ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
