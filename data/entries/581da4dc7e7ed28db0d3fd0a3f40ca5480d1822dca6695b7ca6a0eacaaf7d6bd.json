{"title":"Nuʻupia Ponds&#039; Water Circulation Characteristics: Exploring Water Exchange and Residence Time for Marine Ecosystem Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0989/v1","date":1718346571000,"content":"Nuʻupia Ponds, a traditional Hawaiian fishpond system, are located at Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) and part of the Nuʻupia Ponds Wildlife Management Area, a wetland refuge for native, endangered, and protected birds and Hawaiian green sea turtles, as well as many native fish species. Currently, there is uncertainty regarding the ecological status and condition of the fishponds following prior modification of wetland habitats in and around the ponds. This study examines circulation dynamics and characterizes water exchange, pond volume, and residence time across the full tidal spectrum at Nuʻupia fishponds. Our results indicate a general west to east gradient in current flow; with higher flushing rates and lower residence times of fishponds in the western ponds of the Nu’upia system compared to the eastern ponds. We further found low flushing rates at several sites causing limited water exchange with Kāne’ohe Bay, as well as within Nu’upia Pond system. Sufficient water circulation plays a fundamental role in maintaining a healthy balance of fishpond flora and fauna and preserve ecosystem health. The results from this study provide a baseline of current physical water circulation dynamics and implications for ecosystem health, as well as inform science-based conservation and management strategies moving forward.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"581da4dc7e7ed28db0d3fd0a3f40ca5480d1822dca6695b7ca6a0eacaaf7d6bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
