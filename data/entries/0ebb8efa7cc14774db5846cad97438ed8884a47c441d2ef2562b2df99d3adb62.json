{"title":"Understanding Formation of Irradiation-Induced Defects through 4D-STEM, Electron Tomography, and WBDF-STEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.122/7719494?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>A major challenge in advancing nuclear materials for next-generation fission and proposed fusion reactors is to comprehensively understand the formation of irradiation-induced defects [<a href=\"#ozae044.122-B1\">1</a>]. It is essential to correlate the evolution of irradiation-induced defects and the degradation of mechanical properties, as they collectively dictate the material's lifespan and ensure nuclear safety [<a href=\"#ozae044.122-B2\">2</a>]. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) based techniques have emerged as indispensable tools for irradiation-induced defect characterization [<a href=\"#ozae044.122-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.122-B4\">4</a>], offering high spatial resolution imaging and chemical analysis, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). These techniques have been effectively used to obtain an atomic-scale view of the defect structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.122-B5\">5</a>]. Recent advances in electron microscopy, particularly in 4D-STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.122-B6\">6</a>], offer detailed insight into microstructural evolution by capturing full 2D diffraction patterns at every pixel position. Using high-speed direct electron detectors, this technology generates a four-dimensional dataset, overcoming the limitations of traditional STEM imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0ebb8efa7cc14774db5846cad97438ed8884a47c441d2ef2562b2df99d3adb62","category":"Environment"}
