{"title":"Immune response in diseased and healthy common carp exposed to carp edema virus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14012?af=R","date":1728927761000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The common carp is one of the most economically valuable freshwater fish worldwide and its aquaculture can be severely affected by the koi sleepy disease (KSD)/carp edema virus disease (CEVD). This study explores a natural outbreak of CEVD in a pond containing both clinically healthy and diseased fish of various origins exposed to the virus. We investigated mRNA expression of genes associated with known antiviral immune mechanisms, such as type I interferon signalling and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and performed a comprehensive protein expression analysis to highlight differences between the two groups in various organs. Significant differences in expression profiles of common carp with and without clinical signs were found to be strongly dependent on the organ from which the sample originated. Components of the complement cascade, including various C3 proteins, exhibited upregulation only in less affected organs, specifically the head kidney and spleen. Other complement proteins such as B/C2 and C9 showed upregulation in the kidney, spleen, and gills but not in the skin. Conversely, lysozymes C and G, were observed to be upregulated in the most affected organs of the skin and gills. This study submits the first description of the immune system related proteome using a mass spectrometry on the samples isolated from fish infected with CEV. It also offers a unique comparison of immune reaction of CEV infected and healthy fish under an infectious pressure.</p>","author":"Radek Machat, \nLubomir Pojezdal, \nJan Gebauer, \nRadek Tesarik, \nJitka Motlova, \nMiroslava Palikova, \nMartin Faldyna","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"7e2ab44953045d2af2f878152966dd7d46a8ab2b419dfb8bc315ded1cd894ee8","category":"Environment"}
