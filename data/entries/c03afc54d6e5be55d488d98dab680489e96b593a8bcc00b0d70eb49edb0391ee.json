The present study simulated two distinct temperatures cold chain distribution processes. Quality indicators and high-throughput sequencing were employed to investigate the effects of temperature fluctuations on the quality and microbial diversity of beef meatballs during cold chain distribution.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Quality indicators revealed that temperature fluctuations during simulated cold chain distribution significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) exacerbated the quality deterioration of beef meatballs. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that temperature fluctuations affected the diversity and structure of microbial community. Lower microbial species abundance and higher microbial species diversity were observed in the temperature fluctuations group. <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> were identified as the dominant phylum and genus in beef meatballs, respectively, exhibiting faster growth rates and greater relative abundance under temperature fluctuations.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrates that temperature fluctuations during simulated cold chain distribution can worsen spoilage and shorten the shelf life of beef meatballs. It also offers certain insights into the spoilage mechanism and preservation of meat products during cold chain distribution. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jingjing Yuan, \nZhaoming Wang, \nHuale Li, \nBaocai Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c03afc54d6e5be55d488d98dab680489e96b593a8bcc00b0d70eb49edb0391ee","category":"Environment"}
