{"title":"Evaluation of dietary methionine sources on growth performance and antioxidant potential of gilthead seabream juveniles reared at high water temperature","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13042?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Methionine (Met) is one of the most limiting essential amino acids in aquafeeds, and different commercial feed-grade Met sources are available for diet supplementation, namely L-Met, DL-Met, and hydroxy-Met (OH-Met). In this work, we compared the bioefficacy of OH-Met and DL-Met as diet supplements for gilthead seabream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles reared at normal (22°C) and high (29°C) water temperatures. Two isoproteic (50%) and isolipidic (20%) practical diets (24% fish meal; 6% fish oil) were formulated to contain 1% Met and were supplemented with 0.2% DL-Met (diet DL-Met) or OH-Met (diet OH-Met). The diets were fed to triplicate groups of fish with an initial body weight of 13 g for 78 days. Growth performance and N retention (%) were higher at 29°C. However, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, and hepatic and visceral indexes were higher at 22°C. Hepatic oxidative stress indicators were not affected by dietary Met source. In the muscle, however, oxidative stress index and lipid peroxidation were lower in fish fed the OH-Met diets. Overall, DL-Met and OH-Met proved to be similarly effective as dietary methionine sources for gilthead seabream, while OH-Met seemed to be more effective in reducing oxidative stress in fish reared at high temperatures.</p>","author":"Lúcia Vieira, \nRui Magalhães, \nNicole Martins, \nFilipa Fontinha, \nCarolina Castro, \nHelena Peres, \nYves Mercier, \nTahir Mahmood, \nWaldo G.
