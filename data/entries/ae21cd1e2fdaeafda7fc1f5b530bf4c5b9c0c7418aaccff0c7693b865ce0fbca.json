{"title":"Brazilian Gold Miners Working Irregularly in French Guiana: Health Status and Risk Determinants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2245/v1","date":1722244346000,"content":"Brazilian garimpeiros are a highly hard-to-reach and mobile population, with little access to basic hygiene and health services, and have been crossing the border to work irregularly in gold mines in French Guiana since the 90s. This study aimed to characterize this population and identify their main health problems. A cross-sectional study was carried out in the municipality of Oiapoque-AP, with two surveys: before (2018) and after (2019) the implementation of Malakit. Individuals were recruited from resting places and submitted to a questionnaire with demographic variables, history and knowledge of malaria, and health issues in the mines. Simultaneously, a clinical evaluation was performed. The garimpeiros were mainly men from Maranhão, Pará, and Amapá, with a low educational level and worked on average for 10 years in the mining sites. The study population mentioned numerous health problems: malaria, followed by leishmaniasis, flu, body aches, headaches, and digestive problems. Other diseases mentioned were skin diseases, bat bites, hepatitis, and HIV infection. This vulnerable population is constantly subjected to heavy routines and exposed to different diseases and infections that can spread across borders. Knowledge of this is essential for developing public health policies that can be integrated into specific epidemiological situations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae21cd1e2fdaeafda7fc1f5b530bf4c5b9c0c7418aaccff0c7693b865ce0fbca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
