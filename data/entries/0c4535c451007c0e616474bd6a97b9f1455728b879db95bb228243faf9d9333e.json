{"title":"Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Cat Paradox Is an Illusion: Completion of the Quantum Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1576/v2","date":1719815441000,"content":"At the beginning of our observations, humanity believed that the Earth was the center of the uni-verse and that the sun was spinning around the Earth. Claude Ptolémée (100-168) made a mistake by modelling the movements in the geocentric referential, the model of the sun and planet move-ments was an illusion and all Humanity was wrong. Nicolas Copernic (1473-1543) showed the illusion and simplified the system by moving from the geocentric referential to the heliocentric referential.  In the present paper, I would like to discuss about the possibility of making mistakes with quantum theory. I postulate that we are living in a virtual classical world that we consider as real. In my interpretation, the decoherence problem and wave function collapse do not exist at all, because we are the illusion, we are living in illusion, in a mirage. It is impossible to observe the quantum world as it is, in our virtual classical referential, and we see the quantum world with a false vison of quantum reality because we are not yet in the universal real quantum referential whose I postulate the existence. As we are illusions when seen from this universal quantum ref-erential, Schrödinger’s cat paradox is an illusion as life and death are illusions. We must be very humble with quantum theory and we should not put ourselves in the center of the quantum world again particularly with our lives and deaths. I also develop a cosmological model based on bipolarity and schizophrenia which explains well the recent observations of the James Webb’s spatial tele-scope. We will be collectively able to reach the universal quantum referential by changing our vision of life and quantum world. I also explain how to go out of human suffering. This will be our Big Bang.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c4535c451007c0e616474bd6a97b9f1455728b879db95bb228243faf9d9333e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
