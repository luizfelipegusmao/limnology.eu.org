{"title":"Query Based Construction of Chronic Disease Datasets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1261/v1","date":1729071624000,"content":"The RECONNECT project addresses the fragmentation of Ireland's public healthcare systems, aiming to enhance service planning and delivery for chronic disease management. By integrating complex systems within the Health Service Executive (HSE), it prioritizes data privacy while supporting future digital resource integration. The methodology encompasses structural integration through a Federated Database design to maintain system autonomy and privacy, semantic integration using a Record Linkage module to facilitate integration without individual identifiers, and the adoption of the HL7-FHIR framework for high interoperability with the national electronic health record (EHR) and the Integrated Information Service (IIS). This innovative approach features a unique architecture for loosely coupled systems and a robust privacy layer. A demonstration system has been implemented to utilize synthetic data from the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE), Chronic Disease Management (CDM), Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) and Retina Screen systems for healthcare queries. Overall, RECONNECT aims to provide timely and effective care, enhance clinical decision-making, and empower policymakers with comprehensive population health insights.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6897cbace11f0387ad6a0f08802508c914233f9f290dd23ae93118dc2d42bd9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
