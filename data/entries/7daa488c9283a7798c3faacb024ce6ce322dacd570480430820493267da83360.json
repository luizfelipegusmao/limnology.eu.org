{"title":"Amelioration of Photoreceptor Degeneration by Intravitreal Transplantation of Retinal Progenitor Cells in Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0215/v1","date":1717506798000,"content":"Photoreceptor degeneration is a major cause of untreatable blindness worldwide and has recently been targeted by emerging technologies, including cell- and gene-based therapies. Cell types of neural lineage have shown promise for replacing either photoreceptors or retinal pigment epithelial cells following delivery to the subretinal space, while cells of bone marrow lineage have been tested for retinal trophic effects following delivery to the vitreous cavity. Here we explore an alternate approach in which cells from the immature neural retinal are delivered to the vitreous cavity with the goal of providing trophic support for degenerating photoreceptors. Rat and human retinal progenitor cells were transplanted to the vitreous of rats with a well-studied photoreceptor dystrophy, resulting in substantial anatomical preservation and functional rescue of vision. This work provides scientific proof-of-principle for a novel therapeutic approach to photoreceptor degeneration that is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7daa488c9283a7798c3faacb024ce6ce322dacd570480430820493267da83360","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
