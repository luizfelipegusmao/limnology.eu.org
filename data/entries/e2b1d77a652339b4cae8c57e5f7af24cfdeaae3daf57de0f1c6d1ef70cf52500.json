{"title":"Analyses and Comparison of PO Based Fuzzy Logic Controlled Mppt and the Incremental Conductance Mppt Algorithms in Photovoltaic Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1099/v1","date":1726282343000,"content":"It aims to utilize more solar energy, which is both environmentally friendly and easily accessible, to satisfy the energy needs of developing countries. Therefore, maximum power generation should be provided from photovoltaic panels. Several maximum power point tracking(MPPT) methods are utilized for the maximum power generation in photovoltaic panels systems under different weather conditions. In this paper, a novel hybrid and clever maximum power point monitoring fuzzy logic controller maximum power point tracking algorithm established on the perturb and observe (PO) algorithm is presented. The proposed fuzzy logic controller algorithm and the incremental conductivity maximum power point tracking algorithm were simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and evaluated by comparing the results. Four Sharp ND-F4Q295 solar panels, two in series and two in parallel were used for the simulation. The hybrid method proposed here was found to reduce the voltage and current ripple compared to the classical incremental conductivity method. The proposed intelligent method has been shown to stabilise the system more quickly in the event of sudden weather changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2b1d77a652339b4cae8c57e5f7af24cfdeaae3daf57de0f1c6d1ef70cf52500","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
