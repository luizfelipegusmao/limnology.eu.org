The traditional sample preparation workflow for biological materials involves thin sectioning of epoxy-embedded materials, heavy metal-based contrast-enhancement (OsO4, PbO2, â€¦) and metal coatings for charge compensation. In this case analyses suffer from sample preparation artefacts. In addition traditional chemical analysis using EDX (energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis) provides insufficient detection limits. Cryo-workflows avoiding as much as possible any chemical redistribution are established for imaging but are still relatively rare for chemical analysis. Ion beam milling of the sample surface in such instruments is typically used for tomographic imaging (where the imaging is done using the electron beam) and nanofabrication purposes especially at interfaces where hard and soft materials meet - but less for high resolution chemical imaging facilitated by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"be9e3541fb011eedfe051c0842a725309a37929caea1a46c53ab6781e7d60b83","category":"Environment"}
