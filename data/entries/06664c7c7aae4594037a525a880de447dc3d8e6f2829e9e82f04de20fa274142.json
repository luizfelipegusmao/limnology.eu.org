This study aimed to assess the long-term survival results among patients who received endoscopic therapy (ET) or surgical resection (SR) for cardia GIST. Cardia GIST patients from 2000 to 2019 were selected from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end result (SEER) database. Multiple imputation (MI) was applied to handle missing data, and propensity score matching (PSM) was carried out to mitigate selection bias during comparisons. Demographic and clinical characteristics’ effects on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 330 patients with cardia GIST were enrolled, including 47 (14.2%) patients with ET and 283 (85.8%) patients with SR. The 5-year OS and CSS rates in the ET and SR groups were comparable [before PSM, (OS) (76.1% vs. 81.2%, <i>P</i> = 0.722), (CSS) (95.0% vs. 89.3%, <i>P</i> = 0.186); after PSM, (OS) (75.4% vs. 85.4%, <i>P</i> = 0.540), (CSS) (94.9% vs. 92.0%, <i>P</i> = 0.099)]. Moreover, there was no significant difference between ET and SR in terms of long-term OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.735, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.422–1.282) and CSS (HR 1.560, 95% CI 0.543–4.481). Our study found no significant disparity in long-term survival outcomes between ET and SR in cardia GIST patients, implying that ET could be a valid surgical strategy for treating cardia GIST.","author":"Qiong Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"06664c7c7aae4594037a525a880de447dc3d8e6f2829e9e82f04de20fa274142","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
