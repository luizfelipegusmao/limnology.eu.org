After characterizing knowledge at grounded, embodied, and situated levels, number knowledge is analyzed from this hierarchical perspective. Lateralized cortical processing of coarse versus fine detail is identified as a grounding substrate for the population stereotype few/left, many/right, which then contributes to number-related sensory and motor biases at the embodied and situated levels. Implications of this perspective for education and rehabilitation are discussed.</p>","author":"Martin H.
