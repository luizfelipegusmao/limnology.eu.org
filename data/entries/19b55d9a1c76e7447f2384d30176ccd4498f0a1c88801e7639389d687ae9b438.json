{"title":"Stomatal improvement for crop stress resistance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1823/7450934?rss=1","date":1700870400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The growth and yield of crop plants are threatened by environmental challenges such as water deficit, soil flooding, high salinity, and extreme temperatures, which are becoming increasingly severe under climate change. Stomata contribute greatly to plant adaptation to stressful environments by governing transpirational water loss and photosynthetic gas exchange. Increasing evidence has revealed that stomata formation is shaped by transcription factors, signaling peptides, and protein kinases, which could be exploited to improve crop stress resistance. The past decades have seen unprecedented progress in our understanding of stomata formation, but most of these advances have come from research on model plants. This review highlights recent research in stomata formation in crops and its multifaceted functions in abiotic stress tolerance. Current strategies, limitations, and future directions for harnessing stomatal development to improve crop stress resistance are discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"19b55d9a1c76e7447f2384d30176ccd4498f0a1c88801e7639389d687ae9b438","category":"Environment"}
