{"title":"A Decentralized More-than-Human World, or, How Can Slime Molds Build Social Movements?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2239/v1","date":1727600959000,"content":"In a time of ecological and social crises, designing new institutions is crucial for meeting future challenges. Institutions emerge from the imaginations of individuals, moving into social movements and crystallizing in legal structures. As present movements seek to develop tomorrowâ€™s governances, they turn to decentralized structures: distributed networks with little hierarchy, characterized by a diversity of actors and dynamics. While movements and technologies may seek to utilize decentralized ideas, they lack design principles: only recently has it been possible to decentralize at the national stage. Designs may come from biology and ecological networks; fungi, plants, and slime molds in soil to the neurons, glia, and blood vessels within our own bodies. This article blends these biological analogies with present technologies like blockchain and Web3 to posit future decentralized institutions, movements and legalities that give greater consideration to the more-than-human world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d0f354ed5e714c1b692bdddd8324c6e88b98e4e57e28e2c85c765b6b1fb8d3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
