{"title":"Source Apportionment and Risk Assessment of Potentially Toxic Elements Based on PCA and PMF Model in Black Soil Area of Hailun City, Northeast China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1964/v1","date":1724759282000,"content":"Soil potentially toxic elements (PTEs) pollution in black soil is of significant concern in China. However, research is scarce regarding the current status, ecological risk, and human health risk of PTEs in the black soil area of northeast China. In our study, 304 soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected in Gonghe Town, Hailun City. The pollution degree and spatial distribution patterns of soil PTEs were analyzed by using the single-factor pollution index (PI) and the Nemerow pollution index (NPI). The source apportionment of PTEs was carried out by combining correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and positive matrix factorization (PMF) methods. Meanwhile, the potential ecological risk (RI) and the human health risk (HI) associated with soil contamination from various sources were evaluated through the RI and the HI. The results demonstrated that the average content (mean ± standard deviation) of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn were 11.16 ± 1.32 mg/kg, 0.11 ± 0.04 mg/kg, 65.29 ± 3.46 mg/kg, 22.56 ± 1.32 mg/kg, 0.03 ± 0.01 mg/kg, 27.07 ± 1.46 mg/kg, 26.09 ± 2.84 mg/kg, and 66.01 ± 4.52 mg/kg, respectively. The overall PTEs in the study area exhibited slight pollution levels. The PCA and PMF model source apportionment was validated against each other to yield four sources, which were natural source (33.2%), irrigation source (29.5%), traffic source (23.4%), and fertilizer source (13.2%). The overall RI in the study area was determined to be at the level of slight ecological risk. The non-carcinogenic risk of PTEs to children and adults was ignored, and the carcinogenic risk was at an acceptable level. The comprehensive analysis of PTEs, pollutant sources, RI, and HI concluded that the fertilizer source should be the primary control source, with Cd identified as the first control PTE. The irrigation source and the traffic source were identified as the secondary control sources, with As, Pb, and Hg identified as the secondary control PTEs. This study revealed the status, risks, and sources of PTEs in black soils and provided a scientific basis of PTEs control for policymakers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8744f49dcb6c544c249b7acc44e9bd64b97b7f0b4b31a289fa727a1cff6a6590","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
