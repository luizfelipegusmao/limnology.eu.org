{"title":"A Pinch of Nonsense","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ae/article/70/1/3/7633243?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span>I was recently listening to my favorite podcast (<span>Ologies with Alie Ward</span>), and there was a delightful episode on carcinology (the study of crabs). Alie’s guest (Adam Wall, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles) mentioned the pinch-force power of the coconut crab. Coconut crabs have measured pinch forces of up to 1,765 N, but the largest specimens might reach 3,300 N (<a href=\"#CIT0002\">Oka eta al. 2016</a>). This exceeds the bite force of most vertebrate predators (except alligators). I couldn’t help but wonder about the pinch power of insects and other (non-crabby) arthropods. Among the groups traditionally studied by entomologists, which have pincers? This topic seemed particularly appropriate for the spring issue, as many of you will be reading this around St. Patrick’s Day. There is a substantial religiopolitical history behind the use of green in the Irish independence movement. However, the “get pinched for not wearing green on St. Patrick’s Day” component is much more lighthearted (green makes you invisible to leprechauns, who are notorious pinchers) and is likely of American origin. Regardless, I couldn’t get the idea of arthropod pincers to release its grasp on my brain.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"American Entomologist Current Issue","siteHash":"718e0ce511af4548d0dc98d99e3fcb2a0cedb968506172cfd4871c3567f613f2","entryHash":"60d7c02ff834eae931ff90f2d49eda1c24579ba910344ce4b85513c198eba644","category":"Environment"}
