{"title":"Implementation of an Improved 100 CMM Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer to Reduce VOCs Gas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1718/v1","date":1727086879000,"content":": In this paper, we present an improved 100CMM regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) designed for low-emission combustion, capable of processing over 95% of volatile organic compound (VOC) gas emissions at generating sites. The existing RTO system features a cylindrical drum structure that cyclically introduces and discharges VOC gas into a rotating disk, achieving excellent energy efficiency with a heat recovery rate exceeding 95%. However, the driving force exerted on the rotating disk in the RTO combustion chamber causes increased wear around the rotating shaft, leading to untreated gas being released through the outlet due to the channeling phenomenon. Additionally, prolonged use can result in operational issues such as rotation stoppages or explosions caused by pollutant discharge, dust accumulation, and thermal expansion at high temperatures of up to 800°C. To address these challenges, we designed an enhanced rotating plate drive unit while ensuring the stable operation of the RTO combustion chamber. Considering that the combustion chamber can reach temperatures of up to 920°C when processing high-concentration VOC gas, the gas burner has been designed with a diameter of 125 mm, and the outlet dimensions are set to 650 mm x 650 mm to effectively discharge high-temperature waste heat. The heat storage material in the combustion chamber is configured with a ceramic block thickness, and the outer diameter and height of the combustion chamber are set at 250 mm, 2,530 mm, and 1,875 mm, respectively, to optimize the gas residence time and the insulation material thickness. Empirical experiments were conducted to analyze changes in VOC removal efficiency, nitrogen oxide emission concentration, and total hydrocarbon (THC) concentration, ultimately evaluating the economic performance of the 100CMM RTO.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52e461d4160fab2d67437a04fa059d0d5b739e5f184e320e07ec3ba1dee90195","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
