{"title":"Assessing disintegration effectiveness: A thorough evaluation using the SeDeM-ODT expert system for doxylamine succinate orodispersible formulation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310334","date":1726581600000,"content":"<p>by Salman Ashfaq Ahmad, Syed Muhammad Farid Hasan, Duaa Bafail, Saira Faraz Shah, Muhammad Imran, Tuba Sahar, Azfar Athar Ishaqui</p>\r\nBackground <p>The SeDeM-ODT expert system is designed to assess the suitability of the pharmaceutical ingredients for their conversion into an orodispersible formulation by direct compression. The tool can be utilized to select the most appropriate excipients that improve the compressibility and buccodispersibility of the formulation.</p> Objective <p>This study aimed to utilize the SeDeM-ODT expert system to evaluate the performance of superdisintegrants and select an appropriate superdisntegrant for Doxylamine Succinate orodispersible formulation.</p> Method <p>The SeDeM-ODT expert system scrutinized the excipients to develop an orodispersible Doxylamine Succinate formulation. Among the 15 parameters of the tool, some of them were determined through experimental work, while the remaining were calculated through the experimental values of other parameters. The central composite design approach was used for formulation development. The prepared powder blends were compressed using the direct compression method and evaluated for different parameters (hardness, thickness, diameter, friability, weight variation, water absorption ratio, wetting time, and disintegration time).</p> Results <p>The results of the SeDeM-ODT expert system were correlated with the values obtained by the post-compression tests. The Crospovidone formulation (F7) was found to be an optimized formulation as it disintegrated quickly compared with the other formulations containing other superdisintegtrants. The results perfectly endorsed the SeDeM-ODT expert system evaluation, as Crospovidone showed the highest IGCB value of 6.396.</p> Conclusion <p>The study observed the effectiveness of the expert system in accurately examining the performance of disintegrating agents. The study observed the effectiveness of the expert system in accurately examining the performance of disintegrating agents. The assessment proved Crospovidone to produce quicker disintegration in Doxylamine Succinate orodispersible formulation.</p>","author":"Salman Ashfaq Ahmad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d3615b6bae766b7e8798b8e4f5ee5a21570e7720e9036683c232f73f66da9c65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
