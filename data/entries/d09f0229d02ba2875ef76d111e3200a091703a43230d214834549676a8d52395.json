{"title":"B- and T-cell Specific Responses to Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in Anti-CD20 Treated Patients with Relapsing-Remitting or Progressive Form of Multiple Sclerosis Reveal Immunosenescent Features","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0381/v1","date":1720083080000,"content":"Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that inflammation starts early and progresses with age. B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+ B cells, are effective for both relapsing-remitting (RR) and progressive-relapsing (PR) MS. While effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA-vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality, that however suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d09f0229d02ba2875ef76d111e3200a091703a43230d214834549676a8d52395","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
