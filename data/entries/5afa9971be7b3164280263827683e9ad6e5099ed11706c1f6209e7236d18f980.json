They gathered a comprehensive sample of more than 800 species that cover the extant family-level diversity of mammals, using linear measurements of the forelimb skeleton to determine its shape and size. They found aquatic locomotion drives forelimb shape diversification, whereas aerial locomotion constrains forelimb diversity, demonstrating that locomotion in continuous fluid media can either facilitate or limit morphological diversity and, more broadly, that locomotor environments have fostered the morphological and functional evolution of mammalian forelimbs.\n\n</p>\n<br />","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"5afa9971be7b3164280263827683e9ad6e5099ed11706c1f6209e7236d18f980","category":"Environment"}
