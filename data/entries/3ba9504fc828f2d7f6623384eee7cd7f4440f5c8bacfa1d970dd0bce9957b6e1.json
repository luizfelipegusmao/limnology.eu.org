{"title":"Year‐round sampling of the fish community in a boreal lake: differences between summer and winter influence estimates of species composition, catch, and fish size","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15865?af=R","date":1721377125000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Boreal lakes experience pronounced seasonal variation in abiotic factors, especially light, temperature, and oxygen. A deep boreal humic lake was sampled year-round to test putative changes in total fish catch, species composition, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), habitat use, fish size, and condition. Monthly sampling was conducted in Lake Pääjärvi, southern Finland, during one full year in 2020–2021 as well as in March and August 2021 and 2022. The fish community was dominated by cyprinid species in all months, but the percentage of percid fish caught increased during the warm summer period. Most fish were caught in littoral habitats and the highest catches occurred in summer, but some species (e.g., ruffe, <i>Gymnocephalus cernua</i>, and pikeperch, <i>Sander lucioperca</i>) remained abundant in the winter catch. The body size of fish was larger in the winter catch, while condition factor was higher in summer for most species. Fish species proportions in total catch, CPUE, and average size of fish were closest to the annual mean values in September, which may be used as the optimal period to monitor fish communities of similar deep boreal lakes. Our findings highlight the need for year-round research to reveal the impacts of rising temperatures and diminishing ice-covered periods in fish communities and lake food webs.</p>","author":"Emmi S.
