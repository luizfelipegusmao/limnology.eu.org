{"title":"279 Effect of multiple feed additives on sow inflammatory status and reproductive performance during lactation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/173/7665036?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Low grade inflammation and insulin resistance were associated with increased gut permeability in lactating sows during the farrowing transition period. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of 4 feed additives including monolaurin, essential oil (Cinergy FIT 3S), phytogenic prototype 1 (PT1) and 2 (PT2) on sow inflammatory status and reproductive performance. It was hypothesized that the active components in these additives will reduce sow inflammation during lactation and lead to better sow reproductive performance. A randomized block design with 5 treatments was used in the study. A total of 550 gestating sows were enrolled with entry body weight of 240.1 ± 14.6 kg and allotted to one of the following five diets: Control; monolaurin; Cinergy; PT1 and PT2. Corn-soy based lactation diet was formulated with CP of 18%. All diets were formulated to be at similar net energy and standardized ileal digestible Lysine level. Experimental diets were fed beginning approximately 4 d before farrowing and throughout the entire lactation phase (21 d). Blood was collected from 16 sows per treatment before farrowing and within 5 d post farrowing to measure inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Performance data were analyzed using a general linear model in R (version 4.0.0). Count data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution. Dietary treatments did not impact average daily feed intake. Dietary treatment did not affect probability of still born or number of weaned pigs, but diet supplemented with PT1 resulted in greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) probability of born alive compared with the control (Table 1). There was a tendency (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) in treatment effect on pre-weaning mortality, with sows received PT2 supplemented diet having lowest value numerically. The concentration of cytokines IL-1α (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), IL-1β (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), IL-4 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), IL-6 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) and IL-10 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) were reduced between pre and post farrowing to a greater extent in sows fed Cinergy supplemented diet compared with the control. In conclusion, Cinergy worked best in reducing multiple inflammatory cytokine concentrations post-farrowing. Sows received PT1 supplemented diet had greater born alive and those received PT2 supplemented diet had numerically least pre-weaning mortality.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"617b8547c4b146518be6cf80e96edc0a00c3bdaa74d42254e712d8268f5d0005","category":"Environment"}
