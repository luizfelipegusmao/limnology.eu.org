{"title":"Development of 6DOF Hardware-In-the-Loop Ground Testbed for Autonomous Robotic Space Debris Removal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1425/v1","date":1724285719000,"content":"This paper presents the development of a hardware-in-the-loop ground testbed featuring active gravity compensation via software-in-the-loop integration, specially designed to support research in autonomous robotic removal of space debris. The testbed is designed to replicate six degrees of freedom (6DOF) motion maneuvering to accurately simulate the dynamic behaviors of free-floating robotic manipulators and free-tumbling space debris under microgravity conditions. The testbed incorporates two industrial 6DOF robotic manipulators, a 3-finger robotic gripper, and a suite of sensors, including cameras, force/torque sensors, and tactile tensors. Such a setup provides a robust platform for testing and validating technologies related to autonomous tracking, capture, and post-capture stabilization within the context of active space debris removal missions. Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated advancements in motion control, computer vision, and sensor fusion. This facility is positioned to become an essential resource for the development and validation of robotic manipulators in space, offering substantial improvements in the effectiveness and reliability of autonomous capture operations in space missions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4cfe31647243e208fffb314f1c86e24925d9e3cc5e49f75f0e03bfbf0109bf60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
