{"title":"Purging Autologous HSCs via Detection of Clonal Mutations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0163/v4","date":1728910441000,"content":"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants are usually used in cases where patients have active cancerous illness in their bone marrow, but allogeneic transplants can cause graft vs. host disease. If autologous HSCs could be purged of cancer cells, they could then be used for transplantation purposes without concern. It is still controversial whether purging is necessary, but it certainly would alleviate concerns. A novel method of purging is discussed herein that does not require chemotherapy and is targeted for each patient. It could be applied either in vitro or in vivo.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a69090e9a05d4e281ac13fab9bbab6d5a90cc755954d3baf126d546fd3906ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
