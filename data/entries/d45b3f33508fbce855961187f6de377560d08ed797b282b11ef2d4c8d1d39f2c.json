{"title":"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Up-Regulated Factor (PAUF) Transforms Human Monocytes into Alternative M2 Macrophages with Immunosuppressive Action","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0206/v1","date":1727943470000,"content":"Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) promote immune evasion, cancer cell proliferation, and metastasis. Ongoing research is focused on finding ways to prevent tumor growth by inhibiting TAM polarization, which has shown a correlation with unfavorable prognosis in clinical studies. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma upregulated factor (PAUF) is a protein secreted from pancreatic cancer (PC) and acts as a TME modulator that affects the TME by acting on not only cancer cells but also stromal cells and immune cells. Tumor cells can evade the immune system by PAUF binding to Toll-like receptor (TLR) in monocytes, as this research shows. In this study, the examination centered around the recruitment of human monocytes by PAUF and the subsequent differentiation into macrophages. In an in vitro chemotaxis assay, PAUF induced chemotactic migration of TLR2-mediated monocytes. In addition, PAUF induced differentiation of monocytes into M2 macrophages, which was verified based on expressing surface markers and cytokines and morphological analysis. The inhibition of T cell proliferation and function was observed in differentiated M2 macrophages. To conclude, these findings indicate that PAUF functions as a promoter of cancer progression by regulating the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages within TMEs, ultimately causing immunosuppression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d45b3f33508fbce855961187f6de377560d08ed797b282b11ef2d4c8d1d39f2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
