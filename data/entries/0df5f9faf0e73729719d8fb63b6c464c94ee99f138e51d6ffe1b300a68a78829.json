{"title":"Transient plasma membrane disruption induced calcium waves in mouse and human corneal epithelial cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301495","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Zhong Chen, Xiaowen Lu, Mitchell A. Watsky</p>\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to examine transient plasma membrane disruptions (TPMDs) and TPMD-induced Ca<sup>++</sup> waves (TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs) in human and mouse corneal epithelium (HCEC and MCEC). A multi-photon microscope was used to create laser–induced TPMDs in single cultured cells and in intact <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> MCECs and <i>ex vivo</i> human cornea rim HCECs. Eye rubbing-induced TPMDs were studied by gentle rubbing with a cotton tipped applicator over a closed eyelid in <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> MCECs. Ca<sup>++</sup> sources for TPMD-induced Ca<sup>++</sup> waves were explored using Ca<sup>++</sup> channel inhibitors and Ca<sup>++</sup>-free media. TPMDs and TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs were observed in all cornea epithelial models examined, often times showing oscillating Ca<sup>++</sup> levels. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>++</sup> ATPase inhibitors thapsigargin and CPA reduced TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs. TRP V1 antagonists reduced TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs in MCECs but not HCECs. Ca<sup>++</sup>-free medium, 18α-GA (gap junction inhibitor), apyrase (hydrolyzes ATP), and AMTB (TRPM8 inhibitor) did not affect TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs. These results provide a direct demonstration of corneal epithelial cell TPMDs and TPMDs in <i>in vivo</i> cells from a live animal. TPMDs were observed following gentle eye rubbing, a routine corneal epithelial cell mechanical stress, indicating TPMDs and TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs are common features in corneal epithelial cells that likely play a role in corneal homeostasis and possibly pathophysiological conditions. Intracellular Ca<sup>++</sup> stores are the primary Ca<sup>++</sup> source for corneal epithelial cell TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wvs, with TRPV1 Ca<sup>++</sup> channels providing Ca<sup>++</sup> in MCECs but not HCECs. Corneal epithelial cell TPMD Ca<sup>++</sup> Wv propagation is not influenced by gap junctions or ATP.","author":"Zhong Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0df5f9faf0e73729719d8fb63b6c464c94ee99f138e51d6ffe1b300a68a78829","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
