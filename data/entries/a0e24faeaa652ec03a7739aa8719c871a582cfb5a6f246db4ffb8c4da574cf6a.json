{"title":"Impact of Cultural Heritage Travel Experience on Well-being Mediating Escapism: A Multi-Group Analysis between Travelers from the Daily and Non-Daily Living Spheres","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1387/v1","date":1721216568000,"content":"Life is a field of senses and the experience of feeling, thinking, acting, and building relationships with everything around us. These senses and experiences are also consumed in travel destinations to pursue the traveler's escapism and happiness. However, while the field of tourism studies has recognized the importance of experience and focused on the relationship between various travel experiences and happiness, research on the variables that mediate and strengthen these relationships is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to apply the five strategic experiential models proposed by Schmitt [1]— sense, feel, think, act, and relate — to investigate the mediating effect of escapism on travelers' well-being. Data were collected from travelers visiting three major heritage sites in Gyeongju (Bulguksa Temple, Seokguram Grotto, and Bunhwangsa Temple), and 509 responses were used for analysis. The analysis was conducted using statistical package programs SPSS and AMOS employing frequency analysis, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. The results indicated significant positive effects between variables such as cultural heritage travel experience, escapism, and well-being. In the analysis of the mediating effect of escapism, escapism showed a significant mediating effect on the relationship between travel experience and well-being. This study confirmed that, during cultural heritage travels, individuals’ well-being can be enhanced through a holistic experience encompassing sensory, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and relational aspects rather than an isolated experience centered on escapism. This finding provides important implications for the design and planning of travel programs and products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0e24faeaa652ec03a7739aa8719c871a582cfb5a6f246db4ffb8c4da574cf6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
