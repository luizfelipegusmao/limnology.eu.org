{"title":"The ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ziziphi’ effectors SJP1/2 negatively control leaf size by stabilizing the transcription factor ZjTCP2 in jujube","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/3054/7602077?rss=1","date":1707177600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phytoplasmas manipulate host plant development to benefit insect vector colonization and their own invasion. However, the virulence factors and mechanisms underlying small-leaf formation caused by jujube witches’ broom (JWB) phytoplasmas remain largely unknown. Here, effectors SJP1 and SJP2 from JWB phytoplasmas were identified to induce small-leaf formation in jujube (<span>Ziziphus jujuba</span>). <span>In vivo</span> interaction and expression assays showed that SJP1 and SJP2 interacted with and stabilized the transcription factor ZjTCP2. Overexpression of <span>SJP1</span> and <span>SJP2</span> in jujube induced ZjTCP2 accumulation. In addition, the abundance of <span>miRNA319f_1</span> was significantly reduced in leaves of <span>SJP1</span> and <span>SJP2</span> transgenic jujube plants and showed the opposite pattern to the expression of its target, <span>ZjTCP2</span>, which was consistent with the pattern in diseased leaves. Overexpression of <span>ZjTCP2</span> in Arabidopsis promoted ectopic leaves arising from the adaxial side of cotyledons and reduced leaf size. Constitutive expression of the <span>miRNA319f_1</span> precursor in the <span>35S::ZjTCP2</span> background reduced the abundance of <span>ZjTCP2</span> mRNA and reversed the cotyledon and leaf defects in Arabidopsis. Therefore, these observations suggest that effectors SJP1 and SJP2 induced small-leaf formation, at least partly, by interacting with and activating <span>ZjTCP2</span> expression both at the transcriptional and the protein level, providing new insights into small-leaf formation caused by phytoplasmas in woody plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7eb2eafe2ac77e5ded3d70d74964d02c9bd4206f8d841fd9cf73dbce0ace74ca","category":"Environment"}
