{"title":"Coated sodium butyrate and vitamin D3 supplementation improve gut health through influencing intestinal immunity, barrier, and microflora in early‐stage broilers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13288?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Intestinal development and function are critical to maintaining sustained broiler growth. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of coated sodium butyrate (CSB) and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (VD<sub>3</sub>) on the intestinal immunity, barrier, oxidative stress and microflora in early-stage broilers. In total, 192 one-day-old broilers were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial design including two dietary supplements at two different levels, in which the main effects were VD<sub>3</sub> (3000 or 5000 IU kg<sup>−1</sup>) and CSB (0 or 1 g kg<sup>−1</sup>).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that CSB supplementation increased ileal goblet cells (GCs) numbers, villus height and decreased crypt depth in broilers. CSB increased ileal proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and high-level VD<sub>3</sub> decreased cluster of differentiation 3 expression. CSB reduced serum <span>d</span>-lactate, endotoxin (ET), adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level. Meanwhile, high-level VD<sub>3</sub> decreased serum ET concentration. Furthermore, CSB increased ileal T-AOC, lysozyme (LYZ) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and decreased MDA, whereas high-level VD<sub>3</sub> decreased ileal MDA and increased secretory immunoglobulin A. CSB up-regulated ileal claudin1, superoxide dismutase 1, TGF-β and LYZ mRNA expression and down-regulated interleukin-1β mRNA expression. CSB combined with high-level VD<sub>3</sub> increased ileal <i>Faecalibaculum</i> abundance. Spearman correlation analysis showed that <i>Faecalibaculum</i> was related to the immune and barrier function.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Dietary supplementation with CSB and high-level VD<sub>3</sub> improved early gut health in broilers by promoting intestinal development, enhancing antioxidant capacity, strengthening barrier function and enhancing the favorable composition of the gut bacterial flora. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hang Gao, \nXingkai Zhao, \nYizhe Guo, \nZhendong Li, \nZhenlei Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"34d175eb4102325b6937ead17aebaf000c28cb6833d11776500551f55556b56e","category":"Environment"}
