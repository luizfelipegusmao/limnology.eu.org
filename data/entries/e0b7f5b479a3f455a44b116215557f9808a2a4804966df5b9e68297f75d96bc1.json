Processes that govern epithelial—mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PDAC hold promise for advancing novel therapeutic strategies. SAMD1 (SAM domain-containing protein 1) is a CpG island-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the repression of its target genes. Here, we revealed that SAMD1 acts as a repressor of genes associated with EMT. Upon deletion of SAMD1 in PDAC cells, we observed significantly increased migration rates. SAMD1 exerts its effects by binding to specific genomic targets, including <i>CDH2</i>, encoding N-cadherin, which emerged as a driver of enhanced migration upon SAMD1 knockout. Furthermore, we discovered the FBXO11-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex as an interactor and negative regulator of SAMD1, which inhibits SAMD1 chromatin-binding genome-wide. High <i>FBXO11</i> expression in PDAC is associated with poor prognosis and increased expression of EMT-related genes, underlining an antagonistic relationship between SAMD1 and FBXO11. In summary, our findings provide insights into the regulation of EMT-related genes in PDAC, shedding light on the intricate role of SAMD1 and its interplay with FBXO11 in this cancer type.","author":"Clara Simon","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"e0b7f5b479a3f455a44b116215557f9808a2a4804966df5b9e68297f75d96bc1","category":"Environment"}
