{"title":"The evolution of seminal fluid gene expression and postmating reproductive isolation in Drosophila","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/995/7615571?rss=1","date":1709078400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Seminal fluid protein (Sfp) genes show, in general, a higher rate of sequence divergence than genes from other categories, which is often attributed to forms of postcopulatory sexual selection or sexual conflict. Recently, the relaxation of selective constraints has been proposed as an alternative explanation for the rapid sequence evolution of Sfps and other genes with sex-limited expression. The expression of Sfp genes is a likely target of selection, but the evolution of differences in their expression levels is less understood. Here, we explore both polymorphism and divergence in Sfp gene expression between <span>Drosophila melanogaster</span> and <span>Drosophila simulans</span>, how selection might have influenced their expression, and whether changes in expression might trigger the evolution of reproductive isolating barriers. In our analysis, Sfp genes showed higher divergence, but not higher polymorphism, in expression than the average male reproductive glands gene. Sfp genes with reproductive-tissue-specific expression were enriched for both directional and stabilizing selection, while relaxed selection was the predominant mode of evolution among Sfp genes with any other nonreproductive tissue-specific or nontissue-specific expression. The knockdown of single genes known to affect intraspecific sperm competition, and with patterns of expression divergence and polymorphism suggestive of directional selection, was not enough to break down postmating reproductive isolation barriers between species. Our results identify the expression of male-specific Sfp genes as an enriched target of selection and suggest a complex molecular relationship between postcopulatory sexual selection on a single geneâ€™s expression and its effect on the onset of speciation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"06b6557cc296701c8df8793abbd41b69ba9c5bf3baccb425360671cfed39772d","category":"Environment"}
