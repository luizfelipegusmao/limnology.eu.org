{"title":"Analysis of the genetic structure of the introduced clearhead icefish (Protosalanx chinensis) populations in northern China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15710?af=R","date":1709723718000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>When species are introduced to a new environment, they can quickly adapt to the environment and may differ from the indigenous species. The indigenous population of <i>Protosalanx chinensis</i> has a high level of genetic diversity, but it is unclear on the genetic diversity of the introduced populations in northeast China, which supports the major production of <i>P. chinensis</i> in the world. A total of 556 individuals of <i>P. chinensis</i> were collected during 2016–2021, from Lianhuan Lake (LHL), Xingkai Lake (XK), and Shuifeng Reservoir (SF), and one population was collected from the indigenous Taihu Lake (TH). Overall, 36 haplotypes were detected, and the genetic differences in <i>P. chinensis</i> populations within and between river basins were investigated. The nucleotide diversity (π) of the populations ranged from 0.0005 to 0.0032, and the haplotype diversity (<i>H</i>\n<sub>d</sub>) ranged from 0.455 to 0.890, with the highest genetic diversity in the TH population, followed by the SF population, and lower genetic diversity in the XK and LHL populations. The analysis of the genetic differentiation index (<i>F</i>\n<sub>st</sub>) and the genetic distance between populations showed that there was significant genetic differentiation between the TH population and the other populations. More sampling points have been set up in LHL for further analysis; the Dalong Lake (DL) and the Xiaolong Lake (XL) populations were far from the other populations within the LHL population. In this study, we didn't find a correlation between population size, stability, and genetic diversity, and the ecological measures of management should be decisive to the population dynamics. These results provide a basis for the rational utilization and effective management of <i>P. chinensis</i>.</p>","author":"Yi Zheng, \nFujiang Tang, \nXianhu Zheng, \nRongbin Na, \nZhe Li, \nWanqiao Lu, \nCuiyun Lu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"91246bdf30856cd6b12b63611a845dcfd4a8b034e2f2df596b91bf6900a11cc4","category":"Environment"}
