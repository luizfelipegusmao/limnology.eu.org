{"title":"A Crystal Plasticity Based Simulation to Predict Fracture Initiation Toughness in Reactor Grade Aluminium: Experimental Verification and Study of Effect of Crystal Orientation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1361/v1","date":1716275733000,"content":"Aluminium alloys are used for fabrication of fuel clad of research grade nuclear reactors as well as of several types of core components of high flux research reactors. In order to carry out design and safety analysis of these components, their mechanical and fracture properties are required by the designer. In this work, experiments have been conducted on tensile specimens machined from an aluminium alloy block to evaluate the material stress-strain curve. For evaluation of fracture properties, experiments have been conducted on disc shaped compact tension specimens in order to determine the fracture toughness of aluminium alloy. From crystal plasticity based finite element analysis and experimental data, a material damage parameter for prediction of crack initiation has been evaluated. The variation of the parameter for various values of initial a/W ratios of the disc-shaped CT specimens have been studied. It was observed that the damage parameter is independent of crack geometry and hence, it qualifies as transferable material property which can be used to predict crack initiation in a component of this material subjected to different kinds of loading conditions. In addition, the JR curves of the disc-shaped CT specimens have also been evaluated from experiments. The material damage parameter has also been used to study the crack initiation in single crystal fracture specimens with two different orientations. It was observed that the [111] orientation is more susceptible to crack initiation and propagation compared to the [100] orientation as the damage parameter is high in the ligament of the specimen ahead of the crack-tip for the same level of load. The results of the experiments and the material damage parameter shall be helpful for integrity analysis of fuel clad of research reactors as well as components of high flux research reactors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9dcd725f558aaa22953fc8a1b343470677b6759d05ebab9c5b924a4ab2348389","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
