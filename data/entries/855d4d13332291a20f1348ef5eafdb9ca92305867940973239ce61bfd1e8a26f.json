{"title":"Community Mobilisation for Human Sample Collection in Sensitive Communities: Experiences from Granular Mapping of Schistosomiasis &amp; Soil-Transmitted Helminths in Ekiti Satate, Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1200/v1","date":1726482006000,"content":"Community mobilisation is a vital process for raising awareness and increasing participation in healthcare interventions, research and programs that require human sample collection and mass management. In this report, we present the community mobilisation approach undertaken for the implementation of granular schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths operational mapping and assessment in Ekiti State Nigeria. The mobilisation was conducted in 177 communities/wards of the 16 Local Government Areas. A total of 15,340 urine and stool samples were collected in 34 days. The efficacy and success of the strategy was evaluated through three performance metrics: Community compliance rate, the participant response rate at community level and overall compliance response rate of the 4 most sensitive LGAs. Community compliance was 93.7% as sample collection was denied in 9 communities. Two other communities demanded return of collected samples. Participant response rate at the community level was 86.7%. Three of the 4 sensitive LGAs (based on previous assessment programs) demonstrated satisfactory compliance rates of 100%, while a response rate of 64.0% was computed for one of the LGAs. We believe our approach contributed to effective community mobilisation &amp;amp; awareness and the developed model has potential for improving participation rates in large healthcare assessments and intervention programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"855d4d13332291a20f1348ef5eafdb9ca92305867940973239ce61bfd1e8a26f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
