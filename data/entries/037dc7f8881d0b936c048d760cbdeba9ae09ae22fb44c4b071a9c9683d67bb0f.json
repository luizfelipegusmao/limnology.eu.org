{"title":"Long-term Storage Stability of Neutral Electrolyzed Water by Two-stage Electrolysis: Optimal Storage Conditions for Intraoral Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0302/v1","date":1725431777000,"content":"Electrolyzed water, which mainly contains hypochlorous acid, is widely used because of its strong microbicidal effects, biosafety, and eco-friendliness. For frequent use in intraoral treatments, we focused on neutral electrolyzed water (NW) produced using two-stage electrolysis and investigated its storage stability. For standard-concentration NWs with free available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 25, 35, and 50 mg/L and high-concentration NWs (100, 200, 300, 500, and 1000 mg/L), changes in the pH, oxidation-reduction potential, and ACC during 126 days of storage and the bactericidal efficacies were examined. Storage under non-shaded conditions at room temperature (LRT) and a higher ACC substantially altered the properties of the NW. NW (≤ 300 mg/L) had a pH of 5.9–7.3 even after storage under LRT; however, NW with higher ACC (500 and 1000 mg/L) had a pH ˂ 5.5, critical for human enamel), even under shaded and refrigerated conditions (SLW). Only NW (25 mg/L) stored under LRT exhibited the lowest ACC (5 mg/L), indicating a decreased bactericidal effect. When stored for use in intraoral treatments, NWs should be prepared with an ACC of 25–300 mg/L and stored in SLW. If diluted NW is used, the ACC should be checked and appropriately diluted every time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"037dc7f8881d0b936c048d760cbdeba9ae09ae22fb44c4b071a9c9683d67bb0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
