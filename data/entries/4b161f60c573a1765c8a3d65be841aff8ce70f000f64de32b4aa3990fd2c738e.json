Predator presence is often communicated through predator-released chemical signals. Ovipositing female mosquitoes of several species are repelled by unknown signals released from larvivorous fish.\n\nIt was previously suggested that in many cases, a predator's microbiota plays an important role in the release of these signals; however, this mechanism is still poorly understood.\n\nIn this study, we looked into the effects of the microbiota originating from the larvivorous <i>Gambusia affinis</i> (Baird and Girard) on the oviposition behaviour of gravid female mosquitoes. We used fish with altered microbiota and bacterial isolates in a set of outdoor mesocosm experiments to address this aim.\n\nWe show that interference with the fish microbiota significantly reduces fish's repellent effect. We further show that the bacterium <i>Pantoea pleuroti</i>, isolated from the skin of the fish, repels oviposition of <i>Culex laticinctus</i> Edwards and <i>Culiseta longiareolata</i> Macquart mosquitoes similarly to the way in which live fish repel them.\n\nOur results highlight the importance of bacteria in the interspecies interactions of their hosts. Furthermore, this finding may lead to the development of an ecologically friendly mosquito repellent, that may reduce the use of larvivorous fish for mosquito control.\n</p>","author":"Nimrod Shteindel, \nYoram Gerchman, \nAlon Silberbush","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"4b161f60c573a1765c8a3d65be841aff8ce70f000f64de32b4aa3990fd2c738e","category":"Environment"}
