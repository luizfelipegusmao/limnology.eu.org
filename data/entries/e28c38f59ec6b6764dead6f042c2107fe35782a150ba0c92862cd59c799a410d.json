{"title":"How does the green efficiency of urban land use evolve in the urban agglomeration of China's middle Yangtze river?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nrm.12392?af=R","date":1701770327000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze river (MYRUA) is the second largest national urban agglomeration in China, with an excellent ecological foundation. As the construction of urban agglomerations accelerated towards both extension and connotation, land prices of various cities rose, and the contradiction in the demand and utilization of land resources became acute. Therefore, exploring the spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms of land green utilization efficiency within MYRUA had positive significance. This article focused on 28 prefecture-level cities in the MYRUA and measured their urban land green use efficiency (ULGUE) from 2006 to 2018 using the super slack-based measure model with undesirable output (Super-SBM-U). Then, the improved Fixed Malmquistâ€“Luenberger index was developed to improve the accuracy of dynamic efficiency analysis. Further, the internal and external driving factors were explored using the index decomposition and the spatial error model with fixed effects. The results showed that the land use mode of the urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River was relatively green, but efficiency gaps still existed. Although the green total factor productivity of the whole cluster has improved by 3.30% a year on average, the excessive pursuit of technological innovation has led to the stagnation of urban land management in various cities, and there are numerous inherent contradictions in urban development. But at the same time, feasible economic development directions, industrial upgrading, high-quality employees, land marketization, and positive environmental behaviors are conducive to the green and sustainable development of ULGUE. This article depicted the internal land use characteristics of the MYRUA from the perspective of spatiotemporal evolution and efficiency, providing a theoretical reference for the green development and coordinated management of urban agglomeration land.</p>","author":"Jiaxuan Hong, \nYanling Mao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resource Modeling: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3719477483f67b16afdbb60e07461dbbb5827188dd5d72806069fb36caa95c59","entryHash":"e28c38f59ec6b6764dead6f042c2107fe35782a150ba0c92862cd59c799a410d","category":"Environment"}
