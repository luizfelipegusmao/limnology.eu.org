{"title":"Reinforced Polymers with Natural Fiber","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0757/v1","date":1715596234000,"content":"The interest in obtaining new composite materials with diverse properties has created a growing interest in natural fi-bers as reinforcement in polymers, which has generated an impact in sectors such as automotive and construction, dis-placing synthetic fibers. Properties such as low density, low cost, and rene.wable make these fibers an attractive alterna-tive to reduce environmental impact. Their application in polymers, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, and epoxy resins, has allowed the modification of polymeric composite materials' mechanical and physical properties (NFRP). This review focuses on investigating the status of natural fiber-reinforced polymers. It analyzes their worldwide demand, chemical characteristics, physical and mechanical properties, and various applications in different sectors and indus-tries. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of NFRPs are highlighted, highlighting their potential for new ap-plications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be42e6b6ab3b11b0aaf2be57f4433e4e3ca185ca8ef04a472f044dba51bd0003","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
