NaCl (approximately a mass fraction of 39 % Na) is not practical for use alongside other embedded and polished materials in a mounted block of standards. While albite (NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>; approximately a mass fraction of 8 % Na) represents a typical choice for some microanalysts, it may be subject to time dependent signal intensity issues, such as those observed for Na and other cations during analysis of hydrous glasses [<a href=\"#ozae044.012-B2\">2</a>]. Near endmember jadeite pyroxene (NaAlSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>; approximately mass fraction of 11 % Na) represents a desirable option for calibration given its relatively large concentration of Na and insensitivity to electron beam radiation with respect to X-ray output. Despite these desirable characteristics, jadeites have been shown to contain complex microstructures as the result of intracrystalline zoning [<a href=\"#ozae044.012-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.012-B4\">4</a>], and the impact of chemical inhomogeneity within mineral standards and natural glasses has been documented [<a href=\"#ozae044.012-B5\">5-7</a>]. In this study, a commercially obtained jadeite crystal (source location “China”) was studied to assess its microscale uniformity using a suite of microbeam methods, including dispersive red-green-blue multispectral cathodoluminescence imaging (CL<sub>RGB</sub>), hyperspectral CL imaging spectrometry, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), SEM-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (μXRF), and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"256b7513355343021ecaeae0cb10b8b95b84f13b3168db6adbfbc1e8ee5b40c5","category":"Environment"}
