{"title":"Vascular Nadph Oxidases and Atherothrombotic Stroke","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2171/v1","date":1721990903000,"content":"Oxidative stress constitutes a main molecular mechanism underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This pathological mechanism can be triggered by NADPH oxidases (NOXs), which produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). In fact, the different NOXs have been associated with myocardial infarction, atherothrombosis, and stroke. More specifically, we will focus on the implications of NOXs in atherothrombotic stroke. Each NOX member participates in a different way in the several stages of this disease: endothelial dysfunction, immune cell infiltration, foam cell genesis, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation, and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Additionally, some NOXs are involved in plaque instability, thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Interestingly, the effects of NOXs in this pathology depend on the specific homologue, the cell type in which they are activated, and the stage of the disease. In this review we summarize the most up-to-date information about the implications of vascular NOXs in each of these processes. Finally, we highlight some limitations and future perspectives of the study of NOXs in CVDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ea78a13230e727ed7ce029271ac8f69a20dce615426df9e20685d653136ebcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
