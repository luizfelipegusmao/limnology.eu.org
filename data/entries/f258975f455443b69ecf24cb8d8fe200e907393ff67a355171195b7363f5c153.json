{"title":"Contrasting nitrogen dynamics across the Mid‐Atlantic Bight shelfbreak front: Insights from nitrate dual isotopes and nitrifier gene abundance","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12678?af=R","date":1727804393000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Observations and model studies suggest that front dynamics can enhance phytoplankton productivity. This study tested whether frontal systems also increase the abundance of nitrifying microbes and nitrogen recycling during repeat sampling transects across the Mid-Atlantic Bight shelfbreak in July 2019. We measured ammonium concentrations, nitrate dual isotopes (δ<sup>15</sup>N, δ<sup>18</sup>O), and ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (<i>amoA</i>) genes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB). In subsurface shelf waters, ammonium concentrations exceeded 2 <i>μ</i>mol L<sup>−1</sup>, due to a temporary imbalance in regeneration from sinking particles and subsequent nitrification. The inverse correlation between nitrate δ<sup>15</sup>N values and ammonium concentrations confirmed nitrate was partially or entirely from local nitrification on the shelf. In contrast, the shelfbreak frontal zone and slope sea subsurface waters had much lower ammonium concentrations (0.1–0.2 <i>μ</i>mol L<sup>−1</sup>) due to tight coupling between ammonium regeneration and nitrification. The deviation of nitrate δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>18</sup>O from algal uptake-driven 1 : 1 ratio suggests concurrent nitrification in the euphotic zone. The shelfbreak front acted as an ecological boundary where AOA and AOB <i>amoA</i> gene numbers were partitioned, with AOAs abounding in slope waters and AOBs in shelf waters, likely due to ammonium availability. At certain slope stations, deep-water nutrient inputs via isopycnal lifting induced by Gulf Stream intrusions caused unexpectedly high phytoplankton biomass, which doubled nitrifier abundance and potentially stimulated both ammonium regeneration and nitrification. These findings demonstrate distinct distributions of nitrifying microbes along the salinity gradient from shelf to slope and highlight the significant influence of coastal ocean-western boundary current interactions on nitrogen biogeochemistry.</p>","author":"Yifan Zhu, \nMargaret R.
