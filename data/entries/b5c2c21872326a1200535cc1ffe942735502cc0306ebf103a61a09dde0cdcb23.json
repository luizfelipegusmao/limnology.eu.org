{"title":"Stress as a Catalyst: Understanding its Role in Bowel Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1511/v1","date":1711450419000,"content":"Stress has been identified as a prominent contributor to the development and advancement of bowel cancer, however its specific involvement is intricate and diverse. This abstract tries to offer a concise summary of the correlation between stress and bowel cancer, consolidating significant discoveries from several research fields. The investigation commences by studying the molecular pathways by which chronic stress impacts the development of colon cancer. Chronic stress causes disruption in the functioning of neuroendocrine, immunological, and inflammatory pathways, leading to the development of a microenvironment within the gastrointestinal system that promotes the growth of tumours. Furthermore, changes in the composition of gut microbiota, variations in epigenetics, and alterations in immune function caused by stress also have a role in increasing the risk and advancing the advancement of cancer. Psychological aspects, including how one perceives stress, the tactics they use to cope with it, and the level of psychosocial support they receive, are crucial in determining a person's susceptibility to bowel cancer and impacting the effectiveness of treatment. Stress management therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction, have demonstrated potential in enhancing patient well-being and promoting adherence to treatment. Moreover, epidemiological studies and clinical trials offer vital knowledge regarding the correlation between stress and the risk, prognosis, and treatment results of bowel cancer. Although the evidence is inconclusive, it is essential to continue researching the intricate relationship between stress and bowel cancer. This will help us understand the connection better and create specific strategies to reduce its impact on patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5c2c21872326a1200535cc1ffe942735502cc0306ebf103a61a09dde0cdcb23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
