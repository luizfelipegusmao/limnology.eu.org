While some have assessed the endocrinological conditions of children and adults, a consensus regarding the interaction between F and the thyroid remains elusive. This systematic review aimed to gather primary evidence on the association between F and changes in the thyroid at optimal and high levels in water supply as stipulated by the World Health Organization. A search strategy, incorporating terms pertinent to the studies, was employed across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, and Google Scholar. Following the review of studies, data were extracted and analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations to assess the quality of the evidence. Our results yielded 3,568 studies, of which seven met the inclusion criteria for this review. Five of the seven studies identified an association between high F exposure and thyroid function. In the analysis of methodological quality, every study was found to have major or minor methodological issues and significant risk of bias. The overall confidence in the evidence was deemed low for all outcomes in the seven studies. The evidence compiled in this review suggests a potential association between chronic high levels of F exposure and thyroid damage. Nonetheless, further studies with robust design and high methodological quality are required to provide evidence for policy makers and health care practitioners.","author":"Maria Karolina Martins Ferreira","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c1ee9dc5a1d692f24c0284722e96ff6c377038708dcf58ead0194bd39016d4e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
