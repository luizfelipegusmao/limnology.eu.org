The tree lycopsids, sometimes as the primary elements of Devonian forests, had evolved several types of rooting systems. In recent years, we found and excavated a Late Devonian (Famennian, 374â€“359 Ma) lycopsid forest from Zhejiang Province, China. The fossil forest occurs at seven locations of Lincheng Town of Changxing County and mainly consists of <span>in situ</span> small tree lycopsid (<span>Heliodendron longshanense</span> gen. et sp. nov.) stems usually connected to lobed cormose rhizomorphs. The four short lobes of each rhizomorph often branch once and bear roots arranged radially. Allometry is observed between the trunk diameter of <span>Heliodendron</span> and the length of its rhizomorphic lobes, indicating that the trunk develops later than the rhizomorph in tree lycopsid plants. The Devonian witnessed the transformation from clastic nonlycopsid dominated forests to Carboniferous swampy forests dominated by giant lycopsid trees. These trees form a multigenerational community, as shown by the <span>in situ</span> preserved stems at various levels within the same area due to frequent sedimentation events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"9c1f54222f2b5b558aec96822c95d8207e8d94edaa8e8adb7cd223980d9ce801","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
