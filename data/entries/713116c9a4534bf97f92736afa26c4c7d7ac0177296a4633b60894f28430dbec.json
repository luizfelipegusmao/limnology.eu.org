{"title":"PSXII-16 Effect of including sugar cane molasses on rumen fermentation characteristics in young beef finishing heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/780/7757715?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In ruminant animals, the use of molasses has benefits related to improved voluntary intake and increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the rumen, especially butyrate. Butyrate is closely related to gastrointestinal tract health, as it may contribute to the increase in the absorption area of the ruminal epithelium and improve the utilization of diet components, resulting in improved voluntary intake and immune response capacity in stressful situations, such as weaning. Hence, our objective was to assess the effect of sugar cane molasses on rumen fermentation characteristics in young beef finishing heifers. Newly weaned Nellore × Red Angus heifers (n = 12) averaging 238 ± 5.1 kg body weight (BW), were used. All heifers were housed in individual pens with concrete floors, covered feeders, and drinkers. The basal diet was 50 % concentrate, and consisted of corn silage, sorghum silage, ground corn, soybean meal, urea, and a mineral premix. The diet was provided twice daily at 0700 and 1600 h, allowing up to 10% in orts (as fed). The following treatments were evaluated: control (no addition of powdered molasses) or addition of 50 g/kg of diet [dry matter (DM) basis] of powdered molasses. The experiment lasted for a total of 80 d, including a 14-d adaptation period. On d 68 and 76, rumen fluid samples were collected both before and 4 h after the morning feeding using an oral probe coupled to a vacuum pump. The initial fluid samples were discarded to prevent saliva contamination. The rumen fluid was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and then pH was measured. Subsequently, samples were taken and stored in an ultra-freezer (-80°C) for subsequent SCFA analysis. The data were subjected to analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS 9.4 (α = 0.05). Providing molasses increased ruminal pH compared with control heifers (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.032). Adding molasses did not affect SCFA concentration (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.90). Conversely, we detected an effect of molasses on SCFA molar proportion. The molar proportion of both acetate (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.013) and butyrate (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.012) were greater in heifers fed molasses than with controls. On the other hand, dietary molasses addition decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). the propionate molar proportion. This resulted in an increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.002) acetate-to-propionate ratio in heifers fed diets containing molasses. In conclusion, providing sugar cane molasses enhances rumen fermentation characteristics in young beef finishing heifers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"713116c9a4534bf97f92736afa26c4c7d7ac0177296a4633b60894f28430dbec","category":"Environment"}
