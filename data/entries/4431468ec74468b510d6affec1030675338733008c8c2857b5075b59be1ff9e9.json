This study aims to assess the awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding sun exposure and sunscreen use among college students in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 388 college students from various disciplines. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire covering demographic information, knowledge, and practices related to sun exposure and sunscreen use. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to analyze the data. Results: The study comprised 53.9% females, with the majority aged 18-23 years. Formal education on sun exposure dangers was lacking for 43.0% of participants. The most recognized consequences of excessive sun exposure were sunburn (80.6%) and skin cancer (74.4%). Intermediate knowledge of sun exposure effects was most common (40.7%). Sunscreen use was inconsistent, with 27.3% never using it during peak sunlight hours. Factors influencing sunscreen use included weather conditions and healthcare provider recommendations. Males were significantly less likely to use sunscreen. First-year students and participants without formal education on sun exposure were less likely to use sunscreen regularly. Conclusion: Despite awareness of the risks associated with excessive sun exposure, sunscreen use among college students in Saudi Arabia is inconsistent and influenced by various factors, including gender and education level. These findings highlight the need for enhanced educational initiatives to promote regular sunscreen use and other sun protection behaviors to mitigate the risk of skin conditions associated with sun exposure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4431468ec74468b510d6affec1030675338733008c8c2857b5075b59be1ff9e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
