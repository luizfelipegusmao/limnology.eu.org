{"title":"Pattern Formation in a Model of Inflammation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1049/v1","date":1718606126000,"content":"Inflammation is the body’s response to infection, injury, or other stimuli. Acute inflammation is a crucial component of the immune system’s defense, aimed at eliminating infected or damaged cells and halting disease progression. A subtle interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes determines its progression to inflammation resolution or to chronic inflammation. In this study, we propose a generic model of inflammation through a system of reaction-diffusion equations involving various inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cells and cytokines. We investigate the formation of patterns, determined by the emergence of Turing structures, through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations. These theoretical findings are further supported by observations of similar patterns in skin diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f798daab232443a3f22001035c8fdef748d0d1b5b6ec5f2ee293f9f75d042747","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
