{"title":"An Electrical Parameter Characterizing Solute Heterogeneity: The Mixing Factor M","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036059?af=R","date":1718607600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Quantitative estimates of hydrological state variables using electrical or electromagnetic geophysical methods are systematically biased by overlooked heterogeneity below the spatial scale resolved by the method. We generalize the high-salinity asymptotic limit of electrical conduction in porous media at the continuous (e.g., Darcy) scale, by introducing a new petrophysical parameter, the mixing factor <i>M</i>, which accounts for the effect of fluid conductivity heterogeneity on the equivalent electrical conductivity tensor; it is expressed in terms of the volume-average of the product of mean-removed fluid conductivity and electric fields. We investigate the behavior of <i>M</i> for static and evolving fluid conductivity scenarios. Considering 2-D ergodic log-normal random fields of fluid conductivity, we demonstrate, in absence of surface conductivity, that observing the components of the <i>M</i>-tensor allows univocally determining the variance and anisotropy of the field. Further, time-series of the <i>M</i>-tensor under diffusion-limited mixing allows distinguishing between different characteristic temporal scales of diffusion, which are directly related to the initial integral scales of the salinity field. Under advective-diffusive transport and for a pulse injection, the time-series of <i>M</i> have a strong dependence on the PÃ©clet number. Since <i>M</i> is defined in the absence of surface conductivity, we investigate how to correct measurements for surface conductivity effects. The parameter <i>M</i> provides conceptual understanding about the impact of saline heterogeneity on electrical measurements. Further work will investigate how it can be incorporated into hydrogeophysical inverse formulations and interpretative frameworks.</p>","author":"Alejandro Fernandez Visentini, \nNiklas Linde","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"dae7e1780b7836f72e09eeeb484d644afe78860bdc0846953545516bd6090dc8","category":"Environment"}
