{"title":"A follow up on the continuum theory of eco-anxiety: Analysis of the Climate Change Anxiety Scale using Item Response Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0803/v1","date":1720605804000,"content":"The mental health impact of the environmental crisis, particularly eco-anxiety, is a growing research topic whose measurement still lacks consensus. In this article, we use item response theory (IRT) to better un-derstand what existing questionnaires measure. To conduct this review, we used open-access data from the short French version of the Climate Change Anxiety Questionnaire (Mouguiama-Daouda et al. 2022, Heeren et al., 2023). Our results suggest that, of the different models tested, the unidimensional model seems to be the most appropriate for measuring eco-anxiety. The item difficulty parameter extracted from the IRT enabled us to discuss the level of severity of the items making up this tool. The Climate Change Anxiety Questionnaire is more appropriate for measuring severe to moderately severe eco-anxiety. Ave-nues for improving this questionnaire and the measurement of eco-anxiety in general are then discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa5f6b81b8acac0922f085619f1a969674e3e2377dc5a5f76fbfc7759d65ed8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
