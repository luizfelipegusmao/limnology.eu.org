{"title":"Magnitude of Scholarly Communication Theories Used durign the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1814/v1","date":1727102783000,"content":"This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the use of theories in open access resources during the COVID-19 pandemic would be greater than in copyrighted resources. Using the Scopus database from August 18-28, 2023, the search terms “COVID-19,” “Coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “2019-nCoV” retrieved 511,920 results, of which 17,487 were selected. After filtering, 8,254 studies were analyzed. These were categorized as \"Both Theory and Model,\" \"Only Theory,\" and \"Only Model.\" Using MS Excel, the researchers sorted studies based on titles, abstracts, and keywords to assess the magnitude of theory and model use. The study found that theories and models were employed across various disciplines and indexed accordingly. Further analysis included term categories, year-wise distribution, and citation patterns in relation to access categories. The study recommended future research to explore the connection between theories/models and factors such as publication trends, geography, and funding. The study concluded that, journals should encourage authors to include theories/models used in their studies in titles, especially during health emergencies, to provide early insights into handling pandemics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"553e7f5557a4faa2d235220046caefed0d46d5aea17c6b5c7aefd65e1fdf084b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
