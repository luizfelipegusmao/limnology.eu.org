{"title":"Biomarkers of Neuroinflammation and Epileptogenesis: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1976/v1","date":1717034712000,"content":"Introduction: A central role for neuroinflammation in epileptogenesis has recently been suggested by several investigations. This systematic review explores the role of inflammatory mediators in epileptogenesis, its association with seizure severity, and its correlation with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Material and Methods: The study analysed articles published in JCR journals from 2019 to 2024, including retrospective, prospective, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. It combined MESH and free terms for \"Epileptogenesis\" and \"Neuroinflammation\" and included searches for biomarkers previously reported in narrative reviews. Results: The study analysed 243 articles related to epileptogenesis and neuroinflammation, with 356 from selective searches by biomarker type. After eliminating duplicates, 324 articles were evaluated, with 272 excluded and 52 evaluated by authors. 21 articles were included in the qualitative evaluation, including 18 case-control studies, 2 case series, and 1 prospective study. This systematic review provides acceptable support for five biomarkers: TNF-a and some of its soluble receptors (sTNFr2), HMGB1 and TLR-4, CCL2 and IL-33. Discussions: Certain receptors, cytokines, and chemokines are examples of neuroinflammation-related biomarkers that may be crucial for the early diagnosis of refractory epilepsy or may be connected to the control levels of epileptic patients. Their value will be better defined by future studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd0d03f508c258e8cb2b0ac36e3ea7c24b1a26ab529a87b30791596b5a3682e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
