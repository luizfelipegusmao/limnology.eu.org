{"title":"The evolutionary and transmission dynamics of HIV-1 CRF08_BC","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310027","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Xingguang Li, Nídia S. Trovão</p>\r\n\r\nHIV-1 CRF08_BC is a significant subtype in China, though its origin and spread remain incompletely understood. Previous studies using partial genomic data have provided insights but lack comprehensive analysis. Here, we investigate the early evolutionary and spatiotemporal dynamics of HIV-1 CRF08_BC in China and Myanmar using near-complete genome sequences. We analyzed 28 near-complete HIV-1 CRF08_BC genomes from China and Myanmar (1997–2013). Phylogenetic, molecular clock, and Bayesian discrete trait analyses were performed to infer the virus’s origin, spread, and associated risk groups. Based on Bayesian time-scaled inference with the best-fitting combination of models determined by marginal likelihood estimation (MLE), we inferred the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of HIV-1 CRF08_BC to be at 3 October 1991 (95% HPD: 22 February1989–27 November 1993) and 2.30 × 10<sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% HPD: 1.96 × 10<sup>−3</sup>–2.63 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), respectively. Our analysis suggests that HIV-1 CRF08_BC originated in Yunnan Province, China, among injecting drug users, and subsequently spread to other regions. This study provides valuable insights into the early dynamics of HIV-1 CRF08_BC through combined genomic and epidemiological data, which may inform effective prevention and mitigation efforts. However, the limited genomic data influenced the extent of our findings, and challenges in collecting accurate risk group information during surveillance were evident.","author":"Xingguang Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c9be2c2936937d399744e3d4fa3adc594cdb88ad24662df88e53969262028e88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
