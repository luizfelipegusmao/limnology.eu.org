The performance of annular metallic fuels has been an ongoing discussion. Void swelling, fission gas release, fuel cladding chemical interaction are some of the fuel performance limiting factors in metallic fuels. High resolution characterization provides vital information in investigating the fuel performance by studying the microstructure and phases present. Atom probe tomography, an advanced characterization tool, offers extensive capabilities in retrieving chemical information at the nano scale. It has become a beneficial tool in correlating different factors while understanding the irradiation effects on a material.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e101e06f6ea2c40c9e0dd7774e334457c5634f990a5c9ccfc000e0d6ab4d9635","category":"Environment"}
