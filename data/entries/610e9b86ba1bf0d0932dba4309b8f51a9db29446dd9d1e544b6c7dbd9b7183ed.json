{"title":"Isoginkgetin and Madrasin are poor splicing inhibitors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310519","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Michael Tellier, Gilbert Ansa, Shona Murphy</p>\r\n\r\nThe production of eukaryotic mRNAs requires transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) II and co-transcriptional processing, including capping, splicing, and cleavage and polyadenylation. Pol II can positively affect co-transcriptional processing through interaction of factors with its carboxyl terminal domain (CTD), comprising 52 repeats of the heptapeptide Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7, and pol II elongation rate can regulate splicing. Splicing, in turn, can also affect transcriptional activity and transcription elongation defects are caused by some splicing inhibitors. Multiple small molecule inhibitors of splicing are now available, some of which specifically target SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component. SF3B1 inhibition results in a general downregulation of transcription elongation, including premature termination of transcription caused by increased use of intronic poly(A) sites. Here, we have investigated the effect of Madrasin and Isoginkgetin, two non-SF3B1 splicing inhibitors, on splicing and transcription. Surprisingly, we found that both Madrasin and Isoginkgetin affect transcription before any effect on splicing, indicating that their effect on pre-mRNA splicing is likely to be indirect. Both small molecules promote a general downregulation of transcription. Based on these and other published results, we conclude that these two small molecules should not be considered as primarily pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors.","author":"Michael Tellier","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"610e9b86ba1bf0d0932dba4309b8f51a9db29446dd9d1e544b6c7dbd9b7183ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
