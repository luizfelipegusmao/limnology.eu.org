So, this study aims to investigate causal factors contributing to youth cyberbullying in Thailand's three Southern border provinces. (2) Methods: The subject group consisted of 340 youths and the data were analyzed with structural equation modeling (SEM). (3) Results: The study found that the model of the causal factors resulting in youth cyberbullying in the three Southern border provinces was consistent with the empirical data (the relative chi-square (Ï‡2/df) was 1.77. The goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was 0.95. The root-mean-square-error of approximate (RMSEA) was 0.049). Cyberbullying was positively influenced directly and indirectly by negative upbringing, the influence of personal violence, and the influence of media violence at a statistically significant level of 0.001, with total effect sizes of 1.13, 0.74, and 0.64, respectively. Additionally, cyberbullying was positively influenced directly by negative mental traits with a statistically significant level of 0.05 and a total effect size of 0.17. (4) Conclusions: The study results could be beneficial in concretely forming policies and strategies to prevent and mitigate the problem of youth cyberbullying.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1e624ff2d35a9290137b0cf89a27856d6ca9198ea86ddee811fbfa2707852f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
