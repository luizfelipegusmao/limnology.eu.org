For well over a century now, we have had a theoretical framework – Maxwell’s equations – to describe the shifting charge and the applied fields. The task still at hand, however, is to measure, describe, and understand how real materials behave within this framework.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e45eb013827f29bf765442ed31faa94b91d7737ba68a30d205f52945f37bfe84","category":"Environment"}
