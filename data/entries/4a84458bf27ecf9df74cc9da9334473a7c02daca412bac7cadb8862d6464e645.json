{"title":"Effects of marine microplastic on marine life and the food webs – A detailed review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12819?af=R","date":1718622523000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Microplastics, which are microscopic plastic particles smaller than five millimetres, have become a common global pollution in marine environments. These particles, which come from a variety of sources such as the decomposition of bigger plastic objects and the microfibres that are shed from textiles, are extremely dangerous to ecosystems and marine life. This study provides a detailed analysis of the global issue of microplastic pollution, including its origins, effects on marine ecosystems, current mitigation techniques, and future research prospects. The review divides microplastics into main and secondary categories, detailing their sources ranging from plastic pellets and microbeads to the breakdown of bigger plastic items such as bottles and bags. It emphasises the negative impacts of microplastics on marine species, aquaculture, and human health, such as gastrointestinal obstructions, toxic chemical accumulation, and cancer risk to human health. The review also examines the economic and environmental consequences of marine plastic pollution, highlighting the importance of effective policies and remedies. Furthermore, the article covers several researches on microplastic contamination in coastal sediments, seafood, and aquatic creatures from diverse locales. It addresses methods for collecting, extracting, and analysing microplastics, as well as advances in machine learning and spectroscopic techniques for precise identification and measurement. Furthermore, the study summarises the research on the ecological hazards presented by microplastics, such as their movement patterns, accumulation in marine ecosystems, and possible long-term effects. The study also examines the problems and limitations in existing research, such as the need for consistent data collection processes, a better knowledge of microplastic behaviour in various settings, and the development of novel mitigating solutions. Overall, this study gives an in-depth summary of the current state of knowledge on microplastic contamination, emphasising the critical need for more research, legislative interventions, and public awareness campaigns to ameliorate its negative impacts on marine ecosystems and human health.</p>","author":"Prateek Sethia, \nDhuraimurugan Nandhini, \nSadasivan Amutha","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"4a84458bf27ecf9df74cc9da9334473a7c02daca412bac7cadb8862d6464e645","category":"Environment"}
