And a comprehensive control strategy for HMCVT output speed is proposed by analyzing the factors affecting the fluctuation of output speed, which combines engine speed control and displacement ratio control of hydraulic speed control system. This strategy adopts fuzzy control to regulate the engine speed to maintain the stability of engine operation. Moreover, adopting feed forward compensation control for speed compensation enhances the anti-interference ability of the hydraulic speed control system. And combined with model predictive control, adjust the swash plate swing angle of the variable pump to reduce the fluctuation of HMCVT output speed. By establishing joint simulation model, the effectiveness of the control strategy was verified using tractor acceleration mode and step load disturbance mode. The results show that the strategy can reduce the fluctuation rate of engine speed and impact degree, shorten the adjustment time, and improve the stability of tractor operating speed.","author":"Zhiqiang Xi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f4c821cb941411294d7490c73d64e03fa0d8edafcd477f720c4ca49008328a1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
