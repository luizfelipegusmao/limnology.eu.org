{"title":"Systematic Review of Machine Learning Return-on-Investment Forecasting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1191/v1","date":1721100841000,"content":"In this paper, we investigate the proftability of investing in movies for retail investors, focusing on the return on investment (ROI) metric, which is calculated as revenue divided by budget. Our analysis encompasses 5000 movies from the movie database TMDB, examining factors such as production scale, genres, key actors, directors, and more. Additionally, we employ textual analysis techniques like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on movie overviews and tags to incorporate movie themes. We then evaluate various supervised classifcation models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM), comparing their performance. Our fndings highlight the signifcance of production scale, team structure, and movie themes in identifying potential high-return opportunities for investors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33521e25659de303d0de1f93c82206e7e499c12f1987e7e64558912c3f58984e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
