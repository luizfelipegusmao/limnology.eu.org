{"title":"Object and Event Detection Pipeline for Rink Hockey Games","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0383/v1","date":1712230338000,"content":"All types of sports are potential application scenarios for automatic and real-time visual object and event detection. In rink hockey, the popular roller quad skate variant of hockey team sports, it is of great interest to automatically track player’s movements and positions, player’s sticks and, also, making other judgments, such as being able to locate the ball. In this work, we introduce a real-time pipeline composed by an object detection model, created specifically for rink hockey games, followed by a knowledge-based event detection module. Even in the presence of occlusions and quick motions, our deep learning object detection model effectively identifies and tracks, in real-time, important visual elements such as: ball; players; sticks; referees; crowd; goalkeeper; and goal. Using a curated dataset composed by a collection of videos of rink hockey, comprising 2525 annotated frames, we trained and evaluated the algorithm performance and compare it to state of the art object detection techniques. Our object detection model, based on YOLOv7, presents a global accuracy of 80%, and presents a good performance in terms of accuracy and speed, according to our results, making it a good choice for rink hockey applications. In our initial tests, the event detection module successfully detected one important event type in rink hockey games, the occurrence of penalties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79ebdc6f1096a0aa91c741ea3610fcdd2f5fb62297fe43bf27790a0d84f6fbc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
