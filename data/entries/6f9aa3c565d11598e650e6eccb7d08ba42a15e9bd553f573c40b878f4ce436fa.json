The method utilizes mild acid hydrolysis to convert amide N found in proteins and <i>N</i>-acetyl amino polysaccharides to primary amine containing products that are measured using a highly sensitive (nanomolar range and precision) fluorometric technique with addition of <i>O</i>-phthaldialdehyde. We find amidic bDON concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 1.82 <i>μ</i>M N within waters from the upper 300 m in the southern California Current, Southern California Bight, and subtropical North Pacific representing 15–33% of bulk DON concentrations. Bioassay experiments from the North Pacific revealed consumption of ~20% of the in situ bDON within 5 days. The method represents a simple and rapid tool for the quantification of bioavailable DON concentrations in seawater with improved analytical precision over traditional estimates of bulk DON concentrations.</p>","author":"Robert T.
