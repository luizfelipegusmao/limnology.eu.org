The mechanisms governing quasispecies remain unclear. Plasmodesmata regulate viroid movement and were hypothesized to impact viroid quasispecies. Here, we sequenced the progeny of potato spindle tuber viroid intermediate (PSTVd-I) strain from mature guard cells lacking plasmodesmal connections and from in vitro-cultivated mesophyll cell protoplasts from systemic leaves of early-infected tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) plants. Remarkably, more variants accumulated in guard cells compared to whole leaves. Similarly, after extended cell culture, we observed more variants in cultivated mesophyll protoplasts. Coinfection and single-cell sequencing experiments demonstrated that the same plant cell can be infected multiple times by the same or different PSTVd sequences. To study the impact of initial population composition on PSTVd-I quasispecies, we conducted coinfections with PSTVd-I and variants. Two inoculum ratios (10:1 or 1:10) established quasispecies with or without PSTVd-I as the master sequence. In the absence of the master sequence, the percentage of novel variants initially increased. Moreover, a 1:1 PSTVd-I/variant RNA ratio resulted in PSTVd-I dominating (&gt;50%), while the variants reached 20%. After PSTVd-I-only infection, the variants reached around 10%, while after variant-only infection, the variants were significantly more than 10%. These results emphasize the role of cell-to-cell communication and initial population composition in shaping PSTVd quasispecies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"513363306ed6e15fc39d016d26136c7e67b13776c636a993e0cc392e41f180e1","category":"Environment"}
