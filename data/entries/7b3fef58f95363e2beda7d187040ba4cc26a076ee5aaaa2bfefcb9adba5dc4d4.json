{"title":"The Expansion of Sirtuin Gene Family in Gilthead Sea Bream (Sparus aurata). Phylogenetic, Syntenic, and Functional Insights Across the Vertebrate/Fish Lineage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1181/v1","date":1713431458000,"content":"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes, and the aim of this study was to disclose/re-annotate uncertain paralogs in gilthead sea bream, expanding from seven to ten the repertoire of Sirts in this Perciform fish. Such gene expansion revealed up to three copies of sirt3 (sirt3.1a/sirt3.1b/sirt3.2) and two of sirt5 (sirt5a/sirt5b). Phylogenetic and synteny attempts disclosed the duplication of SIRT3/Sirt3 branch as a process shaped by the 2R whole genome duplication (WGD) at the early vertebrate evolution, with still vestiges in all living fish, and some Sarcopterygii. In gilthead sea bream and other Percomorphaceae, this duplication was accompanied by short segmental duplications of sirt3.1 (clustered to the mammalian SIRT3 ortholog), making a conserved tandem-duplicated synteny block (psmd13-sirt3.1a/b-drd4-cdhr5-ctsd). Conversely, the expansion of the Sirt5 branch was shaped by the 3R WGD as a specific event of the teleost fish lineage. Intriguingly, gene expression profiling across tissues and developmental stages highlighted a conserved high expression of sirt3.1 and sirt5a in skeletal muscle, while the duplicated sirt3.2 and sirt5b displayed an overall muscle suppression of transcriptional activity, and an enhanced expression on immune-relevant tissues and gills, respectively. Altogether offers new insights about the function, regulation, and timing of Sirt expansion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b3fef58f95363e2beda7d187040ba4cc26a076ee5aaaa2bfefcb9adba5dc4d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
