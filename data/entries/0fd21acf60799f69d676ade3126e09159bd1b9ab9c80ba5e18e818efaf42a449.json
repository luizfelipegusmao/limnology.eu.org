{"title":"Navigating the cancer care continuum: A comparative study of Black and White breast cancer patients","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312547","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Min K.

Shields, Yuehwern Yih</p>\r\n\r\nDespite improvements in early detection and therapeutic interventions, the mortality rate for Black breast cancer patients is still significantly higher than that of White breast cancer patients. This study seeks to understand differences in the patient experience that lead to this disparity. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand the breast cancer treatment process and patient experiences. This study collected health services and timeline data from medical records. Based on these two data sources, the patient’s journey in breast cancer treatment was mapped and a thematic analysis was conducted to identify challenges and barriers in the process. The cancer care continuum consists of four stages—diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy/radiation, and follow-up care. The themes contributing to patient experiences and challenges were identified and compared in each stage for both Black and White patients. Both Black and White participants faced challenges related to financial constraints, treatment changes, lack of autonomy, and insufficient emotional support. However, Black participants additionally faced significant barriers in terms of cultural concordance, effective patient-provider communication, and delay in diagnosis. This study highlights the importance of incorporating effective provider-patient communication, navigation, and emotional support, especially for Black breast cancer patients throughout the cancer care continuum to address healthcare disparities.","author":"Min K.
