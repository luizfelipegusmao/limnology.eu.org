{"title":"Impaired Tertiary Dentin Secretion After Shallow Injury in Tgfbr2-Deficient Dental Pulp Cells Is Rescued by Extended CGRP Signaling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1398/v1","date":1716457089000,"content":"Introduction: Transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) signaling regulates odontoblast differentiation, dentin mineralization, and the paracrine signaling that guides sensory innervation in developing mouse molars. We hypothesized that Tgfbr2 also regulates the neuro-pulpal responses to injury to activate axon sprouting and tertiary dentin secretion. Methods: We per-formed a timed deletion of Tgfbr2 using tetracycline-responsive Osterix-Cre;Tgfbr2f/f (Tgfbr2^cko) mice, which allowed them to develop normally. At 3 months, we drilled a shallow hole on the mesial side of the first mandibular molar (M1) in both control and Tgfbr2^cko mice. Hemi-mandibles were collected 4, 8, 21, and 56 days post-injury (dpi). In situ hybridization (ISH) for Sp7 was performed to confirm Osterix-Cre transcription. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) imaging and histology were used to examine the tertiary dentin, and immunofluorescence was used to visualize CGRP+ axons following the injury. Results: Tgfbr2 deletion was inferred by Sp7 ISH. Micro-CT and histology indicated a lower dentin volume in 21 dpi Tgfbr2^cko M1s compared to WT M1s, but the volume was comparable by 56 dpi. The duration of axon sprouting was longer in injured Tgfbr2^cko M1s compared to WT M1s. Conclusions: These results suggest that sensory afferents may support dentin repair in Tgfbr2-deficient odontoblasts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e930be0ef2cb7163bfd589ee5c168d8229a66295f0e74689e335c2e496e73fe4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
