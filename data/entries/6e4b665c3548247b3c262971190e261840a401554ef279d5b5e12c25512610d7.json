RT-qPCR analysis of circHIPK3 and miR-338-3p levels. MWM test was performed to examine the behavioral changes in rats. The levels of circHIPK3 and miR-338-3p levels were investigated using RT-qPCR. ELISA assay to analyze the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. CCK-8, flow cytometry, and commercial ROS assay kits were analyzed to detect cell viability, apoptosis, and ROS production. DLR and RIP assays validate circHIPK3 binding to miR-338-3p.<div>Results</div>Sev increased circHIPK3 expression in rat hippocampal tissue as well as in neuronal cells but decreased miR-338-3p levels compared to controls. circHIPK3 binding to miR-338-3p. Furthermore, silencing of circHIPK3 rats attenuated Sev-induced decline in learning and memory functions . silencing circHIPK3 also reduced Sev-induced secretion of inflammatory factors in rat and neuronal cells. Reducing circHIPK3 partially reversed the Sev-induced decrease in cell viability, increased apoptosis, and overproduction of ROS. However, the inhibitory effect of circHIPK3 on Sev neurotoxicity was restored upon downregulation of miR-338-3p.<div>Conclusion</div>Collectively, silencing circHIPK3 alleviates Sev exposure-induced learning and memory deficits and neurotoxicity by enhancing miR-338-3p expression.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"6e4b665c3548247b3c262971190e261840a401554ef279d5b5e12c25512610d7","category":"Environment"}
