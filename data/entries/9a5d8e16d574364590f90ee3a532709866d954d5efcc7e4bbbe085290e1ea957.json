{"title":"Sphaeroptica: A tool for pseudo-3D visualization and 3D measurements on arthropods","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311887","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Aurore Mathys, Yann Pollet, Adrien Gressin, Xavier Muth, Jonathan Brecko, Wouter Dekoninck, Didier Vandenspiegel, Sébastien Jodogne, Patrick Semal</p>\r\n\r\nNatural history collections are invaluable reference collections. Digitizing these collections is a transformative process that improves the accessibility, preservation, and exploitation of specimens and associated data in the long term. Arthropods make up the majority of zoological collections. However, arthropods are small, have detailed color textures and share small, complex and shiny structures, which poses a challenge to conventional digitization methods. Sphaeroptica is a multi-images viewer that uses a sphere of oriented images. It allows the visualization of insects including their tiniest features, the positioning of landmarks, and the extraction of 3D coordinates for measuring linear distances or for use in geometric morphometrics analysis. The quantitative comparisons show that the measures obtained with Sphaeroptica are similar to the measurements derived from 3D μCT models with an average difference inferior to 1%, while featuring the high resolution of color stacked pictures with all details like setae, chaetae, scales, and other small and/or complex structures. Shaeroptica was developed for the digitization of small arthropods but it can be used with any sphere of aligned images resulting from the digitization of objects or specimens with complex surface and shining, black, or translucent texture which cannot easily be digitized using structured light scanner or Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry.","author":"Aurore Mathys","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9a5d8e16d574364590f90ee3a532709866d954d5efcc7e4bbbe085290e1ea957","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
