{"title":"Mutator-like transposable element 9A interacts with metacaspase 1 and modulates the incidence of Al-induced programmed cell death in peanut","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/2113/7465199?rss=1","date":1702080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The toxicity of aluminum (Al) in acidic soil inhibits plant root development and reduces crop yields. In the plant response to Al toxicity, the initiation of programmed cell death (PCD) appears to be an important mechanism for the elimination of Al-damaged cells to ensure plant survival. In a previous study, the type I metacaspase AhMC1 was found to regulate the Al stress response and to be essential for Al-induced PCD. However, the mechanism by which AhMC1 is altered in the peanut response to Al stress remained unclear. Here, we show that a nuclear protein, mutator-like transposable element 9A (AhMULE9A), directly interacts with AhMC1 <span>in vitro</span> and <span>in vivo</span>. This interaction occurs in the nucleus in peanut and is weakened during Al stress. Furthermore, a conserved C2HC zinc finger domain of AhMULE9A (residues 735â€“751) was shown to be required for its interaction with AhMC1. Overexpression of <span>AhMULE9A</span> in Arabidopsis and peanut strongly inhibited root growth with a loss of root cell viability under Al treatment. Conversely, knock down of <span>AhMULE9A</span> in peanut significantly reduced Al uptake and Al inhibition of root growth, and alleviated the occurrence of typical hallmarks of Al-induced PCD. These findings provide novel insight into the regulation of Al-induced PCD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"1edb41e5e259ba9471a2a64a228e61af30ad07472ceb93d00573426906b2afd4","category":"Environment"}
