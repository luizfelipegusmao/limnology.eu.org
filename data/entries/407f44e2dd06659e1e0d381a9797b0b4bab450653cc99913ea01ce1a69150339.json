{"title":"Histaminergic System Activity in the Central Nervous System (CNS) &ndash; the Role in Neurodevelopmental and Neurodegenerative Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1269/v1","date":1724122902000,"content":"Histamine (HA), a biogenic monoamine, exerts its pleiotropic effects through four H1Râ€“H4R histamine receptors, which are also expressed in brain tissue. Together with the projections of HA-producing neurons located within the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), which innervate most areas of the brain, they constitute the histaminergic system. Thus, while remaining a mediator of the inflammatory reaction and immune system function, HA also acts as a neurotransmitter and a modulator of other neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system (CNS). Although the detailed causes are still not fully understood, neuroinflammation seems to play a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative (neuropsychiatric) diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Given the increasing prevalence/diagnosis of these disorders and their socioeconomic impact, the need to develop effective forms of therapy has focused researchers' attention on the brain's histaminergic activity and other related signaling pathways. This review presents the current state of knowledge concerning the involvement of HA and the histaminergic system within the CNS in the development of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"407f44e2dd06659e1e0d381a9797b0b4bab450653cc99913ea01ce1a69150339","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
