{"title":"Insights into Catechin &ndash; Copper Complex Structure and Biologic Activity Modulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1183/v1","date":1728984831000,"content":"Compounds of natural origin found in varying quantities in plant-based products constitute a highly significant category, possessing structural significance as well as the capacity to regulate oxidative processes. The activity of these compounds may be modulated by the composition of the biological milieu in which they operate, the pH of the environment, or the presence of metal cations in plants or plant extracts. This work shows the synthetic methodology and the optimization process that took place to synthesize a catechin-copper complex which demonstrated antioxidant activity tested for iron chelation ability, hydroxyl radical test and inhibition of lipoxygenase (15-LOX) activity. Antidiabetic assay was performed by determination of the alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibition assays and the antibacterial activity showed results against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The complex was characterized by FT-IR, UV-VIS and EDX techniques and the biological activity assays were tested in triplicate to fully confirm the activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc66339f27742ac79d432c1a5db3f11074b73ece3c9d3e6e8b39f95a1c4217ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
