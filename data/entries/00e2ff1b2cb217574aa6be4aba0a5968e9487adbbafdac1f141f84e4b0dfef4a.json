{"title":"Estimated reproductive parameters for a vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin population","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13131?af=R","date":1713872023000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding reproductive output and success is integral to the conservation and management of threatened species and populations. Little is known about the reproductive parameters of Australian humpback dolphins (<i>Sousa sahulensis</i>), a species subject to cumulative pressures from anthropogenic threats due to their coastal distribution and strong site fidelity. This study assesses several reproductive parameters, including crude birth, recruitment, fecundity, and calf survival rates, in addition to interbirth intervals of Australian humpback dolphins inhabiting the near-urban embayment of Moreton Bay, Queensland. Between 2014 and 2020, 106 adult females were photographically identified during 222 boat surveys. Of these, 75.5% (<i>n</i> = 80) were observed with calves. Birth seasonality was apparent and coincided with austral autumn and winter months. Interbirth intervals ranged between 1 and &gt;6 years, with an average of 3.1 (<i>SD</i> = 1.1) years if offspring survived. Findings indicate declining fecundity rates (<i>p</i> &lt; .05, <i>M</i> = 0.12, <i>SD =</i> 0.02), relatively low recruitment rates (<i>M</i> = 0.04, <i>SD</i> = 0.01) and calf survival rates to 1 year of age (<i>M</i> = 0.63, <i>SD =</i> 0.15). This study provides a useful baseline that can inform viability assessments and conservation measures, for both this population and others throughout the species range.</p>","author":"Elizabeth R.
