{"title":"An Evidence-based Guide for Delivering Mental Healthcare Services in Farming Communities: A Qualitative Study of Providers&rsquo; Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1046/v1","date":1715771722000,"content":"Background: Individuals living in rural areas often face challenges in accessing healthcare, increasing their risk of poor health outcomes. Farmers, a sub-population in rural areas, are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues and suicide, yet exhibit low rates of help-seeking behavior. The aim of our study was to develop an in-depth understanding of the issues influencing mental help-seeking among farmers living in rural areas from the perspectives of healthcare providers, as well as to explore the strategies providers use to navigate through these issues to effectively engage with this vulnerable population. Methods: We used a descriptive phenomenological approach to understand healthcare providersâ€™ perspectives, experiences, and approaches to providing mental healthcare to farmer clients in rural areas. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 participants between March and May 2023. Results: Our analysis yielded five thematic areas: (1) ensuring accessibility, (2) establishing relatability, (3) addressing stoicism and stigma, (4) navigating dual roles, and (5) understanding community trauma. Conclusions: Healthcare service delivery for farmers is multifaceted. This study fills a gap in knowledge by translating these the data to inform an evidence-based model and a list of recommendations for implementing agriculturally-informed practices in rural areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a92c1d700e660f1dd7132651484b7c16737f2d6f0614d07f0805e35093d3e40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
