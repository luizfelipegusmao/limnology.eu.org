{"title":"Impact of the Use of High-power Wind Turbines on the Efficiency and Sustainability of Wind-powered Water Pumping Systems: Application to Small Towns in the Bodélé Triangle Area of Chad","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1589/v1","date":1724252457000,"content":"Study assessed the wind potential of three sites in Chad: Koro Toro, Salal and Nedeley. Analysis of the Weibull distribution curves reveals marked seasonal variability in wind speed, concentrated around the mean. Three models of high-power wind turbines were analyzed. At Koro Toro, the Siemens Gamesa SG 14-222 DD has a capacity factor of between 0.52 and 0.682, allowing a daily flow of pumped water of between 1.4 and 6.1 million m³. The Enercon E-126 EP4 performs slightly less well. At Salal, the Siemens Gamesa has a capacity factor of between 0.4463 and 0.6605, with a water flow rate of between 0.9 and 3.7 million m³/day. The Vestas V164-10.0 MW has a higher capacity factor (0.6327 to 0.8115) but a lower water flow rate (0.5 to 1.9 million m³/day). Enercon's performance is comparable to that of Siemens Gamesa. The Nedeley study reveals favorable conditions, with seasonal variations in wind speed and capacity factor indicating good wind potential, and maximum daily water flows of between 3 and 6 million m³. Analysis of the wind roses shows interesting potential in these towns, with a dominant east-north-easterly wind at maximum frequencies of 40%. The absence of calm winds is promising, although Nedeley and Salal have a residual presence. This study shows that the sites offer good wind potential This, enabling the production of electricity and heat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8ec01d020573e00645a833b675382302ae846ffdf7f235511e62a9d003f059e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
