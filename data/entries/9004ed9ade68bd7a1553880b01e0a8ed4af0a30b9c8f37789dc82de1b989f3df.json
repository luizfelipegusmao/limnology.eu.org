{"title":"Development of an epilepsy self-management mobile health app framework: Content validity study results","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302844","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Mohsen Zaied Alzamanan, Kheng-Seang Lim, Maizatul Akmar Ismail, Norjihan Abdul Ghani</p>\r\nBackground <p>Mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) show promise in supporting epilepsy self-management (eSM). To delve deeper into this potential, we conducted a systematic review of epilepsy mHealth apps available on both iOS and Android platforms, examining articles related to eSM. This review allowed us to identify important domains related to eSM. Furthermore, based on the findings, we developed an epilepsy mHealth app framework that aims to improve self-management for the local population. This study aims to assess the practicality and usability of the proposed mHealth app framework designed to improve eSM. We will conduct an expert panel review to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the framework.</p> Material and methods <p>Content validity was assessed by an expert panel comprising epileptologists and pharmacists. The validation process involved scoring the items within each domain of the framework to evaluate their practicality and usability (quantitative component). In addition, a panel discussion was conducted to further explore and discuss the qualitative aspects of the items.</p> Results <p>A total of 4 domains with 15 items were highly rated for their practicality and usefulness in eSM.</p> Conclusions <p>The locally validated framework will be useful for developing eSM mobile apps. Seizure Tracking, Medication Adherence, Treatment Management, and Healthcare Communication emerged as the most crucial domains for enhancing eSM.</p>","author":"Mohsen Zaied Alzamanan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9004ed9ade68bd7a1553880b01e0a8ed4af0a30b9c8f37789dc82de1b989f3df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
