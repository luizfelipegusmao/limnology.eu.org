It’s no one-trick pony, either—USB-C handles data transfer, video output and power input. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll find Type C on the old 12in MacBook, and faster variants of it (called Thunderbolt 3 or 4) on the MacBook Pro (post-2016 models), MacBook Air (post-2018), the iMac (after 2017) and Mac mini (2018 and later).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt 3 and 4 Macs can use USB-C accessories, but may lose some of their extra bandwidth—Thunderbolt’s 40Gbps significantly outpaces USB-C’s 5-10Gbps. USB4, like Thunderbolt, boasts 40Gbps bandwidth, although note that there is also a 20Gbps version to look out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an Apple user perspective, Thunderbolt 3 and 4 are very similar. Both have 40Gbps bandwidth but TB4 has a few extra benefits; find out more in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675887/thunderbolt-4-vs-thunderbolt-3-vs-usb-4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbolt 4 vs Thunderbolt 3 comparison.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need super-fast data transfer, read our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/test-centre/accessories/best-thunderbolt-4-usb4-hubs-docks-3809388/\" target=\"_blank\">best Thunderbolt 4 hubs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Apple’s Lightning connector and Thunderbolt, USB-C doesn’t have to be plugged in at a certain orientation, which means that you can wave bye-bye to the age-old USB guessing game of “Which way does it go in?”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few people have a full range of USB-C or Thunderbolt gear, so you’ll likely need a USB-C hub to add different ports—such as old-school USB-A—to your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, an “adapter” works with a single port (such as USB-A or Ethernet) while a “hub” gives you multiple ports. If you require even more, then look for a “dock” or “docking station”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re after a full desktop setup for your MacBook, look out for our recommendations for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668894/best-thunderbolt-3-4-and-usb-c-docking-stations-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html\" target=\"_blank\">best USB-C and Thunderbolt docking stations for MacBooks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has a range of adapters, too, but at a (high) price. We have tested them here, but other gadget makers offer more budget-friendly alternatives, along with a range of other USB-C cables, chargers and accessories–and we present the best ones below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we have tested and reviewed the premium USB-C hubs and adapters. There are many much cheaper versions out there, but we recommend these for quality and robustness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which extra ports do you need</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many MacBook users connect their laptop to one or more external displays for greater screen space. You can connect to monitors via a USB-C (via adapters to non-USB-C monitors) or better a dedicated video port, such as <strong>HDMI</strong> or <strong>DisplayPort</strong>. Check the hub specs to see which displays they support: some are limited to HD displays, others support 4K (also known as UHD) displays. The refresh rate is also important. 4K at 30Hz is fine for most productivity and browsing tasks, but watching video or playing games demands higher refresh rates of at least 60Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll likely need some old non-reversible <strong>USB-A ports</strong>, and most adapters and hubs have at least one for your non-USB-C memory sticks and drives. Look for at least USB 3.0, which has a speedy bandwidth of 5Gbps compared to the sluggish USB 2.0’s 480Mbps. if you want to use these older USB slots for charging your phone, look out for chargers that include Quick Charge 3.0 (35W) or BC 1.2 (7.5W) ports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your smartphone is compatible, you can charge your phone up to 80% in just 35 minutes. To fast-charge an iPhone, you need a minimum of 18W and <strong>USB-C</strong>, so look for extra USB-C slots, which are more capable than USB-A.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ports to look for include <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> for faster wired Internet access (without the flakiness of Wi-Fi), and an <strong>SD</strong> or <strong>microSD card reader</strong> for adding inexpensive portable storage to your system. Card readers come at different speeds: UHS-I at 104Mbps, and UHS-II at 312Mbps; although some are slower at 60Mbps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for hubs that offer <strong>passthrough charging</strong>, so you can charge your laptop even though you are using up one of the laptop’s USB-C ports for the hub itself. Most don’t ship with a charger, so you’ll need to add your own, and remember that it needs to be a 100W charger to give 85W and above charging if offered by the hub. Lower wattage chargers are fine but will limit the hub’s charging potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <strong>Power Delivery (PD)</strong> charging power each hub or adapter offers connected laptops or iPads. 12in MacBook and MacBook Air charge at 30W; the 13in and 14in MacBook Pro at 67W, the 15in MacBook Pro at 87W; and the 16in MacBook Pro at 96W. You can certainly use a charger at lower power, but remember that it will power up slower than when using a higher-wattage charger, and if too low your laptop might run out of juice altogether when maxed out on power-hungry apps and devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also buy USB-C adapters for the many display standards out there, such as <strong>VGA</strong> and <strong>DVI</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the products tested here work with non-Apple USB-C laptops too, but you can read Tech Advisor’s more general roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/test-centre/pc-peripheral/usb-c-hubs-3683402/\" target=\"_blank\">best USB-C hubs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many hubs and docks aren’t compatible with Apple’s SuperDrive CD/DVD drive. We’ve found only one USB-C dock that is compatible with the SuperDrive, the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/review/caldigit-usb-c-pro-dock-review-3789778/\" target=\"_blank\">Caldigit USB-C Pro Dock</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnker 555 PowerExpand 8-in-1 USB-C Hub – Best overall USB-C hub\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Anker 555 PowerExpand 8-in-1 USB-C Hub - Best overall USB-C hub\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3601459/anker_usb-c_hub.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t8 ports inc Ethernet, 60Hz 4K display via HDMI\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t10Gbps USB-C and USB-A\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t85W PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCan get warm during use\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUHS-I SD reader\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$79.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087QZVQJX?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$59.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fcollections%2Fhubs%2Fproducts%2Fa8383%3Fvariant%3D37438604968086&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-668462-6-664549-15070\" target=\"_blank\">$79.99 at  Anker</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Anker-8-in-1-USB-C-Hub-Adapter-with-100W-Power-Delivery-4K-60Hz-HDMI-Ethernet-Port-SD-Card-Reader/292038111&amp;subid1=1-1-668462-6-664549-15070\" target=\"_blank\">$79.99 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Anker PowerExpand 8-in-1 USB-C Hub is compact and powerful, offering greater specs than some of the other leading options on this list.</p>\n\n<p>It offers two USB-C ports—one that supports 85W USB-C Power Delivery, while another supports data transfers up to 10Gbps. You also get speedy 10Gbps transfer rates through two additional USB-A ports, where many rivals max out at 5Gbps. </p>\n\n<p>The Anker PowerExpand is special as it offers an HDMI port that supports 4K 60Hz resolutions, where most are limited to 4K 30Hz. For 4K 60Hz resolution, your device must support DP 1.4. This includes MacBook Air (from 2020), MacBook Pro 15in (from 2018), MacBook Pro 16in (from 2019) and iPad Pro (from 2018).</p>\n\n<p>Also included are an SD card reader (that can support a microSD card with an adapter). This is rated at UHS-I (104MBps) so not the fastest but speedier than some other hubs tested here offer.</p>\n\n<p>The Gigabit Ethernet port is great for those times when Wi-Fi just won’t do.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also incredibly light at just under 130g and compact so you can take it anywhere. At $79.99/£79.99 it’s hard to deny this hub’s value for money.

The hub receives 40Gbps from each of the Thunderbolt ports on the Mac (so a total of 80Gbps). 40Gbps is used for the USB4 pass-through port, while the second Thunderbolt port distributes 40Gbps of bandwidth to the rest of the ports on the hub.</p>\n\n<p>The USB4 port supports up to 96W charging—easily fine for a 14-inch MacBook Pro and punchy enough to keep a 16-inch Pro going and charged pretty quickly. This same USB4 port can be used to connect to an external display—up to 6K at 60Hz display output, transferring data at 40Gbps.</p>\n\n<p>It should allow video output and passthrough charging simultaneously. In a test connection from a MacBook to an LG 4K UltraFine Display, the MacBook was able to output video to the monitor, while the monitor was able to provide power to the MacBook, all through the single connection. Owners of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and M2 Air can charge via the MagSafe connector at the same time as using the Pro Hub.</p>\n\n<p>The HDMI 2.0 port can also be used to connect a 4K 60Hz display, so you can achieve a dual 4K monitor setup on any Pro or Max M1 or M2 MacBook. Plain M1/M2 MacBook Airs are limited to just one external display.</p>\n\n<p>Also onboard are a 5Gbps USB-A port and a 5Gbps USB-C port—although neither can charge connected devices. There are both SD and MicroSD card readers (UHS-I), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and 3.5mm combo audio jack port.</p>\n\n<p>In the same family, Satechi also offers the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Type-C-Mini-Adapter-USB/dp/B09P1FSV9Z?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Hub Mini</a></strong> (the same as the Max but without the HDMI port) and the <strong><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://satechi.net/products/pro-hub-slim?variant=40199509835864&amp;xcust=1-1-668462-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Hub Slim</a></strong> (which swaps the Ethernet port for an extra USB-A port, and boasts 10GBps USB-A and USB-C ports compared to the Mac and Mini’s 5Gbps).

The audio jack port is also covered but replicated on the hub.</p>\n\n<p>The 40Gbps USB-C port can be used to connect a display up to 6K at 60Hz, or offer passthrough charging at up to 100W—15W for phones and other devices.</p>\n\n<p>Its closest rival is the Satechi Pro Hub Mini (reviewed above), which features an extra USB-C port (5Gbps) but is more expensive, so this hub wins our budget 40Gbps hub award.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwelve South StayGo – Best portable USB-C dock\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Twelve South StayGo - Best portable USB-C dock\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3601459/twelve-south_staygo-usb-c-dock.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLightweight\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t8 ports inc Ethernet, 4K display via HDMI\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t85W passthrough PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t4K display at 30Hz\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$99.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TJH4S7X?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$75.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/staygo-usb-c-hub&amp;xcust=1-1-668462-6-663066-13431&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$99.99 at  Twelve South</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The StayGo is, as its name suggests, one for the home, office and on your travels.

The smarter M1/M2/M3 Pro and Max chips do support multiple displays.</p>\n\n<p>If that is a problem for you there is a hardware solution in the Hyperdrive Dual 4K HDMI 10-in-1 USB-C Hub, which lets non-Pro/Max Macs connect two external displays. There is some light software installation involved for M1/M2/M3 users, and you need to allow InstantView access to your Privacy settings in System Preferences.

This six-port hub from Satechi boasts a 2.5Gbps (2.5GbE) Ethernet port—2.5x faster than regular Gigabit Ethernet. 2.5GbE development is becoming more commonplace now that WiFi 6 enables wireless connection to over 1GbE LAN, and you can find 2.5G ports on some WiFi 6 routers. Current CAT5e Ethernet cables are compatible so there’s no need for rewiring.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from this super-fast Ethernet this hub boasts 4K at 60Hz HDMI, 10Gbps USB-A and two 10Gbps USB-C ports (one with 100W passthrough charging) and a combo 3.5mm audio jack.

These ports are also all hidden away at the back, which can mean snaking cables all over your desk.</p>\n\n<p>Five of the ports on this hub that clamps to the underside of the iMac are front-facing ports for easy access to memory cards, USB storage, or storage cards.
