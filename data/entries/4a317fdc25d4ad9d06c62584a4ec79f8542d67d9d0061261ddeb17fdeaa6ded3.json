{"title":"Optimization of Process Parameters of Friction Stir Welded Dissimilar Aluminium Alloys (AA6061 and AA8011) Using Response Surface Methodology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0895/v1","date":1710485509000,"content":"Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state welding process for joining metallic alloys and dissimilar metals. It has emerged as an alternative technology for welding high strength alloys that are difficult to join with conventional techniques. FSW is used to produce products with better mechanical properties. Now a days aluminum alloys have been widely used in several industrial applications such as aerospace, marine, automobile and commercial applications due to their light weight structure, better mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance.In this work, three welding parameters such as spindle speed, welding speed and plunge depth were considered for friction stir welding. FSW was carried out between dissimilar aluminum alloy plates (AA6061 and AA 8011) to produce butt joint.A Box-Behnken design with three factors and three levels was chosen to minimize the number of experimental conditions .The tensile strength and hardness of the welded regions were evaluated. The optimum level settings and the major parameters that influence the joint strength were obtained by Box-Behnken design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a317fdc25d4ad9d06c62584a4ec79f8542d67d9d0061261ddeb17fdeaa6ded3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
