{"title":"442 Effects of added 25(OH)D3 with varying standardized total tract digestible phosphorus levels on nursery pig performance, bone and urine characteristics, and serum vitamin D","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/258/7757382?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pigs [n = 360; DNA 600×241; initial body weight (BW) = 5.8 ± 0.54 kg] were used in a 45-d study to evaluate effects of added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> with three levels of standardized total tract digestible (STTD) P on nursery pig growth performance, bone and urine characteristics, and serum vitamin D status. Pigs were weaned at approximately 19 d of age and randomly allotted to 6 treatments with 5 pigs/pen and 12 replications/treatment. Dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> (0 or 50 µg/kg equivalent to 2,000 IU/kg of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>; Hy-D, dsm-firmenich, Plainsboro, NJ) and STTD P (70, 100, or 130% of the NRC (2012) requirement on a dietary percentage basis). Diets were corn-soybean meal-based and fed in 3 phases. On d 45, 1 pig/pen was euthanized to collect right fibula, metacarpal, and 2nd and 10th ribs. Overall, increasing STTD P increased (quadratic, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.003) BW, ADG, ADFI, and G/F with minimal improvement above 100% of NRC STTD P requirement. Added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> had no effect on growth performance (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). Pigs fed increasing STTD P had decreased urinary Ca concentration (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001 and quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.078) and increased urinary P concentration (quadratic, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), with all pigs fed 70% of NRC STTD P requirement having non-detectable levels of urinary P. Added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> had no effect on urinary Ca and P concentration (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). A quadratic 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>×STTD P interaction (<span>P</span> = 0.032) was observed for serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. When pigs were fed 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> increased as STTD P increased (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.005) but no differences were observed when no 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> was added and STTD P increased. A quadratic 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>×STTD P interaction was observed for serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> concentrations (<span>P</span> = 0.002). When pigs were fed 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> decreased (quadratic, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) as STTD P increased but the decrease was not significant when no 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> was fed. Added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> had no effect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) on serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, but concentrations decreased (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.001) as STTD P increased. No added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>×STTD P interaction was observed for 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3.</sub> Serum 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) with added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. Metacarpal bone density increased (linear, <span>P</span> = 0.001) as STTD P increased, as did fibulas and ribs (quadratic, <span>P</span> ≤ 0.055). Percentage bone ash and bone ash weight increased (quadratic, <span>P</span> ≤ 0.065) for all bones as STTD P increased. Added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> had no effect on bone density or bone ash weight for any bones (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10); however, the reduction in bone ash observed with reducing STTD P level tended to be less when 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> was provided (linear interaction, <span>P</span> = 0.098). In summary, added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> had limited effect on growth performance, urine parameters, or bone characteristics; however, added 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> increased serum concentrations of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Increasing STTD P to 100% of NRC requirement estimate increased growth and 130% of NRC maximized bone ash.5634 Abstract Table.pdf</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"9b81421347509dd70e107e5872bf59a7eef356e1f2232b4bc69f4bf35f1e1f5d","category":"Environment"}
