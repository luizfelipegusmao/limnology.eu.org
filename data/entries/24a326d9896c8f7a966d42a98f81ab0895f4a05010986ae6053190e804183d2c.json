{"title":"Validation of OLCI Sentinel-3 water products in the Baltic Sea and evaluating the effect of System Vicarious Calibration (SVC)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0734/v1","date":1723454732000,"content":"The monitoring of coastal waters using satellite data, from sensors including Sentinel-3 OLCI, has become a vital tool in the management of these water environments; especially when it comes to improving our understanding of the effects of climate change on these regions. In this study, Level-2 water products derived from different OLCI Sentinel-3 processors were validated against a comprehensive in situ dataset from the NW Baltic Sea proper region. The products validated were those of the regionally adapted Case-2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) OLCI processor (v1.0 and v2.1), as well as the latest standard Level-2 OLCI case 2 (Neural Network) products from Sentinel-3’s processing baseline: Baseline Collection 003 (BC003), including “CHL_NN”, “TSM_NN”, and “ADG443_NN”. Furthermore, the effect of the current EUMETSAT system vicarious calibration (SVC) on the Level-2 water products was also validated. Results showed that the system vicarious calibration (SVC) reduces the reliability of the Level-2 OLCI products. For example, the application of these SVC gains to the OLCI data for the regionally adapted v2.1 C2RCC products resulted in RMSD increases of 36% for “conc_tsm”; 118% for “conc_chl”; 33% for “iop_agelb”; 50% for “iop_adg”; and 10% for “kd_z90max” using a ±3h validation window. The findings indicate that the current EUMETSAT SVC gains should be applied and interpreted with caution in the region of study at present. A key outcome of the paper recommends the development of a regionally specific SVC against AERONET-OC data for the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24a326d9896c8f7a966d42a98f81ab0895f4a05010986ae6053190e804183d2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
