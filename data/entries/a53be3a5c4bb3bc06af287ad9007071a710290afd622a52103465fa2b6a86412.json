{"title":"Probing Biological Nitrogen Fixation in Legumes Using Raman Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0765/v1","date":1718186318000,"content":"Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by symbiotic bacteria plays a vital role in sustainable agriculture. However, current quantification methods are often expensive and impractical. This study explores the potential of Raman spectroscopy, a non-invasive technique, for rapid assessment of BNF activity in soybeans. Raman spectra were obtained from soybean plants grown with and without rhizobia bacteria to identify spectral signatures associated with BNF. Î´N15 isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) was used to determine actual BNF percentages. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was employed to develop a model for BNF quantification based on Raman spectra. The model explained 80% of the variation in BNF activity. To enhance the model's specificity for BNF detection regardless of nitrogen availability, a subsequent elastic net (Enet) regularization strategy was implemented. This approach provided insights into key wavenumbers and biochemicals associated with BNF in soybeans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a53be3a5c4bb3bc06af287ad9007071a710290afd622a52103465fa2b6a86412","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
