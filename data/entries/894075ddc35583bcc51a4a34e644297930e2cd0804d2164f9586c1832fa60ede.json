{"title":"CLAVATA signaling in plant–environment interactions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1336/7335663?rss=1","date":1698796800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants must rapidly and dynamically adapt to changes in their environment. Upon sensing environmental signals, plants convert them into cellular signals, which elicit physiological or developmental changes that allow them to respond to various abiotic and biotic cues. Because plants can be simultaneously exposed to multiple environmental cues, signal integration between plant cells, tissues, and organs is necessary to induce specific responses. Recently, CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptides and their cognate CLAVATA-type receptors received increased attention for their roles in plant–environment interactions. CLE peptides are mobile signaling molecules, many of which are induced by a variety of biotic and abiotic stimuli. Secreted CLE peptides are perceived by receptor complexes on the surface of their target cells, which often include the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase CLAVATA1. Receptor activation then results in cell-type and/or environment-specific responses. This review summarizes our current understanding of the diverse roles of environment-regulated CLE peptides in modulating plant responses to environmental cues. We highlight how CLE signals regulate plant physiology by fine-tuning plant–microbe interactions, nutrient homeostasis, and carbon allocation. Finally, we describe the role of CLAVATA receptors in the perception of environment-induced CLE signals and discuss how diverse CLE-CLAVATA signaling modules may integrate environmental signals with plant physiology and development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"894075ddc35583bcc51a4a34e644297930e2cd0804d2164f9586c1832fa60ede","category":"Environment"}
