{"title":"Development of Multi-part Field-Shapers for Magnetic-Pulse Welding Using Nanostructured Cu-Nb Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1582/v1","date":1711443947000,"content":"Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) employs high pulsed magnetic field to accelerate parts against each other thus forming an impact joining. Single-turn tool coils and field-shapers (FS) used in MPW operate under the most demanding conditions: a magnetic field of 40-50 T with a period of tens of microseconds. For conventional copper and bronze coils intense thermo-mechanical stresses lead to rapid degradation of the working bore. This work is aimed to improve the efficiency of field-shapers and focused on development of 2- and 4-slit FS with nanocomposite Cu 18Nb wire brazed as FS inner current-carrying layer. The measured ratio of magnetic field to discharge current was 56.3 and 50.6 T/MA for 2- and 4-slit FS respectively. FEM calculations of magnetic field generation showed its 6-9% and 3% variation for 2- and 4-slit FS respectively. The results of copper tube compression have shown an ovality of 27% and 7% for 2- and 4-slit FS respectively. The measured deviation of weld joining length was 11% and 1.4% in 2- and 4-slit FS respectively. Compared to the previous experiments on the whole steel inductor, the novel FS showed significantly better results in terms of efficiency and homogeneity of the magnetic field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5eb508dd52b68f495419781a2a817d920b31478593bf5092a693deeb026a9377","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
