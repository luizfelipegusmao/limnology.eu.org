{"title":"Species delimitation and taxonomic revision of the Ptilagrostis dichotoma species complex (Poaceae) based on statistical morphological variations","link":"https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/206/1/69/7636415?rss=1","date":1711497600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Statistical morphological variations at the population level serve as a robust foundation for species delimitation and taxonomic treatment. We employed this approach to investigate species delimitation within the <span>Ptilagrostis dichotoma</span> species complex (Poaceae), which is characterized by open panicles. While three species have been described, the boundaries between these species and the morphological distributions of all taxonomic traits remain unclear. In this study, we examined the geographical variability of 19 morphological traits based on at least six individuals from each of the 28 populations across the entire distributional range of the species complex. Our statistical analyses identified five distinct phenotypic clusters with specific geographical preferences. Three of these clusters corresponded to the previously described species, while the remaining two clusters represented previously undescribed species. Furthermore, our findings highlight several traits, such as basal leaf scabrosity, panicle branch pulvinae, and glume length, which exhibit distinct gaps between phenotypic units and prove highly valuable for species delimitation. Finally, two new species are described and a key is provided to differentiate the five species. This morphological revision establishes a basis for future studies on species boundaries and divergences of the complex based on other evidence.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"84b5fa2619594e061395c38d918de42c13a5b0cd8ac0441f237084e35d0e4410","entryHash":"3f16f4f50b1d695dedbfda9c6c50fdcaa37fdac957107f29e8fa4adac8329833","category":"Environment"}
