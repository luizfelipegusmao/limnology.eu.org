Coopmans, Anna Mai, Andrea E. Martin</p>\r\n\r\nNegation is key for cognition but has no physical basis, raising questions about its neural origins. A new study in PLOS Biology on the negation of scalar adjectives shows that negation acts in part by altering the response to the adjective it negates.\r\n\r\nAll languages make use of negation, but the neural bases of our cognitive ability to process negation remain unknown. This Primer explores a new PLOS Biology study which shows that humans first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning.","author":"Cas W.
