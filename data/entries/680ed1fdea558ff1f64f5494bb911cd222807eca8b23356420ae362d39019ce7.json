{"title":"An In Vitro Assay to Measure Astrocyte-Dependent Synaptic Phagocytosis in Health and Major Depressive Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1311/v1","date":1726563197000,"content":"Immunofluorescent methods in vitro have been widely used to characterize the distribution and extent of colocalization of molecules located in various intracellular compartments. These are key processes to better understand the role of those molecules in physiological and pathological conditions.In the brain, interactions of astrocytes with neurons are fundamental for the establishment and proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Among these, the phagocytosis of synapses that need to be removed is a process known as synaptic pruning. When this process is dysregulated, it might lead to the development of several brain disorders. Here, we describe the adaptation of a method to characterize the astrocyte-mediated synaptic phagocytosis and evaluate astrocytic (dys)functions in healthy cells and cells derived from an animal model of major depressive disorder (MDD).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"680ed1fdea558ff1f64f5494bb911cd222807eca8b23356420ae362d39019ce7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
