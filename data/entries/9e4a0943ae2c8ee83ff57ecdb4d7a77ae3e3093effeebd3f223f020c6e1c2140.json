{"title":"Dicing DICER-LIKE2 roles: Identification of siRNA-independent DICER-LIKE2 functions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2061/7627155?rss=1","date":1710201600000,"content":"<span>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play key roles in eukaryotic cells, such as repressing transposons and viruses, as well as controlling gene expression. siRNA biogenesis involves DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins, a family of type III RNAses, composed of 4 members in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Each DCL produces a specific kind of small RNA by processing double-strand RNAs (dsRNAs) (<a href=\"#koae078-B1\">Margis et al. 2006</a>). DCL2 produces 22 nucleotide-long siRNAs, unlike other DCLs that produce 21-nt (DCL1 and DCL4) or 24-nt (DCL3) small RNAs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9e4a0943ae2c8ee83ff57ecdb4d7a77ae3e3093effeebd3f223f020c6e1c2140","category":"Environment"}
