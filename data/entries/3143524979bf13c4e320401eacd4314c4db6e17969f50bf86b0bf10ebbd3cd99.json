{"title":"Experimental Visualization Study of Two-Phase Flow Dynamics in Closed-Loop Pulsating Heat Pipes Using Fe3O4/Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0146/v1","date":1719919778000,"content":"This article discusses a focused study on visualizing the flow patterns in a two-phase pulsating heat pipe (PHP) using Fe3O4/water as the working fluid at 3 V/V% concentration. The research also aims to meticulously examine phase change phenomena in the heating section, particularly focusing on bubble formation and expansion processes. A high-speed video camera was utilized to capture dynamic insights into the behavior of the Fe3O4/water mixture. Based on the findings, a straightforward model was developed to explain bubble generation and growth in the mixture, serving as a useful reference for future PHP designs and optimizations. Visual observations also noted the stable nature of the Fe3O4/water nanofluid over a four-day period, confirming its consistency throughout the experiments. Moreover, the impact of heat load variation on the evaporator section was assessed using controlled heat inputs ranging from 10 to 80 Watts. Observations on the arrangement of slugs and plugs at a 50% filling ratio revealed interesting self-adjusting flow patterns in response to increasing heat inputs, providing valuable insights into PHP operational dynamics. Notably, the oscillatory flow behavior of Fe3O4/water, the chosen working fluid, exhibited greater activity in comparison to water. This distinctive flow behavior contributed to achieving heightened thermal performance efficiency for the Fe3O4/water system, attributed to its faster attainment of the annular flow condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3143524979bf13c4e320401eacd4314c4db6e17969f50bf86b0bf10ebbd3cd99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
