{"title":"Plasma Biochemistry, Intestinal Health and Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Why Laying Hens Producing Translucent Eggs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1832/v1","date":1721750037000,"content":"Producing translucent eggs has been found to reduce the quality and safety of the eggs produced., as well as the demand from consumers. However, the intestinal function and the molecular mechanism for the production of translucent eggs remain uncertain. A total of 120 eggs were allocated into two groups, one for the translucent egg group (group T) and one for the normal group (group C), according to the degree of eggshell translucence. Translucent eggs showed thicker eggshell and lower egg yolk color. We also detected the plasma biochemical index, intestinal morphology and structure, enzyme activity, and antioxidant capacity of the hens’ producing translucent eggs and normal eggs. The results showed that the ratio of duodenal villus length to crypt depth, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, chymotrypsin, total ATPase (T-ATPase), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were decreased in the hens produced translucent eggs (P &amp;lt; 0.05), but malondialdehyde (MDA) content was increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05); jejunal lipase activity, Na+K+-ATPase activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), GSH-Px activities were decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in group T; ileal amylase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase activities were also decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in group T. In addition, we identified a total of 471 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in duodenal tissue, with 327 up-regulated genes and 144 down-regulated genes (|log2FC| ≥ 1 and P &amp;lt; 0.05). Enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes, such as GSTT1, GSTO2, GSTA3, were mostly enriched in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The results of our study indicate that plasma lipid metabolism disorder, decreased intestinal antioxidant capacity, and altered intestinal metabolism capabilities may influence the formation of translucent eggs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1842d09057f9ecb60010a858f819b4d5106717832bec05ccd77baa84a9cac700","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
