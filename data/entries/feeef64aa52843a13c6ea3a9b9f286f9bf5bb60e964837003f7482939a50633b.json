This abundant phenolic compound exhibits significant antioxidant capacity and a broad spectrum of therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, antidiabetic, cardiovascular and neuroprotective activities. It is absorbed more quickly by the body and stays in the bloodstream for a longer period compared with other phenolic acids. It is widely used in the food (namely whole grains, fruits, vegetables and coffee), pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. The current review highlights ferulic acid and its pharmacological activities, reported mechanisms of action, food applications (food preservative, food additive, food processing, food supplements and in food packaging in the form of edible films) and role in human health. In the future, the demand for ferulic acid in the food and pharmaceutical industries will increase. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mukul Kumar, \nDeepika Kaushik, \nShubham Shubham, \nAshwani Kumar, \nVishal Kumar, \nEmel Oz, \nCharles Brennan, \nMaomao Zeng, \nCharalampos Proestos, \nKenan Çadırcı, \nMuharrem Bayrak, \nTahra Elobeid, \nSercan Karav, \nFatih Oz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"feeef64aa52843a13c6ea3a9b9f286f9bf5bb60e964837003f7482939a50633b","category":"Environment"}
