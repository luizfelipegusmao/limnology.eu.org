{"title":"The Effect of Ambient Illumination and Text Color on Visual Fatigue Under Negative Polarity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1073/v1","date":1713346004000,"content":"This study investigates the effects of ambient illumination and negatively polarized text color on visual fatigue, exploring the issue of visual fatigue when using visual display terminals in low-illumination environments. The research methodology utilized an experimental design to collect data on changes in pupil accommodation and blink rate through an eye tracker. Partici-pants completed a reading task while exposed to various text colors and ambient light conditions to evaluate visual fatigue and cognitive performance. The study's findings suggest that text color significantly affects visual fatigue, with red text causing the highest level of visual fatigue and yellow text causing the lowest level of visual fatigue. Improvements in ambient lighting reduce visual fatigue, but the degree of improvement varies depending on the text color. Additionally, cognitive performance is better when using yellow and white text but worse when using red text. Yellow text is the most effective choice for reducing visual fatigue under negative polarity. In-creasing ambient lighting can also improve visual fatigue in low-illumination conditions. These findings will offer valuable guidance for designing visual terminal device interfaces, especially for low-illumination or night environments, to minimize visual fatigue and improve the user ex-perience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55b1e62059f7486df0443c63ded43445f87fcd642d304e77d11e5244003bfcbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
