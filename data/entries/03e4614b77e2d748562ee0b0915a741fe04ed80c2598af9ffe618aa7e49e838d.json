Aquatic macroinvertebrates deploy resistance and resilience strategies to cope with flow intermittency, crucial in rivers with long-term seasonal dry episodes. Less is known, about how these strategies support community persistence in streams that only recently have experienced drying, and where local assemblages lack such adaptations. Our study conducted two four-season campaigns, separated by a one-year break, to assess macroinvertebrate responses in newly drying intermittent streams by comparing intermittent and perennial stream sections. We characterize communities from structural and functional perspectives, and then evaluate the response at the trait state level. We observed a decline in taxa richness and abundance, but not structural diversity, in response to flow intermittency. Resistance traits are more important than resilient traits in structuring macroinvertebrate communities in newly intermittent stream sections. Taxa in intermittent sections exhibit a smaller trait space, indicating lower functional redundancy. The macroinvertebrate response to intermittency lacks a predictable pattern, suggesting time-dependent and trait-state-specific colonization by adapted taxa and community assembly with resistance and resilience strategies. As river drought increases due to climate change, recognizing the temporal dimension becomes crucial for understanding ecological responses to intermittency.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"03e4614b77e2d748562ee0b0915a741fe04ed80c2598af9ffe618aa7e49e838d","category":"Environment"}
