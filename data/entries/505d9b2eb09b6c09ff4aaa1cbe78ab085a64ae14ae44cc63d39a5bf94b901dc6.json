{"title":"Effect of dietary β‐carotene supplementation on growth and antioxidant capability of female swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13073?af=R","date":1713161276000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dietary supplementation with synthetic β-carotene was investigated in this study to assess its impact on gonad development, antioxidant status, color parameters, and carotenoid composition in adult female swimming crab (<i>Portunus trituberculatus</i>). Four diets, designated as Diet 1 to 4, were formulated to contain 3.07, 53.78, 103.23, and 205.22 mg/kg dry diets of synthetic β-carotene. The findings revealed the following: (1) No significant differences in body weights or feed utilization were observed, indicating that β-carotene did not significantly enhance the growth of adult <i>P. trituberculatus</i>. (2) The inclusion of 50–100 mg/kg β-carotene in the diets led to improvements in antioxidant capacity indicators (T-AOC, MDA) and immune-related parameters (AKP, ACP) in both hepatopancreas and hemolymph. (3) Notably, the redness of ovaries and hepatopancreas increased significantly with higher dietary β-carotene supplementation for color enhancement. In conclusion, incorporating β-carotene into the diet enhanced the antioxidative capability, nonspecific immunity, and tissue carotenoid contents in adult female <i>P. trituberculatus</i>, and the optimal level of dietary synthetic β-carotene supplementation for adult female <i>P. trituberculatus</i> was suggested to be around 100 mg/kg.</p>","author":"Tianli Ma, \nJie He, \nXiaodong Jiang, \nQingsong Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"505d9b2eb09b6c09ff4aaa1cbe78ab085a64ae14ae44cc63d39a5bf94b901dc6","category":"Environment"}
