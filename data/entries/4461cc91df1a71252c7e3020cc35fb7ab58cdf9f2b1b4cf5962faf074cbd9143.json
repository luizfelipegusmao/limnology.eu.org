{"title":"Facile synthesis of Fe-doped ZIF-8 and its adsorption of phosphate from water: Performance and mechanism","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311239","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Zhijia Miao, Xueqiang Song, Xiaolei Wang, Hao Wang, Shuoyang Li, Zhen Jiao</p>\r\n\r\nTo remove phosphate from water, a novel Fe-doped ZIF-8 was synthesized as a superior adsorbent. The Fe-doped ZIF-8 was fully characterized using different characterization techniques and it was found that the as-prepared Fe-doped ZIF-8 (denoted as ZIF-(2Zn:1Fe)) showed a polyhedral morphology with a large specific surface area of 157.64 m<sup>2</sup>/g and an average pore size of 3.055 nm. Analyses using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction showed that Fe atoms were successfully incorporated into the ZIF-8 skeleton. Batch experiments demonstrated that the molar ratio of Fe and Zn has effects on phosphate adsorption. The adsorption kinetics conformed to a pseudo-second-order model with a high correlation coefficient (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9983). The adsorption isotherm matched the Langmuir model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9994) better than the Freundlich model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.7501), suggesting that the adsorption of phosphoric acid by ZIF-(2Zn:1Fe) can be classified as a chemisorption on a homogeneous surface. The adsorption amount was 38.60 mg/g. It was found that acidic environments favored the adsorption reaction and the best adsorption was achieved at an initial pH of 2. Inhibition of adsorption by common anions is NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>&gt; CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>&gt; SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>&gt; Cl<sup>-</sup>. Characterization results indicate that the main mechanism of adsorption is surface complexation interactions.","author":"Zhijia Miao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4461cc91df1a71252c7e3020cc35fb7ab58cdf9f2b1b4cf5962faf074cbd9143","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
