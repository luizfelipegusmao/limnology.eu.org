{"title":"Pre-Crop and Residue Management Effects on Photosynthesis Efficiency and Grain Yield of Dryland Wheat Genotypes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1071/v1","date":1723646364000,"content":"To evaluate dryland wheat genotypes' performance to different pre-crop and residue management under dryland conditions, a split-split plot experiment based on RCB design with three replications was conducted for two years (2017-2018 and 2018-2019). The site of study's long-term average precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity are 376 mm, 9 â—¦C, and 50%, respectively. Wheat-wheat and vetch-wheat cropping systems were considered in the main plots, different wheat and vetch residue levels including 0, 2, and 4 t ha-1 were located in subplots, and five dryland wheat genotypes including Sadra, Hashtroud, Baran, Varan, and Ohadi were allocated in sub-sub plots. Results indicated that leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI) and stomatal conductance (gs) were greater in the vetch-wheat cropping system compared to the wheat monoculture system for all genotypes. Normalized differences vegetative index (NDVI) of genotypes improved by applying the crop residue. Over two years, the application of crop residues resulted in higher variable fluorescence at J and I steps as well as an increase in the photosynthesis performance index (PI). Varan and Baran genotypes stood out as the superior genotype, exhibiting the highest values physiological characteristics and grain yield under the application of 4 t ha-1 of vetch residue. Grain filling rate (GFR) was reduced, while grain filling duration (GFD) was increased with increasing the crop residue levels. The enhanced grain yield of wheat genotypes grown under vetch residue attributed to the factors such as improvement in leave pigments and photosynthetic efficiency which facilitate longer grain filling duration with high grain weight. As a result, it is advisable to adopt a vetch-wheat cropping system with a high proportion of crop residue in dryland regions to achieve increased and sustainable wheat production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44a796214bbdbd76f537a09c6d29fd29926848cb30fc1671a4e1b03c53a506ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
