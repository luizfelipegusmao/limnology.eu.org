{"title":"Transcriptomic analysis reveals transcription factors implicated in radon-induced lung carcinogenesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae161/7808469?rss=1","date":1727913600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Radon, a potent carcinogen, is a significant catalyst for lung cancer development. However, the molecular mechanisms triggering radon-induced lung cancer remain elusive.<div>Methods</div>Utilizing a radon exposure concentration of 20,000 Bq/m3 for 20 min/session, malignant transformation was induced in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B).<div>Results</div>Radon-exposed cells derived from passage 25 (BEAS-2B-Rn) exhibited enhanced proliferation and increased colony formation. Analysis of differential gene expression (DEG) through transcription factors revealed 663 up-regulated and 894 down-regulated genes in radon-exposed cells. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed significant alterations in the malignant transformation pathway of cells, including those related to cancer and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. A PPI network analysis indicated a significant association of oncogenes, such as CCND1, KIT, and GATA3, with lung cancer among differentially expressed genes. In addition, the stability of the housekeeping gene was determined through RT-qPCR analysis, which also confirmed the results of transcriptome analysis.<div>Conclusions</div>The results suggest that transcription factors may play a pivotal role in conferring a survival advantage to radon-exposed cells. This is achieved by malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells into lung carcinogenesis cell phenotypes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"539ac2c5c7e2b1ceb327a525dd42415039766c2587fb30396f5f2f3d77c0c1dc","category":"Environment"}
