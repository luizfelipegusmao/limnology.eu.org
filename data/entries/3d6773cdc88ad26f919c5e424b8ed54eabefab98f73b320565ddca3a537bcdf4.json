{"title":"Recombinant Live-Attenuated Salmonella Vaccine for Veterinary Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1420/v1","date":1729232598000,"content":"Vaccination is essential in maintaining animal health, with a priority on safety and cost-effectiveness in veterinary vaccines. The development of recombinant live-attenuated Salmonella vaccines (RASVs) has enabled the construction of balanced lethal systems, ensuring the stability of plasmid vectors encoding protective antigens post-immunization. These vaccines are particularly suitable for production animals, providing long-term immunity against a range of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. This review summarizes the progress made in this field, with a focus on clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy and commercial potential of RASVs in veterinary medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d6773cdc88ad26f919c5e424b8ed54eabefab98f73b320565ddca3a537bcdf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
