{"title":"Promoting carotenoid biosynthesis in the NUD(X23)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1588/7611685?rss=1","date":1708387200000,"content":"<span>Carotenoids are essential plant pigments, having roles in light harvesting, photoprotection, and antioxidant activity, among others. Carotenoid biosynthesis, or carotenogenesis, is a complex process facilitated by multiple proteins, starting with geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) and phytoene synthase (PSY) (see <a href=\"#koae057-F1\">Fig</a>.). GGPPS produces GGPP, a carotenoid precursor, and PSY catalyzes the condensation of 2 GGPP molecules to form phytoene, the first intermediate of carotenogenesis. In plants, the rate of carotenogenesis is limited mainly by PSY activity (<a href=\"#koae057-B6\">Zhou et al. 2022</a>), and, accordingly, PSY expression and activity are heavily regulated. Numerous transcription factors regulate <span>PSY</span> gene expression, while alternative splicing, protein-protein interactions, and other processes further modulate PSY activity (<a href=\"#koae057-B2\">Liang and Li 2023</a>). In Arabidopsis, one such protein-protein interaction is that of GGPPS11 with PSY, which promotes the channeling of GGPP to PSY (<a href=\"#koae057-B5\">Ruiz-Sola et al. 2016</a>). Interestingly, it was recently revealed that some members of the enzyme family NUcleoside Diphosphates linked to moiety-X hydrolases (NUDXs) can hydrolyze various metabolites, some of which are precursors of carotenoids, suggesting they may also influence carotenogenesis (<a href=\"#koae057-B1\">Henry et al. 2018</a>). However, the function of many NUDX family members and their potential roles in carotenogenesis remain unknown.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"b283a3ca473e28bf1b0f2265696c9798c7131ff738f037fe1894389586202908","category":"Environment"}
