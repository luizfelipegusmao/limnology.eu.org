{"title":"Lignin: An Adaptable Molecule","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2241/v1","date":1727674518000,"content":"Lignin is a complex organic polymer. It has a crucial role in providing structural support, rigidity, and defense against disintegration. Following cellulose, it ranks as the second most abundant natural polymer discovered on Earth. Lignin is composed of several phenolic compounds that form a complex, three-dimensional framework. Lignin, unlike cellulose, is a non-carbohydrate polymer rather than a polysaccharide. Lignin's characteristics pose both difficulties and prospects in several sectors, spanning from agriculture to renewable energy. The investigation of the composition of Lignin and its manipulation through engineering are closely intertwined. Disruptions of genes implicated in the lignin biosynthesis pathway can result in substantial alterations in the composition and architecture of Lignin. These modifications can offer novel approaches for altering Lignin and deliberately engineering the polymer to enhance its worth or simplify its extraction from cell wall polysaccharides. As a result, the definition of Lignin is constantly expanding and being adjusted to accommodate its diversity and adaptability. This review examines explicitly the versatility of the lignin molecule.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78a7eb8dd44110d544f5ebbf54a7f07b353be179ae6663090b033932aedc4a57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
