{"title":"Constant Current Galfenol Electrodeposition on an Optical Fiber with and Embedded FBG, for Optical-Magnetostrictive Sensor Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1777/v1","date":1714205624000,"content":"The aim of this research work is to get a method for Galfenol electrodeposition thought which we can control the desired percentage of Ga versus Fe that has the maximum magnetostriction constant. Galfenol is electrodeposited on an optical fiber with an imbedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) in its core. The final objective, that goes further of the scope of this research, is to get an optical magnetostrictive sensor. The device will sense magnetic field or current based on the combination of this magnetostrictive Galfenol, that will stress the optical fiber with the application of magnetic field or current and will change the reflected wavelength of the FBG as a consequence of the variation of the Bragg wavelength. We have developed a method of electrodeposition that allows controlling the density of current in the electrodeposition process in order to get the desired percentage of Ga and Fe in the alloy Ga X Fe 1-x. We have manufactured a set of samples with different parameters (as density of current and pH) and we have characterized these samples morphological, structural and magnetically. With this research we want to give to the scientific community the groundwork to design magnetostrictive optical sensors based on and FBG coated by giant magnetostrictive material. In this paper we have developed a method of covering the optical fiber controlling the composition of (Ga X Fe 1-X) in order to be able to get the maximum magnetostriction constant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"299263b2acdd0850c14e29d93ac5501346a017ae276a8fab5cc9904d9aba8a3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
