{"title":"Systematic Review of Biological, Chemical, Ergonomic, Physical, and Psychosocial Hazards Impacting Occupational Health of United States Forestry Workers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/2/159/7428704?rss=1","date":1700265600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Forestry is one of the most hazardous occupations, due in part to the biological, chemical, ergonomic, physical, and psychosocial aspects of the job. Here, we review health risks in forestry occupations, including those in professional and technical forestry, logging, and forestry support, from the standpoint of biological (e.g., insects/arachnids, plants), chemical (e.g., diesel exhaust), ergonomic (e.g., awkward postures, forceful motions), physical (temperature, noise, vibrations, radiation), and psychosocial (e.g., workplace factors that cause stress, strain, or interpersonal problems for the worker) issues. We conducted a systematic review over a 10-year period (2011–2021) to assess health hazards identified in studies conducted on these occupations and reveal knowledge gaps for future studies to address. This study focuses on occupational health rather than occupational safety. Other forestry worker occupational health and safety studies have focused on analyzing injuries and deaths directly relating to transportation and/or contact with objects such as trees or logs and equipment; however, the areas of occupational health highlighted here have been understudied. Future work should focus on these areas, with an emphasis on intervention strategies that eliminate or mitigate the deleterious health effects of occupational exposures.Study Implications: Forestry workers are exposed to occupational health hazards in their outdoor workplace. This review analyzes published work for a 10-year period (2011–2021) with broader implications such as (1) greater understanding of gaps in the literature for key occupational health hazards facing United States forestry workers and (2) better information on the need for more in-depth studies to collect information about exposure assessments to improve worker protection. This literature review can help forestry workers, managers, and scientists mitigate exposures and protect health.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"187d72bccb326aab58706234617306ac4127ebefbcd85e58cc9595e4bbd4937c","category":"Environment"}
