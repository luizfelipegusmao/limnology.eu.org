{"title":"Evaluating the Prognostic Potential of CA-125 and miRNA Levels in Endometriosis: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1261/v1","date":1713505708000,"content":"Abstract Objective: This study aims to examine CA-125 and miRNAs as biomarkers in endometriosis pathophysiology and their potential roles in clinical diagnostics and prognostics. Methods:We reviewed a variety of studies, including cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective designs, examining a broad spectrum of patient demographics, clinical features, and biomarker (CA-125 and miRNA) expression levels. Results: CA-125 has been reaffirmed as a valuable biomarker in diagnosing and monitoring endometriosis, with its utility enhanced when used alongside other markers. MiRNAs have emerged as promising molecular regulators, offering new avenues for non-invasive diagnostics and a deeper understanding of the disease's pathophysiology. The integration of these biomarkers presents a potential shift towards more personalized and effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.  Conclusion: Endometriosis presents a significant challenge in women's health, requiring innovative approaches for its management. The convergence of CA-125 and miRNA research represents a promising advance, potentially leading to more accurate diagnostics and personalized treatment. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies, expanding study cohorts, and integrating findings into clinical practice to fully harness the potential of these biomarkers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f758e7380446355b4a241aba7dc0947fc92b4be14a20802bfa1f7d069896c01c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
