This study investigated the long-term outcomes of ESD in high-risk ESCN patients. We retro-spectively included early ESCN patients treated with ESD at two medical centers in Taiwan be-tween August 2010 and December 2023. Demographic, endoscopic, and pathological data were collected. Among 146 patients (mean age 59.17 years) with 183 lesions, 73 (50%) had a history of head and neck cancer (HNC). En bloc and R0 resection were achieved in 100% and 95.6% of the lesions, respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and local recurrence rates were 42.7%, 94.7% and 11%. R0 resection was significantly associated with re-currence in univariate analysis (adjusted OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.05-0.99, P=0.05). Alcohol abstinence was independently associated with lower recurrence (adjusted OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.08-0.48, P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76b8c36128d1f1144b6ba933a8feacfeac8b4b6181d981d219f8794d8eb028f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
