{"title":"Which ring is the ring? Insights from a study on maize circRNAs under drought stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/16/7667262?rss=1","date":1715126400000,"content":"<span>Circular RNA (circRNA) is a form of single-stranded RNA that adopts a covalently closed loop structure, resembling a ring. Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs possess increased stability and longevity due to their resistance to common RNA-degrading enzymes, even though circRNAs exist at low abundances in most cases (<a href=\"#kiae265-B2\">Pisignano et al. 2023</a>). CircRNAs have been considered the result of splicing errors since they were first discovered in the 1970s (<a href=\"#kiae265-B4\">Xu and Zhang 2021</a>). As more and more circRNAs were found in animals and plants, it became clear that they arose due to nonsequential back-splicing of exons and occasionally introns (<a href=\"#kiae265-B6\">Zhao et al. 2019</a>). In the past decade, a handful of examples in mammals showed circRNAs can bind microRNAs, encode peptides, and bind to proteins as scaffolds, along with other functions (<a href=\"#kiae265-B1\">Kristensen et al. 2019</a>). Despite their prevalence, understanding their functionality has proven challenging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d07775b815de913feb512007e930dae7d97fc949c5ecabac4f68708116d6e330","category":"Environment"}
