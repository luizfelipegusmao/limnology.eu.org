{"title":"84 Efficacy of Livamol with BioWorma for controlling gastrointestinal nematode in nursing Kiko does raised in pastures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/29/7617976?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Prevalence of gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) has become a critical issue because of nematode resistance to anthelmintics available in the market. Livamol with BioWorma (hereafter BioWorma), a biological product containing spores of Duddingtonia flagrans, is known to trap GIN larvae and reduce the chance of re-infection in artificially-infested animals. However, the efficacy of this product is not known in pasture-raised nursing does acquiring natural challenges of GIN through contaminated pastures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of BioWorma for controlling GIN in pasture-raised nursing does. The study was conducted for 120 d (March-August 2023). Sixteen nursing Kiko Does and kids (n = 30) were divided into two uniform groups. Each group of animals was assigned to separate sets of grazing plots and rotationally stocked in those plots throughout the study. Animals had free access to clean drinking water, shelters, and mineral mix in each plot. BioWorma at the rate of 1g/d/kg of animal body weight (BW) was fed to one group of animals. BioWorma was mixed with 0.227 kg of whole corn before feeding. Another group (control) was provided with an equivalent amount of corn without BioWorma. Additionally, both groups were supplemented with whole corn at the rate of 0.5% BW. Animal performance data [BW, body condition score (BCS), and FAMACHA score] and fecal samples were taken on d 1, every week during the study, and the last day of the study. Fecal samples were analyzed to determine the egg per gram (EPG). Blood samples were taken on the first day of the study, then every month during the study, and on the last day of the study. Blood samples were analyzed in ProCyte Dx Analyzer for hematological parameters (RBC, hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, monocytes, basophil, and platelets) and in Catalyst Dx for biochemical parameters (glucose, creatine, blood urea nitrogen, Ca, P, Na, Cl, and other parameters). Animal performance and blood profile data were analyzed using the GLM procedure and EPG data using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test in SAS 9.4. Overall, the treatment group had less EPG (35%; P &lt; 0.05) than the control group. However, the consistent trend of BioWorma reducing EPG was not found when data were analyzed for each observation date. BioWorma had no significant impact on BW, FAMACHA score, BCS, and blood parameters. Results showed that BioWorma was able to reduce the overall GIN EPG in nursing Kiko does raised in pastures. Long-term research on the efficacy of BioWorma in controlling GIN in goats will reveal more useful information.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"735734996a172e55f89497b0f16b8ba9e112284245952251e0bb2bf0583009cb","category":"Environment"}
