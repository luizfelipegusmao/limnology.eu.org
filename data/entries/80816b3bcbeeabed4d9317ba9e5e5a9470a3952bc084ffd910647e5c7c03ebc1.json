{"title":"The Mathematization of Puzzles or Puzzling Mathematics Innovative Teaching of Mathematics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0609/v1","date":1725864201000,"content":"It is a fact, that  the varying definitions and perspectives on thinking among scientists, emphasizing the influence of theoretical foundations and practical experiences on individual mental processes, would equally  highligh the importance of mathematics in developing thinking skills by fostering connections between ideas, organizing information, and encouraging students to record problem-solving strategies. The professional development of mathematics teachers aims to enhance students' thinking abilities by focusing on skills such as problem-solving, abstraction, generalization, and divergent thinking. The  use of puzzles and games in education to enhance students' mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills, as a significant indicator on how puzzles and games can engage students in critical thinking, logical reasoning, and creative problem-solving, leading to a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. By incorporating educational games into teaching, educators can create a fun and interactive learning environment that promotes cognitive, emotional, and psychomotor development in students. On a different note,  the potential negative behaviors that can arise from games, such as fraud and deception, when the focus shifts away from educational goals, could be prevented to ensure that games are not solely recreational, do not overly emphasize winning or losing, align with social values, and are understood by students as purposeful educational activities. Additionally, fostering self-efficacy beliefs among students can enhance their persistence and success in achieving goals, as demonstrated in studies using game-based learning environments to improve mathematical skills and motivation. The current exposition showcases the significance of employing puzzles to revolutionize both theory and practice of teaching mathematics. Most potentially, some emerging open problems are provided. The paper ends with some concluding remarks combined with futuristic research pathways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80816b3bcbeeabed4d9317ba9e5e5a9470a3952bc084ffd910647e5c7c03ebc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
