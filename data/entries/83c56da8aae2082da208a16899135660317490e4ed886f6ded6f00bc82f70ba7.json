{"title":"Proposing Bromo-Epi-Androsterone for Neurologic Long-COVID","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0115/v1","date":1719849481000,"content":"The neurologic effects of long-COVID are a therapeutic challenge. This article discusses the immunologic manifestations of long-COVID and proposes a non-androgenic, synthetic analog of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), bromo-epi-androsterone (BEA), as a candidate for clinical trials for this exigent collection of neurologic conditions. Moreover, because there is an association between long-COVID and Alzheimer’s disease, the evaluation of BEA in long-COVID may serve as a proxy for its effect on neuroinflammatory biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease that are shared with long-COVID.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83c56da8aae2082da208a16899135660317490e4ed886f6ded6f00bc82f70ba7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
