{"title":"Pediatric Obesity and Non-hepatobiliary Gastrointestinal Disorders: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1073/v1","date":1721065047000,"content":"Background and Aims: Obesity is a pervasive health issue in children. It affects multiple systems in the body including the gastrointestinal tract. Research on obesity-related gastrointestinal diseases has focused mostly on hepatobiliary disorders.  However, non-hepatic gastrointestinal diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, and functional abdominal pain, though common and debilitating, have not been highlighted in the context of obesity. These entities can downgrade the already compromised lifestyle of obese children. Some of these disorders are more difficult to treat in these children compared to their peers with normal body mass index. Method: We reviewed the available literature on the association between obesity and these three common gastrointestinal disorders. \nResults: - There appears to be a strong correlation between childhood obesity and constipation and gastroesophageal reflux, and a probable correlation with functional abdominal pain.\nConclusion: We suggest that given the available literature, weight management should be an integral part of the management of gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, and functional abdominal pain in obese children. This gains relevance especially because of the recent availability of medications for the treatment of obesity in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"607f125f06a22d2399417b01f76b2672df3d2d37597b67f18acae892d7e423df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
