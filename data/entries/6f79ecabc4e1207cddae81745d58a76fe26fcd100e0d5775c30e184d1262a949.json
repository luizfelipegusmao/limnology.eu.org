{"title":"Do Sex Ratio Distorting Microbes Inhibit the Evolution of Pesticide Resistance? An Experimental Test","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70003?af=R","date":1728923880000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>We are still largely reliant on pesticides for the suppression of arthropod pests which threaten human health and food production, but the recent rise of evolved resistance among important pest species has reduced pesticide efficacy. Despite this, our understanding of strategies that effectively limit the evolution of resistance remains weak. Male-killing sex ratio distorting microbes (SRDMs), such as <i>Wolbachia</i> and <i>Spiroplasma</i>, are common among arthropod species. Previous theoretical work has suggested that they could limit adaptive potential in two ways: first, because by distorting sex ratios they reduce the effective population size, and second, because infected females produce no male offspring which restricts gene flow. Here we present the results of a novel experiment in which we test the extent by which these two mechanisms limit the adaptive response of arthropods to pesticide. Using a fully factorial design, we manipulated the adult sex ratio of laboratory populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, both in the presence and absence of SRDMs, and exposed these populations to six generations of pesticide poisoning. This design allows the effects of SRDMs on sex ratio and their effects on gene flow to be estimated separately. After six generations, individuals from populations with even sex ratios displayed a higher resistance to pesticide relative to individuals from female-biased populations. By contrast, we found no effect of the presence of SRDMs in host populations on pesticide resistance independent of sex ratio. In addition, males were more susceptible to pesticide than females—this was true of flies from both naïve and previously exposed populations. These findings provide the first empirical proof of concept that sex ratio distortion arising from SRDMs can limit adaptation to pesticides, but cast doubt on the theoretical effect of male-killers limiting adaptation by disrupting gene flow.</p>","author":"Adam M.
