{"title":"The <i>in vitro</i> assessment of rheological properties and dentin remineralization of saliva substitutes containing propolis and aloe vera extracts","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304156","date":1716386400000,"content":"<p>by Surapong Srisomboon, Thanapong Intharah, Ungkarn Jarujareet, Arnit Toneluck, Piyaphong Panpisut</p>\r\n\r\nSaliva substitutes with enhanced dentin remineralization properties were expected to help manage caries progression in patients with xerostomia. This <i>in vitro</i> study examined the rheological properties and remineralization action of experimental saliva substitutes containing propolis extract and aloe vera extract on demineralized dentin. Four experimental saliva substitutes were formulated with varying concentrations of propolis extract (P) and aloe vera extract (A) were prepared. A commercial saliva substitute (Biotene Oral Rinse) was used as a commercial comparison. The rheological properties and viscosity of these materials were measured using a strain-controlled rheometer (n = 3). The remineralizing actions of saliva substitutes on demineralized dentin after 2 weeks were determined using ATR-FTIR and SEM-EDX (n = 8). The results were expressed as a percentage increase in the mineral-to-matrix ratio. Biotene demonstrated a significantly higher viscosity (13.5 mPa·s) than experimental saliva substitutes (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). The addition of extracts increased the viscosity of the saliva substitutes from 4.7 mPa·s to 5.2 mPa·s. All formulations showed minimal shear thinning behavior, which was the viscoelastic properties of natural saliva. The formulation containing 5 wt% of propolis exhibited the highest increase in the median mineral-to-matrix ratio (25.48%). The SEM-EDX analysis revealed substantial mineral precipitation in demineralized dentin, especially in formulations with 5 wt% or 2.5 wt% of propolis. The effect of the aloe vera extract was minimal. The addition of propolis and aloe vera extracts increased the viscosity of saliva substitutes. the addition of propolis for 2.5 or 5 wt% to saliva substitutes increased mineral apatite precipitation and tubule occlusion. To conclude, the saliva substitute containing propolis extract demonstrated superior remineralizing actions compared with those containing only aloe vera extract.","author":"Surapong Srisomboon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f7ed6ad2a76be7d66c050805623d6d95263e96ec088e78949767d75d4c1418b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
