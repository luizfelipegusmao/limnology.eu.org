{"title":"Diversity and Conservation of Rodents in Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0251/v1","date":1714973970000,"content":"The rodents of Saudi Arabia consist of 20 species and 12 genera within four families (Gliridae, Dipodidae, Muridae, and Hystricidae). Details on the past and present distribution of the rodents were included along with available data on their habitat preference and biology. The eastern central part of Saudi Arabia covering Tuwiq mountains plateau, including the vicinity of Riyadh, hosts the highest number of rodent species. Analysis of the rodent fauna of Saudi Arabia revealed that they have four major zoogeographical affinities; Palaearctic-Oriental (one species), Afrotropical- Palaearctic (six species), Palaearctic (four species), endemic to Saudi Arabia and Yemen (three species), Afrotropical-Palaearctic-Oriental (three species) and three cosmopolitan species. According to the National Red List, the Euphrates Jerboa, S. euphratica, is listed as Endangered, Near Threatened for the Indian Crested Porcupine, H. indica, three species as Data Deficient, while the rest are considered as Least Concern.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13940c53e5776e116cadc01085ac2feaeebfbf939f036f5c3ac12cc60b18b1ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
