{"title":"Prioritization of Sub-Watersheds Susceptible to Soil Erosion using Different Combinations of Objective Weighting and MCDM Techniques in an Ungauged River Basin","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11269-024-03825-9","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The identification of areas prone to soil erosion in ungauged river basins is crucial for timely preventive measures, as erosion causes significant damage by lowering soil productivity and filling reservoirs with sedimentation. This study proposes a novel approach to prioritize sub-watersheds (SWs) in Ponnaniyar river basin. It utilizes different combinations of five objective-based weighting methods and seven Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques under outranking and synthesis methods with soil loss, morphometry, land use/land cover (LULC), and topography parameters. The results obtained from different hybrid models are validated using metrics like percentage and intensity of change. The findings reveal that MW-PROMETHEE (53.85%) and CRITIC-WASPAS (8.31) perform best in prioritizing areas based on morphometry, while CRITIC-TOPSIS (48.35% and 7.58) is more effective in prioritizing areas based on land use/land cover (LULC) and topography. The grade average method is used to integrate the rankings from 71 models: 35 based on morphometry, 35 based on LULC, and 1 based on the RUSLE model. The analysis identifies SW2 with a grade value of 4.34 as severely affected by soil erosion, followed by SW11 (5.45), SW5 (5.56), and SW9 (5.68), all falling within the very high priority level. This study recommends implementing appropriate water harvesting structures, which might be helpful in mitigating soil degradation, promoting soil conservation, and ensuring sustainable agricultural productivity.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"40a42827fc69ff45c40185f94be4bfa8611e280355cb159bd1624e827bfea819","category":"Environment"}
