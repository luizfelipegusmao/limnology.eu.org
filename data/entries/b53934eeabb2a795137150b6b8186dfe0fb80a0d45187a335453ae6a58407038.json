{"title":"Assessing the influence of the inclusion of Bacillus subtilis AQUA‐GROW® as feed additive on the growth performance, feed utilization, immunological responses and body composition of the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16129?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study was carried out to determine the influence of four concentrations of dietary <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> on the growth performance, nutrient utilization, immunity and antioxidants activities, mortality rate and chemical composition of <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>. Three hundred and sixty <i>L. vannamei</i> (4.00 g ± 0.03) were raised in 12 hapas (1 m<sup>3</sup> each, placed in 4 ponds) equally distributed on apparently 38.5% protein and 10.5% lipid containing three concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) g/kg of dietary <i>B. subtilis</i> and a non-supplemented control in triplicates. After 56 days of feeding trial, the growth performance, feed utilization, survival rate and immune parameters were significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) better in shrimp fed with dietary <i>B.subtilis</i> compared to the control. The higher dose of dietary <i>B.subtilis</i> showed the good performance of the parameters studied, but in some instances (specific growth rate, feed conversion rate, lysosomal enzyme activity, phenoloxidase activity etc.) were not significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) difference. This study indicates that dietary <i>B. subtilis</i> based diets have a more positive influence on the growth performance, feed utilization, survival rate and immune response of <i>L. vannamei</i> fingerlings.</p>","author":"El‐Sayed Hemdan Eissa, \nNorhan H.
