{"title":"Enterprise Architecture Technology, Controls, and Viewpoints","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0721/v1","date":1720574843000,"content":"There is a lot of pressures from organizations to continually redesign the business processes and the technology infrastructure to support the organization, but to also help organizations manage competing stakeholder needs, changing objectives and behaviour, and so on. A key part of this is making sure that all their activities in the different components of the business are interconnected and that they are moving in the same direction. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is an effective way of dealing with the challenge of designing business activities and supporting IT. This paper will summarize the organization of EA and look more closely at some major components of EA: governance architecture, business architecture, information architecture and technical architecture and consider the overlap and constructive interaction involved. Enterprise Architecture can be best understood through business process redesign. So, it is useful to briefly review the leading frameworks for business process redesign, including COBIT from ISACA, LEAN from the Toyota Group, TOGAF from the Object-Management Group, and the Capgemini Integrated Architecture Framework (IAF). All these frameworks allow us to more successful transformation, to return to the central idea of this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd26464026e7832cabd403e2e19180824e42b292f328f836463c6a1aa04c3e91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
