CCK-8 method was used to investigate the proliferative activity of hDPSCs. The cell cycle distribution of hDPSCs was detected by flow cytometry; The cell migration ability was assessed using the cell scratch and Transwell tests; Odontogenic differentiation medium was used to induce mineralization of hDPSCs, followed by statistical analysis. RNA-Seq revealed that FOS, JUN and other genes were found to be enriched in MAPK signaling pathway and osteoclast differentiation pathway. qPCR was used to detect mRNA expression of hub genes (FOS and JUN). \nResults: Compared with the NSTA-EDA1 and STA-EDA1, Wt-EDA1 promotes the proliferation and transformation of hDPSCs from the G0/G1 phase to S phase (p0.05). Wt-EDA1 also upregulated hDPSCs cell migration compared to NSTA-EDA1 and STA-EDA variants, as demonstrated by migration assays (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b506b7571490bd98fc15115f1f29b3292f67d36cbeb47b175821cac54204751","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
