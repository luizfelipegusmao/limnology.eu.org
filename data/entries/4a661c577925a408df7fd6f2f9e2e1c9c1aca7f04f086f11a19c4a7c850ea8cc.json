This study delves into the serial correlations embedded in global surface air temperature (SAT) data. Initially, we preprocess the SAT time series to eradicate seasonal patterns and linear trends, resulting in the SAT anomaly time series, which encapsulates the inherent variability of Earth’s climate system. Employing diverse statistical techniques, we identify three distinct types of serial correlations: short-term, long-term, and nonlinear. To identify short-term correlations, we utilize the first-order autoregressive model, AR(1), revealing a global pattern that can be partially attributed to atmospheric Rossby waves in extratropical regions and the Eastern Pacific warm pool. For long-term correlations, we adopt the standard detrended fluctuation analysis, finding that the global pattern aligns with long-term climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we apply the horizontal visibility graph (HVG) algorithm to transform the SAT anomaly time series into complex networks. The topological parameters of these networks aptly capture the long-term correlations present in the data. Additionally, we introduce a novel topological parameter, Δ<i>σ</i>, to detect nonlinear correlations. The statistical significance of this parameter is rigorously tested using the Monte Carlo method, simulating fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noise processes with a predefined DFA exponent to estimate confidence intervals. In conclusion, serial correlations are universal in global SAT time series and the presence of these serial correlations should be considered carefully in climate sciences.","author":"Meng Gao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4a661c577925a408df7fd6f2f9e2e1c9c1aca7f04f086f11a19c4a7c850ea8cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
