The synthesis process involves the chemical reduction of NiCl<sub>2</sub> and CoCl<sub>2</sub>. NaCl is also added to dilute and reduce the coalescence of the reaction products. Sample preparation is carried out within a vacuum chamber to avoid oxidation of the metals in the sample. The reagents have been set in stoichiometric proportions according to reaction (1) for 3 g of mixture. Reagents comply with an atomic proportion of 50% of Ni and Co in a 1:1 ratio with NaCl as dispersant. Reagents and dispersant are placed in a vial along with the grinding balls. The applied mass ratio of balls has been 1:1 with respect to the total mass of the reactants. The vials have been loaded in a vacuum chamber. The following reaction is assumed to occur instantaneously and discontinuously as a result of the collisions between the grinding media and the reactants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7cf8cad58ff14bb009d9e693276a36afa9713b74b99a16d0e8447c0b5f03768a","category":"Environment"}
