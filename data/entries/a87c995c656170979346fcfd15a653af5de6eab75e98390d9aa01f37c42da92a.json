{"title":"Thank The Quantum Realm For Nothing Ever Entering Into Black Holes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0483/v1","date":1717978753000,"content":"While the quantum realm seems hidden, it can also reach examples of infinite energy, especially when a part of space is roughly removed until it disappears, possibly forever. Since it follows that {\\it Nothing } can enter a region where the space is missing, the quantum realm, as seen now in affine quantization, will automatically come to help everything else by creating colossal `quantum walls' that will ensure that everything stays out of all black holes. In this article, we show that the expanded quantum realm allows {\\it Nothing} to ever fall into a black hole.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a87c995c656170979346fcfd15a653af5de6eab75e98390d9aa01f37c42da92a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
