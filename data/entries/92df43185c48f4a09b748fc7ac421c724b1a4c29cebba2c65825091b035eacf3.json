{"title":"Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Larynx Preservation in Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0697/v1","date":1725880741000,"content":"Background/Objectives: To test the hypothesis that clinical tumor response after a single cycle of induction chemotherapy (ICT) can reliably differentiate between chemo-/radiosensitive and resistant tumors in the larynx preservation setting. Methods: Treatment consisted of docetaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (TPF) ICT followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) with weekly cisplatin. The response of the primary tumor was assessed by transnasal endoscopy after the first ICT cycle. Results: 37/39 (95%) patients with laryngeal (46%) or hypopharyngeal (54%) carcinoma responded to one cycle of ICT, and two patients were referred for salvage surgery. Laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 5 years was 87% and 75%, respectively. The corresponding rates for locoregional control (and also for disease-free survival) were 79% and 70% and for overall survival 92% and 82%. Conclusions: Clinical assessment of tumor response to one cycle of TPF ICT serves as a valid and easy-to-use predictor of tumor sensitivity to platinum-based cCRT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92df43185c48f4a09b748fc7ac421c724b1a4c29cebba2c65825091b035eacf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
