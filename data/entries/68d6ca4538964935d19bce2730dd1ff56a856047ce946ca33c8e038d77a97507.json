{"title":"Analytical Descriptions of High-Tc Cuprates by Introducing Rotating Holes and a New Model to Handle Many-Body Interactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0105/v5","date":1729162856000,"content":"This study describes the properties of high-Tc cuprates by introducing rotating holes that are created by angular momentum conservations on a 2D CuO2 surface, and which have a different mass from that of a normal hole because of the magnetic field energy induced by the rotation. This new particle called a macroscopic Boson describes the doping dependences of pseudo-gap temperature and the transition temperature at which an anomaly metal phase appears and describes the origin of the pseudo-gap. Furthermore, this study introduces a new model to handle many-body interactions, which results in a new statistic equation. This statistic equation describing many-body interactions accurately explains why high-Tc cuprates have significantly high critical temperatures. Moreover, a partition function of macroscopic Bosons describes the properties of anomaly metal phase, which sufficiently agree with experiments. Note that, the calculations were conducted, using the result from our previous study that analytically describes the doping dependence of Tc. By introducing a macroscopic Boson and the new statistical model for many-body interactions, this study uncovered the mystery of high- Tc cuprates, which have been a challenge for many researchers. An important point is that, in this study, pure analytical calculations are consistently conducted, which agree with experimental data well (i.e., they do not use numerical calculations or fitting methods but use many actual physical constants).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68d6ca4538964935d19bce2730dd1ff56a856047ce946ca33c8e038d77a97507","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
