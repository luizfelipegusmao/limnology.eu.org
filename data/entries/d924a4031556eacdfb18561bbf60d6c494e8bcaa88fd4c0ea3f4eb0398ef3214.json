{"title":"The Hanks‐like serine/threonine protein kinase YihE is crucial for Aeromonas veronii virulence and adhesion","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13986?af=R","date":1723123610000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Aeromonas veronii</i> is an important pathogen found in various aquatic environments and products, posing a threat to public health. The Hanks-like serine/threonine protein kinase is closely linked to the pathogenesis of pathogenic bacteria, but the exact role of YihE in <i>A. veronii</i> remains still unknown. To study the specific function of the YihE kinase, we constructed a knockout mutant of the <i>yihE</i> gene in <i>A. veronii</i>. The deletion of the <i>yihE</i> gene resulted in changes to the metabolism of L-arginine-AMC and acetic acid, as well as enhanced resistance to ampicillin and kanamycin in <i>A. veronii</i>. Additionally, the Δ<i>yihE</i> strain demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in biofilm formation ability and a 1.8-fold decrease in adhesion and invasion to EPCs when compared to the wild-type strain. A significant decrease in cytotoxicity was observed at 2 and 3 h post-infection with EPCs compared to the wild-type strain. Additionally, the deletion of the <i>yihE</i> gene was associated with a significant decrease in motility of the strain. Furthermore, the deletion of the <i>yihE</i> gene resulted in a 1.44-fold increase in the LD<sub>50</sub> of <i>A. veronii</i> in zebrafish. These findings offer valuable insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of <i>A. veronii</i>.</p>","author":"Dongjie Shi, \nBintong Yang, \nTong Zhao, \nWenchao Sun, \nHaiying Cui, \nYuanhuan Kang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"d924a4031556eacdfb18561bbf60d6c494e8bcaa88fd4c0ea3f4eb0398ef3214","category":"Environment"}
