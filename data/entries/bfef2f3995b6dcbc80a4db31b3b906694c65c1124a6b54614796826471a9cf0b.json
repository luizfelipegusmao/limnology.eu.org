These defects can be categorized according to their topological dimensionality from 0D, namely point defects such as vacancies, 1D linear defects (dislocations, triple lines), to 2D surfaces, grain boundaries, or stacking faults. Dislocations are essential carriers of plastic deformations and can create or annihilate additional defects when moving, thus mediating the macroscopic mechanical response. Impurities and alloying elements often segregate to these defects, altering the defectsâ€™ energetic stability, geometric structure, and mobility. Understanding the interactions between alloying elements and crystal defects is crucial for property engineering. Atom probe tomography (APT) is a characterization routine capable of discerning these interactions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bfef2f3995b6dcbc80a4db31b3b906694c65c1124a6b54614796826471a9cf0b","category":"Environment"}
