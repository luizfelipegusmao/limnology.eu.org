Bioenergetics models have become a useful tool in conservation and management efforts of marine mammals generally, yet no bioenergetics model exists for sea otters. Previous research provides abundant data that can be used to develop bioenergetics models for this species, yet important data gaps remain. Here we review the available data that could inform a bioenergetics model, and point to specific open questions that could be answered to more fully inform such an effort. These data gaps include quantifying energy intake through foraging by females with different aged pups in different quality habitats, the influence of body size on energy intake through foraging, and determining the level of fat storage that is possible in sea otters of different body sizes. The more completely we fill these data gaps, the more confidence we can have in the results and predictions produced by future bioenergetics modeling efforts for this species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"e08d03ca1f7511fa67a175ebc477983ac76843ac111362edf85e3a5c445b7c60","category":"Environment"}
