Klahm, Wilhelm Stahl, Peter Brenneisen</p>\r\nBackground <p>Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer with a rather poor prognosis. Standard chemotherapy often results in severe side effects on normal (healthy) cells finally being difficult to tolerate for the patients. Shown by us earlier, cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP, nanoceria) selectively killed A375 melanoma cells while not being cytotoxic at identical concentrations on non-cancerous cells. In conclusion, the redox-active CNP exhibited both prooxidative as well as antioxidative properties. In that context, CNP induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the studied melanoma cells via generation of reactive oxygene species (primarily hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)), but that does not account for 100% of the toxicity.</p> Aim <p>Cancer cells often show an increased glycolytic rate (Warburg effect), therefore we focused on CNP mediated changes of the glucose metabolism.</p> Results <p>It has been shown before that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity is regulated via oxidation of a cysteine in the active center of the enzyme with a subsequent loss of activity. Upon CNP treatment, formation of cellular lactate and GAPDH activity were significantly lowered. The treatment of melanoma cells and melanocytes with the GAPDH inhibitor heptelidic acid (HA) decreased viability to a much higher extent in the cancer cells than in the studied normal (healthy) cells, highlighting and supporting the important role of GAPDH in cancer cells.</p> Conclusion <p>We identified glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a target protein for CNP mediated thiol oxidation.</p>","author":"Claudia von Montfort","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8ea220b4ab3f472b278fd2aacffdc81ad974086254e7476fa989f22c3b10028d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
