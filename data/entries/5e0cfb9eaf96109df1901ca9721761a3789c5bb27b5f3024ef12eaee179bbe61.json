Among these techniques, the scanning electron microscope is widely used in both academic and industrial research and has played a major role in the development and analysis of new materials and devices. SEMs primarily reveal the surface topography of a material by imaging secondary electrons (SEs) that are generated within a shallow depth of the surface. In general, the resolution of these images is as high as a few nanometers, but it has been shown that atomic level visualization can be achieved [<a href=\"#ozae044.133-B1\">1-3</a>] using a spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Notably, these achievements have been accomplished with samples that were thin enough to be electron-transparent, which raises the question of whether atomic-resolution SE imaging can be achieved with thick, bulk samples. Traditional (S)TEM imaging necessitates specimen thinning to mitigate signal degradation from multiple scattering. Nonetheless, the interest in thick samples persists due to their closer representation of real material properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5e0cfb9eaf96109df1901ca9721761a3789c5bb27b5f3024ef12eaee179bbe61","category":"Environment"}
