{"title":"Clamping Pressure during Step Loading of Power Transformer with and without Prior Energisation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1099/v1","date":1713347187000,"content":"Electrification of society, increasing renewable energy sources and mobility charging lead to new loading patterns for power transformers. Dynamic load conditions induce enhanced mechanical stress on the transformersâ€™ windings, potentially causing degradation of the solid insulation over time and compromising the transformer's short-circuit withstand capability. Thermal expansion of the windings, caused by losses in the copper conductors, occurring as the transformer is load-ed, increases the stress. Conversely, magnetic losses in the core and tie plate expansion contribute to a reduction in stress. This paper presents the effect of step changes in core losses and copper losses by on-line measurements of the clamping pressure, to better understand the mechanical stresses acting upon the solid insulation cellulose materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72cc7e8a3f6d5a7ea9d93871b4f03e094065fc290093d8ddfb879851284be848","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
