{"title":"Brain: The Role of Criticality, Fractality, and the Darwinian Process in the Evolution of Thought and the Abstraction of the Physical World","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1507/v1","date":1726769819000,"content":"This article explores the intricate functioning of the human brain, highlighting how it operates near a critical state to optimize memory storage, adaptability, and the generation of thoughts. Through complex, fractal-like neural networks and brain waves, the brain largely governs our actions via subconscious processes, allowing for rapid, automated responses while reserving conscious thought for novel or complex tasks. Reasoning and planning emerge from the interplay of episodic memory and various neural networks such as Default Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network (SN), and Executive Network (EN), guiding decisions and actions. The \"self\" and “consciousness” are portrayed as functional illusions, which is being continuously constructed by dynamic neural activity, while free will is examined as a deterministic illusion shaped by prior neural states. We have argued that the brain's response to the physical world is a blend of subconscious automation and conscious sensory processing, thus, reality navigating through an evolving neural plasticity that promotes creativity and the illusion of a coherent, freely acting self. We discuss how does the mind select what to think about, how does it begin? Online and offline state of mind. We address what is an intelligence, understanding, creativity. We propose individual neuronal cells might store information beyond synaptic changes, the pathways through which neuronal thoughts propagate and Darwinian-like evolution of thoughts in minimizing surprises. We have drawn some parallels between the human brain and Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT in terms of their functional roles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8656962cf5e132e25924924f8b70744d57e026153f39eaeea50964f644669bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
