{"title":"Evaluation of Antitumor Activity of Reprogrammed Spleen CD8+ T-Cells in a Lewis Lung Cancer Mouse Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1191/v1","date":1713442931000,"content":"The enhancement of early diagnosis of lung cancer is mandatory to improve prognosis. We observed the increase cancer stem cells (CSC) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood of mice on d3 after Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell implantation before disease symptom. Besides we have developed an approach to reprogramming immune cells by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway through MEKi and the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint signaling pathway. We hypothesized that reprogramming of spleen CD8+ T-cells could also create a population of immune cells with high antitumor activity. We reprogrammed CD8+ T-cells derived from the spleen of C57BL/6 mice (rsCD8+T-cells). The rsCD8+T-cells were able to migrate to lung and were more resistant after the exhaustion in vitro in comparison with na√Øve sCD8+T-cells. In the orthotopic LLC model, the rsCD8+T-cells therapy increased the amount of proliferating CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in blood and lung from mice. The amount of CSC decreased in the blood and lung of mice treated with rsCD8+ T-cells. A morphological study revealed a decrease in the number of metastases in lung tissue. The antitumor effects of rsCD8+T-cells are based on the activation of the host immune response by increasing the populations of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells and apoptosis of CSCs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce6ed8ea8385134a2c5acd6e7d3a4aa110a6881a2caf1b30a529a90e4ba81067","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
