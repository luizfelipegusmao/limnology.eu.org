{"title":"From Early Adoption to Mainstream Acceptance: A Case Study on the Distribution of Electric Vehicles in Sweden (2016-2020)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1438/v1","date":1711352602000,"content":"In this study, we investigate the growth of EV ownership among Swedish households. Through detailed socio-economic data and the Swedish vehicle register, we are able compare characteristics of households that bought an EV in 2016 with those that became EV owners in 2020. We are thus able to describe and analyse the transition from the early EV owners to the early majority. Unlike many prior studies in the field, which are based on surveys or interviews, this study relies on registry data, thereby encompassing all car owners in Sweden. In this study, we have also scrutinized the significance of ownership mode by distinguishing between households that have chosen to purchase a car and those that have chosen to lease one. The results show that the demand for EVs has reached new consumer groups, e.g. both younger and older car buyers, and that the option to lease a car privately has broadened the market for new cars in general, and for EVâ€™s in particular.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6774a48686bc3d56d49735911e797142b5241a64e31cb3b585414ce85861f2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
