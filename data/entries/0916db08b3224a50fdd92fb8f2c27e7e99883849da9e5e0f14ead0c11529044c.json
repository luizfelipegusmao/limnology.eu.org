Prehistoric, historic and ongoing declines of the world's predators have reshaped terrestrial ecosystems and are a topic of conservation concern. However, the availability of ecologically relevant predator functional traits is limited, hampering efforts to understand macroecological changes in this ecologically important functional group. Here, we present <i>CarniTraits</i>, a comprehensive open-access functional trait database of all late Quaternary (~130,000 ybp) terrestrial mammalian predators (149 species, ≥1 kg body mass, ≥50% vertebrate meat consumption).</p>\n<h2>Main Types of Variables Contained</h2>\n<p>Mammalian terrestrial predator functional traits including body mass, diet, scavenging, locomotion, cooperative hunting, hunting habitat, hunting method, bone consumption, temporal activity patterns, brain mass and encephalisation quotient.</p>\n<h2>Spatial Location and Grain</h2>\n<p>Global.</p>\n<h2>Time Period and Grain</h2>\n<p>Late Quaternary (the last ~130,000 years).</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa and Level of Measurement</h2>\n<p>All late Quaternary terrestrial mammalian predators (149 species, ≥1 kg body mass, ≥50% vertebrate meat consumption).</p>\n<h2>Software Format</h2>\n<p>csv.</p>","author":"Eamonn I. F.
