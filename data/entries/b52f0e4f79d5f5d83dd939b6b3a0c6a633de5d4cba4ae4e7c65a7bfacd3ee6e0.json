{"title":"Leveraging Innovation Capability and Organizational Resilience to Business Sustainability Among Small and Medium Enterprises: A PLS-SEM Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1437/v1","date":1726666036000,"content":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of innovation capability on business sustainability in Nigerian small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as well as consider the effects of organizational resilience, sustainable competitive advantage, and environmental dynamism as mediators in succession. The researchers adopted a quantitative approach and collected data from 401 employees in SMEs in the Lagos Metropolitan Area of Nigeria. We conducted the analysis of the collected data using the partial least squares approach (PLS-SEM). The researcher established that innovation capabilities are beneficial in ensuring business sustainability. Findings further corroborated the importance of sustainable competitive advantage and environmental dynamism for business sustainability. Finally, the results showed that environmental dynamism is important for helping small business owners keep their businesses sustained and increase their innovation capabilities. Similarly, the indirect paths also showed that resilience organizations like SMEs play a role in the paradigm. However, businesses can benefit from this study's findings by crafting strategies that adapt more quickly to changing market dynamics and capitalize on emerging possibilities. This way, businesses may take the necessary measures to stay ahead of the competition while guaranteeing sustainability. Even though the heuristic model emphasizes originality, current research on how to successfully link innovative capacity to sustainability and build sustainability in dynamic environments is sparse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b52f0e4f79d5f5d83dd939b6b3a0c6a633de5d4cba4ae4e7c65a7bfacd3ee6e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
