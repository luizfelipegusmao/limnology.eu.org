{"title":"Microalgal Diversity and Molecular Ecology: A Comparative Study of Classical and Metagenomic Approaches in Ponds of the Eifel National Park, Germany","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1846/v1","date":1719391695000,"content":"While molecular methods have begun to transform ecology, most algal biodiversity is still studied using the classical approach of identifying microalgae by light microscopy directly in sample material or using cultures. In this study, we compare both approaches (light microscopy and metagenomics as a molecular approach) using freshwater ponds of the Eifel National Park in Germany as a case study. The ponds were found to be rich in desmids by light microscopy. A total of 299 species representing 81 genera were identified by light microscopy. While the molecular method does not currently allow species identification in most cases, we were able to identify 207 different algal genera. 157 genera were detected only by metagenomics, 50 genera with both methods and 31 genera were found by light microscopy, highlighting the need to continue using light microscopy in addition to a molecular approach. The metagenomics method has several advantages over the light microscopy method: 1) deeper assessment of alpha biodiversity 2) better abundance numbers 3) complete coverage of all living matter. The latter is also a significant improvement over metabarcoding, as universal PCR primers are not available.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7befb466ab454e6253465b0708479817df2b28829069bbb4fd0db128bcb405a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
