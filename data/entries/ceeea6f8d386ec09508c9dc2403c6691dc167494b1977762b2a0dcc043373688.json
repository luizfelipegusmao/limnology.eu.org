{"title":"Effects of purple cabbage anthocyanin extract on the gluten characteristics and the gluten network evolution of high‐gluten dough","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13598?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Anthocyanins are polyphenolic pigments that have hypoglycemic, antioxidation, anti-aging, and other effects. Research has shown that polyphenols can optimize the processing of dough and improve the texture and nutritional characteristics of dough products. The formation of gluten networks is decisive for the quality of flour products. The effects of purple cabbage anthocyanin (PCA) extract on the structure, microscopic morphology, and network formation of gluten protein were studied, and the types of cross-linking between PCA and gluten protein are discussed.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results show that PCA extract increased the free sulfhydryl (SH) group content and the free amino group of gluten proteins, stimulated an increase in the <i>β</i>-sheet ratio and the decrease of <i>α</i>-helix ratio, and increased the gluten index significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The PCA extract also induced gluten protein aggregation, increased the height of protein molecular chains, and stimulated the formation of gluten networks. When PCA extract concentrations were 4 g kg<sup>−1</sup> and 8 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, the gluten network was more homogeneous, continuous, and dense.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Appropriate anthocyanins have a positive effect on the properties of gluten and promote the formation of gluten networks. Excessive anthocyanins destroy gluten protein interaction and harm gluten cross-linking. This study may provide a useful source of data for the production of functional flour products rich in anthocyanins. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Li Xie, \nMinglong Liu, \nHuawei Zeng, \nZhi Zheng, \nYongkang Ye, \nFengru Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ceeea6f8d386ec09508c9dc2403c6691dc167494b1977762b2a0dcc043373688","category":"Environment"}
