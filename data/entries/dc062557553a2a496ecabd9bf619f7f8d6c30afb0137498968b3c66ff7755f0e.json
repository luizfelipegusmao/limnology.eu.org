{"title":"Effectiveness of Sodium Metabisulfite against Fungal Rot of Fruit after Harvest and Assessment of the Phytotoxicity Induced in Treated Fruit","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1146/v1","date":1710848986000,"content":"This study evaluates the efficacy of the salts, sodium metabisulfite (SMB), ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate first in vitro against the main postharvest fruit rot fungi, Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium italicum and Penicillium digitatum. Results showed that 0.2% SMB completely inhibited mycelium growth of the fungal species. Ammonium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate were less effective at 0.2% in inhibiting mycelial growth, ranging from 57.6% to 77.6%. The least effective was potassium dihydrogen or-thophosphate. Experiments were also performed in vivo on wounded apples inoculated with the most pathogenic fungus, B. cinerea, and treated with SMB at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%, both preventively and curatively. Results based on the decay size showed that SMB, when used as a preventive treatment, had a reduced efficacy, even with the highest concentration. However, this salt proved to be very effective at 0.5% in curative treatment, since the decay was completely blocked. Our results suggest that the appropriate concentration of SMB for post-harvest treatment is 0.5% as a curative treatment. On the other hand, the 1% dose induced the onset of phytotoxicity around the wound. To assess the extent of phytotoxicity reaction, higher concentrations of 1-4% SMB were applied to wounded fruit. Apples and oranges were inoculated or not with B. cinerea and P. digitatum respectively. Doses of 1- 4% induced phytotoxicity in the form of a discoloured ring surrounding the wound on the epidermis of the fruit; this phytotoxicity enlarged as the concentration of SMB increased. The phytotoxic features were similar on apples and oranges. The methodological procedure made it possible to carry out a quantitative assess-ment of SMB phytotoxicity. This method is proposed as an easy-to-use technique for quantitatively estimating the phytotoxicity of antifungal compounds on post-harvest fruit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc062557553a2a496ecabd9bf619f7f8d6c30afb0137498968b3c66ff7755f0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
