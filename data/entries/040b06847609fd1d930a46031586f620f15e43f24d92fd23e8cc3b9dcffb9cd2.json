{"title":"Emerging Mutations of SARS-COV-2 in Kenya","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0647/v1","date":1715333440000,"content":"Background: The rise of new SARS-CoV-2 mutations brought challenges and progress in the global fight against COVID-19. Mutations in spike and accessory genes affect transmission, vaccine efficacy, treatments, testing, and public health strategies. Monitoring emerging variants is crucial to halt virus spread. \nMethods: 44 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from Kenyan patients were sequenced with the Illumina platform. Galaxy's bioinformatic tools were used for genomic analysis. SARS-CoV-2 genome classification was done using PANGOLIN and mutation annotation with the COVID-19 Annotator tool. \nResults: The study showed 5 clades to be circulating in the region. 38(86%) were BA.1.1; 2(5%) were BA.1.1.1; 1(2%) was BA.1; 1(2%) was BA.1.14 and 2(5%) were AY.46. These clades had a cumulative of 173 mutations among them with 50 novel mutations. Forty-eight of these novel mutations occurred in a low frequency of 2.3% of the sequences tested while the other two, S:R214R, and NSP2:A555A, were for 43.2% and 18.2% of the cases respectively. \nConclusions: The high-frequency novel mutations were synonymous mutations, a phenomenon that was previously viewed as phenotypically silent but recent studies indicate they can affect viral fitness with potential functional associations. These findings add to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus future evolutionary and immunological dynamics in the region","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"040b06847609fd1d930a46031586f620f15e43f24d92fd23e8cc3b9dcffb9cd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
