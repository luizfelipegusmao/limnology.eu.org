{"title":"Updates on an Even More Compact Precision NMR Spectrometer and a Wider Range V-T Probe, for General Purpose NMR and for NMR Cryoporometric Nano- to Micro-pore Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0251/v1","date":1722917844000,"content":"There is an increasing need for compact low-cost NMR apparatus that can be used on the laboratory bench and in the field. There are four main usage variants of usage: a) Time-Domain apparatus, particularly for physical measurements; b) Frequency Domain apparatus, particularly for chemical analysis, c) NMR Cryoporometry apparatus for measuring pore-size distributions, and d) MRI apparatus for imaging. For all of these, variable temperature capability may be vital. We have developed compact low-cost apparatus targeted at these applications. We discuss a hand-held size NMR spectrometer, and three different holdable NMR magnets, with sufficiently large internal bores for the Lab-Tools compact Peltier thermo-electric cooled variable-temperature probes.  Currently the NMR Spectrometer is very suitable for a), NMR time-domain relaxation and c), NMR Cryoporometry. With a suitable high-homogeneity magnet it is also appropriate for simple use b), spectral analysis, or, with a suitable gradient set, use d), MRI. Together, the NMR Spectrometer, one of the NMR variable-temperature probes, and any of these NMR magnets make an excellent NMR Cryoporometers, as demonstrated by this paper, and previously published research. Equally, they make versatile general-purpose variable-temperature NMR systems for materials-science.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"615c58afdadf33b4efa1b2b6c42003d1128a7983ee5ee5c992562d8c84796ed7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
