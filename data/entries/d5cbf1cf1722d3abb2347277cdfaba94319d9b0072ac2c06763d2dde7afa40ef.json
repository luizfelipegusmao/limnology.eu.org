In this technique, a focused, high-energy beam of electrons or ions is raster scanned across the sample, initiating the emission of SEs. An SE detector maps the detected SE intensity to a pixel brightness to create the final image. The quality of SEI is affected by three identifiable noise sources – randomness in incident particle number (<span>source shot noise</span>), randomness in emitted SE number (<span>target shot noise</span>), and noise in the SE detector [<a href=\"#ozae044.987-B2\">2</a>]. Imaging noise increases the required particle dose, potentially damaging radiation-sensitive samples. Further, the lack of knowledge of the detector’s gain and efficiency results in SEI being qualitative rather than a precise measurement of the pixelwise <span>SE yield</span>, i.e., the average number of SEs emitted per incident particle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d5cbf1cf1722d3abb2347277cdfaba94319d9b0072ac2c06763d2dde7afa40ef","category":"Environment"}
