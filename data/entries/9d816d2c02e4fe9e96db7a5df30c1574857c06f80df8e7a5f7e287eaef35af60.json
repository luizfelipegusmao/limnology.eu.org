{"title":"Sensorless Control of SPM Motor for e-Bike Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1826/v1","date":1729750190000,"content":"The aim of this research is to present both a sensorless control and a torque derating algorithm in the overload region of a permanent magnet motor for e-bike. First the theoretical backgrounds and the field oriented control are presented. Then a sensorless control, based on the back-emf estimation with a second order generalized integral flux observer for permanent magnet motor, has been designed. The second order generalized integral flux observer is an adaptive filter which can eliminate the DC offset and strongly attenuate the harmonics of the estimated rotor flux. The algorithms have been simulated and then validated by means of tests on a permanent magnet motor for e-bike.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d816d2c02e4fe9e96db7a5df30c1574857c06f80df8e7a5f7e287eaef35af60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
