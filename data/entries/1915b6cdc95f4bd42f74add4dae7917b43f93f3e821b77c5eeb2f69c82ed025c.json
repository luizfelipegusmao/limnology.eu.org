{"title":"Integration of Additive Manufacturing in Aerospace Engineering","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2453/v1","date":1722350099000,"content":"The integration of additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized aerospace engineering by enabling the creation of complex, lightweight, and high-performance components. This paper explores the transformative impact of AM technologies on the design, production, and maintenance of aerospace systems. The aerospace industry demands high precision, reduced weight, and enhanced performance, all of which are facilitated by AM's ability to produce intricate geometries and optimize material usage. Key applications of AM in aerospace include the fabrication of engine components, structural parts, and customized tooling. The technology's capability to produce parts with complex internal structures, such as lattice designs, leads to significant weight reductions without compromising strength and durability. Furthermore, AM allows for rapid prototyping, enabling faster iteration and development cycles, which is crucial in the highly competitive aerospace sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1915b6cdc95f4bd42f74add4dae7917b43f93f3e821b77c5eeb2f69c82ed025c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
