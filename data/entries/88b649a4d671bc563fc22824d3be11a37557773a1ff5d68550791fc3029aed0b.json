{"title":"Sustainable Supply Chains as a Marketing Differentiator: Qualitative Insights from Industry Leaders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1294/v1","date":1718787986000,"content":"This qualitative research explores the intricate relationship between cultural influences on supply chain practices and their implications for marketing strategies. Cultural dimensions such as individualism versus collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and contextuality significantly shape decision-making processes, risk management strategies, and relationship dynamics within global supply chains. Through semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers, marketing executives, and cultural experts across diverse industries and regions, this study investigates how cultural values impact supply chain operations and consumer engagement strategies. Key findings highlight that collectivist cultures prioritize consensus-building and long-term relationships, fostering trust and collaboration among supply chain partners. In contrast, individualist cultures emphasize efficiency and accountability but may face challenges in relationship building. Risk management practices vary with cultural orientations towards uncertainty, influencing the adoption of structured versus flexible approaches to mitigate disruptions. In terms of marketing implications, the study underscores the importance of cultural sensitivity in crafting effective strategies. High-context cultures require marketing messages that resonate emotionally through implicit communication and cultural symbolism, while low-context cultures prefer clear, direct messaging focusing on product benefits. The study concludes by advocating for cultural competence as a strategic imperative for global businesses, enabling them to leverage cultural diversity for innovation and competitive advantage. It emphasizes the need for continuous adaptation to cultural nuances and market dynamics to foster inclusive collaboration and achieve sustainable growth in a globalized economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88b649a4d671bc563fc22824d3be11a37557773a1ff5d68550791fc3029aed0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
