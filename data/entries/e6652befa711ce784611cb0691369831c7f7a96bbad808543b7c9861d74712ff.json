{"title":"P450 in Liver Pathology Diagnostic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0670/v1","date":1728533872000,"content":"A specific key point in liver cirrhosis is  the decreased  metabolic capacity for drugs. So medicines which are metabolized by oxidative biotransformation play a great role in liver pathology. Responsible for the drug metabolism that takes place in liver during illnes, are three cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) gene families in liver microsomes (CYP 1, CYP2 and CYP3).  In attention of various studies, is cytochrome P450. Folowing the  currently aim,we  try  to assess the effect of liver disease on multiple CYP enzymes by use of a validated cocktail composed of medicins. Liver diseases are  associated with metabolic activity changes It is important to know and to tell a little bit about different directions in cirrhosis diagnostic, including laboratory tests or management ideas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6652befa711ce784611cb0691369831c7f7a96bbad808543b7c9861d74712ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
