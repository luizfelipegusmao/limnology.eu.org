We characterized the energetic substrates in pregnant individuals and stages of offspring development in the freshwater stingray <i>Potamotrygon amandae</i>. Our results show that the energetic distribution of the yolk is composed of more lipids than proteins, whereas the inverse pattern is observed in the egg and uterus, proving the plasticity of the energy provision of the species. As a novelty, we describe that yolk/intestine transfer occurs in this species.</p>","author":"Natalia Carvalho Fabricio da Silva, \nBianca de Sousa Rangel, \nÉvillyn dos Santos Zacheo, \nDouglas de Castro Ribeiro, \nCristiéle da Silva Ribeiro","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"ce68d838bd8efc9b9ff684ded24ae2fb090e1694f799ce1cdc2a04f722599354","category":"Environment"}
