{"title":"Induction of volatile organic compounds in chrysanthemum plants following infection by <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302541","date":1714658400000,"content":"<p>by Dariusz Piesik, Natalia Miler, Grzegorz Lemańczyk, Alicja Tymoszuk, Karol Lisiecki, Jan Bocianowski, Krzysztof Krawczyk, Chris A. Mayhew</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigated the effects of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> J.G. Kühn infestation on the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and biochemical composition of ten cultivars of chrysanthemum (<i>Chrysanthemum</i> × <i>morifolium</i> /Ramat./ Hemsl.) to bring new insights for future disease management strategies and the development of resistant chrysanthemum cultivars. The chrysanthemum plants were propagated vegetatively and cultivated in a greenhouse under semi-controlled conditions. VOCs emitted by the plants were collected using a specialized system and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Biochemical analyses of the leaves were performed, including the extraction and quantification of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds. The emission of VOCs varied among the cultivars, with some cultivars producing a wider range of VOCs compared to others. The analysis of the VOC emissions from control plants revealed differences in both their quality and quantity among the tested cultivars. <i>R</i>. <i>solani</i> infection influenced the VOC emissions, with different cultivars exhibiting varying responses to the infection. Statistical analyses confirmed the significant effects of cultivar, collection time, and their interaction on the VOCs. Correlation analyses revealed positive relationships between certain pairs of VOCs. The results show significant differences in the biochemical composition among the cultivars, with variations in chlorophyll, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds content. Interestingly, <i>R</i>. <i>solani</i> soil and leaf infestation decreased the content of carotenoids in chrysanthemums. Plants subjected to soil infestation were characterized with the highest content of phenolics. This study unveils alterations in the volatile and biochemical responses of chrysanthemum plants to <i>R</i>. <i>solani</i> infestation, which can contribute to the development of strategies for disease management and the improvement of chrysanthemum cultivars with enhanced resistance to <i>R</i>. <i>solani</i>.","author":"Dariusz Piesik","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b13b5257c751fed4472220c5c4ab6cb5f1ec70ac5f00262d985292f8f9553d6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
