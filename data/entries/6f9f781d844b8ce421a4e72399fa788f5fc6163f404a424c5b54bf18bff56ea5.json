{"title":"Diagnostic Accuracy of Specific IgE to Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs) in Food Allergy: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2091/v1","date":1727363329000,"content":"Background: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of\nmolecular-based LTPs serum IgE for the diagnosis of food allergies in patients with suspected\nallergy to one of the LTPs-containing food. Methods: cohort, prospective or retrospective cross-\nsectional studies were considered for inclusion in the review. Oral food challenge (both open and\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled) was the reference standard for the diagnosis. Pubmed\n(MEDLINE), Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrial.org were searched for relevant papers.\nRisk of bias was assigned by QUADAS-2 tool. Data were reported as sensitivity and specificity.\nStudy protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022321985). Results: Fifteen\narticles, including 2395 individuals, were included. Sensitivity of Ara h 9 for peanut allergy\ndiagnosis ranged from 6 to 61%; specificity ranged from 57 to 100%. Cor a 8 sensitivity ranged\nfrom 11 to 43%, with specificity ranging from 59 to 94%. Conclusions: Ara h9 and Cor a 8 serum\nIgE may be useful to confirm diagnosis of peanut and hazelnut allergy in symptomatic patients,\nalthough diagnostic accuracy is limited by low sensitivity. More investigation on other LTPs and in\nadult population may be important to define the clinical role of this test in food allergies\ndiagnostics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f9f781d844b8ce421a4e72399fa788f5fc6163f404a424c5b54bf18bff56ea5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
