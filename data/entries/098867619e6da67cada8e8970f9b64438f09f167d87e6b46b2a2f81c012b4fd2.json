{"title":"Qualitative and Quantitative Sex-Related Differences in the Perception of Single Molecules from Coffee Headspace","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0593/v1","date":1725877519000,"content":"One of the still debated topics regarding the olfactory function concerns the presence or absence of sex-related differences of individuals. In this study, we checked for a relationship between the olfactory function of females and males and their ability to perceive single molecules, and how this can influence the intensity with which the complex odor formed by a set of single molecules is perceived. First, females and males were classified as normosmic or hyposmic based on the TDI olfactory score obtained using the Sniffin' Sticks test. Subsequently, the headspace of roasted coffee beans as a complex olfactory stimulus was broken down into single molecules by means of a chromatographic column; these were simultaneously conveyed to a mass spectrometer (for their subsequent classification) and to the human nose which acts as a chemical sensor by means of an olfactometer port. The results obtained with this gas chromatography-olfactometry approach show both qualitative and quantitative differences between females and males, with females performing better than males. In addition, the odor intensity reported by females when sniffing pen #10 containing coffee aroma is significantly higher than that reported by males. In conclusion, these data highlight that the human ability to perceive both single compounds and complex odors is strongly conditioned, not only by olfactory function of individuals, but also by their sex.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"098867619e6da67cada8e8970f9b64438f09f167d87e6b46b2a2f81c012b4fd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
