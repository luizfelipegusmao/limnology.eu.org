The nanoscale spin texture within magnetic materials plays a large role in the behavior of these technologies, and also provides a rich area of fundamental study. Much of this development has been enabled by electron, x-ray, and scanning probe microscopies adapted to measure nanomagnetism, yet each technique has strengths and limitations. Lorentz TEM, for example, projects images of the average magnetic field inside a specimen while exposing it to an external field or temperature, but it is insensitive to the field component along the beam path. Limitations can be overcome by using more than one technique. Here we discuss the use of specialized electron microscopies, STEM holography and scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA), to understand the 3D structure of nanomagnetic spin textures such as skyrmions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"624de51124e531067e4de0ccb4aa4e3ea5d90be1164b85dd3544835059216ca8","category":"Environment"}
