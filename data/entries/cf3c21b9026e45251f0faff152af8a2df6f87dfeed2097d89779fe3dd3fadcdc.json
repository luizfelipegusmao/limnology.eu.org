Our aim is to emphasize the importance of preoperative inflammatory parameters such as NLR, PLR, and MPV in predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (CRC PC).\nMethods\nPatients operated for CRC PC were evaluated. Demographic data, NLR, PLR, and MPV values were calculated using the following formulas: NLR = (absolute neutrophil count)/(total lymphocyte count), PLR = (total lymphocyte count)/(total platelet count) × 100, MPV = mean platelet volume calculated by dividing platelet crit (PCT) by total platelet count.\nResults\nA total of 196 patients with CRC PC were included in the study. A statistically significant relationship was observed between NLR, PLR, MPV, and OS. Patients with an NLR value of 3.77 had a median OS of 22.1 months, whereas those with an NLR value below 3.77 had a median OS of 58.3 months (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1–5.3, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf3c21b9026e45251f0faff152af8a2df6f87dfeed2097d89779fe3dd3fadcdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
