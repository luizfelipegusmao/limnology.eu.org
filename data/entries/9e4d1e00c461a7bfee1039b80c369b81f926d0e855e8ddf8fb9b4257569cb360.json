{"title":"On Renormalization Group Based Deep Q-Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0953/v1","date":1720695823000,"content":"In This paper we introduce the integration of Renormalization Group (RG) methods with Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to improve reinforcement learning in high-dimensional state spaces. RG methods provide multi-scale analysis, enhancing state representation, learning stability, and exploration. The proposed RG-DQN algorithm uses hierarchical Q-value estimation and multi-scale representations, demonstrating superior performance on synthetic genomic data compared to traditional DQNs.}","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e4d1e00c461a7bfee1039b80c369b81f926d0e855e8ddf8fb9b4257569cb360","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
