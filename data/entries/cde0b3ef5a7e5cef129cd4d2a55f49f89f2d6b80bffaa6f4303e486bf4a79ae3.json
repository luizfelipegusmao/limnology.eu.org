{"title":"A new classification of the family Ariidae (Osteichthyes: Ostariophysi: Siluriformes) based on combined analyses of morphological and molecular data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/200/2/426/7246615?rss=1","date":1692576000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We present a new classification of the catfish family Ariidae based on a total-evidence hypothesis, which incorporates data from the examination of 249 morphological and 5603 molecular characters from 131 species. The named taxa in the proposed classification represent groups of species found in the Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference analyses or, in some cases, two of the three methods. Each named taxon is provided with a diagnosis derived from a comprehensive summary of the morphological characters and their character-state transformations, as interpreted from the most parsimonious version of the total-evidence tree. Taxa newly named herein are: Cathoropsini, new tribe; Genidentini, new tribe; Sciadeini, new tribe; <span>Aceroichthys</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius dioctes</span> Kailola, 2000); <span>Bleekeriella</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius leptaspis</span> Bleeker, 1862); <span>Betancurichthys</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius madagascariensis</span> Vaillant, 1894); <span>Jayaramichthys</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius leptonotacanthus</span> Bleeker, 1849); <span>Kyataphisa</span>, new genus (type species <span>Pimelodus nenga</span> Hamilton, 1822); <span>Megalosciades</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius augustus</span> Roberts, 1978); <span>Paracinetodus</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius carinatus</span> Weber, 1913); <span>Papuarius</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius latirostris</span> Macleay, 1883); and <span>Pseudosciades</span>, new genus (type species <span>Arius sona</span> Hamilton, 1822). A key to the genera of Ariidae is presented.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"cde0b3ef5a7e5cef129cd4d2a55f49f89f2d6b80bffaa6f4303e486bf4a79ae3","category":"Environment"}
