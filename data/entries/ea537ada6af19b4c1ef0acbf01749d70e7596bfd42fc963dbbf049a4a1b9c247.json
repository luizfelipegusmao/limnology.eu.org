{"title":"Cultural and Creative Employment across Italian Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0222/v1","date":1712066799000,"content":"in the following article I analyze the trend of cultural and creative employment in the Italian regions between 2004 and 2022 through the use of ISTAT-BES data. After presenting a static analysis, I also present the results of the clustering analysis aimed at identifying groupings between Italian regions. Subsequently, an econometric model is proposed for estimating the value of cultural and creative employment in the Italian regions. Finally, I compare various machine learning models for predicting the value of cultural and creative employment. The results are critically discussed through an economic policy analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea537ada6af19b4c1ef0acbf01749d70e7596bfd42fc963dbbf049a4a1b9c247","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
