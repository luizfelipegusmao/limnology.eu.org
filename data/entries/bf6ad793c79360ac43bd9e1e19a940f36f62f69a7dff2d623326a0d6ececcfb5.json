{"title":"Bridging aquatic invasive species threats across multiple sectors through One Biosecurity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/7/440/7721333?rss=1","date":1721952000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding the magnitude of biosecurity risks in aquatic environments is increasingly complex and urgent because increasing volumes of international shipping, rising demand for aquaculture products, and growth in the global aquarium trade, are accelerating invasive alien species spread worldwide. These threats are especially pressing amid climate and biodiversity crises. However, global and national biosecurity systems are poorly prepared to respond because of fragmented research and policy environments, that often fail to account for risks across sectors or across stakeholder needs and fail to recognize similarities in the processes underpinning biological invasions. In the present article, we illustrate the complex network of links between biosecurity threats across human, animal, plant, and environment sectors and propose a universal approach to risk assessment. One Biosecurity is a holistic, interdisciplinary approach that minimizes biosecurity risks across human, animal, plant, algal, and ecosystem health and is critical to reduce redundancy and increase cross-sectoral cohesion to improve policy, management, and research in aquatic biosecurity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"bf6ad793c79360ac43bd9e1e19a940f36f62f69a7dff2d623326a0d6ececcfb5","category":"Environment"}
