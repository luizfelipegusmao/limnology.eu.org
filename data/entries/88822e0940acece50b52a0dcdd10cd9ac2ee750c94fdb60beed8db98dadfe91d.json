{"title":"Emission Ellipsometry Study in Polymeric Interfaces Based on POLY(3-Hexylthiophene), PCBM and Graphene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1081/v1","date":1718606658000,"content":"We analyzed the interaction of two acceptor materials, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and [6,6]-phenyl-C6-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT), as well as the dependence of its photophysical properties with the temperature in the range 90 to 300 K. The nanocomposite of the films was analyzed by optical absorption ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and photoluminescence (PL) and emission ellipsometry (EE) in a function of sample temperature. The surface morphology was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We noted that onset levels (Eonset) of the nanocomposite of P3HT and RGO is smaller than the others. The PL spectra showed the presence of anomalies in the emission intensities in the nanocomposite of P3HT and PCBM. It was also possible to determine the electron-phonon coupling by calculating the Huang-Hys parameters and its dependence with the sampleâ€™s temperature. Through EE it was possible to analyze the degree of polarization and the anisotropy. We observed a high degree of polarized emission of the P3HT films which varies subtly according to the temperature. For nanocomposites with RGO the polarization degree in the emission decreases and the roughness on the surface increases. As a result, the RGO improves the energy transfer between adjacent polymer chains at the cost of greater surface roughness. Then, the greater energy transfer may favor applications of this type nanocomposite in OPVC's with enhancement in energy conversion efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88822e0940acece50b52a0dcdd10cd9ac2ee750c94fdb60beed8db98dadfe91d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
