{"title":"Is Maternal Selenium Status Associated with Pregnancy Outcomes in Physiological and Complicated Pregnancy?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0733/v1","date":1712746907000,"content":"Selenium is essential for the synthesis and function of various selenoenzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases, selenoprotein P, and thioredoxin reductase, which play an important role in both antioxidant defense and limiting oxidative damage. Associations between serum selenium concentration and obstetric complications as well as pregnancy outcomes has been reported in many studies. The aim of this study was to determine whether the dietary intake of selenium, its concentration in serum and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in subsequent trimesters of pregnancy affect the birth condition of newborns assessed on the basis of the Apgar score in the 1st and 5th minute of life, birth weight, body length and head and chest circumference in physiological and complicated pregnancy course. Twenty-seven pregnant women at a mean age 29.6 ± 4.8 years from the Lower Silesia region of Poland were recruited to the study, 55% of studied group had pregnancy complications. The mean reported Se intake and serum selenium content for Polish pregnant women was in the first trimester – 56.53 μg/day and 43.75 μg/l, the second trimester – 61.79 μg/day and 41.77 μg/l and the third trimester – 58.37 μg/day and 42.13 μg/l, respectively. In the subgroup of pregnant women with a physiological pregnancy course, a weak, although statistically significant, positive correlation was found in the first trimester between Se intake and the length (R=0.48, p=0.019) and birth weight of newborns (R=0.472, p=0.022), and in the second trimester with the APGAR score at 1 (R=0.680, p=0.005) and 5 minutes (R=0.55, p=0.033), as well as in the third trimester with th APGAR score at 1 minut (R=0.658, p=0.019). The GPX value had a strong positive correlation with the APGAR score at 1 min. (R=0.650, p=0.008) in the second trimester and with the birth weight of the newborns (R=0.598, p=0.039) in the third trimester. There was no correlation between newborns' birth measurements and serum selenium concentration. In the subgroup of pregnant women with pregnancy complications, a strong, statistically significant, negative correlation was found between Se intake in the second trimester and gestational age (R=-0.618, p=0.032), and in the third trimester, a positive correlation between Se concentration in serum and head circumference (R=0.587, p=0.021). The obtained results indicate that there is a relationship between the maternal selenium status during pregnancy, both in terms of the intake of this element, its serum concentration as well as the glutathione peroxidase activity, and the anthropometric parameters of the newborn, such as birth weight, length and APGAR score, especially in the group with physiological course of pregnancy, but when pregnancy complications occur, these relationships lose their importance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"baf6326ff35c5f1d2b2a615839381584651c5ed852c8e2907989e0859e226d64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
