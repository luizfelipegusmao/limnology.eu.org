{"title":"Health Benefits of White Mulberry, Sea–Buckthorn, Garlic, Lily of the Valley, Motherwort, and Hawthorn — Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1104/v1","date":1711089236000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases are a broadly understood concept focusing on vascular and heart dys-function. Lack of physical exercise, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, throm-boembolism, kidney, and lung diseases all contribute to the development of heart and blood vessel dysfunction. Although effective and important, traditional treatment with diuretics, statins, beta–blockers, calcium inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, and anti–platelet drugs remain a second–line treatment after dietary intervention and lifestyle changes. Scientists worldwide are still looking for an herbal product that would be quite effective and free from side effects, either taken together or before the standard pharmacological intervention. Such herbal–originated medication therapy may include Morus alba L. (white mulberry), Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson (sea–buckthorn), Allium sativum L. (garlic), Convallaria majalis L. (lily of the valley), Leonurus cardiaca L. (mother-wort), and Crataegus spp. (hawthorn). Valuable herbal raw materials include leaves, fruits, seeds, and even thorns. This short review focuses on six herbs that can constitute an interesting and po-tential therapeutic option in the management of cardiovascular disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c508780c82d3b650024a7be10bcf63a24a292f785165cad38bbbb1a09a49f13e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
