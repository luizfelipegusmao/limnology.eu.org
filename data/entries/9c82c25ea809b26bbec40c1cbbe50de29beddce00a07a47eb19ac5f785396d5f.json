{"title":"Prediction of COVID-19 Hospitalization and Mortality Using Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0984/v1","date":1715691039000,"content":"COVID-19 has substantially influenced healthcare systems, requiring early prognosis for innovative therapies and optimal results, especially in individuals with comorbidities. Healthcare practitioners have used AI systems for investigating, anticipating, and predicting diseases, through means including medication development, clinical trial analysis, and pandemic forecasting. This study proposes the use of AI to predict disease severity in terms of hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients.\nMethodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted the approval from the Research Ethics Committee of King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Saudi Arabia. The study used sequential sampling approaches to include 50 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19 patients from KAU's coronavirus isolation wards. A pre-designed form was used to collect each patient's demographic information, including age and gender, signs and symptoms, illness severity (mild, moderate, severe), and laboratory findings. Furthermore, the length of the hospital stay and the result, whether the patient recovered or died, were reported.\nResults: The study involved 50 patients with varying degrees of disease severity, most of whom suffered from fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, and diarrhoea. Laboratory analysis of COVID-19 patients showed increased white blood cell and platelet counts, with C-reactive protein levels above normal. Elevated LDH levels indicated possible tissue damage, while ferritin levels were elevated. Other enzymes were in the normal range, but bilirubin levels were slightly elevated. Overall, the patient's lab results indicated inflammation and possible blood clot formation. The study evaluated the predictive accuracy for outcomes and mortality of COVID-19 patients based on factors such as CRP, LDH, Ferritin, ALP, Bilirubin, D-dimers, and hospital stay (p-value ≤0.05). The predictive accuracy mortality of patients with COVID-19 using AI showed Hospital stay, D-Dimers ALP, Bilirubin, LDH, CRP, and Ferritin significantly affected hospital mortality. (p ≤ 0.0001). \nConclusion: Artificial Intelligence is crucial for identifying early coronavirus infections and monitoring patient conditions. It improves treatment consistency and decision-making via the development of algorithms. AI can track the crisis at various scales, facilitate research, and aid in developing treatment regimens, prevention strategies, and drugs and vaccines. It also aids in monitoring health and facilitating research on the virus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c82c25ea809b26bbec40c1cbbe50de29beddce00a07a47eb19ac5f785396d5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
