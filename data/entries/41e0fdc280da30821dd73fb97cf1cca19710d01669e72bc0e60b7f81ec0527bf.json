{"title":"Energy Communities in the Transition to Renewable Sources: Innovative Models of Energy Self-Sufficiency through Organic Waste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0115/v1","date":1717483857000,"content":"The paper examines the evolution and crucial role of energy communities in the context of the transition to renewable energy sources. Such communities are presented as an innovative and resilient response to the challenges posed by climate change. Their importance emerges from their ability to decentralise energy production, increasing local security and reducing dependence on non-renewable energy sources and external suppliers. However, despite the obvious benefits, the contribution highlights several challenges, such as the need for significant upfront investment and the presence of regulatory barriers that may hinder the integration of these solutions into existing energy systems. A detailed bibliometric analysis is used, focusing on specific research areas and using tools to map the most relevant keywords and emerging trends. The results of the bibliometric analysis highlight how energy communities are emerging as key players in the sustainability landscape, capable of addressing and overcoming contemporary environmental challenges. The research reaffirms the transformative potential of energy communities in promoting a more sustainable and resilient future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41e0fdc280da30821dd73fb97cf1cca19710d01669e72bc0e60b7f81ec0527bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
