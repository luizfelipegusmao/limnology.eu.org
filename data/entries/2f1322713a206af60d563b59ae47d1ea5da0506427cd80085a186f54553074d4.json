{"title":"Health parameters for wild Carnaby's cockatoo (Zanda latirostris) nestlings in Western Australia: results of a long-term study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae005/7611679?rss=1","date":1708387200000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>The collection of baseline health data is an essential component of an endangered species conservation program. As for many wildlife species, there are minimal health data available for wild populations of the endangered Carnaby’s cockatoo (<span>Zanda latirostris</span>). In this study, 426 wild Carnaby’s cockatoo nestlings were sampled from nine breeding sites throughout the range of the species over an 11-year period. In addition to a physical examination, samples were collected to test for hematologic and biochemical parameters, psittacine beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), avian polyomavirus (APV), psittacine adenovirus, psittacine herpesvirus, <span>Chlamydia</span>, disease serology and endoparasites. Environmental sampling was performed to screen for BFDV and APV in nest hollows. Descriptive health data are presented for nestlings of this species, with BFDV, APV and <span>Chlamydia</span> infections reported. Reference intervals for hematologic and biochemical parameters are presented in three age groups, and factors affecting blood analytes and body condition index are discussed. This longitudinal dataset provides insights into health parameters for Carnaby’s cockatoo nestlings and a reference for future monitoring of breeding populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"2f1322713a206af60d563b59ae47d1ea5da0506427cd80085a186f54553074d4","category":"Environment"}
