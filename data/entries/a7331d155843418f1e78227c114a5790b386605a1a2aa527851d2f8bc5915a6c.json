{"title":"Multiplex gene editing reveals cucumber MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O family roles in powdery mildew resistance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1069/7603939?rss=1","date":1707350400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Powdery mildew (PM) is one of the most widespread and prevalent diseases that affects a wide range of crops. In cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span> L.), previous forward genetic studies have identified <span>MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 8</span> (<span>CsMLO8</span>) as necessary but alone insufficient for cucumber PM resistance (PMR) and suggested the involvement of other members of the <span>CsMLO</span> family. However, the function of other CsMLO family members in cucumber remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a highly efficient multiplex gene editing system in cucumber to generate a series of <span>Csmlo</span> mutants from all the 13 family members. Systematic analysis of these mutants revealed growth effects of these CsMLO family members on development and PMR. Importantly, we obtained the <span>Csmlo1/8/11</span> triple mutant with complete resistance to PM. Transcriptome and proteome analysis of PM-resistant <span>Csmlo</span> mutants suggested that the kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP)-interacting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein (CsKIC), calmodulin-like protein 28 (CsCML28), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase 11 (CsCPK11)-mediated calcium signaling pathway is involved in PMR. CsMLO8 interacted directly with CsKIC, and the simultaneous silencing of both genes resulted in a phenotype that resembled the silencing of <span>CsKIC</span> alone. Silencing <span>CsCML28</span> and <span>CsCPK11</span> increased susceptibility to PM, whereas overexpressing <span>CsCPK11</span> through genetic transformation enhanced cucumber's PMR, demonstrating their positive regulatory roles in PMR. Given the importance of PMR for cucurbit crops, this research provides unprecedented insights into the function of the proteins encoded by the <span>CsMLO</span> gene family as well as the plant defense response to PM pathogen.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a7331d155843418f1e78227c114a5790b386605a1a2aa527851d2f8bc5915a6c","category":"Environment"}
