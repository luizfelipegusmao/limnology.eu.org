{"title":"CD Markers and HLA Expression in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients: correlations and clinical relevance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1776/v1","date":1716812878000,"content":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a distinct category of lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of mature B cells, followed by their accumulation in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Cluster of differentiation (CD) markers such as CD20, CD22, CD23, CD5, and CD81 serve as reliable prognostic indicators and disease progression factors in CLL. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is a critical genetic variable in many diseases, with well-documented associations between HLA and various cancers. This study aims to investigate, for the first time, potential connections between HLA typing and CD marker expression in CLL. Despite being one of the most prevalent neoplasms in developed regions, there is a need for biomarkers that can improve survival predictions and identify possible genetic determinants. Methods: This study included 66 CLL patients and 100 controls, with all samples analyzed using biochemical methods, flow cytometry, and cytomorphology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed for HLA typing. Results: The results indicate that several CD markers are statistically associated with different HLA alleles. Specifically, CD20 was associated with HLA-DRB1*11:04:01; CD45 with HLA-C*07:01:01; CD79b with HLA-DPA1*02:01:02; CD23 with HLA-B*39:01:01; CD43 with HLA-DRB1*15:01:01; CD22 with HLA-B*49:01:01, HLA-C*07:01:01, HLA-DPB1*02:01:02, and HLA-DRB1*07:01:01; and CD81 with HLA-DPB1*04:02:01, HLA-DQA1*01:04:01, and HLA-DQB1*05:03:01.Conclusion: In conclusion, this research demonstrates significant statistical links between HLA genes and immunophenotypic markers in CLL patients, shedding new light on the immunological context of CLL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"162e852914650dd08fe1bbc85d480c01da47fd58e83a39e295a5c52e90f36e30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
