{"title":"A New Perspective to the Relation Between Accretion Luminosity and Mass Accretion Rate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1285/v1","date":1721111155000,"content":"In this paper I show that, opposite to what is generally assumed, when a source accretes matter at the so-called Eddington mass accretion rate M˙ed, the generated accretion luminosity Lacc is smaller than Led, the Eddington accretion luminosity that can stop accretion. I demonstrate my thesis using pieces of informations that, one by one, are well known in the accretion theory but that, for some reason, they are not considered altogether. Namely, I use the following facts: i) Lacc, in the ideal case, is equal to the rate at which kinetic energy is deposited into the accreting source; ii) radiation pressure decreases the velocity of the infalling matter; iii) the generally accepted formula Lacc=GMM˙/R is valid only if the matter is in free fall. To give a quantitative demonstration of my thesis I use two accretion models: the first is the very simple spherical accretion of zero-temperature, fully ionized hydrogen; then I use a model developed some years ago where the energy transfer between matter and radiation is taken into account. The fact that M˙ed generates a Lacc&amp;lt;Led can have consequences in all the cases in which one would need to model accretion with M˙&amp;gt;M˙ed to reproduce the observations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c528b0e1219b481e3952fb4888514818d105852c2732df5c5d84e8cec87f6aa2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
