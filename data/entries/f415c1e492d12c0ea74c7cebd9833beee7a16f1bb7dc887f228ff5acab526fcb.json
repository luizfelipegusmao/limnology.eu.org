Angiosperms have evolved pollen tubes that carry their passive and immobile sperm cell cargo deep into the maternal reproductive tissues toward the embryo sac for double fertilization (<a href=\"#koae024-B1\">Dresselhaus et al. 2016</a>). Autocrine signaling pathways regulated by rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs) play a crucial role in hydration as well as cell wall integrity during pollen tube growth, a mechanism essential for double fertilization. As pollen tubes navigate from stigma to ovules, they secrete proteins, including RALFs, important for communication with maternal tissues. RALFs have been extensively studied in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<a href=\"#koae024-B4\">Zhong et al. 2022</a>) but remain unexplored in cereal crops such as maize.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"f415c1e492d12c0ea74c7cebd9833beee7a16f1bb7dc887f228ff5acab526fcb","category":"Environment"}
