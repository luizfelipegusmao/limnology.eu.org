{"title":"Thorium Recovery with Crown Ether&ndash;Polymer Composite Membranes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2130/v1","date":1727349774000,"content":"Thorium is a weak radioactive element, but the control of its concentration in natural aqueous systems is of great interest for health, because it is a toxic heavy metal. The present paper presents the recovery of thorium from diluted synthetic aqueous systems by nanofiltration. The membranes used for nanofiltration of systems containing thorium species are composites containing 4′-Aminobenzo-15-crown-5 ether (ABCE) and sulfonated poly–ether–ether–ketone (sPEEK). The composite membranes (ABCE–sPEEK) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X–ray spectroscopy EDAX, thermal analysis (TG and DSC) and from the perspective of thorium removal performance. To determine the process performances, the variables were: the nature of the composite membrane, the concentration of thorium in the aqueous systems, the rotation speed of the stirrer, the pressure and the pH of the thorium aqueous system. When using pure water, a permeate flux value of 12 L·m⁻2 h⁻1 was obtained for sPEEK membrane, and up to 15 L·m⁻2 h⁻1 for the ABCE–sPEEK composite membrane. The use of mechanical stirring, with a propeller stirrer, leads to an increase in the permeate flux of pure water by about 20 % for each of the studied membrane. Depending on the concentration of thorium and the pH of the feed solution, retentions between 84.9 % and 98.4 % were obtained. An important observation is the retention jump at pH 2 for the ABCE–sPEEK composite membrane. In the paper, a thorium ion retention mechanism is proposed for the sPEEK membrane and the ABCE–sPEEK composite membrane.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db8925effa62f8f0cf24319899c807aea3c10d5d0383a3058300c92cb5583a9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
