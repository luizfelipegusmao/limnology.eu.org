The aquaporin (AQP) family plays an important role in water transport and regulation in many tissues, including the male gonad. The testis undergoes various stages of change during the reproductive cycle, and water balance is an important factor in ensuring reproductive success. Considering the relevance of water control in testicular development in anurans and the lack of research regarding the tissue localization of AQP in the male gonad, the present study investigated the expression of three AQPs (1,2, and 9) in the testis of the neotropical anuran species Leptodactylus podicipinus during two different periods of the reproductive cycle. AQP1 and 2 immunoreactions were found in early germ cells, spermatozoa, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells, which were strongly associated with the reproductive period. AQP1 was also found in the testicular blood vessels. AQP 9 was identified predominantly in the epithelium of the intratesticular ducts of reproductive period individuals. The study present, for the first time, the localization of AQP1, AQP2, and AQP9 in the testis of an anuran species, and the differences in their location during two distinct periods of the reproductive cycle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1210956f359a14568e9ae96c83bfd50cd815a0d99c2813aa747861909f8f1aff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
