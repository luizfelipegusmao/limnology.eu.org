{"title":"Evidence of Rapid Rise in Population Immunity from Subclinical Infections in Pakistan from Pre-vaccination Serial Serosurveys in Pakistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0135/v1","date":1725312931000,"content":"Background: Understanding factors associated with protective immunity against emerging viral infections is crucial for global health. Pakistan reported its first COVID-19 case on February 26, 2020, but compared to other countries, it experienced relatively low COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality between 2020 and 2022. The underlying reasons remain unclear. Our research aims to shed light on this crucial issue.\nMethods: We conducted serial household surveys over 16 months (Rounds 1-4, July 2020 - November 2021) in urban (Karachi) and rural (Matiari) Sindh, sampling 1100 households and 3900 individuals. Our comprehensive approach included measuring antibodies in sera, testing a subset of respiratory samples for COVID-19 using RT-PCR and antigen tests, and measuring Hemoglobin, CRP, Vitamin D, and zinc in Round 1.\nResults Participants showed 23% (95% CI 21.9-24.5) antibody seroprevalence in round 1, increasing across rounds to 29% (95% CI 27.4-30.6), 49% (95% CI 47.2-50.9) and 79% (95% CI 77.4-80.8). Urban residents had 2.6 times (95% CI 1.9-3.6) higher odds of seropositivity than rural residents. Seropositivity did not differ between genders. Individuals aged 20-49 had 7.5 (95% CI 4.6-12.4) times higher odds of seropositivity compared to children aged 0-4. Most participants were asymptomatic, with no reported mortality. Vitamin D deficiency was linked to seroprevalence. COVID-19 was confirmed in 1.8% of individuals via RT-PCR and antigen tests.\nConclusions: The data suggests a steady increase in humoral immunity in Pakistan, likely due to increased transmission and potential cross-protective immunity, which may be associated with asymptomatic disease, leading to the reduction of morbidity and mortality observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da51a57be6022f2b95a5689784bec65ca8c7f82b87eed16fb9521923c0d2aec4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
