{"title":"Enhancing Player Experience in an FPS with Dynamic Audio Cue Adjustment Based on Gaussian Progress Regression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2460/v1","date":1727746660000,"content":"This paper analyzes the experience of first-person shooter (FPS) players when the game difficulty is adjusted by personalizing their audio cue settings, considering the balance between player performance, modeled using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and prior data serving as designer preference. In addition, we investigate the reason why player experience changes according to in-game audio cues. Previous studies have proposed various dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) methods for FPS games. However, few studies have considered the role of audio cues in the player experience. This paper compares the player experience of personalized enemy audio cue volume setting (GPR-DDA) and that of predetermined setting in an FPS game. Two comprehensive experimental phases, involving 80 participants, are conducted to assess the efficacy of GPR-DDA. The experience of our players is measured using questions taken from the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS) questionnaire and a final survey asking their open-ended feedback. A large language model (LLM) is used to analyze the natural language expressions of the players according to their native languages. To effectively have an LLM assist a limited number of qualified human evaluators in the classification of player responses, we develop an original procedure for this task. The GUESS results show that GPR-DDA can improve the player experience, and, in addition, the high consistency in the classification results over multiple runs of the selected LLM, as well as the similarity between its results and those of our human evaluators, reflect the reliability of the proposed LLM-assisted procedure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"436e28fb3384a446eeee3c11f8a71fb91e72a3cecef558aafb5a61d617d4a64a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
