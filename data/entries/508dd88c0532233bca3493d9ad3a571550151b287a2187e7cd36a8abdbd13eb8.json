{"title":"Maximum sustainable employment: Adding to the beacons of wild fisheries governance","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12829?af=R","date":1712688916000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This paper proposes to establish Maximum Sustainable Employment (MSE) as a new guiding light, or beacon, for wild fisheries governance. This new social beacon complements the directives provided by the prevailing beacons: Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and Maximum Economic Yield (MEY). The argument is that context matters: in countries where poverty levels are high and alternative employment is scarce, fisheries governors cannot limit themselves to a sectoral perspective. Instead, they must include the remunerative employment and ‘decent work’ that wild fisheries offer society in their strategic deliberations. This perspective is especially relevant for countries in the Global South, but it also has a bearing on the Global North. After discussing the history of scientific fisheries management and the relevance of employment in fisheries, the paper considers the arguments made against MSE. It concludes with a reflection on the balancing of the three beacons in line with prevailing circumstances.</p>","author":"Maarten Bavinck, \nJoeri Scholtens, \nMichael Fabinyi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3de509ad0f312c77d6dd4d37070c89263edb7695bf1d0e15e1eb17cfd4455e34","entryHash":"508dd88c0532233bca3493d9ad3a571550151b287a2187e7cd36a8abdbd13eb8","category":"Environment"}
