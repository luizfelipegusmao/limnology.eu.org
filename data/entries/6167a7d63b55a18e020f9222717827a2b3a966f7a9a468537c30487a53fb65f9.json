{"title":"Investigating the Performance of a Novel Modified Binary Black Hole Optimization Algorithm for Enhancing Feature Selection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0441/v1","date":1715174786000,"content":"High dimensional datasets are highly likely to have redundant, irrelevant, and noisy features that negatively affect the performance of the classification algorithms. Selecting the most relevant features and reducing the dimensions of datasets by removing the undesired features is a dimensional reduction technique called Feature Selection (FS). In this paper, we propose an FS approach based on the Black Hole Algorithms (BHO) with a mutation technique called MBHO. Generally, BHO contains two major phases. At the exploitation phase, a set of stars are modified based on some rule and according to some objective function, the best star is selected as the black hole which attracts other stars. Furthermore, when a star gets closer to the event horizon, it will be swallowed and a new one will be randomly generated in the search space which thus is the exploration phase. However, randomness may cause the algorithm to fall into the trap of local optima, and to overcome such complications, inversion mutation is used. Furthermore, we modify a widely utilized objective function in most of the proposed works for wrapper feature selection by combining two new terms that are based on the correlation among the selected subset of features and the features and the classification label. We also utilize a transfer function, known as the V2 transfer function, to convert continuous values into discrete ones to enhance search. We assess our approach via extensive evaluation experiments using fourteen benchmark datasets. We benchmark the performance of a wrapper FS approach called Binary Cuckoo Search (BCS), and three filter-based FS approaches (namely Mutual Information Maximisation (MIM), Joint Mutual Information (JMI), and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR)). Our evaluation has shown that the proposed model is an effective approach for FS, in selecting better features that enhance the performance metrics on the classifiers. Thus, MBHO can be utilized as one alternative to the existing state-of-art-approaches. We release the source codes of our implementation for the community to build on with new methods and datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6167a7d63b55a18e020f9222717827a2b3a966f7a9a468537c30487a53fb65f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
