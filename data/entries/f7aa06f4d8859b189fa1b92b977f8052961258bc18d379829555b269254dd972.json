Thus, the emphasis on adaptation to climate change is no longer a choice or a deferred problem into the future, but rather an urgent matter of concern which must be considered a policy priority. As a response to retrogressive climate change challenges on social-economic development and environmental degradation, the government of South Africa has in the last two and half decades, embarked on the progressive formulation of different policy instruments and strategic frameworks to curb and minimize the impacts of climate change on all sub-sectors of the economy. Although much remains to be achieved, some level of success has been realized, particularly in the space of policy formulation, albeit the poor record of implementation. Using research methods inspired by the tradition of qualitative research and an appraisal of existing literature, this paper discusses the complexities of climate change adaptation governance at a local government level in South Africa, focusing on the Eastern Cape Province. It is argued in the paper that one of the major challenges for climate change governance at local municipality levels in South Africa emanates from the gap between aspirations and actions across the entire national governance system. The absence of an integrated climate change governance system has posed significant systemic challenges, and these have tended to constrain decision-making and implementation processes. These issues have been discussed within the broader discourse of the sustainable development goals, particularly goals number 13, 16 and 17.</p>","author":"Siyaxola Ernest Gadu, \nRichard Kwame Adom, \nMulala Danny Simatele","siteTitle":"Wiley: Climate Resilience and Sustainability: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e7509a6a763a901e53649c0568b0f7267c6e779cdc08f41bb80af5ed2bfb3753","entryHash":"f7aa06f4d8859b189fa1b92b977f8052961258bc18d379829555b269254dd972","category":"Environment"}
