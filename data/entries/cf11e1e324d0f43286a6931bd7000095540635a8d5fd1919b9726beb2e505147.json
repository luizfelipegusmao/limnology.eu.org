{"title":"Characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with kidney failure of unknown aetiology from ANZDATA registry","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300259","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Lucy S. Wang, Venkat Vangaveti, Monica S. Y. Ng, Andrew J. Mallett</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Kidney failure of unknown aetiology (uESKD) is also heavily location dependent varying between 27% in Egypt to 54% in Aguacalientes, Mexico. There is limited information about the characteristics of people with uESKD in Australia and New Zealand, as well as their clinical outcomes on kidney replacement therapy.</p> Methods <p>Data on people commencing kidney replacement therapy 1989–2021 were received from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry. Primary exposure was cause of kidney failure–uESKD or non-uESKD (known-ESKD). Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcome was kidney transplantation. Dialysis and transplant cohorts were analysed separately. Cox Proportional Hazards Regression models were used to evaluate correlations between cause of kidney failure and mortality risk. Subgroup analyses were completed to compare mortality risk in people with uESKD to those with diabetic nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), glomerular disease and other kidney diseases.</p> Results <p>This study included 60,448 people on dialysis and 20,859 transplant recipients. 1-year, 3-year and 5-year mortality rates in people with uESKD on dialysis were 31.6%, 58.7% and 77.2%, respectively. 1-year, 3-year and 5-year mortality rates in transplant recipients with uESKD were 2.8%, 13.8% and 24.0%, respectively. People with uESKD on dialysis had a higher mortality risk compared to those without uESKD on univariable and multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.06–1.16, p&lt;0.001). Transplant recipients with uESKD have a higher mortality risk compared to those without uESKD on univariable and multivariable analyses (AHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.35, p&lt;0.05). People with uESKD had similar likelihood of kidney transplantation compared to people with known-ESKD.</p> Conclusion <p>People with uESKD on kidney replacement therapy have higher mortality risk compared to people with other kidney diseases. Further studies are required to identify contributing factors to these findings.</p>","author":"Lucy S.
