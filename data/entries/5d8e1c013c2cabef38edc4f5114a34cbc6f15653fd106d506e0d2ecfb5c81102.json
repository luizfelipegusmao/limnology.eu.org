{"title":"Study on Body Weight-Length Relationship and Relative Fatness of Bigeye Grunt Brachydeuterus auritus in the Coastal Waters off Sierra Leone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1609/v1","date":1713952154000,"content":"Bigeye grunt Brachydeuterus auritus is an important economic species in the waters off Sierra Leone in West Africa, with great ecological value. Based on the survey data of bottom trawl nets from 6 voyages from 2019 to 2021, the body weight-length relationship (WLR), as well as their relative fatness, were studied in depth using the method of body length and its corresponding mean body weight. This study fitted the WLR of bigeye grunt by gender, calculated its fullness, and analyzed the influence of environmental factors. The results showed that month and gender had a significant impact on body length and weight distribution (P&amp;lt;0.01). There was a highly significant negative correlation (P&amp;lt;0.01) between the condition factor (a) and the allometric factor (b) in the WLR, and salinity significantly affects b (P&amp;lt;0.05). The (lga)/b ratio was less affected by environmental factors which may be related to the body size and density of the fish. The difference in b between male and female populations was extremely significant (P&amp;lt;0.01). The relative fatness had significant seasonal variation characteristics, with highly significant effects of sex and body length (P&amp;lt;0.01). With increasing body length, the relative fatness showed two types of changes, continuously increasing and first increasing then decreasing, with salinity and b significantly affecting the type of change (P&amp;lt;0.05) and depth having a highly significant effect (P&amp;lt;0.01). The bigeye grunt off the coast Sierra Leone exhibited significant seasonal growth characteristics, with significant differences in growth characteristics between male and female individuals. This study suggested that salinity may be the main factor affecting its growth and development. In addition, this study hypothesised that the peak breeding season may occur during the dry season, beginning in December and ending before April of the following year. The study provides updated and more comprehensive insights into the biology and ecology of the bigeye grunt offshore Sierra Leone, West Africa, which can provide scientific basis for its resource assessment, development and utilization, and resource management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d8e1c013c2cabef38edc4f5114a34cbc6f15653fd106d506e0d2ecfb5c81102","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
