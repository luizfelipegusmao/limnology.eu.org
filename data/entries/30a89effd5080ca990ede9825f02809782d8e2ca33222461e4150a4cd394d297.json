{"title":"Recent Developments on CO2 Hydrogenation Performance over Structured Zeolites: A Review on Properties, Synthesis, and Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0044/v1","date":1711962754000,"content":"This review focuses on an extensive synopsis of the recent improvements in the field of CO2 hydrogenation over structured zeolites including their properties, synthesis methods, and characterization approaches. The role of bimodal mesoporous structures surface oxygen vacancies, and the Si/Al ratio in improving catalytic activity is highlighted. The porosity, thermal stability, and structural integrity are also discussed in the review along with how structured zeolites are affected by electrical and plasma interactions. The synthesis methods are analyzed in detail by comparing the benefits and drawbacks of the bottom-up techniques, such as hard templating, soft templating, and non-templating on the one side; and the top-down approaches, e.g. dealumination, desilication, and recrystallization on the other. This review also draws attention to the necessity of overcoming the difficulties arising from these synthesis techniques, for example, micropore-induced diffusion restrictions and morphological constraints, employing innovative approaches and optimization strategies. Conventional and advanced characterization techniques are pointed out in this respect as crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanism and the dynamic behavior, hence, beneficial in the advancements of research on structured zeolites with higher efficiency and activity. The review ends with a perspective that highlights the necessity of further research in the improvement of synthesis approaches and characterization procedures of the structured zeolites to increase their catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation, a critical process of paramount importance in the global effort to reduce excessive carbon emissions and combat climate change..","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30a89effd5080ca990ede9825f02809782d8e2ca33222461e4150a4cd394d297","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
