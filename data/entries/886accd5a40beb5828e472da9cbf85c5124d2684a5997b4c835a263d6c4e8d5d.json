{"title":"Looking into the Quantification of Forensic Samples with Real-Time PCR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0581/v1","date":1715243954000,"content":"The quantification of human DNA extracts from forensic samples plays a key role in the forensic genetics process. Quantification guarantees maximum efficiency and avoids repeated analyses, over amplified samples, or unnecessary examinations. Here, we present our experience using an extremely sensitive real-time-based method with the Quantifiler® Trio DNA quantification kit, which we have explored in the ISO/IEC17025 accredited test validation process conducted in our laboratory. In this study, our focus was on establishing a minimum threshold beyond which DNA typing is unnecessary, by defining the correlation of negative quantification results with the absence of genetic profiles resulting from DNA typing. We investigated the results in the range in which the technique is used (50-0.005 ng/μl). In the validation process of the internally accredited method, we used data from the commercial quantification system, based on the average values of the standard curve using a wide range of samples, including artificially degraded samples. This method was extensively used continuously for nine years to quantify the DNA extract coming from a wide range of samples from criminal cases. The validation allowed us to verify the limits of the technique, especially in the use of the minimum quantities necessary to obtain genetic profiles acceptable for sending to the Italian DNA database. This optimization of the protocol for analysing forensic samples allows us to optimise the protocol for analysing forensic samples. However, the technique is used in our laboratory with a completely manual preparative phase, and we have decided to investigate the contribution of human error more accurately. Thus, in our experience, we have found that it is preferable to use quantification ranges rather than exact limits before deciding how to analyse the extracts via PCR. In addition, here we present some preliminary data related to the analysis of certain samples that initially appeared negative during quantification, applying a concentration method for maximum yield from forensic samples of judicial interest. Our aim is to ensure that no source of evidence is lost in the reconstruction of a criminal event.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"886accd5a40beb5828e472da9cbf85c5124d2684a5997b4c835a263d6c4e8d5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
