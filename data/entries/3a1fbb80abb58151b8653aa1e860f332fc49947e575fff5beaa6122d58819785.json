{"title":"A New Automatic Hydrological Station Relocation Algorithm (ASRA) for Moving Hydrological Stations Onto a Simulated Digital River Network","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034567?af=R","date":1714978800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Determining the precise placement of hydrological stations on a simulated digital river network is crucial for constructing hydrological models applicable to process simulation, water resource management, and flood forecasting endeavors. To solve this problem, we categorized and scrutinized deviations between the simulated and their actual station locations, and proposed a novel automatic hydrological station relocation algorithm (ASRA). The algorithm was first validated in the Amazon Basin using Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) hydrological stations and 90 m × 90 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, successfully correcting the spatial position and corresponding catchment area (CCA) of each station. Findings revealed that CCA inaccuracies were notably decreased, transitioning from an initial 7.62% when employing a conventional 5-km search radius to 5.43% after adopting an iteratively optimized, objective, and rational 8-km search radius. The ASRA method was subsequently applied to GRDC stations within the HDMA and HydroSHEDS data sets, successfully repositioning 8,339 and 8,026 stations respectively, all with catchment area deviations of less than 5%, thus either exceeding or at least equaling the precision of prior research efforts. A Python program was developed and incorporated into an ArcGIS toolbox that features user-friendly attributes, enabling swift computation and accurate rectification, as a result of building upon our method. In short, our study presents a fresh approach and a robust tool for tackling the inconsistencies of hydrological station locations. The updated global GRDC hydrological station locations specifically tailored for both HDMA and HydroSHEDS data sets, together with the toolbox developed, were accessible for download on the figshare platform.</p>","author":"Kun Wang, \nDenghua Yan, \nZuhao Zhou, \nBaisha Weng, \nTianling Qin, \nWuxia Bi, \nSiyu Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"3a1fbb80abb58151b8653aa1e860f332fc49947e575fff5beaa6122d58819785","category":"Environment"}
