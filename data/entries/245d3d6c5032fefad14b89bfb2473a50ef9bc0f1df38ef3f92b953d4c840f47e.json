{"title":"On a Unitary Solution for the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1809/v1","date":1727097578000,"content":"For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schrödinger equation was assumed\nto be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson\nseries. We study the unitarity of this solution in case of singular Hamiltonian and provide a\nnew methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is L2(R).\nThen, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution is suggested that is manifestly\nunitary, regardless of the choice of the Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional\npositive operator that normalizes the wave-function locally and allows us to preserve\nunitary even on indefinite norm spaces. Our considerations show that Schrödinger's and Liouville's\nequations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, and together they become the unified\ndescription of quantum systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"245d3d6c5032fefad14b89bfb2473a50ef9bc0f1df38ef3f92b953d4c840f47e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
