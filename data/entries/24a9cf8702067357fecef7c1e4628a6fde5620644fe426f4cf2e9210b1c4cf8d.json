{"title":"Using Muscle Element Fingerprint Analysis (EFA) to Trace and Determine the Source of Hypophthalmichthys nobilis in the Yangtze River Basin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0667/v1","date":1720501946000,"content":"Hypophthalmichthys nobilis are widely distributed in the Yangtze River basin and its related lakes. They are an important economic fish species and are a famous cultured species known as the \"Four Famous Domestic Fishes\" in China. Currently, with the fishing ban in the Yangtze River basin, fishing for H. nobilis in natural water bodies of the Yangtze River basin has been completely prohibited. In order to identify the sources of H. nobilis appearing in the market, further control and accountability, it is necessary to trace the sources of H. nobilis in the Yangtze River basin and its related water bodies. Therefore, this study identified and traced different sources of H. nobilis through muscle element fingerprint analysis (EFA). The results show that H. nobilis from different stations have characteristic element compositions. The characteristic element of H. nobilis from Wuhan (WH) is Pb, which is significantly higher than that in other stations; the characteristic element from Anqing (AQ) is Hg, which is significantly higher than that in other stations; and the characteristic element from Taihu (TH) is Al, which is significantly higher than that in other water areas. Multivariate analysis selected different spatial distribution patterns of 4 discriminant elements ratios (Pb/Ca, Cr/Ca, Na/Ca, Al/Ca) in the muscle of H. nobilis in the Yangtze River basin and its related lakes. The study suggests that the screened discriminative elements can be used to visually distinguish different sources of H. nobilis, and to quickly trace and verify the origin of newly emerging samples. Therefore, the use of selected discriminant element fingerprint features to trace the origin of new samples has been proven to be feasible. By further discriminating and verifying the muscle element fingerprints of new samples, the discrimination rate is high. Therefore, Multivariate analysis for muscle element fingerprint can be used for origin traceability of samples of unknown origin in market supervision.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24a9cf8702067357fecef7c1e4628a6fde5620644fe426f4cf2e9210b1c4cf8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
