{"title":"Associations between the waist-to-height ratio index and migraine: A cross-section study of the NHANES 1999–2004","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312321","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Jing Jin, Yafang Zheng, Tianqi Gao, Xuanyu Lin, Shi Li, Chunyuan Huang</p>\r\nBackground <p>The importance of obesity as a factor that increases the probability of migraine episodes is increasingly acknowledged. Thus, this study aimed to explore the potential correlation between central obesity and migraine, emphasizing the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as a key measure in assessing this relationship.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional analysis included 13,344 individuals who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999–2004. To investigate the association associations between WHtR and migraine, we utilized refined multivariate logistic regression models, smoothing curve fitting methods, subpopulation analysis, and interactive testing.</p> Results <p>Of the 13,344 participants, 2,764 (20.72%) had migraines. A significant positive correlation was observed between the WHtR and migraine incidence in both the partially adjusted model (3.08 [95% CI: 1.92–4.94]) and the crude model (1.95 [95% CI: 1.23–3.08]). The participants in the highest quartile of the WHtR had a 13% greater incidence of migraine than those in the lowest quartile [1.13(0.99,1.28)]. The interaction analysis revealed a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01) in this relationship among the subgroups. Notably, the correlation between WHtR and migraine risk was not significant and negative in patients ≥60 years, indicating that obesity has a mitigating role in preventing migraine in this elderly population.</p> Conclusions <p>The incidence of migraine increased concomitantly with increased WHtR. However, central obesity has a protective effect against migraine occurrence in individuals ≥60 years. Thus, our findings underscore the importance of WHtR in migraine prevention and management strategies and highlight its potential as a critical biomarker for mitigating migraine incidence.</p>","author":"Jing Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"68c03164b8687dd39cbd9d462d83ffd9602110dcd13221a6585247fe9b819938","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
