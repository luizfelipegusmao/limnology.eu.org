However, the potential influence of COVID-19 on celiac disease remains uncertain. Considering the significant association between gut microbiota alterations, COVID-19 and celiac disease, the two-step Mendelian randomization method was employed to investigate the genetic causality between COVID-19 and celiac disease, with gut microbiota as the potential mediators. We employed the genome-wide association study to select genetic instrumental variables associated with the exposure. Subsequently, these variables were utilized to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the risk of celiac disease and its potential influence on gut microbiota. Employing a two-step Mendelian randomization approach enabled the examination of potential causal relationships, encompassing: 1) the effects of COVID-19 infection, hospitalized COVID-19 and critical COVID-19 on the risk of celiac disease; 2) the influence of gut microbiota on celiac disease; and 3) the mediating impact of the gut microbiota between COVID-19 and the risk of celiac disease. Our findings revealed a significant association between critical COVID-19 and an elevated risk of celiac disease (inverse variance weighted [IVW]: <i>P</i> = 0.035). Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between critical COVID-19 and the abundance of <i>Victivallaceae</i> (IVW: <i>P</i> = 0.045). Notably, an increased <i>Victivallaceae</i> abundance exhibits a protective effect against the risk of celiac disease (IVW: <i>P</i> = 0.016). In conclusion, our analysis provides genetic evidence supporting the causal connection between critical COVID-19 and lower <i>Victivallaceae</i> abundance, thereby increasing the risk of celiac disease.","author":"Yuxin Zou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"988b1d23d456c4607063ce1e0fef6209c363128a4cccd2ad7996bfe2346be57c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
