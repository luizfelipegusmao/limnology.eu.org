The use of only ultrasound showed less oxidation capacity as indicated by only 19.1% degradation at an optimized power of 140 W, pH of 2.5, temperature of 40°C, and initial dye concentration of 15 ppm. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches involving US + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, US + Fenton, and US + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + potassium persulfate (KPS) was subsequently evaluated under optimized conditions. A notable enhancement in decolorization extent was observed for combined operations, including US + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, US + Fenton, and US + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + KPS (dual oxidant scheme) with the actual decolorization extents as 80.6%, 85%, and 92.2% respectively. An optimized scheme of US + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + KPS was also utilized to decolorize the dye at a pilot scale using a US flow cell and also an HC reactor that yielded 91.8% and 88% reductions in initial concentration. The dye decolorization was elucidated to follow first-order kinetics for all the individual and combination approaches. The obtained values of the rate constants were also utilized for the evaluation of the synergistic index. A toxicity analysis was also performed on the dye, both before and following treatment, utilizing two bacterial strains. A comparative analysis of various treatment approaches has been presented focusing on factors such as cavitational yield, operational expenses, and energy requirements. The study elucidated that the combination of US + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + KPS effectively removes Procion brilliant yellow H-E6G giving 92.2% as the maximum degradation at an operating cost of 0.1862 $/L.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nFirst depiction of cavitative degradation of Procion brilliant yellow H-E6G\nOptimizing the equipment operating parameters and chemical oxidants\nDemonstration of optimized treatment scheme at pilot scale\nEvaluation of various approaches based on synergy and costs of treatment\nUS + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + KPS is the best approach for dye degradation\n</p>","author":"Rahat F.
