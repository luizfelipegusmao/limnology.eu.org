{"title":"386 Pregnancy supportive metabolites are enhanced in Brahman cows on day 15 of the estrous cycle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/291/7757333?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Bos indicus</span>-influenced cattle are more resilient to pregnancy loss while receiving a restricted nutrient diet compared with <span>Bos taurus</span> cattle, but the mechanism behind this resilience is still unknown. To undercover this mechanism, the present study was designed with Angus (<span>Bos taurus</span>), Brangus (<span>Bos indicus</span>-influenced), and Brahman (<span>Bos indicus</span>) cows randomly assigned (d -30) to either a 100% maintenance diet (n = 22), or a 70% maintenance diet (n = 23) for 45 d. All cows were submitted to a 5-d CO-Synch + CIDR synchronization protocol on d -7 with ovulation induction representing d 0. A cervically navigated foley catheter was placed in the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum on d 15 of the estrous cycle. Approximately 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline was infused into the uterus then recovered for uterine flush analysis. Recovered uterine fluid was subjected to metabolomic analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry. A significant breed by metabolite interaction occurred (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). A treatment by metabolite interaction was also observed (<span>P</span> = 0.015) in which maintenance and restricted cows clustered within their respective treatment when plotted in an orthogonal PCA graph. Of the 101 metabolites analyzed, 7 metabolites (aspartate, glutamate, hydroxyphenylacetate, taurine, uric acid, uridine, and xanthine) differed (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) among breeds. Brahman cows had the greatest value of all 7 metabolites (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) except hydroxyphenylacetate (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). Angus and Brangus metabolomic values were similar for aspartate, taurine, and uridine (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) but differed for glutamate, hydroxyphenylacetate, uric acid, and xanthine (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Two metabolites that were greatest in Brahman cows (aspartate and glutamate) contribute significantly to the Kreb Cycle, indicating that Brahman cows have the ability to maintain proper amounts of substrates for energy production compared with Angus cows. Both glutamate and aspartate also aid in the removal of toxic ammonium as they are substrates for a-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate, respectively, which both consume ammonium in their respective reactions. Furthermore, uric acid (which has a precursor of xanthine) was also greatest in Brahman cows and is a potent antioxidant with strong capabilities of scattering reactive oxygen species. Finally, aspartate also aids in the detoxification of ammonium within the urea cycle. Taken together, these four metabolites (aspartate, glutamate, uric acid, and xanthine) are working together but separately with the overall goal to provide more functional energy, while removing unnecessary toxins which may be two mechanisms in how <span>Bos indicus</span>-influenced cows are better able to sustain optimal reproductive efficiency than Angus cows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dbe2e1021a8fb0d019b4e837c5364afbf3cf4876c71b8f05fbc29ae45299e7be","category":"Environment"}
