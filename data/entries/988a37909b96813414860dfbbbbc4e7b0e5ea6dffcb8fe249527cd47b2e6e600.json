The proportion of women who experienced violence enrolled in the Cameroon Trauma Registry (CTR) is lower than expected.</p> Methods <p>We concatenated the databases from the October 2017-December 2020 CTR and 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) into a singular database for cross-sectional study. Continuous and categorical variables were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisherâ€™s exact test. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between demographic factors and women belonging to the DHS or CTR cohort. We performed additional classification tree and random forest variable importance analyses.</p> Results <p>276 women (13%) in the CTR and 197 (13.1%) of women in the DHS endorsed violence from any perpetrator. A larger percentage of women in the DHS reported violence from an intimate partner (71.6% vs. 42.7%, p&lt;0.001). CTR women who experienced IPV demonstrated greater university-level education (13.6% vs. 5.0%, p&lt;0.001) and use of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) cooking fuel (64.4% vs. 41.1%, p&lt;0.001). DHS women who experienced IPV reported greater ownership of agricultural land (29.8% vs. 9.3%, p&lt;0.001). On regression, women who experienced IPV using LPG cooking fuel (aOR 2.55, p = 0.002) had greater odds of belonging to the CTR cohort while women who owned agricultural land (aOR 0.34, p = 0.007) had lower odds of presenting to hospital care. Classification tree variable observation demonstrated that LPG cooking fuel predicted a CTR woman who experienced IPV while ownership of agricultural land predicted a DHS woman who experienced IPV.</p> Conclusion <p>Women who experienced violence presenting for hospital care have characteristics associated with higher SES and are less likely to demonstrate factors associated with residence in a rural setting compared to the general population of women experiencing violence.</p>","author":"Mark T.
