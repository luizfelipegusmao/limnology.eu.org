Residual spin-orbit Hamiltonians are considered in order to take into account the internal structure of the molecule. As system parameters in the dissipation processes, transverse and longitudinal relaxation times are considered for stochastic solute-solvent interaction processes. The intramolecular coupling effects on the optical responses are studied using a molecule model consisting of two coupled harmonic curves of electronic energies with displaced minima in nuclear energies and positions. In this study, it was considered the complete frequency space is considered through the pump-probe detuning, not restricting the derivations to only maximums of population oscillations. This approach opens the possibility of studying the behavior of optical responses, which is very useful in experimental design. Our results indicate the sensitivity of the optical responses to parameters of the molecular structure as well as to those derived from the photonic process of FWM signal generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de7ad65cec16bf0eb87565f64c687f08b0e5f67ab9da9e8333d2748cf565621a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
