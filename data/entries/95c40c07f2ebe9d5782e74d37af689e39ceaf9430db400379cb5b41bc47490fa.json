Since 2021, COVID-19 self-tests have been extensively used in high-income countries, however, their programmatic implementation in low- and middle-income countries has been delayed. An implementation pilot, mixed-methods study, was conducted in four industrial manufacturing companies, in Kedah State between November 2022 and May 2023. Participants were asked to take COVID-19 self-tests home for themselves and their household members and to use the tests according to national guidelines. At enrolment and at the end of the study, participants completed an online sociodemographic, knowledge and satisfaction survey. Data were cleaned and analysed using SPSS Statistics V28.0. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was conducted. A total of 1768 employees from four manufacturing industries enrolled in the pilot, representing 60% of the total employees and more than 50% of employees at each site. There were 40 COVID-19-positive cases detected in participants from the manufacturing industries, and 100 positive household members. Participants reported 27 invalid test results. Individuals aged 30 or less [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.65; 95% CI: 1.63 to 4.31; p&lt;0.001] and males (AOR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.17; p = 0.014) showed a significant higher likelihood of self-testing compared to older and female participants. Additionally, individuals who received three or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine had higher odds of using self-tests (OR 1.56 (95% CI: 1.03 to 2.36, p = 0.037)). There was a significant increase in participants’ knowledge on how to correctly collect a self-sample using a nasal swab from 36,9% at baseline to 43,6% post-implementation (p = 0.004) and correct interpretation of a positive result from 80,5% at baseline to 87,6% post-implementation (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, there was a notable increase in the correct understanding of actions following a positive result, especially regarding self-isolation, which rose from 59.1% to 71.9% (p&lt;0.001). A total of 44 SSIs, and 4 FGDs with a total of 14 participants, were performed. The five main themes explored were: 1) previous experiences with COVID-19, 2) COVID-19 ST experiences during the pilot study, 3) advantages of COVID-19 ST, 4) feelings related to COVID-19 ST, 5) willingness to use COVID-19 ST again, and 6) ST for other diseases. This research shows the feasibility of a self-testing model in the community through workplaces due to participants’ high acceptability to enrol and high self-tests’ uptake. Lessons learnt can inform operational aspects of the introduction and scale-up of self-care strategies in low- and middle-income countries, in particular the South-East Asia region.","author":"Huan Keat Chan","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"95c40c07f2ebe9d5782e74d37af689e39ceaf9430db400379cb5b41bc47490fa","category":"Environment"}
