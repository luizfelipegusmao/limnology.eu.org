{"title":"Macular Ischemia Changes in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema Treated with Aflibercept and Ranibizumab","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0460/v1","date":1715157300000,"content":"Τhis study aims to assess changes in the fovea avascular zone (FAZ) in treatment naïve patients receiving aflibercept or ranibizumab injections for diabetic macular edema (DME). This is a prospective study recruiting patients with treatment-naïve DME. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) testing, OCT and OCT-angiography (OCTA) imaging were performed at baseline and 1 month after each injection. Injections of either aflibercept or ranibizumab were administered monthly for 6 consecutive months. FAZ in the superficial (SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) using OCTA was recorded for each visit. Fifty eyes from 50 patients with a mean age of 67.010.7 years were included in the study Twenty-five patients received aflibercept and 25 received ranibizumab. BCVA was 40.810.0 and increased to 52.17.9 ETDRS letters at the last visit (p&amp;lt;0.001). CRT was 295.634.0 at baseline and 247.929.7 at the last study visit (p&amp;lt;0.001). SCP FAZ was 350.679.5μm2 at baseline and 339.071.3μm2 after 6 monthly injections (p=0.132). DCP FAZ was 558.6199.0μm2 at baseline and 459.5156.1μm2 after 6 monthly injections (p&amp;lt;0.001). There was no effect of the choice of ranibizumab or aflibercept on DCP FAZ change (p=0.277). In conclusion, treatment with 6 monthly injections of ranibizumab and aflibercept led to an increase in BCVA and a decrease in CRT and DCP FAZ area. Both drugs led to an improvement in DCP ischemia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f79dfcfa2f0664c07252a79fb0090872e4ac17b6ce777d12965ad6630558446","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
