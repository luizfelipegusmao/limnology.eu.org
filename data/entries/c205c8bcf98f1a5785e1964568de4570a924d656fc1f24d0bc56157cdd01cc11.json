{"title":"Physics as the Solution to an Optimization Problem on  Entropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1009/v5","date":1721213075000,"content":"We propose a novel approach to quantum theory construction that involves solving a maximization problem on the Shannon entropy of all possible measurements of a system, relative to its initial preparation. This maximization problem is additionally constrained by a phase condition that vanishes under measurements. Specifically, enforcing a vanishing U(1)-valued phase constraint leads to standard quantum mechanics, while a vanishing Spin^c(3,1)-valued phase constraint extends the theory to relativistic quantum mechanics and to quantum gravity. The latter scenario derives the metric tensor as an operator via a double-copy mechanism  applied to the Dirac current. Significantly, this solution is consistent exclusively in 3+1-dimensions as all other dimensional configurations lead to fundamental obstructions. Finally, the solution uniquely incorporates the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) symmetries of the Standard Model. This framework seamlessly integrates fundamental concepts from quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, the dimensional specificity of spacetime, and particle physics gauge symmetries as the solution to a simple entropy optimization problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c205c8bcf98f1a5785e1964568de4570a924d656fc1f24d0bc56157cdd01cc11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
