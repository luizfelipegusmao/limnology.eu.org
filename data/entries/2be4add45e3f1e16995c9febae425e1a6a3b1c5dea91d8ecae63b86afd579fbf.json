{"title":"Beyond Genetics: The Role of Familial Comorbidities in Shaping Migraine Phenotypes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1409/v1","date":1726652667000,"content":"Introduction: Migraine is a highly disabling neurological condition with substantial variability in its clinical presentation. This study aimed to explore the influence of familial transmission of comorbid medical conditions on the phenotype of chronic and episodic migraine.\nMethods: A total of 500 patients who presented to a private tertiary headache clinic were categorized into episodic and chronic migraine groups based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms, and familial medical history were collected. Statistical analysis included chi-square and independent sample t-tests to evaluate the impact of familial comorbidities on migraine phenotypes.\nResults: Of the participants, 63% were diagnosed with episodic migraine and 37% with chronic migraine. Significant findings included higher rates of medication overuse (63.31%) and allodynia (58.82%) in patients with chronic migraine. Notably, patients with a maternal history of hypercholesterolemia showed a higher prevalence of chronic migraine (78.6%), whereas those with both parents affected tended to have episodic migraine. Educational levels are inversely correlated with the prevalence of chronic migraine, suggesting a socioeconomic influence on migraine chronification.\nDiscussion: This study highlights significant associations between familial health conditions and migraine phenotypes. The findings suggest that the maternal transmission of comorbidities, particularly hypercholesterolemia, may influence the development of chronic migraine. These results underscore the importance of considering familial medical history in the management and understanding of migraine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2be4add45e3f1e16995c9febae425e1a6a3b1c5dea91d8ecae63b86afd579fbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
