{"title":"Caritas for the Goals of the Agenda 2030: A Study on the Services Provided in Campania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2065/v1","date":1717069933000,"content":"The United Nations’ Agenda 2030 has established a series of Sustainable Development Goals to address global challenges, including poverty, food insecurity, access to education, and social inequality. In this context, charitable organizations such as Caritas play a crucial role in mitigating the negative effects of these challenges and promoting fair and sustainable development. This study aims to analyze prevalent needs among individuals seeking assistance from Caritas in Campania and examine how the organization contributes to achieving the Agenda 2030 Goals in the region. The statistical investigation techniques considered include tandem analysis [], which considers a dimension-reduction technique, such as multiple factor analysis, and, then cluster analysis to identify similar groups of individuals. These exploratory data analysis methods have allowed for the identification of common needs, including food assistance, support for education, employment, and housing assistance. Subsequently, Caritas programs and initiatives aimed at meeting these needs and promoting sustainable development are explored. The results indicate that Caritas plays a significant role in addressing the urgent needs of the vulnerable population in Campania and contributes to the goals of Agenda 2030, particularly those related to poverty alleviation, immigration, health promotion, education, employment, and reduction of social inequalities. This study provides an important perspective on the relevance and effectiveness of Caritas’ work in the context of Agenda 2030.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bde7fdca377b2294cfcba0f189468711ff9b577ee201baf52f5ddba6768677a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
