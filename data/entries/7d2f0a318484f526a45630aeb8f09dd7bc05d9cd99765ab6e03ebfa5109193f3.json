{"title":"Review of Green Water Systems for Urban Flood Resilience: Literature and Codes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1471/v1","date":1726717211000,"content":"Achieving Urban Flood Resilience (UFR) is essential for modern societies, requiring the implementation of effective practices in different countries to mitigate hydrological events. Green Water Systems (GWS) emerge as a promising alternative to achieve UFR, but they are still poorly explored and present varied definitions. This article aims to define GWS within the framework of sustainable practices and propose a regulation that promotes UFR. Through a systematic review of existing definitions and an analy-sis of international regulations on Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS), the study reveals diverse perceptions and applications of GWS and their role in Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI). The research proposes a standardized definition of GWS and their role in Blue – Green Infrastructure (BGI). The research proposes a standardized definition of GWS and the implementation of SuDS in Peru, addressing the current knowledge gap and contributing to the development of sustainable urban infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d2f0a318484f526a45630aeb8f09dd7bc05d9cd99765ab6e03ebfa5109193f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
