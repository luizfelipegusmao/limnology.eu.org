In this study, 54 papers published from 2001–2022 on QTL mapping for yield and yield-related traits in barley were collected, which contained 1080 QTLs mapped to the barley high-density consensus map for QTL meta-analysis. These initial QTLs were integrated into 85 meta-QTLs (MQTL) with a mean confidence interval (CI) of 2.76 cM, which was 7.86-fold narrower than the CI of the initial QTL. Among these 85 MQTLs, 68 MQTLs were validated in GWAS studies, and 25 breeder’s MQTLs were screened from them. Seventeen barley orthologs of yield-related genes in rice and maize were identified within the hcMQTL region based on comparative genomics strategy and were presumed to be reliable candidates for controlling yield-related traits. The results of this study provide useful information for molecular marker-assisted breeding and candidate gene mining of yield-related traits in barley.","author":"Binbin Du","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"117cc37c37e4a3d920b2959448cbf6be93b97274a4e678365ae0658aaf2ce9c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
