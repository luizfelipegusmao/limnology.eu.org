{"title":"Exploring Cellular Automata Learning: An Innovative Approach for Secure and Imperceptible Digital Image Watermarking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.1615/v2","date":1710250048000,"content":"As technology and multimedia production have advanced, there has been a significant rise in attacks on digital media, resulting in duplicated, fraudulent, and altered data and the infringement of copyright laws. This paper presents a robust and secure digital image watermarking technique that has been implemented in the spatial domain and exploits the erratic and chaotic behaviour of the powerful elementary cellular automata rule-30. The crucial characteristics of the watermarking system, i.e., imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness, have been perfectly balanced by the suggested blind watermarking technique. In this approach, prior to embedding, the grayscale watermark image is downsized to its two Most Significant Bits (MSBs). Then, the 2-MSBs watermark is encrypted using an ECA rule-30 so as to level up the security attribute of the system. Then, the host image is scrambled using ECA rule-30 to distribute the watermark pixels throughout the host image and thus achieve the highest robustness against geometrical attacks. Finally, the encrypted watermark data is embedded into the scrambled host image using the ECA rule-30-based embedding key. The proposed method performs better in terms of imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness when compared to several systems with similar competencies. The simulation's findings demonstrate strong imperceptibility as evaluated by the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which has an average value of 58.3735 dB and a high payload. The experimental outcomes, observed across a diverse range of standardized attack scenarios, unequivocally establish the ascendancy of the proposed algorithm over competing methodologies in the realm of image watermarking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a966151d64c4b6f955035fc509b8731357b6c86581141f1f55ab3657c8e74c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
