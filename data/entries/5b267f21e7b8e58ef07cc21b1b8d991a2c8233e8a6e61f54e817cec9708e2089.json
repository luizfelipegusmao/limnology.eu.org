{"title":"Loving and Healing a Hurt City: Planning a Green Monterrey Metropolitan Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1954/v1","date":1729776780000,"content":"In many conurbations, the pressure on the quality of living increases and affects the most vulnerable, human, and non-human populations the most. In this article we describe a mapping and designing investigation how a green metropolis can be developed. The approach used is to make a distinction between the landscape pain, the ways of healing and the opportunities to create environments that people can love. We found that this approach reveals concrete and widespread pain in the metropolis, such as interventions in natural landscapes (rivers and mountains), air pollution, ecological degradation, and hydrological disconnections. The strategy to heal this pain is to uncover the currently hidden and invisible creeks and rivers, then create an abundant zone of ecological space around it before integrating human activities and urban uses. In addition to this, specific design principles have been developed for hydro-ecological corridors, water retention, green islands, and greenways. These places can be replicated to support the healing strategy. These places create an environment that the urban residents love. The analysis of landscape pain, the healing strategies, and the local places to love, can be applied to enhance the quality of life for many urban residents and non-human ecologies in metropolitan areas around the globe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b267f21e7b8e58ef07cc21b1b8d991a2c8233e8a6e61f54e817cec9708e2089","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
