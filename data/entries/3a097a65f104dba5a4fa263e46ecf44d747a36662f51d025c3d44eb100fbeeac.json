Both complexes can catalyze water oxidation under neutral conditions with low onset overpotential. Combined experiments confirm that they are genuine molecular water oxidation catalysts.<br />To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.<br />The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"RSC - Sustainable Energy Fuels latest articles","siteHash":"9be9f536dce043fccd3d0947c04e723c9e53cf87a00631cd30d4859e37580993","entryHash":"3a097a65f104dba5a4fa263e46ecf44d747a36662f51d025c3d44eb100fbeeac","category":"Environment"}
