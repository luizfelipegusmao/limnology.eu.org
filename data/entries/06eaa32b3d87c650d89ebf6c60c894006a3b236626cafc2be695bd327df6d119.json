Such systems can collect very large datasets. The National Gallery of Art built one which can scan a painting up to 1.7 by 1.4 meters in size at a spatial resolution of 0.2 mm/pixel [<a href=\"#ozae044.063-B1\">1</a>]. At one pixel per second, the resulting 60 million pixels would take about two years to acquire, so pixel dwell times are necessarily short compared to whatâ€™s customary for analytical instruments. Squeezing information from limited counts is a priority even when pixel spectra can be summed over a similar area.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"06eaa32b3d87c650d89ebf6c60c894006a3b236626cafc2be695bd327df6d119","category":"Environment"}
