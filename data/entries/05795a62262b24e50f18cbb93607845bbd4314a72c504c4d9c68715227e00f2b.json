The content of total saponins increased significantly. Only 18 compounds were found in raw <i>Polygonatum</i> and 17 new compounds were presented in processed <i>Polygonatum</i>. During the processing of <i>Polygonatum</i>, the polysaccharide was partially degraded into oligosaccharides, the molecular weight gradually decreased, and the neutral sugar was converted into uronic acid, resulting in a decrease in polysaccharide content. The saponins were partially degraded into sapogenins or modified.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study clarifies the changes in the content and structure of polysaccharides and saponins in processed <i>Polygonatum</i>, which will pave the way for elucidating the processing mechanism.
