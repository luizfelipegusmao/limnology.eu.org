{"title":"Are social determinants associated with depression among married women of reproductive age? A mixed methods study from urban slums of Islamabad, Pakistan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003463","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Muhammad Ahmed Abdullah, Babar Tasneem Shaikh, Nargis Yousuf Sattar, Balaj Sarwar, Ameer Sikander Ahmed, Syeda Sara Fatima</p>\r\n\r\nDepression among married women of reproductive age is on the rise in Pakistan, owing to post-COVID-19 phase, super-inflation, increasing poverty, deteriorating law and order situation and perpetuating the uncertain political situation in the country. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with depression among married women of reproductive age in Pakistan, using a mixed methods approach. The quantitative phase utilized the Urdu version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression among 340 married women. Twelve women with higher scores on the PHQ-9 were selected for in-depth interviews in the qualitative phase. The quantitative analysis revealed a higher prevalence of depression among women with poor socioeconomic status, lower educational levels, larger family sizes, and recent deaths in the family. In the qualitative phase, the main themes identified were the impact of social conditions, such as societal expectations and gender roles, the influence of medical conditions on mental health, financial difficulties, the stress associated with caring for a larger number of children, and the emotional burden of recent deaths in the family. This study highlights the importance of addressing depression among married women of reproductive age in Pakistan. It is crucial to focus on early diagnosis and prompt treatment to mitigate the adverse effects of depression on the affected individuals and their families. Targeted interventions should consider the social determinants of depression, including improving socioeconomic conditions through safety nets, providing mental health support at the primary health care level, and addressing the specific health issues and needs of women in the reproductive age group. A multi-pronged approach and health systemâ€™s thinking can reduce the burden of depression among women, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being, productivity and quality of life.","author":"Muhammad Ahmed Abdullah","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"693a18d8f2e0eccb7c8a691cc9561d3646748889ea693844c33fe15565e9ce44","category":"Environment"}
