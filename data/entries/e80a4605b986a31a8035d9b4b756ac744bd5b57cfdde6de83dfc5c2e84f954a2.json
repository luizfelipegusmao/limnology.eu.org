{"title":"Unraveling Shikimate Dehydrogenase Inhibition by 6-Nitroquinazoline-2,4-diol and its Impact on Soybean and Maize Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1066/v1","date":1710838095000,"content":"The shikimate pathway is crucial for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants and represents a promising target for developing new herbicides. This work aimed to identify inhibitors of shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH), a key enzyme of the shikimate pathway that catalyzes the conversion of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate. Virtual screening and molecular docking were performed on the SDH active site of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSDH), and 6-nitroquinazoline-2,4-diol (NQD) was identified as a potential inhibitor. In vitro assays showed that NQD decreased the activity of AtSDH by reducing Vmax while keeping KM unchanged, indicating noncompetitive inhibition. In vivo, hydroponic experiments revealed that NQD reduced the root length of soybean and maize. Additionally, NQD increased the total protein content and certain amino acids. Soybean roots uptake NQD more efficiently than maize roots. Furthermore, NQD reduced shikimate accumulation in glyphosate-treated soybean roots, suggesting its potential to restrict the flow of metabolites along the shikimate pathway in soybean. Simultaneous treatment of maize seedlings with glyphosate and NQD accumulated gallic acid in the roots, indicating that NQD inhibits SDH in vivo. Overall, the data indicate that NQD inhibits SDH both in vitro and in vivo, providing valuable insights into the potential development of herbicides targeting SDH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e80a4605b986a31a8035d9b4b756ac744bd5b57cfdde6de83dfc5c2e84f954a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
