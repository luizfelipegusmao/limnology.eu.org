{"title":"Development and Performance Assessment of Low-Cost Sensors for Pollutants Concentration Measurement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1066/v1","date":1720927809000,"content":"The use of low cost sensors has dramatically increased in recent years in all the engineering sectors. In the field of buildings and automotive, low cost sensors open very interesting perspectives, because they allow to monitor temperature and humidity distributions together with air quality, in a widespread and punctual way and allow control of all energy parameters. The main issue still open remains the validation of the measurements. In this work, we propose an innovative approach to verify the measurements given by some low-cost systems built ad hoc for automotive applications. Two independent low-cost measurement systems have been set to measure Particulate air Matter (PM) concentration, TVOC concentration, CO2 concentration, formaldehyde concentration, air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, air flow velocity and GPS position. These systems have been calibrated by the comparison with standard and certified sensors used by the regional authority of Emilia-Romagna region (ARPAE, Italy) for characterising the air-quality. The innovation of this approach lies in both the in-field comparison of low-cost and high quality sensors and the use of proper conversion approaches for mass concentration measurements. A quantitative analysis of the sensors performance is given, with a focus on effects of time-granularity, relative humidity, mass conversion from particle counts and size detection response. The results show that the low-cost sensors measurements of air temperature, relative humidity and particle number concentration are in a good agreement with high quality sensors measurements, with a strong impact of relative humidity on performance indicators. Overall, a good quality and consistency of the data among the sensors has been achieved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11a48f7437ae0a4e9f644c20829bc38b86d85b6f4899ce58d36dc7cc1f0a9f59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
