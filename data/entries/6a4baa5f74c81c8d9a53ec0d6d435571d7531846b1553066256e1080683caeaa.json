{"title":"Sesamin Exerts Antioxidative Effect by Activating Nrf2 Transcription Factor in Glial Cells of Central Nervous System in Drosophila Larvae","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1335/v1","date":1716304954000,"content":"Sesame seeds are abundant in sesamin, which exerts health-promoting effects such as extending the lifespan of adult Drosophila and suppression of oxidative stress accumulation by activating the Nrf2 transcription factor. Here, we investigated whether sesamin activated Nrf2 in larval tissues and induced the expression of Nrf2 target genes. In sesamin-fed larvae, Nrf2 was activated in the central nervous system (CNS), gut, and salivary glands. However, ectopic expression of Keap1 (Nrf2 inhibitor) in glial cells inhibited sesamin-induced Nrf2 activation in all tissues except in the neurons, indicating that sesamin activates Nrf2 in glia. We labeled the astrocytes as well as cortex and surface glia with red fluorescence to identify these glial cell types in which Nrf2 was activated; we observed their activation in both cell types. These data suggest that sesamin may stimulate the expression of antioxidative genes in glial cells. Among the 17 candidate Nrf2 targets, the mRNA levels of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6g1 in cytochrome P450 were elevated in the CNS, gut, and salivary glands of sesamin-fed larvae. However, this did not lead to resistance against imidacloprid, which is detoxified by these enzymes. Our results suggest that sesamin may exert similar health-promoting effects on the human CNS and digestive tissues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a4baa5f74c81c8d9a53ec0d6d435571d7531846b1553066256e1080683caeaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
