{"title":"Yellow fever outbreak temporarily changes dispersal patterns in an endangered primate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0832/v1","date":1710390713000,"content":"Disease outbreaks can severely affect populations in the wild. However, their ecological consequences are poorly understood. Here, we used a multi-site capture-recapture model to investigate the impacts of a yellow fever outbreak on the endangered golden lion tamarin Leontopithecus rosalia, in the Atlantic forest, Brazil. We show that the annual adult survival rate severely declined in 2017-2018, coinciding with the outbreak period. Simultaneously, dispersal patterns changed temporarily, with a slight reduction of dispersal between groups of the same forest fragment from 3.6 to 2.8%, and a strong increase of dispersal between forest fragments, from 0.4 to 4.3%. Those results suggest that disease transmission potential was low, especially between forest fragments and advocate for a better integration of host movements and landscape configuration when evaluating species response to vector-borne diseases","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df039f09744b6d962a7167898d140f7c8f847679b64f5cae7f13245a70e024f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
