{"title":"Promoting Human-Elephant Coexistence through Integration of AI, Real-Time Alerts, and Rapid Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2065/v1","date":1719612349000,"content":"Human-elephant conflict poses serious conservation challenge in Asia and Africa. We deployed an AI-based camera-alert system in a conflict hotspot in West Bengal, India that accurately detected elephants near villages (266 events) and transmitted real-time alerts ( = 42 seconds). Among detections of separate age and sex classes, lone adult bulls were the most prone to conflict. Real-time alerts permitted rapid response by field personnel to prevent conflict at the site ( = 18.2, SD = 12.4 min to arrival). Frequent detections of humans (33,217 events) on elephant trails highlighted the value of real-time alerts. Four human fatalities and five serious injuries occurred in the study area over a two-year period prior, but none during the study (2023-2024) after deploying the AI-alerting system. Loss of lives and livelihoods underscore the urgency of applying this approach to other elephant ranges and adapting AI models to other conflict-pronespecies to promote coexistence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"262b3b3910d053563d753995c34446ca4aec219e178ee2d90f97e5a73321088e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
