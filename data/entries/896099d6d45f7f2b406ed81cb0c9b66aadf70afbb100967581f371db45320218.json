{"title":"Conservation of the moss RNA editing factor PPR78 despite the loss of its known cytidine-to-uridine editing sites is explained by a hidden extra target","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/727/7449575?rss=1","date":1700784000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cytidine (C)-to-uridine (U) RNA editing in plant organelles relies on specific RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. In the moss <span>Physcomitrium patens</span>, all such RNA editing factors feature a C-terminal DYW domain that acts as the cytidine deaminase for C-to-U conversion. PPR78 of <span>Physcomitrium</span> targets 2 mitochondrial editing sites, cox1eU755SL and rps14eU137SL. Remarkably, the latter is edited to highly variable degrees in different mosses. Here, we aimed to unravel the coevolution of PPR78 and its 2 target sites in mosses. Heterologous complementation in a <span>Physcomitrium</span> knockout line revealed that the variable editing of rps14eU137SL depends on the PPR arrays of different PPR78 orthologues but not their C-terminal domains. Intriguingly, PPR78 has remained conserved despite the simultaneous loss of editing at both known targets among Hypnales (feather mosses), suggesting it serves an additional function. Using a recently established RNA editing assay in <span>Escherichia coli</span>, we confirmed site-specific RNA editing by PPR78 in the bacterium and identified 4 additional off-targets in the bacterial transcriptome. Based on conservation profiles, we predicted ccmFNeU1465RC as a candidate editing target of PPR78 in moss mitochondrial transcriptomes. We confirmed editing at this site in several mosses and verified that PPR78 targets ccmFNeU1465RC in the bacterial editing system, explaining the conservation and functional adaptation of PPR78 during moss evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"896099d6d45f7f2b406ed81cb0c9b66aadf70afbb100967581f371db45320218","category":"Environment"}
