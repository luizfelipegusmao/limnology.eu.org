We identified new modules in experimental groups, suggesting increased integration in specific head bone elements associated with the development of subterminal and upturned mouths, which are major features of <span>Megaleporinus</span> plastic morphotypes released in the lab. Plastic responses in head shape involved differences in the magnitude of mechanical stress, which seem restricted to certain chondrocranium regions. Three bones represent a “mechanical unit” related to changes in mouth position induced by foraging mode, suggesting that functional modularity might be enhanced by the way specific regions respond to mechanical load. Differences in <span>bmp4</span> expression levels between plastic morphotypes indicate associations between molecular signaling pathways and biomechanical responses to load. Our results offer a multilevel perspective of epigenetic factors involved in plastic responses, expanding our knowledge about mechanisms of developmental plasticity that originate novel complex phenotypes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"bfc849d79d138c83dc52103c4fbbcd826ca593a375512707fddaf2793baefa3a","category":"Environment"}
