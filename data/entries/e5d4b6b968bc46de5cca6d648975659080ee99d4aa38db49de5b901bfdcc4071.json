{"title":"Proteome analysis provides insights into sex differences in <i>Holothuria Scabra</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301884","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Chuhang Cheng, FeiFei Wu, Yizhi Xu, Chunhua Ren, Ting Chen, Shella Li, Peihong Shen, Fajun Jiang</p>\r\n\r\nSex-determining mechanism is still ambiguous for sea cucumber <i>Holothuria scabra</i> which only manifests gonochorism in gonad. In this study, proteomic analysis was employed to delineate sex-related proteins and genes in gonads of <i>H</i>. <i>scabra</i>, subsequently validated through Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 5,313 proteins were identified via proteome sequencing. Among these, 817 proteins exhibited expression in both the ovary and testis, with 445 proteins displaying up-regulation and 372 proteins showing down-regulation (ovary vs testis). Furthermore, 136 and 69 proteins were identified as ovary-specific and testis-specific Differentially Abundant Proteins (DAPs), respectively. And 9 DAP coding genes which play crucial role in ovary and testis were verified by qRT-PCR. Notably, 24 ovary-bias proteins enriched in ribosome pathway strongly indicated the crucial role of ribosome in ovary. This study serves to furnish novel evidence pertaining to sex differences in <i>H</i>. <i>scabra</i>.","author":"Chuhang Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e5d4b6b968bc46de5cca6d648975659080ee99d4aa38db49de5b901bfdcc4071","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
