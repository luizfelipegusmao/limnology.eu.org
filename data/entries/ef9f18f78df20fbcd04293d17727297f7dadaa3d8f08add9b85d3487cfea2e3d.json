Calmanostraca and Diplostraca are raised to superorder, and â€ Kazacharthra and Notostraca are both treated as orders. Problems and needs regarding the systematics of large branchiopods are presented and discussed, with suggestions for moving forward, stressing the need for modern methods and defensible taxonomic definitions. Subdividing taxonomic categories may or may not be warranted, but should never be based on only one gene, or on limited taxon sampling. Furthermore, splitting species out as new genera, when the original genus is poorly defined can only lead to future problems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"ef9f18f78df20fbcd04293d17727297f7dadaa3d8f08add9b85d3487cfea2e3d","category":"Environment"}
