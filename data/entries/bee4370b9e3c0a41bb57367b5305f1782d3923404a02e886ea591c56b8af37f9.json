{"title":"The Maximum Depositional Age and Provenance of Metaterrigenous Rocks of the Lykhmanivka Syncline, Middle Dnieper Domain of the Ukrainian Shield: Implications for the Relationships between Greenstone Belts and the Kryvyi Rih &ndash; Kremenchuk Basin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0921/v1","date":1723548120000,"content":"Detrital zircons from two samples of metaterrigenous rocks from the Lykhmanivka Syncline, Middle Dnieper Domain of the Ukrainian Shield (Skelevate Formation of the Kryvyi Rih Group), have been dated by the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb method. Metasandstones from the northern part of the Syncline yield zircons belonging to four age groups: 3205 ± 20 Ma, 3089 ± 11 Ma, 2939 ± 8 Ma, and 2059 ± 4 Ma. In contrast, zircon from metasediments from the southern end of the Lykhmanivka Syncline fall within two age groups: 3174 ± 13 Ma, and 2038 ± 9 Ma. The source area was dominated by rocks of the Auly Group (3.27–3.18 Ga) and the Sura Complex (3.17–2.94 Ga). The proportion of zircons dated at 2.07–2.03 Ga, which reflects the timing of metamorphism, is 5%. The metamorphic nature of the Paleoproterozoic zircon allows us to define the maximum depositional age of the metaterrigenous rocks of the Lykhmanivka Syncline at ca. 2.9 Ga, which is in good agreement with the earlier results from the metaterrigenous rocks of the Kryvyi Rih – Kremenchuk basin. Our data also indicate the local nature of sedimentation and the absence of significant transport and mixing of detrital material within the basin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bee4370b9e3c0a41bb57367b5305f1782d3923404a02e886ea591c56b8af37f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
