Steers (<span>n</span> = 192; initial shrunk body weight [SBW] = 309 ± 20.6 kg) were assigned to microbial supplement treatment in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were control (CON): no microbial supplement prior to diet transition, and (DFM): microbial supplement orally administered prior to diet transition (20 mL of microbial supplement [Lactipro NXT, Axiota Animal Health, Fort Collins, CO] containing 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> colony forming units <span>Megasphaera elsdenii</span> NCIMB 41125). Steers were sourced from a previously conducted 49 d feedlot receiving period experiment and abruptly transitioned from a receiving diet including soybean hulls and wheatlage containing 4% dietary starch (DM basis) to a growing diet including high-moisture ear corn, dry-rolled corn, and wheatlage containing 38% dietary starch (DM basis). Diets were switched on an equal DM intake basis to achieve the abrupt change and steers were fed the 38% starch diet for 49 d until experiment completion. Prior to experiment initiation, steers (<span>n</span> = 72; <span>n</span> = 3/pen) were fitted with wireless rumination tags to track daily activity and rumination time. No differences (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.20) were observed between treatments for final SBW, average daily gain, DM intake, feed efficiency, calculated net energy (NE) for maintenance and gain, or observed-to-expected ratio of NE for maintenance and gain. Additionally, no treatment × day or treatment differences (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.12) were observed for activity or rumination measures. Minutes ruminating and active both differed (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for the main effect of day. Compared to non-supplemented steers, oral administration of <span>Megasphaera elsdenii</span> NCIMB 41125 did not improve growth performance or efficiency of dietary NE utilization in steers transitioned from a receiving diet containing 4% starch (DM basis) to a growing diet containing 38% starch (DM basis).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"6f583d6a9d85152338ba19c42170a4590a396278983bb2574131ee04830eb337","category":"Environment"}
