{"title":"On Atomic Elasticity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2056/v1","date":1727335050000,"content":"It is argued that the compressibility of individual atoms is distinct from the compressibility of matter as a whole. The latter arises from variations in interatomic spacing, whereas the former is a purely quantum effect, characteristic of a given atomic species. Its magnitude can be deduced by solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for an individual many-electron atom with modified external boundary conditions. Over a wide range of parameter space, quantum dilation or compression remains isoelectronic for neutral atoms but, at ultra-high pressures, reordering of their shell structure can occur. Their compression then ceases to be isoelectronic and their chemical properties, as well as their positioning in the Periodic Table, undergo sudden change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38fb9e7fe16adda0d98e7775fbcd603f8ea3d966bfc9851c623751c171188e55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
