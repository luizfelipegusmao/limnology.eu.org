{"title":"Removal of Micro and Nanoplastics from Water Using Magnetic Nanoparticles: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0682/v1","date":1718092111000,"content":"The spread of micro- (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in the environment has become a significant environmental concern, necessitating effective removal strategies. In this comprehensive scientific review, we examine the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as a promising technology for the removal of MPs and NPs from water.\nWe first describe the issue of MPs and NPs and their impact on the environment and human health. Then the fundamental principles of using MNPs for the removal of these pollutants will be presented, emphasizing that MNPs enable selective binding and separation of MPs and NPs from water sources.\nFurthermore, we provide a short summary of various types of MNPs that have proven effective in the removal of MPs and NPs. These include ferromagnetic nanoparticles, MNPs coated with organic polymers, as well as nanocomposites and magnetic nanostructures. We also review their properties, such as magnetic saturation, size, shape, surface functionalization and stability, and their influence on removal efficiency.\nNext, we describe different methods of utilizing MNPs for the removal of MPs and NPs. We discuss their advantages, limitations, and potential for further development in detail.\nIn the final part of the review, we provide an overview of existing studies and results demonstrating the effectiveness of using MNPs for the removal of MPs and NPs from water. We also address challenges that need to be overcome, such as nanoparticle optimization, process scalability, and the removal and recycling of nanoparticles after the completion of the process.\nThis comprehensive scientific review offers an extensive insight into the use of MNPs for the removal of MPs and NPs from water. With improved understanding and the development of advanced materials and methods, this technology can play a crucial role in addressing the issue of MPs and NPs and preserving a clean and healthy environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fead610cdde016b98544a57f2d0f932abc5918b336a0cf0de3b8ecde5147fea4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
