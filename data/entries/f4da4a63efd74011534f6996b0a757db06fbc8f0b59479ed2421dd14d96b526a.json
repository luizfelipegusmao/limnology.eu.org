{"title":"Studying Engagement in Educational Settings: A Bibliometrics on High-Impact Academic Engagement Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0341/v1","date":1722858472000,"content":"Academic engagement provides opportunities and resources for students to engage in socio-educational interactions and academic learning. Our study provides an overview of high-impact research in academic engagement and the potential causes of its high valuation in the scientific community based on a bibliometric analysis of 4667 articles indexed in Web of Science, processed mainly by VOSviewer software. In terms of results, the publication of selected articles grows exponentially year by year, presenting concentration levels of 1% in authorship, 49% in a single country, and 5% of the journals. As well as 6% in highly cited articles, which in this case is associated with authors with high levels of publication. The most cited current topics are those relating academic engagement with motivation and emotional aspects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4da4a63efd74011534f6996b0a757db06fbc8f0b59479ed2421dd14d96b526a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
