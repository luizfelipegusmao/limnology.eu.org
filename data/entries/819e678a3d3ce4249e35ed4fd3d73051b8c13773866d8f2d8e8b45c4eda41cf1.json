High-resolution microscopy techniques present several advantages, such as their accessibility and accuracy in the information obtained from a micrograph. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is well-known as a nanometric spatial resolution technique used to elucidate the crystalline structure of materials under various conditions. Previous works reveal the importance of elucidating the crystalline structure in organic samples, such as cellulose nanoparticles [<a href=\"#ozae044.1001-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1001-B2\">2</a>]. For inorganic materials such as titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), the crystallographic study is well-known under standard techniques; however, only a few reports are found in the literature to explain the obtention of crystalline planes using TEM and image analysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"819e678a3d3ce4249e35ed4fd3d73051b8c13773866d8f2d8e8b45c4eda41cf1","category":"Environment"}
