Turin</p>\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the COVID-19 pandemic was initially characterized by emergency government responses that disrupted daily life, especially for marginalized groups. This study explored the vulnerabilities and capacities of international students studying at a university in Calgary, Canada during the first phase of the pandemic. Guided by the Capacities and Vulnerabilities Analysis framework, we thematically analyzed 11 semi-structured interviews with international students. We found that material vulnerabilities included <i>balancing finances</i>, <i>housing conditions</i>, <i>lack of information</i>, <i>food inaccessibility</i>, <i>reliance on public transport</i>, and <i>poor mental health</i>, social vulnerabilities included <i>lack of social support</i>, <i>culture shock</i>, and <i>racism</i>, and attitudinal vulnerabilities included <i>“nowhere to go”</i>, <i>feeling like a burden</i>, and <i>perception of Canada as safe</i>. Material capacities included <i>financial support</i>, <i>knowledge about pandemic</i>, and <i>mental health supports</i>, social capacities included <i>local social support</i> and <i>multilingualism</i>, and attitudinal capacities included <i>resilience</i>, <i>religious and spiritual beliefs</i>, <i>“it’s not just about you”</i>, and <i>reflexivity</i>. We found overlapping and complex relationships between vulnerabilities and capacities, indicating that while international students’ vulnerabilities were exacerbated and introduced challenges during the pandemic, students uniquely leveraged their capacities to offset and recover from challenges. Findings from this study may be informative for stakeholders involved in disaster responses, especially universities and governments, to support international students’ capacities and address their vulnerabilities.","author":"Ayisha Khalid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aa8f6c3f86f838492cb38f405bc4cec20b3ff688877db1b802663c7fe2b0a437","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
