{"title":"Direct Use of Copper Slag as Photocatalytic Material for Solar Hydrogen Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0800/v1","date":1720613117000,"content":"Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy carrier, offering a viable solution to address our current global energy demands. Solar energy stands out as a primary source of renewable power and has the potential to produce hydrogen through the utilization of solar cells. The quest for efficient, durable, and cost-effective photocatalysts is imperative for the advancement of solar-driven hydrogen generation. Copper slag, a by-product stemming from copper smelting and refining processes, primarily consists of metal oxides like hematite, silica, and alumina. This composition renders it a compelling secondary resource for deployment as a photocatalyst, thereby diverting copper slag from landfills. This review aims to comprehensively examine copper slag as a photocatalytic material, exploring its chemical, physical, photocatalytic, and electrochemical properties. Furthermore, it assesses its suitability for water treatment and its potential as an emerging material for large-scale solar hydrogen production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f098a02e8e49039c0e1ebbc745b218f58591f5196daf97668f30ec19bb5e041","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
