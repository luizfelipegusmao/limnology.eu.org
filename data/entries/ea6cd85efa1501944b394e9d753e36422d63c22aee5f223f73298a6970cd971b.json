A counter-strategy to address this important problem is the environmental cleaning and disinfection, [<a href=\"#ozae044.401-B2\">2</a>] currently, there is a wide variety of disinfectant chemical products (alcohols, chlorines, hydrogen peroxide, etc.) and physical processes (UV-C light, heat) of high efficiency; however, research is being performed in order to improve disinfection rates in the hospital environment, especially against multi-drug resistant pathogens. However, microorganisms develop resistance against antimicrobial compounds [<a href=\"#ozae044.401-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.401-B4\">4</a>], and the estimated surface contamination is reported in values of 5 to 30% despite the application of appropriate cleaning and disinfection protocols. The ineffectiveness of existing cleaning and disinfection formulations can be attributed to the presence of dry biofilm, where the survival of vegetative bacteria has been demonstrated for long periods [<a href=\"#ozae044.401-B5\">5</a>]. This problem requires of new disinfection methods to be tested to help control the appearance of drug resistant microorganisms. Electrical current is a disinfection method that is being tested against microorganisms in static fluids and other scenarios that simulate real life situations [<a href=\"#ozae044.401-B6\">6</a>]; according to results on recent reports, itâ€™s a promising method that needs to be further studied in order to analyze the effects in cellular metabolism and structural components. In this research work the effect of electrical current, alone or in combination with UV-C light, was tested on <span>Candida albicans</span>, a fungus of great interest due to the high rates of systemic infections and mortality it causes in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"#ozae044.401-B7\">7</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ea6cd85efa1501944b394e9d753e36422d63c22aee5f223f73298a6970cd971b","category":"Environment"}
