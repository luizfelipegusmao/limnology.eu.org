{"title":"The Effects of Videogame Skills Across Diverse Genres on Verbal and Visuospatial Short-Term and Working Memory, Hand-Eye Coordination, and Empathy in Early Adulthood","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1813/v2","date":1723018996000,"content":"The cognitive and affective impacts of video games are subjects of ongoing debate, with recent research recognizing their potential benefits. This study employs the Gaming Skill Questionnaire (GSQ) to evaluate participants' gaming skills across six genres and overall proficiency. Eighty-eight individuals aged 20-40 participated, completed assessments of empathy and six cognitive abilities: verbal short-term memory, verbal working memory, visuospatial short-term memory, visuospatial working memory, psychomotor speed (hand-eye coordination), and attention. Cognitive abilities were examined using the Digit Span Test, Corsi Block Test, and Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Task, while empathy was assessed using the Empathy Quotient Questionnaire. Findings indicate that high video game skill levels correlate with improvements in visuospatial short-term and working memory, psychomotor speed, and attention. Different genres enhanced specific skills: RPGs positively influenced verbal working and visuospatial short-term memory but negatively affected empathy; action games improved psychomotor speed and attention; and puzzle games benefited visuospatial working memory. These promising results contribute positively to ongoing research on the cognitive and affective effects of video games, highlighting the potential for video games to enhance certain cognitive functions while also underscoring the complexity of their impact on empathy. Future research should further investigate genre-specific effects and long-term outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6e109e9e2329dd43bc9788e08863d656f4abd9079acaa017cf2f2cd1dc0b17f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
