{"title":"The transcription factor RhMYB17 regulates the homeotic transformation of floral organs in rose (Rosa hybrida) under cold stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2965/7624089?rss=1","date":1709769600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Low temperatures affect flower development in rose (<span>Rosa hybrida</span>), increasing petaloid stamen number and reducing normal stamen number. We identified the low-temperature-responsive R2R3-MYB transcription factor RhMYB17, which is homologous to Arabidopsis MYB17 by similarity of protein sequences. <span>RhMYB17</span> was up-regulated at low temperatures, and <span>RhMYB17</span> transcripts accumulated in floral buds. Transient silencing of <span>RhMYB17</span> by virus-induced gene silencing decreased petaloid stamen number and increased normal stamen number. According to the ABCDE model of floral organ identity, class A genes <span>APETALA 1</span> (<span>AP1</span>) and <span>AP2</span> contribute to sepal and petal formation. Transcription factor binding analysis identified RhMYB17 binding sites in the promoters of rose <span>APETALA 2</span> (<span>RhAP2</span>) and <span>APETALA 2-LIKE</span> (<span>RhAP2L</span>). Yeast one-hybrid assays, dual-luciferase reporter assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that RhMYB17 directly binds to the promoters of <span>RhAP2</span> and <span>RhAP2L</span>, thereby activating their expression. RNA sequencing further demonstrated that RhMYB17 plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of class A genes, and indirectly influences the expression of the class C gene. This study reveals a novel mechanism for the homeotic transformation of floral organs in response to low temperatures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"96265b15e11cc08b802ebae71e64a81c785fcb734ab77094895adf6ea25741b1","category":"Environment"}
