{"title":"ESG into Supply Chain Management in SMEs: Effect Factors and Implementation Path","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0830/v1","date":1726044484000,"content":"With the increased global attention to environmental protection, social responsibility and corporate governance (ESG) standards, integrating ESG into supply chain management (SCM) is becoming a strategic requirement for companies to achieve competitiveness and sustainable development. This study reviews the impact factors of ESG practices on supply chain competitiveness, and empirically examines the mechanism of ESG performance on supply chains through a questionnaire survey with a sample of Chinese SMEs. It was found that normative pressure, coercive pressure and imitative pressure in SMEs have a significant positive effect on cognition and attitude and perceived behavioral control; good corporate cognition and attitude, perceived behavioral control and corporate pressure also enhance the level of ESG practices. Further analysis shows that cognition and attitude and perceived behavioral control play a mediating role in the impact of ESG practices, and ESG performance promotes sustainable development of SMEs. The article puts forward the following suggestions: (1) close supply chain partnerships to enhance green innovation; (2) the government should give more resource support to ESG-invested enterprises and support the development of advantageous enterprises; (3) improve the corporate disclosure mechanism and strengthen the supervision; and (4) strengthen the training of professionals in supply chain ESG management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ec4bb9f5210f66eea794006ff2a0f485458a3ac7c0c70c41b65391c57e15794","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
