{"title":"Variability in strawberry tunnels impacts fruit quality and limits melatonin effects","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13951?af=R","date":1728724468000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Fluctuations in environmental conditions within fields and crop plant performance can greatly affect production and quality standards. These factors are particularly relevant for producers, who require sustained optimal production to profit from small margins. Fluctuations might be exacerbated at the end of the crop season, where neither of the aforementioned factors are optimal. In the present integrated study, we assess strawberries' nutritional quality and the impact of harvest timing, tunnel conditions and inter-individual variability in a Mediterranean production tunnel divided into blocks, where two harvests were performed 3 weeks apart. In addition, the effects of sprayed melatonin at the end of productive season were also evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>End-season harvesting negatively impacted fruit hydration, antioxidant capacity and ripening-related hormones in strawberry fruits. Additionally, tunnel distribution influenced fruit nutritional quality, with light radiation being the main variable factor disturbing antioxidant contents. Nutrients exhibited high inter-individual plant variability, accounting for 20% variation, and were strongly correlated with fruit hydration and ripening-related phytohormones. Finally, melatonin applications affected neither fruit production, nor nutritional parameters, for which the effects were masked by the intrinsic strawberry variability. Overall, the results underline the limitations of this type of application for field implementation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Fruit quality variation in strawberry fields is explained by environmental and inter-individual variability. Likewise, the implementation of regulatory molecules such as melatonin in field applications relies on crop homogeneity and might have limited applicability in heterogeneous productive systems. Consequently, identifying and reducing microclimate variability in productive fields is paramount for advancing agricultural practices to uphold unwavering standards on fruit quality. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Alba Arabia, \nNúria Pallarés, \nSergi Munné‐Bosch, \nPaula Muñoz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"929bda6797a5e0e58369ec4d94efc875e5c7a62060a2174cad9e1b8eb2717b26","category":"Environment"}
