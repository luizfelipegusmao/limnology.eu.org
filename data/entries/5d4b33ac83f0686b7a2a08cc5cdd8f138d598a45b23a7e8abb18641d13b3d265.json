Methods: A total of 37 community-dwelling adults, mean age 61.78±6.88, 73% female, who took part in fall risk screening actions in the central region of Portugal, were assessed. The protocol included sociodemographic and history of falls questions, the Self-Efficacy for Exercise questionnaire, the Activities and Participation Profile Related to Mobility (PAPM) and three functional tests, namely the 10-Meter Walking Speed (10-MWS), TUG and 30 Seconds Sit to Stand (30s STS) tests. Within an interval of 18-24 hours after the face-to-face moment, the participants were instructed to self-administer the TUG test at home. The validity and reliability of self-administered TUG test were examined using the limits of agreement, clinically acceptable limit, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), paired t-tests and Pearson´s coefficient correlation (r). Results: The limits of agreement for self-administered assessment were within the clinically acceptable limits. The average result of the face-to-face TUG test and self-administered TUG test was 7.47 ± 2.45 and 7.57 ± 3.10 seconds, respectively. When comparing the two evaluations, they were strongly associated (r=0.716, p&lt;0.001), with an excellent ICC of 0.82 (0.65-0.91), for a 95% confidence interval. Conclusion: The use of the self-administered TUG test for the screening of risk of fall, using low-cost technology, appears to be valid and reliable in community-dwelling adults aged 50 and over.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d4b33ac83f0686b7a2a08cc5cdd8f138d598a45b23a7e8abb18641d13b3d265","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
