{"title":"N‐Nitrosamines: a potential hazard in processed meat products","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13102?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Nitrite, nitrate, and their salts are added to processed meat products to improve color, flavor, and shelf life and to lower the microbial burden. <i>N</i>-Nitrosamine compounds are formed when nitrosing agents (such as secondary nitrosamines) in meat products interact with nitrites and nitrates that have been added to the meat. With the consumption of such meat products, nitrosation reactions occur in the human body and <i>N</i>-nitrosamine formation occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the benefits nitrites and nitrates have on food, their tendency to create nitrosamines and an increase in the body's nitrous amine load presents health risks. The inclusion of nitrosamine compounds in possible and probable carcinogen classes according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer requires a re-examination of the literature review on processed meat products. This article evaluates the connections between various cancer types and nitrosamines found in processed meat products. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Gülsüm Deveci, \nNilüfer Acar Tek","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"137c1277bc2cdc5996a5a1c51bd5d0d1a544dd4f316c2c2a6fd4269850011616","category":"Environment"}
