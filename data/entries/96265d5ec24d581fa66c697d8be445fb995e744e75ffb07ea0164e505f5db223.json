{"title":"Sticking the landing: A comparison of shod vs barefoot landing kinetics and foot muscle characteristics in gymnasts, cheerleaders, and non-athletes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309157","date":1728050400000,"content":"<p>by Sarah T.

The similarities and contrasts between these sports, where one trains primarily barefoot and the other shod, may increase understanding of the kinetic role of the foot during landings. Design: Sixteen gymnasts (GYM), sixteen cheerleaders (CHR), and sixteen non-athletes (NAT) performed single-foot shod and barefoot drop landings onto a force plate. Method: Foot muscle strength was assessed using a custom test and ultrasound imaging was used to measure six foot muscles. Group differences in muscle sizes and strength measurements were compared using one-way ANOVAs (α = 0.05). Landing mechanics metrics were evaluated using 3 x 2 between-within ANOVAs (α = 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were made using Tukey post-hoc tests. Results: Barefoot landings resulted in greater peak vertical ground reaction force (pVGRF) and lower time to pVGRF (TTpVGRF). Significant group main effect differences were found between GYM and NAT for all kinetic measures (GYM: shorter time to stability (TTS) and TTpVGRF, and greater pVGRF), while no significant differences in landing kinetics were found between CHR and either GYM or NAT. No interactions were found between group and condition. GYM and CHR had significantly greater summed foot muscle size than NAT, however, only CHR displayed significantly greater toe flexion force than NAT. Conclusions: Our data suggests that while wearing shoes does not affect groups differently, footwear reduces initial peak VGRFs but does not influence later stabilization times.","author":"Sarah T.
