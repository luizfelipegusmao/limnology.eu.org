{"title":"Premelting Theory‚ÄêBased Mechanism for Water Freezing in Saline Soil","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR038013?af=R","date":1728299917000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The unfrozen water content constitutes a pivotal parameter in freezing soil, significantly impacting its thermal-mechanical and deformation behavior. This study delves into the alterations in soil attributes as unfrozen water content varies. It examines the influences of impurities, van der Waals forces, and Coulomb forces on the water film, employing the premelting theory as a foundation. A critical state curve quantifying the ratio of the surface charge density to impurity concentration is parameterized for various soil types. Subsequently, combining the theory of effective solution concentration, we have provided calculation methods for the particle surface parameters of pore solutions as ideal and non-ideal dilute solutions, respectively. This has determined the key variables in the model. Additionally, through the integration of equivalent particle sizes, packing structure, and water film thickness, a calculation model is devised and verified for determining the unfrozen water content and residual water content within in freezing soil. The findings indicate that fluctuation in the unfrozen water content primarily stem from impurities. In soils with equivalent saline content, impurity levels exhibit proportionality to the equivalent particle sizes. The residual unfrozen water is predominantly present within the absorbed water layer.</p>","author":"Xusheng Wan, \nJishuai Zhu, \nYing Lai, \nJianguo Lu, \nZhongrui Yan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"23332b7286d7760cc740dbbaf1e4e6d49bee94b30c60bde2ecb3dc5a145ab870","category":"Environment"}
