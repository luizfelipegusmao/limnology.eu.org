{"title":"Impact Resistance of Potential Replacement Materials for Large Power Transformer Tanks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0513/v1","date":1723027803000,"content":"A recently published article posited the use of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) as a replacement material for low-carbon steel (LCS) in large power transformer (LPT) tanks [1].  PMCs offer potential advantages such as weight reduction, corrosion prevention, and self-healing of the tank material which may not be achievable with traditional LCS. LCS can arrest ballistic projectiles at relatively low velocities, but at higher velocities, penetration can occur leading to a potential major transformer failure. Numerical simulations of steel projectile impacts upon LCS plates and glass and/or carbon fiber polymer composite laminates showed that with sufficient thickness both could prevent projectile penetration. This prevention was especially efficient when the plates were coated with a high strain rate sensitive material such as polyurea (PU). Our simulations show that the addition of a 3 mm coating of PU to a standard 10 mm thick LCS plate used in LPT tanks could prevent penetration of a 400 m/s steel projectile. For PMC plates, the simulations with the same projectile velocity showed three times faster deceleration with a 3 mm PU coating than without the coating. Thus, two realistic approaches to improving the ballistic protection of LPTs are presented. In addition to their other advantages, this research clearly shows that PMCs with the coating could provide significant ballistic protection for the next generation of LPT tanks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d4dc730e294741d8a610a5743d6c681a744d7dc3d103375a6dac1d51ee7068a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
