{"title":"An Exhaustive Exploration of the Semaglutide-GLP-1R Sequence Space towards the Design of Semaglutide Analogues with Elevated Binding Affinity to GLP-1R","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0258/v1","date":1714982419000,"content":"Semaglutide is a potent GLP-1 receptor agonist used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its ability to regulate blood glucose levels and promote weight loss.  On July 26, 2021, with a manually defined set of computational structural and biophysical analysis, a simple Val27-Arg28 exchange was for the first time introduced in the backbone of semaglutide to strengthen the semaglutide-GLP-1R binding affinity. In this article, a comprehensive structural and biophysical analysis approach is for the first time proposed towards an exhaustive exploration of the semaglutide-GLP-1R sequence space for the design of semaglutide analogues with elevated binding affinity to GLP-1R, thereby potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy of structurally conceivable semaglutide analogues. Through structure biophysics-based rational design and computational modeling, this article puts forward a set of semaglutide analogues and calculated their binding affinities to GLP-1R, with one particular semaglutide analogue-GLP-1R structural model reaching a Kd of 3.0 × 10-8 M, while the Kd is 3.4 × 10-6 M for the binding of native semaglutide to GLP-1. Overall, the computationally designed semaglutide analogues here constitute a hopeful approach for developing GLP-1 receptor agonists with improved efficacy for the treatment of diabetes and weight management in future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f4674f776a1dc2d3d2821d73a429fe4933d9fe100faa27d6b680c1d92be4d35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
