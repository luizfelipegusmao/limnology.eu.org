{"title":"Impact of Using n-Octanol/Diesel Blends on the Performance and Emissions of a Direct-Injection Diesel Engine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0150/v1","date":1714706822000,"content":"This study evaluates the viability of n-octanol as an alternative fuel in a direct-injection diesel engine, aiming to enhance sustainability and efficiency. Experiments employed varying blends of n-octanol (10%, 30%, and 50% by volume) with pure diesel, analyzing impacts on engine performance and emissions. The methodology involved testing each blend in a single-cylinder engine, measuring engine performance parameters such as brake torque and brake power under full load conditions across an engine speed range from 1400 to 2500 rpm. Comparative assessments of performance and emission characteristics at a constant engine speed of 1700 rpm were also conducted with varying loads. Results indicated that while n-octanol blends consistently improved brake thermal efficiency, they also increased brake specific fuel consumption due to the lower energy content of n-octanol. Consequently, while all n-octanol blends reduced nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions compared to pure diesel, they also significantly decreased carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and smoke opacity, presenting a comprehensive reduction in harmful emissions. However, the benefits came with nuanced trade-offs: notably, higher concentrations of n-octanol (especially the 50% blend) led to a relative increase in NOx emissions as the octanol ratio increased. The study concludes that n-octanol significantly improves engine efficiency and reduces diesel dependence, but optimizing the blend ratio is crucial to balance performance improvements with comprehensive emission reductions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17acdb00b71c3f527aa7b10f8671acf47d551916147d1d3644f802dcb1953e43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
