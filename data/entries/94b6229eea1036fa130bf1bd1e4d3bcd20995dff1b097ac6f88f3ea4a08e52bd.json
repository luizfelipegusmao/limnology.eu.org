{"title":"Women Utilization of Urban Green Spaces in Jordan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1803/v1","date":1724666454000,"content":"This study seeks to comprehend the complex and diverse dynamics of women's encounters with urban green areas in the specific setting of Jordan. The utilization of the focus group methodology facilitated the organization of unstructured talks involving a cohort of twenty-seven female participants, which yielded intricate and perceptive perspectives on their opinions. This study revealed a widespread pattern of stigmatization and unfavorable assessment of women who utilize public areas, which is strongly ingrained in cultural norms and gender expectations. Women were also concerned about the potential harm to their reputation and the censure of society, which ultimately deterred women from participating in public spheres.  The research thus centers on the close proximity and insufficiency of urban green areas in Jordan, which is worsened by high urban density. Insufficient lighting and security measures are responsible for further limiting women's access to areas like these, which also raises concerns about safety. Recent evidence has revealed deficiencies in infrastructure designed to accommodate the needs of women, particularly in public restroom facilities. This study emphasizes the immediate necessity for a fundamental change in urban policy and planning, towards more inclusive approaches. Within this strategic framework for urban policy, there is a strong emphasis on incorporating aesthetics, comfort, and safety elements to enhance the whole urban experience for women. Consequently, addressing this issue necessitates using gender-responsive strategies in urban design and planning. This includes enhancing the quality, cleanliness, and privacy aspects of facilities to cater to the specific needs of women and improve their overall well-being.   This study contends that any ongoing discussion on sustainable urban development in Jordan must take into account the interaction between urbanization, accessibility to public spaces, and the well-being of women. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a worldwide effort to advocate for urban policies that include both genders. This program aims to propose innovative approaches to governance, security measures, and municipal infrastructures that are sensitive to gender-related issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94b6229eea1036fa130bf1bd1e4d3bcd20995dff1b097ac6f88f3ea4a08e52bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
