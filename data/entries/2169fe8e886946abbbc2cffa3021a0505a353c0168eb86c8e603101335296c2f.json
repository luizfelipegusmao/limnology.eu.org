{"title":"Protein Biomarkers of Gastric Preneoplasia and Cancer Lesions in Blood: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2470/v1","date":1722351625000,"content":"Gastric cancer (GC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, often associated with a bad prognosis because of its asymptomatic phenotype until advanced stages, highlighting the need for its prevention and early detection. GC development is preceded by gastric preneoplasia lesions (GPNL), namely atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia (DYS). GC is currently diagnosed by endoscopy, which is invasive and costly and has limited effectiveness for the detection of GPNL. Therefore, the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers in liquid biopsies, such as blood samples, to identify the presence of gastric preneoplasia and/or cancer lesions at an asymptomatic stage, is of paramount interest. This comprehensive review provides an overview of plasma/serum proteins recently identified and their diagnostic performance for the prediction of GPNL and early cancer lesions. Autoantibodies appear as promising biomarkers for AG, IM and early gastric cancer detection, along with inflammation and immunity-related proteins and antibodies against H. pylori virulence factors. There is a lack of specific protein biomarkers to detect DYS. Despite the need for further investigation and validation, some emerging candidates could pave the way to develop reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tests for the detection and prevention of GC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2169fe8e886946abbbc2cffa3021a0505a353c0168eb86c8e603101335296c2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
