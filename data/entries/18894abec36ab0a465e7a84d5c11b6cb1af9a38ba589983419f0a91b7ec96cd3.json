{"title":"Interplay Between the Circadian Clock and Sirtuins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1202/v1","date":1726473587000,"content":"The circadian clock is an autonomous timekeeping system evolved by organisms to adapt to external changes, regulating a variety of important physiological and behavioral processes. Recent studies have shown that the sirtuin family of histone deacetylases is involved in regulating the expression of clock genes and plays an important role in maintaining the normal rhythm of clock gene expression and behavior. Moreover, sirtuins are regulated directly or indirectly by the circadian clock system. The mutual regulation between the circadian clock and sirtuins is likely involved in a variety of signal transduction and metabolism processes. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms and research progress on the intertwined relationship between the circadian clock and sirtuins, highlighting sirtuins as molecular links between metabolic control and circadian rhythms and offering our perspectives on future developments in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18894abec36ab0a465e7a84d5c11b6cb1af9a38ba589983419f0a91b7ec96cd3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
