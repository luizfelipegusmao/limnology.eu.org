{"title":"Study of Antibacterial Properties of Cinnamaldehyde against Aeromonas hydrophila","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/1191123?af=R","date":1675670400000,"content":"<p>Antibacterial properties of cinnamaldehyde against <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> were assayed in this study. To investigate the action mechanisms of cinnamaldehyde against <i>A. hydrophila</i>, we examined the antibacterial activity, bacterial membrane permeability, and ultrastructure of <i>A. hydrophila</i> cells treated with cinnamaldehyde. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of cinnamaldehyde against <i>A. hydrophila</i> NJ-35 was found to be 0.039 mg/mL. The trends of the growth curve of <i>A. hydrophila</i> treated with different concentrations of cinnamaldehyde (from 1/4 MIC to 2 MIC) were different, and there was a significant difference in the growth curve of different groups of treatment. There were significant differences in the K<sup>+</sup> concentration among all treatment groups from 1 h to 5 h after incubation compared with that of the control. The highest K<sup>+</sup> concentration was observed in the 1 MIC group of cinnamaldehyde. The ultrastructure of <i>A. hydrophila</i> cells treated with cinnamaldehyde was destroyed, and the morphology changed. These results indicated that cinnamaldehyde could inhibit the growth of <i>A. hydrophila</i>, increase bacterial membrane permeability, and damage cell membrane integrity, resulting in leakage of the <i>A. hydrophila</i> cell contents.</p>","author":"Jiaqiao Pei, \nCunxin Sun, \nBo Liu, \nQunlan Zhou, \nXiaochuan Zheng, \nBo Liu, \nChuanjiang Zhao, \nChao Sun, \nZhitao Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"c8baa5b7ff25adca17bf8bfe800564c5b8737985fb9e474349b3955cfbed66f4","category":"Environment"}
