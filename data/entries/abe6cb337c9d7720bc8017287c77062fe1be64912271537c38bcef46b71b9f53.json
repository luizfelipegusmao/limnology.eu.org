{"title":"Genetic drift drives faster-Z evolution in the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/9/1594/7691427?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>How sex chromosomes evolve compared to autosomes remains an unresolved question in population genetics. Most studies focus on only a handful of taxa, resulting in uncertainty over whether observed patterns reflect general processes or idiosyncrasies in particular clades. For example, in female heterogametic (ZW) systems, bird Z chromosomes tend to evolve quickly but not adaptively, while in Lepidopterans they evolve adaptively, but not always quickly. To understand how these observations fit into broader evolutionary patterns, we explore Z chromosome evolution outside of these two well-studied clades. We utilize a publicly available genome, gene expression, population, and outgroup data in the salmon louse <span>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</span>, an important agricultural pest copepod. We find that the Z chromosome is faster evolving than autosomes, but that this effect is driven by increased drift rather than adaptive evolution. Due to high rates of female reproductive failure, the Z chromosome exhibits a slightly lower effective population size than the autosomes which is nonetheless to decrease efficiency of hemizygous selection acting on the Z. These results highlight the usefulness of organismal life history in calibrating population genetic expectations and demonstrate the value of the ever-expanding wealth of publicly available data to help resolve outstanding evolutionary questions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"abe6cb337c9d7720bc8017287c77062fe1be64912271537c38bcef46b71b9f53","category":"Environment"}
