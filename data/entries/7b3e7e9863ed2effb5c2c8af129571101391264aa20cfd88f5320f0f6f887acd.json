{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Deep Learning Activities in the Mathematics Classroom on Students&rsquo; Academic Performance: A Comprehensive Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1551/v1","date":1711437818000,"content":"The study aimed to investigate the impact of incorporating deep learning strategies in mathematics instruction on students' problem-solving abilities, critical thinking skills, academic achievement, and mathematical skills development. The study population consisted of 280 students, with a sample size of 162 participants. Employing a purely quantitative approach, data collection utilized questionnaires and achievement tests as instruments. Data analysis involved simple linear regression, descriptive analysis, and Pearson correlation. The results of the study revealed that there was no significant enhancement observed in students' problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills when deep learning strategies were incorporated into mathematics instruction. Additionally, students' attitudes towards deep learning activities in mathematics showed no effect on their academic achievement. Furthermore, students' engagement levels in deep learning activities did not impact their development of mathematical skills. Lastly, the frequency of deep learning activities in the mathematics classroom did not show a significant relationship with students' academic performance. These findings suggest that the implementation of deep learning strategies in mathematics instruction did not yield notable improvements in the specified areas based on the study outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b3e7e9863ed2effb5c2c8af129571101391264aa20cfd88f5320f0f6f887acd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
