{"title":"Conservation, Evolution and Restauration Analysis of the Vegetation and the Beach Dune System of Enebrales Beach (Huelva, Spain)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0017/v1","date":1725276257000,"content":"This study investigates the evolution of the vegetation and beach dune system at Enebrales Beach in Huelva, Spain, from 2003 to 2022. Utilizing orthophotographs and advanced GIS techniques, we analyzed changes in natural surface areas, vegetation cover, and dune stability. The results demonstrate significant ecological improvements: a recovery of 25,300 m² in dunes and 7,400 m² in beach areas, and a total vegetation cover increase of nearly 10,000 m². Interventions, including reforestation with native species and the stabilization of dune ridges, have been effective in enhancing the coastal ecosystem's resilience. Additionally, the beach's carrying capacity increased, allowing for approximately 2,000 more users without compromising ecological integrity. These findings underscore the importance of continued conservation efforts and adaptive management to maintain and further improve the ecological health and sustainability of Enebrales Beach Dune.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40b5f5df86e6c5f8715e9ed8286122f0f36c7dce0d77e9c4cd32f5b9b3668af4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
