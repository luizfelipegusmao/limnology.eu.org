{"title":"Challenges and Opportunities in Managing Geriatric Depression: The Role of Personalized Medicine and Age-Appropriate Therapeutic Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0515/v1","date":1728401921000,"content":"The global aging population has experienced rapid growth in recent decades, leading to an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, among older adults. Depression in the elderly is often compounded by chronic physical conditions and various psychosocial factors, significantly impacting their quality of life. This paper explores the epidemiology of geriatric depression, highlighting the influence of gender, race, and socio-economic status on its prevalence. The classification and diagnosis of geriatric depressive disorders, based on ICD-11 and DSM-5 criteria, reveal the complexity of managing these conditions in older adults. Personalized Medicine (PM) emerges as a promising approach, focusing on tailoring treatments to the individualâ€™s genetic, clinical, and environmental characteristics. However, the application of PM in this demographic faces challenges, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical forms. The need for age-appropriate drug delivery systems is critical, given the prevalence of polypharmacy and issues such as dysphagia among the elderly. This study emphasizes the importance of developing patient-centric formulations to enhance the effectiveness of personalized therapy in geriatric patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98f92c16a241712b3c285ecfed53307b3bf2653719ed18a825e7ec93a6b34373","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
