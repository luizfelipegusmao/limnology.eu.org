Results indicated a general decline in vegetation resilience linked to urbanization. Attribution analysis revealed that this decline was primarily driven by changes in the spatial distribution of urban rainfall. Specifically, as precipitation shifted from suburban to urban areas, the reduced water availability in suburban forests contributed to the observed decrease in vegetation resilience. These findings highlight the significant impact of altered rainfall patterns on the health of urban-suburban ecosystems, emphasizing the need for sustainable water management in the face of urban expansion.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Vegetation resilience holds significant importance for stabilizing ecosystem service functions in a changing climate. While global land surface vegetation resilience changes have been extensively studied, the impact of urbanization on the resilience of suburban woodlands remains inadequately understood. In this study, we utilized two critical slowing down (CSD) indicators, namely lag-one autocorrelation (LOA) and variance (VA), to assess the vegetation resilience, its long-term trends, and influencing factors in suburban woodlands across 1356 cities worldwide. The recovery rates estimated by LOA (rr1$$ {r}_{r_1} $$) and VA (rr2$$ {r}_{r_2} $$) showed close alignment in suburban woodlands with low suburban forest coverage (SFC) areas (correlation coefficient (<i>r</i>) = 0.95). However, a notable divergence was observed in areas with high SFC (<i>r</i> = 0.73). Suburban woodlands with high SFC typically exhibited lower recovery rate estimates, thus indicating greater vegetation resilience compared to areas with lower SFC. From 1986 to 2022, the recovery rates of suburban woodland areas in over 83% of the cities demonstrated a significant upward trend, with an average of 3.23 × 10<sup>−3</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> for both rr1$$ {r}_{r_1} $$ and rr2$$ {r}_{r_2} $$, signifying a widespread decline in vegetation resilience. The accelerating pace of urbanization led to higher rising rates of rr1$$ {r}_{r_1} $$ and rr2$$ {r}_{r_2} $$ during 2010–2022 (5.11 × 10<sup>−3</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>) compared to 1986–1999 (0.49 × 10<sup>−3</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>). The notable decrease in resilience of forestland was primarily attributed to reduced precipitation in urban suburbs, which can be explained by urbanization-induced heat island and building barrier effects, causing a shift of precipitation center from urban suburbs to central cities. In summary, this study revealed that urbanization diminishes the vegetation resilience of urban suburban woodlands by altering urban precipitation patterns. These findings underscore the necessity of augmenting water availability in urban suburbs to restore resilience in these woodlands, thereby enhancing their ecosystem service value.</p>","author":"Han Chen, \nYuhui Xiang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"f4c0593b7b3a0f77acb53eb275879a116ad7f7e68c18c39869aeba20dff2f185","category":"Environment"}
