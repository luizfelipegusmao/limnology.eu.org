{"title":"Analog Implementation of a Spiking Neuron with Memristive Synapses for Deep Learning Processing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2083/v1","date":1717142577000,"content":"Analog neuromorphic prototyping is crucial for creating spiking neuron models that use memristive devices as synapses to design integrated circuits that leverage on-chip parallel deep neural networks. These models mimic how biological neurons in the brain communicate through electrical potentials. Doing so enables more powerful and efficient functionality than traditional artificial neural networks that run on von Neumann computers or graphic processing unit-based platforms. This technology can accelerate deep learning processing, aiming to exploit the brain’s unique features of asynchronous and event-driven processing by leveraging neuromorphic hardware’s inherent parallelism and analog computation capabilities. Therefore, this paper presents the design and implementation of a leaky integrate and fire neuron prototype implemented with commercially available components on a PCB board. Simulations conducted in LTSpice agree well with the electrical test measurements. The results demonstrate that this design can be employed to interconnect many boards to build layers of physical spiking neurons, interconnected with spike-timing-dependent plasticity as the primary learning algorithm, contributing to the realization of experiments in the early stage of adopting neuromorphic computing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c48e8dd440ce8501e46a2dc701dfc9138500e91b5a1afb4a0a283f532c400036","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
