{"title":"Simulating Space Debris Removal Maneuvers: A Multi-Orbit Approach for Active Debris Clearance in LEO and GEO","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0482/v1","date":1728349923000,"content":"The accumulation of space debris, including defunct satellites, rocket stages, and fragments, poses a severe threat to current and future space operations. Addressing this issue requires innovative approaches for active debris removal. This paper presents a new method for detumbling and deorbiting large, non-cooperative tumbling debris, such as those from Russian 'Kosmos 3M' launchers. We propose a detumbling device combining three harpoons with a nanosatellite, which attaches to debris and uses thrusters to reduce its angular velocity, facilitating subsequent removal. A high-fidelity coupled dynamics model of the system is developed to account for external disturbances and inertial changes due to fuel consumption. Additionally, an adaptive sliding mode control strategy with pulse-width pulse-frequency (PWPF) modulation is proposed to manage uncertainties and disturbances during the detumbling process. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, achieving successful detumbling within 4000 seconds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"804715d1ab98599a9911195fda5bfa47231c709120036785c7b87a49d15b3394","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
