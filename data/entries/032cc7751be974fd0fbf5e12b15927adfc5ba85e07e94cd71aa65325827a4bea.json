This article investigates the mBBM equation through the utilization of the rational ( G ′ G )-expansion technique to derive new analytical wave solutions. The analytical solutions we have obtained comprise hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational functions. Some of these exact solutions closely align with previously published results in specific cases, affirming the validity of our other solutions. To provide insights into diverse wave propagation characteristics, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of these solutions using 2D, 3D, and density plots. We also investigated the effects of various parameters on the characteristics of the obtained wave solutions of the model. Moreover, we employed the techniques of linear stability to perform stability analysis of the considered model. Additionally, we have explored the stability of the associated dynamical system through the application of phase plane theory. This study also demonstrates the efficacy and capabilities of the rational ( G ′ G )-expansion approach in analyzing and extracting soliton solutions from nonlinear partial differential equations.","author":"Md.
