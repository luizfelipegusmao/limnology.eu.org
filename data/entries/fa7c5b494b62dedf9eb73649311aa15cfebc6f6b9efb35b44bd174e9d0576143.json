{"title":"Trophic niche partitioning and intraspecific variation in food resource use in the genus Pangasianodon in a reservoir revealed by stable isotope analysis of multiple tissues","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15842?af=R","date":1718595594000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding the mechanism by which non-native fish species integrate into native communities is crucial for evaluating the possibility of their establishment success. The genus <i>Pangasianodon</i>, comprising <i>Pangasianodon gigas</i> and <i>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus</i>, has been introduced into reservoirs, which are non-native habitats, for fishery stock enhancement. <i>P. gigas</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i> often successfully establish and co-occur in several Thai reservoirs, but there is little information on differences in food resource use between the two species. To investigate the trophic niche width of <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i> in a Thai reservoir, we conducted stable carbon and nitrogen ratio (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>13</sup>C and <i>δ</i>\n<sup>15</sup>N) analyses. We examined the degree of individual specialization in both species using the <i>δ</i>\n<sup>13</sup>C and <i>δ</i>\n<sup>15</sup>N values of muscle and liver tissues, which provides long- and short-term diet information. The isotopic niches did not overlap between <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i>. The <i>δ</i>\n<sup>15</sup>N value of <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i> was significantly higher than that of <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i>, whereas the <i>δ</i>\n<sup>13</sup>C value did not significantly differ between the two species. The isotopic niche sizes were larger in <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i> than in <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i>. Individual specialization was observed in <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i> but not in <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i>, indicating that intraspecific variation in food resource use was larger in <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i> compared to <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i>. These findings suggest that trophic niche partitioning was one of the factors facilitating the establishment success of <i>P</i>. <i>gigas</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>hypophthalmus</i> in a reservoir, but the establishment process may differ between the two species.</p>","author":"Ayano Medo, \nNobuhito Ohte, \nHideyuki Doi, \nKiattipong Kamdee, \nKeisuke Koba, \nNobuaki Arai, \nYasushi Mitsunaga, \nManabu Kume, \nDaichi Kojima, \nTakashi Nose, \nAyako Yokoyama, \nThavee Viputhanumas, \nHiromichi Mitamura","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"fa7c5b494b62dedf9eb73649311aa15cfebc6f6b9efb35b44bd174e9d0576143","category":"Environment"}
