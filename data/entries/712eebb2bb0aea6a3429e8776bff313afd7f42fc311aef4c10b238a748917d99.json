{"title":"Optimal Reconfiguration of Electrical Distribution Networks Using the Improved Simulated Annealing Algorithm with Hybrid Cooling (ISA-HC)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0825/v1","date":1720590392000,"content":"This paper presents a new algorithm to solve the optimal reconfiguration problem in distribution networks, using the algorithm called Improved Simulated Annealing combined with Hybrid Cooling (ISA-HC) and Selective Space Search, which leverages the capabilities of the Open Distribution System Simulator (OpenDSS) software and the selective space search concept to enhance performance and reduce the search space. The ISA-HC algorithm determines an adequate starting point for the temperature and initial solution according to the size of the system. For adequate cooling, a three-stage cooling approach was employed to achieve effective cooling, combining two methods widely used in the literature. Overall, the ISA-HC algorithm is a promising method for solving the optimal reconfiguration problem in distribution networks. The algorithm was tested on the systems of 5, 33, 69, and 94 buses and compared to other existing methods in the literature. The results show that the proposed method is more robust and efficient, providing better convergence and reliably achieving good-quality global solutions","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"712eebb2bb0aea6a3429e8776bff313afd7f42fc311aef4c10b238a748917d99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
