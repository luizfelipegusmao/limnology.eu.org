{"title":"Impacts of Eucalyptus globulus Plantation on Soil Properties in the Northwestern Highlands of Ethiopia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1336/v1","date":1716304937000,"content":"In Ethiopia, farmers have changed cropland to Eucalyptus globulus plantations for construction, fuelwood and economic benefits. However, it has adverse effects on soil properties. The investigation was, therefore, to evaluate the impact of Eucalyptus globulus plantations on soil properties in northwestern Ethiopia. About 30 soil samples were collected from two soil depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm) and three land uses (Eucalyptus globulus plantations, cropland and grazing land) with five replications. Soil properties were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the result, soil properties such as silt particles, moisture content (MC), organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were significantly higher under the soil of Eucalyptus globulus plantations than in cropland and grazing land. Whereas the lower contents of bulk density (BD), soil pH, available phosphorus (AP), electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K, and Na) were recorded in Eucalyptus globulus plantations. Besides, clay, BD, MC, pH, EC, CEC, percent base saturation (PBS) and basic cations increased with soil depth while decreasing sand, silt, TP, OM and AP. The basic cations ( Ca, Mg, K), PBS and AP decreased in the soil of the 25-year old Eucalyptus globulus plantation compared to cropland by 38%, 36%, 43 %, 45% and 47% and grazing land by 56%, 60%, 76 %, 60% and 56%, respectively. Therefore, appropriate and effective land use management principles should be implemented in the study area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ec4f762509fed00025ca7b493b0ccd793dcadc305beefe4e6f3ccb5699e18a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
