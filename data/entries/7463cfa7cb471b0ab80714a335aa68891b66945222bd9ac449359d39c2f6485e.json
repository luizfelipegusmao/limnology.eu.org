{"title":"Tourism, Poverty, and Subjective Well-being: Bridging the Urban-Rural Divide in Colombia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0255/v1","date":1727947385000,"content":"This study examines the effects of tourism development on the well-being of impoverished residents in both urban (La Candelaria, Bogot√°) and rural (La Macarena, Meta) regions of Colombia. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the findings reveal that personal economic benefits from tourism are the most vital factor in enhancing residents' happiness and life satisfaction. The analysis outlines a pathway from economic gain to happiness, improving life satisfaction. Additionally, the study highlights tourism's role in exacerbating the urban-rural divide, offering insights into migration trends and regional inequality. Practical recommendations are provided for policymakers to ensure balanced tourism development across regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7463cfa7cb471b0ab80714a335aa68891b66945222bd9ac449359d39c2f6485e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
