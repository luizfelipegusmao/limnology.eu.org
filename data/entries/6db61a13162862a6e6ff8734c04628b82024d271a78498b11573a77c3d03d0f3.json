In the present study off stoichiometric Heusler alloys with nominal composition Χ<sub>50</sub>Υ<sub>25+x</sub>Ζ<sub>25-x</sub> (X = Ni; Y = Mn; Z = Sn; <i>x</i> = 13, 14) were prepared by arc melting followed by thermal treatment. Structural properties were analyzed with X-ray diffraction at room temperature (RT) and at elevated temperatures, above the martensite—austenite transition area, to determine the relevant crystallographic parameters and observe the transition. Martensite stabilization at RT appears to be a challenge, coexistence of martensite—austenite phases were observed and calculated for both 38–12 and 39–11 (16% and 12% austenite, respectively). Magnetization measurements versus temperature and field were recorded in the areas of interest where 1st order transitions were expected (355 K for <i>x</i> = 13 and 408 K for <i>x</i> = 14), and the magnetic entropy's changes (ΔS<sub>m</sub>) were determined [0.4 (J/kgK) for <i>x</i> = 13 and 0.3 J/(kgK) for <i>x</i> = 14; H<sub>max</sub> = 1 T]. The complex character of the magnetic properties and their dependence on Mn-Sn ratio and on the distance between Mn atoms is discussed. The structure and the lattice parameters were determined using an anisotropic strain broadening model; stress and strain were detected in the structure due to crystal phase coexistence.</p>","author":"Dimitris Anastasakos‐Paraskevopoulos, \nCharalampos Sarafidis, \nMaria Giannouri, \nVasileios Alexandrakis, \nIoannis Panagiotopoulos","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"6db61a13162862a6e6ff8734c04628b82024d271a78498b11573a77c3d03d0f3","category":"Environment"}
