{"title":"Circ_0027791 contributes to the growth and immune evasion of hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR‐496/programmed cell death ligand 1 axis in an m6A‐dependent manner","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24188?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Emerging evidence indicates the critical roles of circular RNAs in the development of multiple cancers, containing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, our present research reported the biological function and mechanism of circ_0027791 in HCC progression. Circ_0027791, microRNA-496 (miR-496), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1), and methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and sphere formation ability were detected using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, transwell, and sphere formation assays. Macrophage polarization was detected using flow cytometry assay. To understand the role of circ_0027791 during the immune escape, HCC cells were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells or cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in vitro. A xenograft mouse model was applied to assess the function of circ_0027791 in vivo. After prediction using circinteractome and miRDB, the binding between miR-496 and circ_0027791 or PDL1 was validated based on a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Interaction between METTL3 and circ_0027791 was determined using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR, RIP-qPCR, and RNA pull-down assays. Circ_0027791, PDL1, and METTL3 expression were upregulated, and miR-496 was decreased in HCC patients and cells. Moreover, circ_0027791 knockdown might repress proliferation, invasion, sphere formation, M2 macrophage polarization, and antitumor immune response. Circ_0027791 knockdown repressed HCC tumor growth in vivo<i>.</i> In mechanism, circ_0027791 functioned as a sponge for miR-496 to increase PDL1 expression. In addition, METTL3 mediated the m6A methylation of circ_0027791 and stabilized its expression. METTL3-induced circ_0027791 facilitated HCC cell progression partly regulating the miR-496/PDL1 axis, which provided a new prognostic and therapeutic marker for HCC.</p>","author":"Furong Yu, \nPeifei Fang, \nYonghong Fang, \nDaojun Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"cca452f72c37ac18ea686c2c279b088782ba8c0b17027e08f86d850858caeff7","category":"Environment"}
