{"title":"Data-Driven Multi-objective Optimization With Fairness Constraints: Balancing Efficiency With Equity in Algorithmic Decision-Making","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0924/v1","date":1720686076000,"content":"This research addresses the challenge of integrating fairness considerations into optimization problems, focusing on the development of multi-objective optimization techniques that balance traditional efficiency metrics with fairness constraints. In many algorithmic decision-making processes, optimizing for efficiency alone can inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate biases, leading to inequitable outcomes. This study explores how data analysis and machine learning can be leveraged to identify and mitigate these biases, ensuring that optimization models yield both efficient and fair solutions. The research presents a framework for incorporating fairness constraints into multi-objective optimization, utilizing various fairness metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and disparate impact. It investigates the application of this framework across different domains, including resource allocation in healthcare systems, loan approvals in finance, and personalized learning platforms in education. By analyzing real-world data sets, the study demonstrates how fairness-aware optimization can lead to more equitable outcomes without significantly compromising efficiency. Empirical results from case studies show that multi-objective optimization with fairness constraints can effectively balance the trade-off between efficiency and equity. The research also discusses the computational challenges and ethical considerations associated with implementing fairness constraints in optimization models. Strategies for addressing these challenges, such as regularization techniques and fairness-aware machine learning algorithms, are evaluated and presented. Findings highlight the importance of incorporating fairness into optimization processes to prevent algorithmic biases and promote social equity. The study concludes with practical recommendations for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on adopting fairness-aware optimization techniques to ensure that algorithmic decision-making processes are both efficient and just.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f703bae7a5d0bc4c3e1ddb369565375023681af1e67e3967b9da16007d5f72e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
