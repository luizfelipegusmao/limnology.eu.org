{"title":"Viral load suppression and its predictor among HIV seropositive people who receive enhanced adherence counseling at public health institutions in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. Retrospective follow-up study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303243","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Minyichil Birhanu Belete, Abebayehu Bitew, Kebadnew Mulatu</p>\r\nBackground <p>For those HIV seropositive people with high viral loads, the World Health Organization recommends more counseling before changing ART regimens. A high viral load can lead to increased HIV transmission and lower survival rates. Clients with viral loads above 1000 copies/mL should receive enhanced adherence counseling for 3–6 months before switching. Despite enhanced adherence counseling programs, most countries struggle with viral load suppression. Little is known about viral load suppression in Ethiopia and the research area after counseling.</p> Objective <p>This study aims to assess viral load suppression and its predictors among HIV-positive individuals receiving enhanced adherence counseling in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia, in 2022.</p> Methods <p>An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among randomly selected 546 clients on Enhanced Adherence Counseling at public health facilities in Bahir Dar city. The Epicollect5 mobile application was used to collect the data, which was then exported to Stata version 14 for analysis. A Log-Binomial regression model was fitted for each explanatory variable. Variables having a p-value &lt;0.25 in bivariate analysis were entered into a multivariable Log-Binomial regression model. Finally, an adjusted risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval and a p-value &lt;0.05 was used to measure the strength of the prediction.</p> Results <p>Following enhanced adherence counseling, 312 (57.1%) people had their viral load suppressed. Absence of recurrent OI (ARR 1.40; CI 1.03–1.91), EAC stay less than 3 months (ARR 1.54; CI 1.19–1.99), EAC stay 3–6 months (ARR 1.38; CI 1.12–1.69), once-daily ARV dose regimen (ARR 1.28; CI 1.03–1.58), baseline viral load of 2879.00 copies/ml (ARR 1.30, CI 1.06–1.60), being orthodox Tewahido Christian (ARR 0.37; CI 0.18–0.75) were significant predictors of viral load suppression after Enhanced Adherence Counseling.</p> Conclusion and recommendation <p>Most importantly, this study found that most people had suppressed viral loads after receiving enhanced adherence counseling. Significant predictors of viral load suppression included recurrent OI, length of stay on EAC, daily ARV dosing regimen, baseline viral load, and religion. Clients with a high baseline viral load and those who experience recurring opportunistic infections should get extra care during EAC sessions.</p>","author":"Minyichil Birhanu Belete","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"83454d651fbc5ed3ffdd5d53d205fda79401bb7cfbbce9d87668d5c04999e50f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
