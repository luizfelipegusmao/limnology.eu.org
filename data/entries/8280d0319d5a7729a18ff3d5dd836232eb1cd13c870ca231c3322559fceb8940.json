{"title":"Evolution of Incommensurate Charge Density Waves Quantified with In Situ TEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.797/7719852?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Charge density waves (CDWs) are emergent quantum states that spontaneously break crystal symmetry and compete with other correlated electron phenomenon like superconductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.797-B1\">1</a>]. Just like atomic crystals, CDWs are often disordered, can accommodate topological defects [<a href=\"#ozae044.797-B2\">2</a>], and even melt [<a href=\"#ozae044.797-B3\">3</a>]. Incommensurate (IC-) CDWs are particularly fragile in two dimensions. Therefore, disorder is a key component in the CDW order parameter and careful study is warranted. Here, we present a quantitative study of hexatic melting of ordered IC (oIC-) CDW in TaS<sub>2</sub> using in situ selected area electron diffraction (SAED). IC-CDWs in 1T-TaS<sub>2</sub> are the electronic ground state above 350 K and are disordered [<a href=\"#ozae044.797-B4\">4</a>]. Using in situ heating, oIC-CDWs are synthesized endotaxially [<a href=\"#ozae044.797-B3\">3</a>]; we show this corresponds to a 2D crystalline charge lattice. This charge lattice is a large spatial modulation of the valence electrons that coexists within the atom lattice and modulates the atomic positions, simulating associated periodic lattice distortions (PLDs) that pull atoms towards each charge center. By further heating, the charge lattice is continuously melted.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8280d0319d5a7729a18ff3d5dd836232eb1cd13c870ca231c3322559fceb8940","category":"Environment"}
