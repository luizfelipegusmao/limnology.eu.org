{"title":"The Effect of Decreasing Aperture Diameter on Signal Transmission from the Scintillator to the Photomultiplier Tube Over a Wide Energy Range","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0131/v1","date":1714637613000,"content":"In this paper, we study the effect of decreasing aperture diameter on signal transmission from the scintillator to the PMT. The apertures have been inserted directly between the scintillator and the photomultiplier. Three different aperture diameters have been used over a wide energy range.A newly developed fast digital spectrometer has been utilised for experimental measurement in the radial channel of the VR-1 research reactor. The detector signals with and without inserted apertures have been measured and evaluated. The aim of our research was to determine the effect of the apertures on the spectral quality, energy range and the evaluated physical quantities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75be11a5fabf8b4ded5c2da989a38dda8b7715ed96d30b02634b724ddd32c753","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
