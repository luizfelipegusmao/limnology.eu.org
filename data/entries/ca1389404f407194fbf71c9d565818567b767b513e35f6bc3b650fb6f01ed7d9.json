{"title":"Feed Components and Timing to Improve Feed Conversion Ratio for Sustainable Aquaculture Using Starch","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1207/v1","date":1718698657000,"content":"Aquaculture contributes to the sustainable development of food security, marine resource conservation, and economy. Shifting aquaculture feed from fish meal and oil to terrestrial plant-derivatives may result in cost savings. However, many carnivorous fish cannot be sustained on plant-derived materials, necessitating the need for the identification of important factors for farmed fish growth and to investigate whether components derived from terrestrial plants can be used in feed. Herein, we focused on the carnivorous fish leopard coral grouper (P. leopardus) to identify the essential growth factors and clarify their intake timing from feeds. Furthermore, we evaluated the functionality of starch, which are easily produced by terrestrial plants. Results reveal that carbohydrates, which are not considered essential for carnivorous fish, can be introduced as a major part of artificial diet. The development of artificial feed using starch offers the possibility of increasing the growth of carnivorous fish in aquaculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca1389404f407194fbf71c9d565818567b767b513e35f6bc3b650fb6f01ed7d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
