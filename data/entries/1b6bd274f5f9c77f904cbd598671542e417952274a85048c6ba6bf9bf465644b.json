{"title":"Phylogenomics of Neogastropoda: The Backbone Hidden in the Bush","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/73/3/521/7624404?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The molluskan order Neogastropoda encompasses over 15,000 almost exclusively marine species playing important roles in benthic communities and in the economies of coastal countries. Neogastropoda underwent intensive cladogenesis in the early stages of diversification, generating a “bush” at the base of their evolutionary tree, which has been hard to resolve even with high throughput molecular data. In the present study to resolve the bush, we use a variety of phylogenetic inference methods and a comprehensive exon capture dataset of 1817 loci (79.6% data occupancy) comprising 112 taxa of 48 out of 60 Neogastropoda families. Our results show consistent topologies and high support in all analyses at (super)family level, supporting monophyly of Muricoidea, Mitroidea, Conoidea, and, with some reservations, Olivoidea and Buccinoidea. Volutoidea and Turbinelloidea as currently circumscribed are clearly paraphyletic. Despite our analyses consistently resolving most backbone nodes, 3 prove problematic: First, the uncertain placement of Cancellariidae, as the sister group to either a Ficoidea-Tonnoidea clade or to the rest of Neogastropoda, leaves monophyly of Neogastropoda unresolved. Second, relationships are contradictory at the base of the major “core Neogastropoda” grouping. Third, coalescence-based analyses reject monophyly of the Buccinoidea in relation to Vasidae. We analyzed phylogenetic signal of targeted loci in relation to potential biases, and we propose the most probable resolutions in the latter 2 recalcitrant nodes. The uncertain placement of Cancellariidae may be explained by orthology violations due to differential paralog loss shortly after the whole genome duplication, which should be resolved with a curated set of longer loci.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"1b6bd274f5f9c77f904cbd598671542e417952274a85048c6ba6bf9bf465644b","category":"Environment"}
