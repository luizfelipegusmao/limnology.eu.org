{"title":"Mechanisms of Low-Temperature Dislocation Motion in High-Entropy Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi Alloy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0418/v1","date":1717738686000,"content":"An analysis of the processes of plastic deformation and acoustic relaxation in a high-entropy alloy Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi was carried out. The following have been established: dominant dislocation defects; types of barriers that prevent the movement of dislocations; mechanisms of thermally activated movement of various elements of dislocation lines through barriers at room and low temperatures. Based on modern dislocation theory, quantitative estimates have been obtained for the most important characteristics of dislocations and their interaction with barriers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc54b172445d78088f03d6a0b997961de65a093647f276120c93b57efbcebf3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
