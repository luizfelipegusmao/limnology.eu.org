{"title":"Naturally Occurring Nor-Steroids and Their Design and Pharmaceutical Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1079/v1","date":1713270138000,"content":"The main focus of this review is to introduce readers to the fascinating class of lipid molecules known as norsteroids, exploring their distribution across various biotopes and their biological activities. The review provides an in-depth analysis of various modified steroids, including A, B, C, and D-norsteroids, each characterized by distinct structural alterations. These modifications, which range from the removal of specific methyl groups to changes in the steroid core, result in unique molecular architectures that significantly impact their biological activity and therapeutic potential. The discussion on A, B, C, and D-norsteroids sheds light on their unique configurations and how these structural modifications influence their pharmacological properties. The review also presents examples from natural sources that produce a diverse array of steroids with distinct structures, including the aforementioned A, B, C, and D-nor variants. These compounds, sourced from marine organisms like sponges, soft corals and starfish, as well as terrestrial entities such as plants, fungi, and bacteria. The exploration of these steroids encompasses their biosynthesis, ecological significance, and potential medical applications, highlighting a crucial area of interest in pharmacology and natural product chemistry. The review emphasizes the importance of researching these steroids for drug development, particularly in addressing diseases where conventional medications are inadequate or for conditions lacking sufficient therapeutic options. Examples of norsteroid synthesis are provided to illustrate the practical applications of this research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ee19e1c354081b511c150d752b5380cbc51de19b7c0852a649e0426d9183742","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
