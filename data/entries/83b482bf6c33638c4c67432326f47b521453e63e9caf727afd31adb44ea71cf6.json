However, the complex interplay between global and local effects makes it challenging to pinpoint the primary drivers. In a multi-ecosystem study, we analyzed pluri-decadal trends of bivalve-δ<sup>13</sup>C as recorder of global environmental changes. These trends were correlated with large-scale natural and anthropogenic climate proxies to identify whether coastal biota responded to global effects. Our findings revealed decreasing bivalve-δ<sup>13</sup>C trends in all sea regions, mainly linked with increased temperature and atmospheric-CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, the later generating a decrease in atmospheric-CO<sub>2</sub> δ<sup>13</sup>C values (Suess effect) because of fossil-fuel burning. After removing the Suess effect from bivalve-δ<sup>13</sup>C trends, ongoing global climate variability continues to affect most ecosystems, possibly intensified by combined, interacting regional or local effects. These results highlight the need to consider large-scale effects to fully understand ecosystem and food web responses to the multiple effects of global change.</p>","author":"Camilla Liénart, \nAlan Fournioux, \nAndrius Garbaras, \nArnaud Lheureux, \nHugues Blanchet, \nNicolas Briant, \nStanislas F.
