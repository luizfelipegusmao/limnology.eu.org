{"title":"The Development of Sustainable polyoxymethylene(POM)-Based Composites by the Introduction of Natural Fillers and Melt Blending with Poly(lactic Acid)-PLA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1111/v1","date":1710992497000,"content":"The subject of the conducted study was focused on the development of new type of technical blends reinforced with natural fillers. The study was divided into two parts, where in the firsts stage of the research unmodified POM was reinforced with different types of natural fillers: cellulose, wood flour and husk particles. In order to select the type of filler intended for further modification, the mechanical characteristics was assessed. The 20% wood flour (WF) filler system was selected as the reinforcement. The second stage of research involved the use of combination of polyoxymethylene POM and poly(lactic acid) PLA. POM/PLA blend (ratio 50/50 %) were modified with elastomeric compound (EBA) and chain extender as reactive compatibilized (CE). The microscopic analysis revealed that for POM/PLA system the filler-matrix interface is characterized by better wettability, which might suggest higher adhesion. The mechanical performance revealed that for POM/PLA-based composites the properties were very close to the results for POM-WF composites; however, there is still large difference in thermal resistance in favor of POM-based materials. The increase in thermomechanical properties for POM/PLA composites occurs after heat treatment. The increasing crystallinity of the PLA phase allows for an significant increase of the head deflection temperature (HDT), even above 125 Â°C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a602f0a4e38bcf085c922daab5c43f2b2207eb9574bb6be746a68e767651da0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
