Müller</p>\r\n\r\nDNMT1 is an essential DNA methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to CpG islands in DNA and generates a prominent epigenetic mark. The catalytic activity of DNMT1 relies on its conformational plasticity and ability to change conformation from an auto-inhibited to an activated state. Here, we present four cryo-EM reconstructions of apo DNMT1 and DNTM1: non-productive DNA, DNTM1: H3Ub2-peptide, DNTM1: productive DNA complexes. Our structures demonstrate the flexibility of DNMT1’s N-terminal regulatory domains during the transition from an apo ‘auto-inhibited’ to a DNA-bound ‘non-productive’ and finally a DNA-bound ‘productive’ state of DNMT1. Furthermore, we address the regulation of DNMT1’s methyltransferase activity by a DNMT1-selective small-molecule inhibitor and ubiquitinated histone H3. We observe that DNMT1 binds DNA in a ‘non-productive’ state despite the presence of the inhibitor and present the cryo-EM reconstruction of full-length DNMT1 in complex with a di-ubiquitinated H3 peptide analogue. Taken together, our results provide structural insights into the reaction cycle of DNMT1.","author":"Inessa De","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"96eb41129fc14115c4fe96c13120cb257975f873a0cc9823c6f04caf324c292c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
