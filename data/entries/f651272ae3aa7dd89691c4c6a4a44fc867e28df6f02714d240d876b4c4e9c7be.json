{"title":"Tree‐ and stand‐scale variability of xylem water stable isotope signatures in mature beech, oak and spruce","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2614?af=R","date":1710913800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In ecohydrology, water isotopologues are used to assess potential sources of root water uptake by comparing xylem water signatures with source water signatures. Such comparisons are affected by the variability and uncertainty of the isotope signatures of plant water and water sources. The tree-scale and stand-scale variabilities of the isotope signatures in stem xylem water are often unknown but are important for sampling design and uncertainty estimation in assessing the sources of tree water uptake. Here, we quantified tree-scale and stand-scale variabilities of xylem water isotope signatures in beech, oak and spruce trees in a mature forest on the Swiss plateau. For stem xylem water, sub-daily replicates and replicates in different cardinal directions showed no systematic differences, but we found systematic differences with sampling height. The observed variability of isotope signatures at different heights along the stem suggests that water residence times within trees need to be considered, along with their effects on the isotope signatures in different compartments (stem, branches, leaves). Further, concerning the hydrogen signatures, we found height- and species-specific offsets (SW-excess δ<sup>2</sup>H). Stem xylem water's tree-scale variability was similar in magnitude to its stand-scale variability and smaller than the variabilities in branch xylem and bulk soil water around each tree. Xylem water from stem cores close to the ground, therefore, can give a more precise estimate of the isotopic signal of the most recent root water uptake and facilitate more accurate source water attribution.</p>","author":"Fabian Bernhard, \nMarius G.
