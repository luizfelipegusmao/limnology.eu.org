{"title":"Service-policy gaps in the settlement journey of Arabic-speaking immigrant newcomer and refugee older adults in Edmonton, Canada","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311646","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Saba Nisa, Sadaf Murad, Jordana Salma, Alesia Au</p>\r\n\r\nImmigrant newcomers and refugees (INRs) are two migrant categories that experience consistent systemic barriers to settlement and integration in Canada as older adults. This paper explores the challenges experienced by Arabic-speaking INR older adults in Edmonton, Canada, during settlement and discusses policy and service implications. A qualitative description study using community-based participatory research principles was implemented to evaluate and support digital literacy in Arabic-speaking INR older adults. We included men and women aged 55 and older who identified as immigrants or refugees and spoke Arabic. Experiences of settlement challenges were consistently identified during data collection and engagement of INR older adult participants. A thematic sub-analysis of interviews with (10 individuals and one couple) of participants’ narratives was completed in 2022 and was used to identify themes related to settlement barriers for this population. Two main themes were identified: (1) Limited English skills and digital literacy gaps create service barriers for INR older adults, and (2) Gaps in services and policies as basic needs remain unmet. We describe key challenges experienced by INR older adults, such as language barriers, precarious finances, poor access to health care services and lack of transportation and employment opportunities, which hinder successful integration into the new society. This study showcases the ongoing challenges with early settlement and integration that continue despite Canada’s well-developed immigration settlement landscape. INR older adults often remain invisible in policy, and understanding their experiences is a first step to addressing their needs for resources that support healthy aging in the post-migration context.","author":"Saba Nisa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"20a1fea83e053bafd46d7dfec1fb3167bdbfda3535b979388303dc5e7b07cc49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
