{"title":"Recent Advances and Applications of Passive Acoustic Monitoring in Assessing Shrimp Feeding Behaviour Under Laboratory and Farm Conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12978?af=R","date":1728112776000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has recently been integrated with other noninvasive ethological methodologies to enhance the understanding of shrimp feeding behaviour, as their mandibles emit click sounds during food intake. This review aims to compile recent advances and various applications of PAM in assessing shrimp feeding behaviour under controlled laboratory and farm conditions. It includes a description of key concepts, terms and general methodologies in the field of bioacoustics to facilitate understanding of acoustic characterisation, specific methodologies and the main uses of PAM in shrimp research. Among the primary contributions of PAM in laboratory studies are acoustic characterisation of clicks and mandibular structures associated with their emission for different species; variations in acoustic click parameters related to animal size, feed texture and pellet size; and effects on feeding behaviour caused by shrimp size, stocking density and specific characteristics of artificial diets (texture, formulations, additives and pellet sizes). Finally, future perspectives and recommendations for laboratory studies using PAM are provided. The review highlights the contribution of PAM, which, allied with other ethological methodologies, emerges as a novel tool for researching shrimp behaviour and optimising feed management in aquaculture.</p>","author":"Silvio Peixoto, \nRoberta Soares","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"aac80b845474fabb916c26b82cd9adb79dd8e731af4faa440be3d1f2de6d44b8","category":"Environment"}
