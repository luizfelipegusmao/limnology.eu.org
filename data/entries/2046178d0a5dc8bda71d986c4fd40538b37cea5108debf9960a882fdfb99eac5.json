{"title":"External Validation of the New 2023 FIGO Staging System in Endometrial Cancer Patients: 12-Year Experience from an ESGO Accredited Center","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1708/v1","date":1724408686000,"content":"Background and Objectives: The new molecular classification of endometrial cancer continuously changes the management of the disease in every day clinical practice. Lately, FIGO released a new staging system for endometrial cancer, which incorporates molecular sub-stages and subdivides further early-stage disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences between the two FIGO staging systems and evaluate the prognostic precision of the new one. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients with endometrial cancer that were fully treated in the 1st Department of Obstetrics-Gynecology, 2012-2023. Patient characteristics, oncological outcome and follow-up information were collected. The primary outcomes were the stage shifts and the survival data. Results: 67 (15.5%) patients had a stage shift and the majority of them concerned early-stage disease and specifically up-shift from 2009 stages IA and IB to 2023 stage IIC. Concerning, survival a better median and 5-year PFS was present in Stage II disease and when compering the prognostic precision of the two FIGO staging systems no significant difference was present. Conclusions: The new 2023 FIGO staging system better distinguishes early-stage endometrial cancer into its prognostic groups and seems to be as precise as the old 2009 FIGO staging system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2046178d0a5dc8bda71d986c4fd40538b37cea5108debf9960a882fdfb99eac5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
