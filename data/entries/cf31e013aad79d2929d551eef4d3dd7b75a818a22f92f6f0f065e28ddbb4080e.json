Accurate and efficient analysis of NP characteristics is essential for advancing our understanding of their structure-property relationship and facilitating their applications. In this study, we introduce a novel AI prompt engineering approach to NP analysis, utilizing state-of-the-art single-shot detection (SSD) and vision transformer (ViT) techniques, including Ultralytics YOLOv8 and Meta AI segment-anything model (SAM) frameworks, as illustrated in Figure 1 [<a href=\"#ozae044.196-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.196-B2\">2</a>]. Our results demonstrate that AI-powered automated nanoparticle analysis is competitive with human-handcrafted manual methods, significantly reducing the processing and analysis time while maintaining high precision and accuracy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cf31e013aad79d2929d551eef4d3dd7b75a818a22f92f6f0f065e28ddbb4080e","category":"Environment"}
