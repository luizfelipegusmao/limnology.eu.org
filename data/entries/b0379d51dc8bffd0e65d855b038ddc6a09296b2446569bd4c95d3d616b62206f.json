{"title":"A Dual Hilbert-Space Formalism for Consciousness; Memory Experiments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1134/v1","date":1715942371000,"content":"Inspired by works of W. H. Zurek  and others, a  mathematical, physical  theory, entirely within  a quantum mechanical formalism, is proposed for cognitive processes in terms of an abstract Hilbert-space for the conscious state that is an exact replica of the Hilbert-space for the neuronic physical state. Thus, any actual state of consciousness arises by its formal alignment (identification) with some-one in the set of the neuronic states, with the latter undergoing perpetual changes in the wake of life-long experiences. It is posited that these changes become expressed by an increase in the number of ordered, coherent neuronic states at the expense of the pre-ordinal random neuronic states. Changes, transitions between states are induced by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad formalism, which is also instrumental in the effect of the conscious state on bodily actions. The paradigmatic findings of R.N. Shepard (1958 - 2011) and of S. Sternberg (1966 - 2016) for long- and short-term recalls  are interpreted within the model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0379d51dc8bffd0e65d855b038ddc6a09296b2446569bd4c95d3d616b62206f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
