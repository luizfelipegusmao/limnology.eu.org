{"title":"Songbird annual productivity declines with increasing soil lead contamination around nests","link":"https://academic.oup.com/condor/article/doi/10.1093/ornithapp/duae021/7754272?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Songbirds incidentally ingest soil contaminated with lead and several species in the Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District have a negative relationship between soil lead concentration and reproduction. We used an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate nesting processes throughout the breeding season to estimate annual productivity for 5 songbirds in relation to soil-lead concentration. We modeled daily nest survival and number fledged in relation to soil lead and incorporated these relationships into the IBM using a Bayesian approach that fully captured parameter uncertainty and process variation. The proportion of the posterior distribution for the effect of soil lead on daily nest survival was mostly negative for <span>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</span> (Eastern Towhee), <span>Passerina cyanea</span> (Indigo Bunting), <span>Cardinalis cardinalis</span> (Northern Cardinal), <span>Sialia sialis</span> (Eastern Bluebird; <span>f</span> = 0.972, 0.990, 0.741, 0.581, respectively), and slightly positive for <span>Spizella pusilla</span> (Field Sparrow; <span>f</span> = 0.680). The proportion of the posterior distribution for the effect of soil lead on the number fledged from successful nests was mostly negative for <span>S. pusilla</span>, <span>P. erythrophthalmus</span>, and <span>C. cardinalis</span> (<span>f</span> = 0.867, 0.585, 0.508, respectively) and positive for <span>P. cyanea</span> and <span>S. sialis</span> (<span>f</span> = 0.773, 0.744). Simulated annual productivity decreased by 0.04–1.47 young/female/year among species across the range of soil lead concentrations, with the greatest declines for <span>P. erythrophthalmus</span> and <span>P. cyanea</span>. The probability of fledging one or more young changed from 51% to 15% for <span>P. erythrophthalmus</span>, 57% to 23% for <span>P. cyanea</span>, 60% to 48% for <span>C. cardinalis</span>, 94% to 84% for <span>S. sialis</span>, and 57% to 64% for <span>S. pusilla</span> as soil-lead concentration around a nest increased from 20 to 4,000 ppm. Most nest failures were the result of predation; therefore, we suggest lead may have affected birds’ behavior at the nest, or affected nest site quality, which resulted in higher nest predation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithological Applications Current Issue","siteHash":"0adf13706282b3ccfec74e0cd9d72c5688cecb6af30a6dfa64315dbe0b12427f","entryHash":"747a387d6122ae9c8215f7f9400e5ceeb0ab268a211f77aa3929c386586eccd9","category":"Environment"}
