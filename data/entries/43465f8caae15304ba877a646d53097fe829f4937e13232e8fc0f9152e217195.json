{"title":"An Exogenous Auxiin Indol-3-Butiric Acid (Iba) Induced Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) Cultivars Reactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1197/v1","date":1728989395000,"content":"Bean is a remarkable crop widely used as food worldwide, underscoring the significance of scientific research conducted on this plant. Developing a strong root system in the early stages of growth, which can spread wider and deeper, along with the consequent development of the shoot system crucial for photosynthesis, enhances the plant's productivity and resistance to diseases and pests. In the current study, the reactions of cultivars Önceler-98 and Topçu beans to different concentrations of IBA (indole-3-butyric acid) during the seedling stage were investigated. Three different concentrations, namely 0 (Control), 50, 100, and 150 µM IBA, were applied, and their effects on root length (RL), root fresh weight (RFW), root dry weight (RDW), number of nodules on roots (RNN), shoot length (SL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), and shoot dry weight (SDW) parameters were measured. The pattern of the experiment was a randomized complete block factorial design with four replications and, statistically significant (p≤0.05) and highly significant (p≤0.01) differences were observed among the means of root and shoot traits. As a result, it was found that the cultivar Önceler-98 generally exhibited better responses to IBA solutions, and the optimal concentration range for both varieties was between 50-100 µM, decreasing at 150 µM and higher concentrations, yet still yielding superior means compared to the control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43465f8caae15304ba877a646d53097fe829f4937e13232e8fc0f9152e217195","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
