{"title":"Experimental Investigation of Thermoacoustics and High Frequency Combustion Dynamics with Band Stop Characteristics in a Pressurized Combustor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0527/v1","date":1709905452000,"content":"In combustor systems, thermoacoustic instabilities may occur and must be avoided for reliable op-eration. An acoustic network model can be used to predict the eigenfrequencies of the instabilities and the growth rate by incorporating the combustion dynamics with a Flame Transfer Function (FTF). The FTF defines the interconnection between burner aerodynamics and the rate of combus-tion. In the current study, the method to measure the FTF in a pressurized combustor is explored. A siren unit, mounted in the fuel line, induced a fuel flow excitation of variable amplitude and high maximum frequency. This was done here for pressurized conditions at 1.5 bar and 3 bar and at thermal power of 125 kW and 250 kW. In addition to the experimental investigation, a 1-D acoustic network model approach is used. In the model, thermo viscous damping effects and reflection coefficients are incorporated. The model results compare well with experimental data, indicating the proposed method to determine the FTF is reliable. In the approach, a combination of a FTF with a band stop approach and a network modeling approach was applied. The method provides a good match between experimentally observed behavior and analytical approach and can be used for instability analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce7cc00f67a650e48af1f03730d1405e3be0a39924cbe8793daaa56f5a4b6f78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
