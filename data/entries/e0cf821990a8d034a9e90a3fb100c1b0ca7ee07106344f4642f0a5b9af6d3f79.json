{"title":"Power Distance and Indulgence Are Positively and Negatively Correlated with Ageism, Respectively: Evidence from 31 Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1235/v1","date":1723796508000,"content":"As the aging of the world accelerates, clarifying the relationship between cultural differences and ageism is an urgent issue. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a correlation analysis between the six cultural scales of Hofstede et al. [1] and the objective and subjective ageism scales calculated from data on 35,232 people from 31 countries included in the World Values Survey Wave 6 by Inglehart et al. [2]. The results of a partial correlation analysis controlling for economic and demographic factors showed that power distance (PDI) and indulgence versus restraint (IVR) are positively and negatively correlated with ageism, respectively. This is the first study to show that these two cultural scales that previous studies have not paid much attention to are related to ageism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0cf821990a8d034a9e90a3fb100c1b0ca7ee07106344f4642f0a5b9af6d3f79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
