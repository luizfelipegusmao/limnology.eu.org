We tested the application of thermal drones for locating and counting Northern Bobwhite in Mississippi, USA.\n\nWe conducted flights over known locations of Northern Bobwhite representing three individual, radio-marked birds during the breeding season and seven covey locations during the wintering season shortly after dusk. Individuals and coveys were located in 67% and 86% of flights, respectively. In some scenarios, bobwhite could be seen from altitudes of 120â€‰m because heat signatures of multiple individuals grouped together in the covey provided an easily recognisable feature, in contrast to individual birds alone.\n\nCounts were accurate for two coveys and underestimated remaining coveys, because individual birds were sometimes visually obstructed from above. The small body size of bobwhite results in few pixels in thermal images and depends on ground sampling distance as a function of flight altitude.\n\nOur flights were tested at known vicinities of bobwhite locations, yet our method shows promise for locating unknown coveys as well. Future systematic methods may benefit from automated image recognition using computer vision and machine learning to improve count accuracy and save time, costs and labor.\n</p>","author":"Olivia Lappin, \nJared A.
