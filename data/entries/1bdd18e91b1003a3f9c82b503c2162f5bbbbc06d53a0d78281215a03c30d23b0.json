{"title":"Sex-specific seasonal variations of wild boar distance traveled and home range size","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/70/3/284/7158053?rss=1","date":1683590400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Distance traveled and home range size describe how animals move in space. The seasonal variations of these parameters are important to comprehensively understand animal ecology and its connection with reproductive behavior and energy costs. Researchers usually estimate the distance traveled as the sum of the straight-line displacements between sampled positions, but this approach is sensitive to the sampling frequency and does not account for the tortuosity of the animalâ€™s movements. By means of the continuous-time movement modeling which takes into account autocorrelation and tortuosity of movement data, we estimated the distance traveled and monthly home range size of 28 wild boar <span>Sus scrofa</span> and modeled their inter-sexual seasonal variability. Males traveled longer distances and used larger home ranges than females, particularly during the rut in autumn-winter, consistently with the different biological cycles of males and females. Males enlarged their home ranges during the rut but traveled constant average distances along the year, whereas females traveled shorter distances in correspondence with the peak of food resources and birth periods but exhibited constant home range size across seasons. The differences between the seasonal variation patterns of distance traveled and home range size, observed in both sexes, revealed the complex relationship between these two aspects of spatial behavior and the great opportunity of including both distance traveled and home range size in behavioral ecology investigations. We provided a detailed analysis of wild boar spatial behavior and its relationships with the reproductive cycles of males and females, promoting a deeper comprehension of their behavioral ecology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"1bdd18e91b1003a3f9c82b503c2162f5bbbbc06d53a0d78281215a03c30d23b0","category":"Environment"}
