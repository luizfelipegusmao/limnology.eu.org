{"title":"A combined use of hydraulic and hydrological model to characterize channel hydro-geomorphology of a tropical river basin of West Bengal, India","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11600-023-01234-x","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The present study aims to examine the changing hydro-geomorphological properties of the Mayurakshi River located in a plateau fringe region in Jharkhand and West Bengal. The field investigation of 14 cross-sectional sites has been conducted during the post-monsoon season of 2021 to determine important geomorphic parameters such as channel depth, width, bank height, hydraulic radius, and wetted perimeter. Post-processed kinematic survey and electromagnetic current meter tool have been used to measure the river bed profile and channel velocity, respectively, to obtain more accurate locational information. The primary objective of this study is to compare field-observed discharge data with the discharge volume predicted by a few hydraulic and hydrological models in order to determine the models that are best suited for further application in a scientifically accepted and cost-effective manner. The results demonstrate that there is a noticeable rise in flow velocity from upstream (0.22 m/s) to downstream of the river (0.85 m/s), which is also supported by the results of Manning's equation and kinematic wave parameter. The most correct relationship is then presented by minimizing the deviations between the calculated and analytical discharges at three separate stages. The results show that the proposed Manning's technique is quite accurate with the observed data, as determined by the mean absolute percentage error (60.16%), root mean square error (30.53%), and normalized root mean square error (0.05) indices.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"c817c51a1502ae3c3e82ef0ad13e7aaf2efe8e515e0f83ee2001b779e2ab0559","category":"Environment"}
