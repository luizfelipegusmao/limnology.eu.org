Laser-assisted atom probe tomography (LA-APT) measurements of the chemical composition of such minerals provide access to isotopic information on a scale never before available. It allows the identification of nanoscale chemical heterogeneities that provide insight into the geological and thermal history of terrestrial and extra-terrestrial rocks [<a href=\"#ozae044.033-B1\">1</a>]. However, biases in the isotopic quantification of these materials (âˆ¼2-3 At%), which are still poorly understood at present, lead to significant dating errors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3def2431b9ff250c405c718089872c338fe92d5f793d947260532074ce26fe99","category":"Environment"}
