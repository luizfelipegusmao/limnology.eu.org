{"title":"Functional Analysis of Genetic Tests in Neurological Diagnostics: Advances and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0618/v1","date":1725866473000,"content":"The integration of genetic technologies into neurological diagnostics has significantly enhanced our ability to understand and manage neurological disorders. This  article discusses the functional analysis of key genetic tests, including microarray analysis, variant sequencing, exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and whole genome sequencing. Each of these technologies offers unique advantages and challenges, providing a comprehensive toolkit for diagnosing and understanding the genetic basis of neurological conditions. The functional insights gained from these tests not only detect genetic abnormalities but also elucidate their functional consequences, aiding in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of neurological disorders. As these technologies continue to evolve, they are expected to play an increasingly important role in the field of neurological diagnostics, paving the way for personalized medicine and improved patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32e2e5298aa595e4978b957f427e5e5a34eb4cdf7099b9943f74e50f8df9eeae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
