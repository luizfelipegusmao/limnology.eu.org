{"title":"Research and application of OPC UA-based digital twin smoke alarm calibration workshop information model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307801","date":1721916000000,"content":"<p>by Min Wu, Wenfeng Ying</p>\r\n\r\nAiming at the problems of data integration and information sharing in the calibration workshop of smoke alarm, combining OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and digital twin technology, the OPC UA based digital twin smoke alarm calibration workshop information network framework is proposed. Using OPC UA information modeling technology, a digital workshop information model for smoke alarm calibration was constructed, and the static attribute set, process attribute set, and functional component set of the workshop were defined in detail. Taking the smoke box as an example, the information model construction was instantiated, and data collection and transmission were carried out with the digital twin model of the smoke box, achieving the implementation mapping between the twin model and physical entities. The results show that based on the proposed OPC UA information model, the interconnection and intercommunication of data at all levels of the digital twin smoke alarm calibration workshop can be achieved, and the workshop can be visualized, digitized, and flexible.","author":"Min Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce621093cf367b8cab3e49bf56fb0f33768e5978fa47fcebe832ec71c4a55790","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
