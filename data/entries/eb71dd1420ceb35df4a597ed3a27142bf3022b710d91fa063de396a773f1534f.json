{"title":"Biological Control of Lettuce Drop (Sclerotinia minor) Using Antagonistic Bacillus Species","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0972/v1","date":1723588832000,"content":"Sclerotinia minor Jagger is a phytopathogenic fungus that causes lettuce drop, a serious problem of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) production. The control of this pathogen is challenging because of the presence of resistance of sclerotia, which can survive in the soil under favourable conditions. In Bulgaria, the management of lettuce drop relies primarily on the strategic application of synthetic fungicides. To find alternative methods for disease management, four bacterial isolates were screened for antagonism against S. minor. This study reports the in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of Bacillus subtilis, Priestia megaterium, Bacillus safensis, and Bacillus mojavensis against S. minor. The molecular identification of the isolates involved in the activity was examined by 16s rRNA sequencing. Isolated bacterial strains produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in a medium supplemented with 0.1% L-tryptophan. The ability of those strains to increase the mobility of phosphorus and zinc has been elucidated. The production of siderophores has been confirmed on CAS (Chrom azurol S) medium. The inhibitory action showed by the filtrates of the bacterial growth broths against S. minor and points out the nature of the molecules involved. The evaluation of the antifungal activity was carried out in vitro and pot experiments. This study determined the effect of growth-promoting rhizobacteria on the development of lettuce. This research focuses mainly on the development of biocontrol strategies for the management of lettuce drop in greenhouses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb71dd1420ceb35df4a597ed3a27142bf3022b710d91fa063de396a773f1534f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
