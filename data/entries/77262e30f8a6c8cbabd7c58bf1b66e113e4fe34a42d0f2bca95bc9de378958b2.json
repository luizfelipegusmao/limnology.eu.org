Here, regulation is key. Every conceivable process, including gene transcription, mRNA processing, and translation, but also mRNA and protein decay, is strictly regulated. This tight control allows the establishment of a pool of functional mRNAs and proteins that are constantly available to fine-tune cellular responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"77262e30f8a6c8cbabd7c58bf1b66e113e4fe34a42d0f2bca95bc9de378958b2","category":"Environment"}
