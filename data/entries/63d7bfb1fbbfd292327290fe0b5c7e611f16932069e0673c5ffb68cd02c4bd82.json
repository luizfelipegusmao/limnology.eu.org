{"title":"Acute Physiological and Behavioural Effects of One Session of 1-Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Post-Stroke Aphasia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1574/v1","date":1729504815000,"content":"Objective: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) shows promise as an aphasia treatment, however its physiological mechanisms in people with aphasia (PWA) remain largely unclear. Electroencephalography (EEG) could be used to explore rTMS mechanisms. The present study investigated the acute effects of rTMS in PWA on: 1) an EEG measure of language (N400 event-related potential); and 2) picture naming. Methods: Eleven people with chronic non-fluent or anomic aphasia (64 ± 10.13 years old; 8 males; 37.27 ± 20.64 months since stroke) received one session of 1-Hz rTMS and one session of sham to the right pars triangularis at 80% resting motor threshold (RMT). N400 mean amplitude and picture naming accuracy were compared before and after each session. Results: No acute changes were observed in N400 mean amplitude or picture naming accuracy as compared to sham (p &gt; 0.05; BF10 &lt; 0.33). Conclusions: Results suggest that language networks underlying the N400 are not altered following one session of 1-Hz rTMS in PWA. Significance: Although EEG could be useful for assessing physiological mechanisms of rTMS in PWA, the N400 does not appear to be a viable measure of acute 1-Hz rTMS effects, at least when delivered at 80% RMT in a single session.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63d7bfb1fbbfd292327290fe0b5c7e611f16932069e0673c5ffb68cd02c4bd82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
