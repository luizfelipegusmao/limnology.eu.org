Most of Stx phages are lambdoid bacteriophages. Shiga toxin-producing <span>Escherichia coli</span> (STEC), causes severe hemorrhagic colitis disease which is, in some cases, complicated by a life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) leading to long-term disability and mortality of patients. Although the global incidence of STEC infection is low, severe disease and death occurs in an unacceptably high proportion of infected individuals: 10% and 3–5%, respectively.

The genome and physiology of phi24B-related phages were extensively studied (recently reviewed in [<a href=\"#ozae044.378-B2\">2</a>]), however the structural organization of phi24B virion remains poorly understood, most of the structural proteins encoded by the phage’s genome are not identified.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bb52e3129b3bacfc01b93c47b1294f2bd5ed73e78fcf7aad6f69a129de0238e1","category":"Environment"}
