We aimed to assess the incidence of VTE and bleeding in this population. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42023423949) were based on a standardized search of PubMed, Virtual Health Library and Cochrane (n = 1653) in July 2023. After duplicate removal, data screening and collection were conducted by independent reviewers. The combined rates and 95% confidence intervals for the incidence of VTE and bleeding were calculated using the random effects model with double arcsine transformation. Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, age, income, and type of tumor. Heterogeneity was calculated using Cochran’s Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Egger’s test and funnel graphs were used to assess publication bias. Results: Only 36 studies were included, mainly retrospective cohorts (n = 30, 83.3%) from North America (n = 20). Most studies included were published in high-income countries. The sample size of studies varied between 34 and 21,384 adult patients, mostly based on gliomas (n = 30,045). For overall malignant primary CNS neoplasm, the pooled incidence was 13.68% (95%CI 9.79; 18.79) and 11.60% (95%CI 6.16; 18.41) for VTE and bleeding, respectively. The subgroup with elderly people aged 60 or over had the highest incidence of VTE (32.27% - 95%CI 14.40;53.31). The studies presented few biases, being mostly high quality. Despite some variability among the studies, we observed consistent results by performing sensitivity analysis, which highlight the robustness of our findings. Conclusions: Our study showed variability in the pooled incidence for both overall events and subgroup analyses. It was highlighted that individuals over 60 years old or diagnosed with GBM had a higher pooled incidence of VTE among those with overall CNS malignancies. It is important to note that the results of this meta-analysis refer mainly to studies carried out in high-income countries. This highlights the need for additional research in Latin America, and low- and middle-income countries.</p>","author":"Viviane Cordeiro Veiga","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7ecd525cf1caa8b802c67ea46a62c081a9db38354376ace8387646b8f7b910da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
