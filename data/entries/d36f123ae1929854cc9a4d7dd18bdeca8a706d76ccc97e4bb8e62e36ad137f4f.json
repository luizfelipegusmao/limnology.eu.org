{"title":"Response of soybean Cd to soil Cd and pH and its associated health risk in a high geological background area in Guizhou Province, Southwest China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312301","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Xiaosong Tian, Guanqun Chai, Lina Zhu, Junlin Zhou, Qing Xie, Kangwen Zhu</p>\r\n\r\nThis study comprehensively examined the accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in soybeans grown in low- and high-Cd soils around the high geological background areas in Guizhou province. The aim was to analyze the relationship between soybean Cd and soil pH and soil Cd, alongside assessing the potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks associated with Cd in soybeans. Cd content of soybeans cultivated in the high-Cd area (0.430 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that in low-Cd areas (0.156 mg/kg) (P &lt; 0.05). Biological concentration factors (BCFs) of soybean for Cd in low- and high-Cd areas were 0.282 and 0.314, respectively, with no significant differences (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Multiple linear regression results indicated that soil pH was a determining factor for Cd accumulation in soybeans in both areas. Furthermore, soil pH and soil Cd could accurately predict Cd accumulation in soybeans according to the neural network model. These findings suggest that regulating soil pH could reduce Cd accumulation in soybeans in areas with high geological background. In both areas, there was no significant non-carcinogenic risk for the adult population (HQ value &lt; 1) through soybean consumption. However, according to the Monte Carlo model, the percentage of Cd in soybeans exceeding the acceptable range (CR value &gt; 1.00 × 10 <sup>−04</sup>) in areas was 99.18%, indicating an unacceptable carcinogenic risk for the adult population. Our discussion revealed that reducing the soybean intake and increasing soil pH did not effectively lower the carcinogenic risk of Cd in soybeans to an acceptable range (CR value ≤ 1.00 × 10 <sup>−04</sup>). These findings necessitate further exploration of alternative remediation strategies to ensure the safe production of soybeans, such as screening for low-Cd accumulation soybean varieties and implementing the combined remediation strategies.","author":"Xiaosong Tian","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d36f123ae1929854cc9a4d7dd18bdeca8a706d76ccc97e4bb8e62e36ad137f4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
