{"title":"Facial Suspension and Reconstruction of the Nasolabial Fold with the Use of Local Dermal-Fat Flap","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1062/v1","date":1715846619000,"content":"Treatment techniques for facial paralysis have evolved significantly over the past few decades, offering a variety of options to improve facial symmetry and muscle function. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel static treatment technique for the surface of the nasolabial fold (NLF) in patients with chronic facial nerve paralysis, aged between 40 and 80 years, who are not candidates for dynamic rehabilitation and present with NLF erasure. The surgical marking process was initiated by determining the projection of the nasolabial fold on the paralyzed side, through measurement of the NLF on the non-paralyzed side. Subsequently, a line was drawn around the nasal ala, and a second line was demarcated in the medial region of the sulcus. In the region close to the nasal ala, along this second line, a notch was planned. The procedure was conducted under local anesthesia. In this study, four procedures were performed without any complications. Comparatively, the outcomes demonstrated an improvement in facial symmetry, the creation of a new NLF, elevation of the ipsilateral lip commissure, and correction of nasal deviation. The proposed technique is straightforward, reproducible, and can be performed in an outpatient setting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"130c96cd722e7cb85eea4ed9c92f3dec5fa276c5e782f52d5649e089a59fcdc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
