{"title":"Chemical Characterisation of New Oils Extracted From Ca&ntilde;ihua and Tarwi Seeds With Different Organic Solvents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0805/v1","date":1715575776000,"content":"Vegetable oils contain fatty acids, phenolic compounds, natural antioxidants, and fat-soluble vitamins, which are beneficial against different diseases. Oil extraction methods can, however, affect their composition. This study aims to characterize the chemical composition of oils from two Andean seeds, cañihua (Chenopodium pallidicaule) and tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), extracted with different organic solvents, petroleum ether, hexane, and ethanol. This study compares these oils with commercial sunflower, rapeseed, and olive oils. Results showed that oils extracted with hexane had the highest yield, while those extracted with ethanol had higher antioxidant activity and total phenolic compound content. Additionally, using ethanol makes the process more sustainable than non-green solvents. The composition of tarwi and cañahua oils extracted with ethanol includes fatty acids, tocopherols, antioxidants, and phenolic compounds associated with health benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e43a002babb514f31522e52309449371be4707cc8ff8c845f2c8b0c14dd800b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
