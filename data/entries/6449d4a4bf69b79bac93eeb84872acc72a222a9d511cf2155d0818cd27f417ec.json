{"title":"Complete Loss of RelA and SpoT Homologs in Arabidopsis Reveals the Importance of the Plastidial Stringent Response in the Interplay between Chloroplast Metabolism and Plant Defense Response","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/631/7334406?rss=1","date":1698710400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The highly phosphorylated nucleotide, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), functions as a secondary messenger in bacteria and chloroplasts. The accumulation of ppGpp alters plastidial gene expression and metabolism, which are required for proper photosynthetic regulation and robust plant growth. However, because four plastid-localized ppGpp synthases/hydrolases function redundantly, the impact of the loss of ppGpp-dependent stringent response on plant physiology remains unclear. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate an <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> mutant lacking all four ppGpp synthases/hydrolases and characterized its phenotype. The mutant showed over 20-fold less ppGpp levels than the wild type under normal growth conditions and exhibited leaf chlorosis and increased expression of defense-related genes as well as salicylic acid and jasmonate levels upon transition to nitrogen-starvation conditions. These results demonstrate that proper levels of ppGpp in plastids are required for controlling not only plastid metabolism but also phytohormone signaling, which is essential for plant defense.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"6449d4a4bf69b79bac93eeb84872acc72a222a9d511cf2155d0818cd27f417ec","category":"Environment"}
