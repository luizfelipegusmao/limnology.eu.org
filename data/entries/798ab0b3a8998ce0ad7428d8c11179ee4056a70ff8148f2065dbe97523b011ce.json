{"title":"The association between zinc and prostate cancer development: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299398","date":1710943200000,"content":"<p>by Shahrzad Shahrokhi Nejad, Zahra Golzari, Moein Zangiabadian, Amir Abbas Salehi Amniyeh Khozani, Rasoul Ebrahimi, Seyed Aria Nejadghaderi, Azadeh Aletaha</p>\r\nBackground <p>Prostate cancer is affecting males globally, with several complications. Zinc can play roles in cancers. We aimed to clarify the association between zinc levels or intake with prostate cancer development.</p> Methods <p>We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science until May 1, 2023. We included case-controls and cross-sectionals that measured zinc level and/or intake in patients with prostate cancer or cohorts that evaluated the association between zinc and prostate cancer development. Studies that did not have a healthy control group were excluded. Joanna Briggs Institute was used for quality assessment. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger’s and Begg’s tests and funnel plot.</p> Results <p>Overall, 52 studies (n = 44 case controls, n = 4 cohorts, and n = 4 cross sectionals) with a total number of 163909 participants were included. Serum (standardized mean difference (SMD): -1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.67, -0.56), hair (SMD: -1.31; 95% CI: -2.19, -0.44), and prostatic fluid or tissue zinc levels (SMD: -3.70; 95% CI: -4.90, -2.49) were significantly lower in prostate cancer patients. There were no significant differences in nail zinc level and zinc intake between those with prostate cancer and healthy controls. There was no publication bias except for serum and hair zinc levels based on Begg’s and Egger’s tests, respectively. The mean risk of bias scores were 4.61 in case-controls, eight in cohorts, and seven in cross-sectionals.</p> Conclusions <p>Overall, high zinc levels might have a protective role in prostate cancer, which can be used as a therapeutic or preventive intervention. Future large-scale studies are needed to confirm the association.</p>","author":"Shahrzad Shahrokhi Nejad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"798ab0b3a8998ce0ad7428d8c11179ee4056a70ff8148f2065dbe97523b011ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
