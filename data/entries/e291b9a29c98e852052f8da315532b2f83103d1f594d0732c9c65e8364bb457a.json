However, in many cases, yolk possesses little carbohydrates and sugars, including glucose, the essential monosaccharide. Interestingly, increases in the glucose content were found in embryos of some teleost fishes; however, the origin of this glucose has been unknown. Unveiling new metabolic strategies in fish embryos has a potential for better aquaculture technologies. In the present study, using zebrafish, we assessed how these embryos obtain the glucose. We employed stable isotope (<sup>13</sup>C)-labeled substrates and injected them to the zebrafish embryos. Our liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based isotope tracking revealed that among all tested substrate, glutamate was most actively metabolized to produce glucose in the zebrafish embryos. Expression analysis for gluconeogenic genes found that many of these were expressed in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), an extraembryonic tissue found in teleost fishes. Generation 0 (G0) knockout of <span>pck2</span>, a gene encoding the key enzyme for gluconeogenesis from Krebs cycle intermediates, reduced gluconeogenesis from glutamate, suggesting that this gene is responsible for gluconeogenesis from glutamate in the zebrafish embryos. These results showed that teleost YSL undergoes gluconeogenesis, likely contributing to the glucose supplementation to the embryos with limited glucose source. Since many other animal lineages lack YSL, further comparative analysis will be interesting.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"e291b9a29c98e852052f8da315532b2f83103d1f594d0732c9c65e8364bb457a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
