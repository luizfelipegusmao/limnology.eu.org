{"title":"Insights into brominated flame retardant neurotoxicity: mechanisms of hippocampal neural cell death and brain region-specific transcriptomic shifts in mice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/2/282/7712953?rss=1","date":1720742400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) reduce flammability in a wide range of products including electronics, carpets, and paint, but leach into the environment to result in continuous, population-level exposure. Epidemiology studies have correlated BFR exposure with neurological problems, including alterations in learning and memory. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms mediating BFR-induced cell death in hippocampal cells and clarified the impact of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) exposure on gene transcription in the hippocampus, dorsal striatum, and frontal cortex of male mice. Exposure of hippocampus-derived HT-22 cells to various flame retardants, including tetrabromobisphenol-A (current use), HBCD (phasing out), or 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47, phased out) resulted in time, concentration, and chemical-dependent cellular and nuclear morphology alterations, alterations in cell cycle and increases in annexin V staining. All 3 BFRs increased p53 and p21 expression; however, inhibition of p53 nuclear translocation using pifthrin-α did not decrease cell death. Transcriptomic analysis upon low (10 nM) and cytotoxic (10 μM) BFR exposure indicated that HBCD and BDE-47 altered genes mediating autophagy-related pathways. Further evaluation showed that BFR exposure increased LC3-II conversion and autophagosome/autolysosome formation, and co-exposure with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) attenuated cytotoxicity. Transcriptomic assessment of select brain regions from subchronically HBCD-exposed male mice demonstrated alteration of genes mediating vesicular transport, with greater impact on the frontal cortex and dorsal striatum compared with the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated no increases in cell death or autophagy markers, but did demonstrate increases in the SNARE binding complex protein SNAP29, specifically in the dorsal hippocampus. These data demonstrate that BFRs can induce chemical-dependent autophagy in neural cells in vitro and provide evidence that BFRs induce region-specific transcriptomic and protein expression in the brain suggestive of changes in vesicular trafficking.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"193af66df651b7126708b375e01df2d0008b77f80e8a459c5f62248cfc4b410e","category":"Environment"}
