{"title":"Health insurance financing and patient retention in care at diabetics and hypertension clinics in Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions, Tanzania. A cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002972","date":1709820000000,"content":"<p>by Harrieth Manisha, Candida Moshiro, Ally Hussein, Fredrick Amani, Johnson Mshiu, Jaffar Shabbar, Sayoki Mfinanga</p>\r\n\r\nHypertension and diabetes are chronic conditions that cause major morbidity and mortality worldwide. Whether health insurance financing is associated with improved retention in chronic care in Tanzania, is unknown. Our study establishes the effect of health insurance on retention and the determinants for retention in care among patients attending diabetes and hypertension clinics. We used a Cohort design to study participants enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial of integrated management of HIV, diabetes, and hypertension compared with standard vertical care in the INTE-AFRICA trial. Fifteen health facilities in Dar es Salam and Pwani regions were enrolled, with 1716 participants. Our sample size had 95% power to detect a 50% to 60% retention difference between the insured and uninsured groups (95% CI). We compared proportions using χ2 tests and obtained prevalence and rate ratios by Generalised Linear Models. We studied 1716 participants for 1612.3 Person-years (PY). At the study’s end, 1351 persons were alive and retained in care. Among the insured participants (26.0%), females accounted for 65.9%. Middle-aged adults contributed 58.8% of insured participants. We observed high retention rates (retention incidence rate IR: 83.80/100 PY; 95% CI (79.40–88.40)). There was no difference in retention among insured and uninsured patients (adjusted rate ratio aRR: 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94–1.06). Being middle-aged or senior-aged adults compared to young adults, having diabetes alone or hypertension alone compared to both conditions, having the comorbidity of diabetes or hypertension with HIV compared to a single condition, and attending health centres and hospitals compared to dispensaries were significantly associated with retention in care. This study showed no effect of health insurance on retention in diabetic and hypertension care clinics. However, age, medical diagnosis, morbidity, and type of health facility attended were associated with retention in care.","author":"Harrieth Manisha","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"3096419b91c991393035126e8b9466b3a1205ec9a738e174253d4325017a1a30","category":"Environment"}
