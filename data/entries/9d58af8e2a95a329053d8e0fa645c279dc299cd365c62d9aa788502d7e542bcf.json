{"title":"The volatile organic compounds generated from the Maillard reaction between l‐ascorbic acid and l‐cysteine in hot compressed water","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13408?af=R","date":1709644455000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Hot compressed water (HCW), also known as subcritical water (SCW), refers to high-temperature compressed water in a special physical and chemical state. It is an emerging technology for natural product extraction. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated from the Maillard reaction between <span>l</span>-ascorbic acid (ASA) and <span>l</span>-cysteine (Cys) have attracted significant interest in the flavor and fragrance industry. This study aimed to explore the formation mechanism of VOCs from ASA and Cys and examine the effects of reaction parameters such as temperature, time, and pH in HCW.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The identified VOCs were predominantly thiophene derivatives, polysulfides, and pyrazine derivatives in HCW. The findings indicated that thiophene derivatives were formed under various pH conditions, with polysulfide formation favored under acidic conditions and pyrazine derivative formation preferred under weak alkaline conditions, specifically at pH 8.0.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The Maillard reaction between ASA and Cys mainly produced thiophene derivatives, polysulfides, and pyrazine derivatives in HCW. The generation mechanism was significantly dependent on the surrounding pH conditions. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Liang Feng, \nYan Yang, \nYa‐ting Xie, \nWen‐yi Yan, \nYing‐ke Ma, \nSheng Hu, \nAi‐nong Yu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"9d58af8e2a95a329053d8e0fa645c279dc299cd365c62d9aa788502d7e542bcf","category":"Environment"}
