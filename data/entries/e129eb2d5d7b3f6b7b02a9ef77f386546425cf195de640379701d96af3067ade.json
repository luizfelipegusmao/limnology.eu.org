{"title":"Numerical Coupling between a FEM Code and the FVM Code OpenFOAM by Using the MED Library","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0229/v1","date":1712124571000,"content":"This paper investigates a numerical code coupling technique to tackle multi-physics and multi-scale simulations using state-of-the-art software packages that typically address some specific modeling domain. The coupling considers the in-house FEM code, FEMuS, and the FVM code OpenFOAM, by exploiting the MED library from the SALOME platform. The present approach is tested on a buoyancy-driven fluid flow within a square cavity, where the buoyancy force constitutes the coupling term. In uncoupled scenarios, momentum and temperature equations are solved both in FEM and FVM codes without data exchange. In the coupled setting, only the OpenFOAM velocity and the FEMuS temperature fields are solved separately and shared at each time step (or vice versa). The MED library handles the coupling with the addition of suitable ad-hoc data structures that perform the field transfer between codes. Different Rayleigh numbers are investigated, comparing the outcomes of coupled and uncoupled cases with reference literature results. Additionally, a boundary data transfer application is presented to extend the capabilities of the coupling algorithm to coupled applications with separate domains. In this problem, the two domains share interfaces and boundary values on specific fields as fluxes are exchanged between the two numerical codes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e129eb2d5d7b3f6b7b02a9ef77f386546425cf195de640379701d96af3067ade","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
