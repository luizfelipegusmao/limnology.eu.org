{"title":"Enhancing biological control of postharvest green mold in lemons: Synergistic efficacy of native yeasts with diverse mechanisms of action","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301584","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Martina María Pereyra, Mariana Andrea Díaz, Silvana Vero, Julián Rafael Dib</p>\r\n\r\nArgentina is among the most important lemon fruit producers in the world. <i>Penicillium digitatum</i> is the primary lemon fungal phytopathogen, causing green mold during the postharvest. Several alternatives to the use of synthetic fungicides have been developed, being the use of biocontrol yeasts one of the most promising. Although many of the reports are based on the use of a single yeast species, it has been shown that the combination of agents with different mechanisms of action can increase control efficiency through synergistic effects. The combined use of native yeasts with different mechanisms of action had not been studied as a biological control strategy in lemons. In this work, the mechanisms of action of native yeasts (<i>Clavispora lusitaniae</i> AgL21, <i>Clavispora lusitaniae</i> AgL2 and <i>Clavispora lusitaniae</i> AcL2) with biocontrol activity against <i>P</i>. <i>digitatum</i> were evaluated. Isolate AgL21 was selected for its ability to form biofilm, colonize lemon wounds, and inhibit fungal spore germination. The compatibility of <i>C</i>. <i>lusitaniae</i> AgL21 with two killer yeasts of the species <i>Kazachstania exigua</i> (AcL4 and AcL8) was evaluated. <i>In vivo</i> assays were then carried out with the yeasts applied individually or mixed in equal cell concentrations. AgL21 alone was able to control green mold with 87.5% efficiency, while individual killer yeasts were significantly less efficient (43.3% and 38.3%, respectively). Inhibitory effects were increased when <i>C</i>. <i>lusitaniae</i> AgL21 and <i>K</i>. <i>exigua</i> strains were jointly applied. The most efficient treatment was the combination of AgL21 and AcL4, reaching 100% efficiency in wound protection. The combination of AgL21 with AcL8 was as well promising, with an efficiency of 97.5%. The combined application of native yeasts showed a synergistic effect considering that the multiple mechanisms of action involved could hinder the development of green mold in lemon more efficiently than using single yeasts. Therefore, this work demonstrates that the integration of native yeasts with diverse modes of action can provide new insights to formulate effective microbial consortia. This could lead to the development of tailor-made biofungicides, allowing control of postharvest fungal diseases in lemons while remaining competitive with traditionally used synthetic chemicals.","author":"Martina María Pereyra","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a3e87e576d63561c82259d440436a27f9c7fd6cff07674386036258abbf0c529","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
