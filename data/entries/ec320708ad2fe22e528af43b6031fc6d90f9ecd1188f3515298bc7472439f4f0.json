{"title":"High-sensitivity neonatal urine drug testing has similar positivity rates to meconium for detecting in utero exposure to methamphetamine and cocaine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/2/99/7408626?rss=1","date":1699574400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Current guidelines recommend universal screening for substance use disorders in obstetric patients, and neonatal drug testing is also frequently performed. Meconium is often the preferred specimen type to detect neonatal drug exposure due to a longer window of detection compared to urine, but most laboratories send out meconium testing to specialized reference laboratories, which can delay results for several days or more. Here, we evaluate a rapid and definitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for neonatal urine drug testing and compare results obtained using this method to paired meconium drug testing in 1,424 neonates for amphetamines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates, oxycodone and phencyclidine. Urine testing showed equivalent sensitivity to current meconium methods for detecting <span>in utero</span> exposure to amphetamines and cocaine.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"ec320708ad2fe22e528af43b6031fc6d90f9ecd1188f3515298bc7472439f4f0","category":"Environment"}
