{"title":"Proteome reorganization and amino acid metabolism during germination and seedling establishment in Lupinus albus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4891/7660064?rss=1","date":1714435200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During germination plants rely entirely on their seed storage compounds to provide energy and precursors for the synthesis of macromolecular structures until the seedling has emerged from the soil and photosynthesis can be established. Lupin seeds use proteins as their major storage compounds, accounting for up to 40% of the seed dry weight. Lupins are therefore a valuable complement to soy as a source of plant protein for human and animal nutrition. The aim of this study was to elucidate how storage protein metabolism is coordinated with other metabolic processes to meet the requirements of the growing seedling. In a quantitative approach, we analysed seedling growth, as well as alterations in biomass composition, the proteome, and metabolite profiles during germination and seedling establishment in <span>Lupinus albus</span>. The reallocation of nitrogen resources from seed storage proteins to functional seed proteins was mapped based on a manually curated functional protein annotation database. Although classified as a protein crop, <span>Lupinus albus</span> does not use amino acids as a primary substrate for energy metabolism during germination. However, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism may be integrated at the level of malate synthase to combine stored carbon from lipids and proteins into gluconeogenesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"986af5c4cd7ea7bfe363ce9c263331da614a68835b8b46ddc405edc43fb7df6f","category":"Environment"}
