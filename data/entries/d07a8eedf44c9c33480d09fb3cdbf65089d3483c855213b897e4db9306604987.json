Traditionally NCS is produced by concentrating sugarcane juices in an open pan evaporation process using dried bagasse as a fuel. Field trials at the traditional production site of NCS showed the energy efficiency as low as 8%–10%. Moreover, the effective bagasse consumption as a fuel stands at 7–8 kg/kg NCS production, whereas, as per stoichiometry and theoretical calculations, the actual bagasse consumption required for the production of NCS is a mere 0.65 kg/kg NCS production. Hence, as an alternative to the existing process, the concentration of cane juices by steam-controlled evaporation has been studied and it has been found that the steam-controlled evaporation can enhance the energy efficiency to 78%–83% with an effective bagasse consumption of 1.05 ± 0.04 kg/kg NCS production.</p>","author":"Venkatesh Thulasiraman, \nAnjineyulu Kothakota, \nMoothandaserry S.
