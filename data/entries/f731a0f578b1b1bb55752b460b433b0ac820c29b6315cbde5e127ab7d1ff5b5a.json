{"title":"An Alternative Approach in the Treatment of Anxiety Disorders: Current Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1166/v1","date":1718684333000,"content":"Anxiety disorders significantly reduce patients' quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments, primarily benzodiazepines and antidepressants, are associated with numerous side effects. Consequently, there is a continual search for alternative methods to traditional therapies that are less burdensome for patients and broaden their therapeutic options. In this review, we examined recent evidence on alternative treatments for anxiety disorders, including physical activity, mindfulness, VR technology, biofeedback, herbal remedies, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cryotherapy, hyperbaric therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, MDMA, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. Our objective was to determine the role of these selected alternative methods in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Alternative treatments significantly expand the options available to patients and clinicians, with many serving as adjuncts to traditional therapies. Among the methods presented, mindfulness has the most significant therapeutic potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f731a0f578b1b1bb55752b460b433b0ac820c29b6315cbde5e127ab7d1ff5b5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
