This article keeps track of the most credible reports of the upcoming MacBook Pro, so stay tuned for all of the latest. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: The latest rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter leaker <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1413853957634547714&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">@dylandkt reports</a> that the MacBook Pro will finally get “an updated improved <strong>1080p webcam</strong> for the next model.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/kuo-redesigned-macbook-pro-coming-later-this-year-with-mini-led-macbook-air-with-new-display-in-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Extremely accurate analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac)</a> is confident Apple will launch a <strong>redesigned MacBook Pro with a mini-LED display</strong> later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/07/touch-bar-macbook-pro-rumors-canceled/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">analyst from Display Supply Chain Consultants (vis 9to5Mac)</a> seemingly confirms that <strong>Apple is planning to “cancel the Touch Bar”</strong> with the launch of the next MacBook Pro later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/5566357&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Economic Daily News of China reported</a> that <strong>Apple has “quickly increased its capacity utilization rate”</strong> to prepare for shipments of the MacBook Pro later this year. The timing suggests a launch on October or November. The publication also reported that <strong>MacBook shipments this year are expected to reach 23 million units</strong>, a 15 percent increase over last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Sizes, design, and colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that Apple will release a “redesigned” MacBook Pro this summer. It will be available in 14- and 16-inch models; Gurman did not state if the current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234838/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1-review-amazing-breakthroughs-in-processing-and-battery-performance.html\">13-inch M1 MacBook Pro</a> will undergo any design changes, though <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1353005794292326400&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iOS developer Dylandkt tweeted in January</a> that the “upcoming MacBook Pro models may not feature a logo on the bottom bezel.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ming Chi-Kuo said in a research note  (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>) that the laptop will see a redesign in 2021. In an earlier note from May 2020 (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/07/kuo-apple-mini-led-products-q3-2020-debut/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>), Kuo said that Apple is working on a 14-inch MacBook Pro—essentially, a transformation of the higher-end 13-inch models, similar to what happened when Apple released the 16-inch MacBook Pro to replace the 15-inch models. It’s unclear if the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234838/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1-review-amazing-breakthroughs-in-processing-and-battery-performance.html\">lower-end 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> would remain in the lineup if a 14-inch version is revealed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346093/the-next-macbook-could-have-white-bezels-to-match-the-imac.html\">reports</a> that Apple will release a MacBook Air or a reintroduction of the MacBook in color offerings and a white bezel similar to those of the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344032/apple-24-inch-imac-display-m1-specs-storage-ports-ram-ethernet-colors-touch-id.html\">24-inch iMac</a>. If Apple is using colors in its consumer-level products, it’s possible that Apple sticks with the space gray and silver options for the higher-end, which includes the MacBook Pro. And according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1353005794292326400&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a tweet by previously accurate Dylandkt</a>, the MacBook Pro branding might be removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2020, analyst Ming Chi-Kuo released a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233912/report-apple-to-feature-six-products-with-mini-leds-including-a-14-1-inch-macbook-pro.html\">note</a> reporting on Apple’s use of mini LEDs in new products, including the 2021 versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. Apple already launched its first mini LED screen in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343706/ipad-pro-2021-faq-price-specs-features-release-date.html\">12.9-inch iPad Pro</a>, so it’s clear Apple is already working on the tech. While <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210604PD206.html&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">an earlier report from DigiTimes</a> suggested that Apple might delay the launch of mini-LED to 2022, Ming-Chi Kuo reported in July that Apple is preparing production of the display tech for a launch in late 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mini-LED is a backlighting technology for displays, but several more LEDs are used than what is currently implemented. This results in better control of the backlight, better image contrast, and greater dynamic range. If Apple’s description of the iPad Pro is any indication, the new display will deliver “true-to-life detail with a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio … (and) breathtaking 1000 nits of full‑screen brightness and 1600 nits of peak brightness.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: MagSafe and ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that the MacBook Pro that will be released this summer will have a MagSafe charger, an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and “more Thunderbolt ports” (the current 13-inch MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports; the current Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro has four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ming Chi-Kuo (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>) said in a research note that MagSafe will be on the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro. Introduced in Mac laptops in 2006, MagSafe was a magnetic power adapter connector that could easily disconnect from the laptop using non-axial force—tugs from angles other than straight away. Its implementation meant that if the laptop was plugged in and for whatever reason, the cable was tripped over or pulled, the connection would break and the laptop would be spared from <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/225120/will-your-new-macbook-crash-to-the-ground-without-magsafe-yes.html\">flying off the work surface</a>. MagSafe was a separate, dedicated plug for power, however, and disappeared when Apple switched to USB-C connectors in 2016. The USB-C connectors support battery charging but do not have a breakaway connector.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/13-inch-macbook-pro-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption><p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports.

According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1413853957634547714&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">@dylandkt on Twitter</a>, the MacBook Pro “will actually be getting an updated improved 1080p webcam for the next model,” which will presumably be the same hardware in the 24-inch iMac. Apple upgraded the webcam in its all-in-one with a 1080p FaceTime HD camera with an M1 image signal processor and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347534/24-inch-imac-review-apple-design-display-colors-storage-upgradability-price.html\">we found it to be a massive upgrade</a> over the 720p model.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: End of the Touch Bar</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Touch Bar is a polarizing feature of the higher-end MacBook Pro models—those who dislike it are quite expressive about it, while people who like it don’t really say much (at least it seems that way). In a January 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/235020/apples-next-m1-macbook-pros-might-dump-the-touch-bar-revive-magsafe.html\">note</a>, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the OLED Touch Bar will be replaced by function keys. In July, an analyst at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/07/touch-bar-macbook-pro-rumors-canceled/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Display Supply Chain Consultants</a> seemingly confirmed that report, telling investors that Apple is planning to “cancel the Touch Bar” in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/macbook-pro-touchbar-2019.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption>The Touch Bar’s days appear to be numbered.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234373/the-switch-to-apple-silicon-will-the-touch-bar-survive.html\">introduced the Touch Bar in 2016</a> to replace the function keys with “a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display,” but it has been a decisive feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Processor and other specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Twitter rumor have seemingly leaked small but significant details about the next MacBook Pro. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1388204435273396225&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0%7Cxid:fr1621869772634dch&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-apple-silicon-touch-bar-sd-card-reader-magsafe-price-release.html\">iOS developer Dylandkt</a>—who previously predicted the M1 in the iMac—claims the MacBook’s chip will be branded as the M1X and bring “more thunderbolt channels, more cpu cores, more gpu cores, and greater power draw.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speculation for Apple silicon in the higher-end MacBook Pro models is that Apple will use this opportunity to reveal the next in line in the M-series. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that Apple’s “redesigned” 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro will have Apple’s system on a chip that features a 10-core CPU (eight performance cores and two efficiency cores), 16 or 32 graphics core options, a maximum of 64GB of memory, and an “improved Neural Engine.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reported that it’s possible that at the end of 2021, the 13-inch MacBook Pro will have a new System on a Chip that replaces the M1. The new SoC will be faster but have eight CPU cores (four performance cores, four efficiency cores) like the M1. The graphics cores will increase from eight to ten. The chip will reportedly be called the M1X, as evidenced by several rumors and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/maxbalzer_/status/1402626084265500679/photo/2&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s own tags on the YouTube video</a> for its WWDC keynote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been rumored to be including 5G and Face ID support in its laptops, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that those features do not appear “to be coming soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Price and release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">According</a> to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will release the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with Apple silicon this summer. We had originally hoped that the new machines would arrive at WWDC, but the event has come and gone without a release. DigiTimes, which has a spotty track record for rumors but is more accurate when it comes to shipping, says that “volume production of the 14-inch MacBook Pro is likely to begin in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the 16-inch model will start in the first quarter of 2022.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210609PD204.html&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">sources recently told the publication</a> that shipments will kick off in the third quarter, so a fall launch is likely, possibly around the time the 13-inch MacBook Pro launched last year. More recently, Twitter leaker Dylan also said new MacBooks will arrive in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the Economic Daily News, which has been a reliable source of supply chain information in China, said Apple only began to increase its manufacturing capacity in late June. Finally, Ming-Chi Kuo reported in July that production for the new MacBook Pro would begin in the third quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices have not been leaked but based on prior Apple silicon launches, the 16-inch model will likely still start at $2,399, with the 14-inch MacBook Pro possibly taking the place of the $1,799 13-inch MacBook Pro. It is not clear if the current 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro will remain in the lineup.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"912ecdbca1f103debcf9765191b47a41b16afe7057600c68d2316bbeacb7367c","category":"Apple"}
