{"title":"Arabidopsis Calmodulin-like Proteins CML13 and CML14 Interact with Calmodulin-Binding Transcriptional Activators and Function in Salinity Stress Response","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/2/282/7456399?rss=1","date":1701302400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Eukaryotic cells use calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) as second messengers, particularly in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. These signals are detected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins, such as calmodulin (CaM), which regulate the downstream target proteins. Plants also possess many CaM-like proteins (CMLs), most of which remain unstudied. We recently demonstrated that <span>Arabidopsis</span> CML13 and CML14 interact with proteins containing isoleucine/glutamine (IQ) domains, including CaM-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTAs). Here, we show that CaM, CML13 and CML14 bind all six members of the <span>Arabidopsis</span> CAMTA family. Using a combination of <span>in planta</span> and <span>in vitro</span> protein-interaction assays, we tested 11 members of the CaM/CML family and demonstrated that only CaM, CML13 and CML14 bind to CAMTA IQ domains. CaM, CML13 and CML14 showed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding to the IQ region of CAMTA6 and CAMTA3, and CAMTA6 <span>in vitro</span> exhibited some specificity toward individual IQ domains within CAMTA6 in split-luciferase <span>in planta</span> assays. We show that <span>cml13</span> mutants exhibited enhanced salinity tolerance during germination compared to wild-type plants, a phenotype similar to <span>camta6</span> mutants. In contrast, plants overexpressing <span>CML13-GFP</span> or <span>CML14-GFP</span> in the wild-type background showed increased NaCl sensitivity. Under mannitol stress, <span>cml13</span> mutants were more susceptible than <span>camta6</span> mutants or wild-type plants. The phenotype of <span>cml13</span> mutants could be rescued with the wild-type <span>CML13</span> gene. Several salinity-marker genes under CAMTA6 control were similarly misregulated in both <span>camta6</span> and <span>cml13</span> mutants, further supporting a role for CML13 in CAMTA6 function. Collectively, our data suggest that CML13 and CML14 participate in abiotic stress signaling as CAMTA effectors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"750e3d88558b3aeb80d92aabef50bcd17bd2d714fc858904865361bbce8d286c","category":"Environment"}
