Here, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a selective attention task in which target and distractor pictures of different visual categories were simultaneously presented. Participants were asked to selectively process the target according to the effective cue, either before the encoding period (i.e., perceptual attention) or the maintenance period (i.e., reflective attention). On the next day, participants were asked to perform a memory recognition task in the scanner in which the targets, distractors, and novel items were presented in a pseudorandom order. Behavioral results showed that perceptual attention was better at enhancing target memory and reducing distractor memory than reflective attention, although the overall memory capacity (memory for both target and distractor) was comparable. Using multiple-voxel pattern analysis of the neural data, we found more robust target representation and weaker distractor representation in working memory for perceptual attention than for reflective attention. Interestingly, perceptual attention partially shifted the regions involved in maintaining the target representation from the visual cortex to the parietal cortex. Furthermore, the targets and distractors simultaneously presented in the perceptual attention condition showed reduced pattern similarity in the parietal cortex during retrieval compared to items not presented together. This neural pattern repulsion positively correlated with individuals’ recognition of both targets and distractors. These results emphasize the critical role of selective attention in transforming memory representations to reduce interference and improve long-term memory performance.","author":"Huinan Hu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"2905850ddd0b9c444dd28fb256f3ed47e571c70ed7080486a312dc7b03c17ff0","category":"Environment"}
