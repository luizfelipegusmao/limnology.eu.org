Here, we isolated a novel bacterium (designated as strain TMPK1<sup>T</sup>) from a 0.45-μm-filtered soil suspension by using a gel-filled microwell array device comprising 900 microwells and characterized its phylogenetic and physiological features. This strain showed low 16S rRNA gene sequence identities (&lt;91%) and low average nucleotide identity values (&lt;70%) to the closest validly described species, and belonged to a novel-family-level lineage within the order <i>Rhodospirillales</i> of <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i>. Strain TMPK1<sup>T</sup> exhibited small cell sizes (0.08–0.23 μm<sup>3</sup>) and had a high cyclopropane fatty acid content (&gt;13%), and these characteristics were differentiated from other <i>Rhodospirillales</i> bacteria. A comprehensive habitability search using amplicon datasets suggested that TMPK1<sup>T</sup> and its close relatives are mainly distributed in soil and plant-associated environments. Based on these results, we propose that strain TMPK1<sup>T</sup> represents a novel genus and species named <i>Roseiterribacter gracilis</i> gen. nov., sp. nov. (JCM 34627<sup>T</sup> = KCTC 82790<sup>T</sup>). We also propose <i>Roseiterribacteraceae</i> fam. nov. to accommodate the genus <i>Roseiterribacter</i>.","author":"Ryosuke Nakai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b86a29ea831957e338c0f5370328a81518d1af97322c66b7a37aab77ae2b4679","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
