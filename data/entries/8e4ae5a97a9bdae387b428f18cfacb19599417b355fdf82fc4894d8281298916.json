{"title":"The Existence and Construction of Palindrome Numbers Divisible by 37","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1885/v1","date":1716959029000,"content":"The existence of palindrome numbers of arbitrary length greater than 2 that are divisible by the prime number 37 is proven in this paper. The method to construct such a palindrome is also described. It turns out that a palindrome number divisible by 37 is also divisible by 3 and, consequently, divisible by 111.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e4ae5a97a9bdae387b428f18cfacb19599417b355fdf82fc4894d8281298916","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
