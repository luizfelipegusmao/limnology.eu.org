{"title":"Impact of different landing heights on the contact force in the medial tibiofemoral compartment and the surrounding muscle force characteristics in drop jumps","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307538","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Gengchao Bi, Lijun Hua, Jiajie Sun, Qiang Xu, Guanbo Li</p>\r\n\r\nThis study explored the impact of landing height on the tibiofemoral joint’s medial compartment force (MCF) during drop jumps to help athletes prevent knee injury. Experienced male participants (N = 16) performed drop jumps with landing heights from 0.15 m to 0.75 m. Kinematic/kinetic parameters were collected using a motion capture system and a three-dimensional force platform. The Med-Lat Knee model was used to calculate biomechanical indicators of the knee joint, and data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping (SPM1d). Findings indicated that landing height significantly affected the anterior-posterior and vertical MCF, flexion-extension torque, internal-external rotation torque, and vertical ground reaction force (p&lt;0.05)—all increasing with elevated landing height—and significantly impacted the generated force of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and vastus intermedius (p&lt;0.05). SPM1d analysis confirmed these results within specific time intervals. Thus, both the knee moment and the MCF exhibited similar coordinated changes during drop jumps, indicating that these may be adaptive movement strategy. The impact of varying drop jump heights on muscle groups around the knee joint varied suggests that different heights induce specific muscular responses and improve muscle coordination to prevent knee joint injuries.","author":"Gengchao Bi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9b1b8e2328cf986b657feddeec4cd5f251b87ce117c16ad06c7f562596389ea9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
