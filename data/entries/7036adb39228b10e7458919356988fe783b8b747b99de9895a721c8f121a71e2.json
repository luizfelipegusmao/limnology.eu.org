{"title":"MNEs&rsquo; Contribution to Sustainable Development: Examining the Mediating Role of Environmental, Social Performance, and SDGs&rsquo; Alignment.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1288/v1","date":1716201314000,"content":"The current global business landscape demands an acute commitment of international businesses’ sustainable practices to attain a global sustainability agenda. This paper examines the intricate nexus of Multinational Enterprises' (MNEs) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices, particularly environmental innovation, business ethics, CSR reporting and their environmental performance, social performance, as well as the influence of their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using data from Refinitiv Eikon workspace for 91 MNEs from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as a point of the study, the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) results underline the potential and significant involvement of MNEs in sustainable development shaping, especially in developing and emerging countries. The harmonization and convergence of MNEs’ CSR practices and their adoption of the SDGs emerges as a pivotal approach to enhance MNEs’ contribution to a global development and sustainability agenda.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7036adb39228b10e7458919356988fe783b8b747b99de9895a721c8f121a71e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
