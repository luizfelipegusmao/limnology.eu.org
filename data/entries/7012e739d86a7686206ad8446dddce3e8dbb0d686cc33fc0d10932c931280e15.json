{"title":"Acceleration of Deep Subsurface Fluid Fluxes in the Anthropocene","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004496?af=R","date":1712310903000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Anthropocene has been framed around humanity's impact on atmospheric, biologic, and near-surface processes, such as land use and vegetation change, greenhouse gas emissions, and the above-ground hydrologic cycle. Groundwater extraction has lowered water tables in many key aquifers but comparatively little attention has been given to the impacts in the deeper subsurface. Here, we show that fluid fluxes from the extraction and injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production and inflow of water into mines likely exceed background flow rates in deep (&gt;500 m) groundwater systems at a global scale. Projected carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), geothermal energy production, and lithium extraction to facilitate the energy transition will require fluid production rates exceeding current oil and co-produced water extraction. Natural analogs and geochemical modeling indicate that subsurface fluid manipulation in the Anthropocene will likely appear in the rock record. The magnitude and importance of these changes are unclear, due to a lack of understanding of how deep subsurface hydrologic and geochemical cycles and associated microbial life interact with the rest of the Earth system.</p>","author":"Grant Ferguson, \nLydia R.
