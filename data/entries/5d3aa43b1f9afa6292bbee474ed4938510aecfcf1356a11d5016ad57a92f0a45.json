Electron scattering signals are collected at every probe position, and extracting material properties from diffraction signals plays a critical role in the success of 4D-STEM as they may not manifest directly. This necessitates the development of dedicated data processing techniques and new algorithms for effective information extraction. Moreover, achieving large field-of-view and high-throughput materials analyses demands efficient data collection and management strategies. In this talk, we introduce a suite of machine learning-based data analysis techniques tailored for exploiting 4D-STEM datasets as outlined in Figure 1.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5d3aa43b1f9afa6292bbee474ed4938510aecfcf1356a11d5016ad57a92f0a45","category":"Environment"}
