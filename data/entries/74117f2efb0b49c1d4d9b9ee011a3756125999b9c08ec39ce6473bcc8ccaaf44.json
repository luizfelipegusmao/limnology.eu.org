{"title":"TWIST1 Drives Immune Evasion through Upregulating PD-L1 Expression in Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1047/v1","date":1713257244000,"content":"In breast cancer, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is positively associated with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and immune escape, and TWIST1 induces EMT and cancer metastasis. However, how TWIST1 regulates PD-L1 and immune evasion is unknown. This study analyzed TWIST1 and PD-L1 expression in breast cancers, investigated the mechanism for TWIST1 to regulate PD-L1 transcription, and assessed the effects of TWIST1 and PD-L1 in cancer cells on the cytotoxicity of CD8+ effector T cells. Interestingly, TWIST1 expression is associated with high-level PD-L1 in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Overexpression and knockdown of TWIST1 robustly upregulates and downregulate PD-L1 expression, respectively. TWIST1 binds to the PD-L1 promoter and recruits the TIP60 acetyltransferase complex in a BRD8-dependent manner to promote PD-L1 expression, which drives immune escape of breast cancer cells by accelerating the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, knockdown of TWIST1 or BRD8 or blockade of PD-L1 with a PD-L1 antibody significantly enhances CD8+ T cells to inhibit breast cancer cell growth. These results demonstrate that TWIST1 directly induces PD-L1 expression in breast cancer cells to drive immune evasion. Targeting TWIST1, BRD8 or PD-L1 in TNBC should facilitate CD8+ T cell-mediated immune therapy. TWIST1 may also serve as a biomarker for anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74117f2efb0b49c1d4d9b9ee011a3756125999b9c08ec39ce6473bcc8ccaaf44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
