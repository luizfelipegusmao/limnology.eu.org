{"title":"The influence of self-generated song during aggression on brain serotonin levels in male crickets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae097/7796690?rss=1","date":1727654400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pairs of adult male crickets, <span>Gryllus bimaculatus,</span> fight and immediately determine winner and loser statuses. The winner male repeatedly produces an aggressive (rival) song by rubbing his forewings together. In this study, I removed the plectrum, a sound-producing structure in the forewing, from male crickets and measured their brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) levels immediately after a 10-min aggressive interaction. Pairs of plectrum-removed males fought and established clear winner–loser relationships, like the case of intact males. The plectrum-removed winner males frequently rubbed their forewings together, but were unable to produce song. Aggressive interaction reduced significantly brain 5-HT levels in the plectrum-removed males, regardless of their winner and loser statuses. Furthermore, the reduction of brain 5-HT was detected primarily in the central body, a group of neuropils spanning the midline of the brain. In contrast, in pairs of intact males, aggressive interaction reduced brain 5-HT levels in the loser males, but not in the winner males. Plectrum removal alone did not affect the brain’s 5-HT levels. These results suggest that aggressive song emitted by the winner male cricket prevents the reduction of 5-HT levels in his own brain, especially in the central body.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"826020234953994e13233812023aa49be7153e1681c012cf1326ec87af4ca6eb","category":"Environment"}
