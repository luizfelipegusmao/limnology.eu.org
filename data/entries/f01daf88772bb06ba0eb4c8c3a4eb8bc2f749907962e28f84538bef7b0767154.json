The investigation into atomic vibrations at interfaces—shaped by structural and chemical discontinuities—sheds light on understanding and engineering phonon-correlated properties, like their role in generating distinctive infrared-optical responses and influencing thermal boundary conductance [<a href=\"#ozae044.212-B1\">1</a>]. In addition to phonon eigenfrequencies, it would be of interest to measure specific atomic eigendisplacements because of their significant roles in understanding phonon wave-like transport [<a href=\"#ozae044.212-B2\">2</a>], especially in the case of chiral phonons, where atoms vibrate circularly around their equilibrium positions [<a href=\"#ozae044.212-B3\">3</a>]. The measurement of phonon eigen-displacements, especially at interfaces, needs ultimate spatial and energy resolutions and remains challenging, typically requiring computational verifications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f01daf88772bb06ba0eb4c8c3a4eb8bc2f749907962e28f84538bef7b0767154","category":"Environment"}
