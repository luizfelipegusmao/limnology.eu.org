{"title":"Mindfulness and inhibitory control: Insights from the stop signal task with neutral and reward-associated stimuli","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303384","date":1716386400000,"content":"<p>by Zsófia Logemann-Molnár, Anna Veres-Székely, Zsolt Demetrovics, H. N. Alexander Logemann</p>\r\n\r\nMindfulness has been linked to enhanced inhibitory control, yet the dynamics of this relationship, especially in reward situations, are not well understood. Our cross-sectional study aimed to explore the relationship between trait mindfulness and a performance measure of inhibitory control as a function of reward context operationalized by stimuli characteristics, and temporal inhibitory demands. Thirty-six individuals aged 19 to 41 filled out the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and performed a stop signal task (SST), that included both neutral (stone images) and reward-related (money images) stimuli. The SST encompassed four conditions: neutral go/neutral stop, neutral go/reward stop, reward go/neutral stop, and reward go/reward stop, requiring participants to suppress reactions either during or after encountering reward-related stimuli. The relevant index of inhibitory control is the stop signal reaction time (SSRT), a performance measure of inhibitory control. Our findings showed no notable variation in the relationship between the MAAS score and SSRT across the different conditions. However, there was an overall significant effect of MAAS score on SSRT, irrespective of condition. Results may reflect the benefit of mindfulness on inhibitory control after generalized reward exposure.","author":"Zsófia Logemann-Molnár","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3e72d7b6b1c6d7c045bff4d0166bdda646dfc2e51461caec3ca3209a504bec59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
