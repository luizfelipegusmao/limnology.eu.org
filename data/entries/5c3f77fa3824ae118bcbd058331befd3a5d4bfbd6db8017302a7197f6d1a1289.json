{"title":"Subway Fine Particles (PM2.5)‐Induced Pro‐Inflammatory Response Triggers Airway Epithelial Barrier Damage Through the TLRs/NF‐κB‐Dependent Pathway In Vitro","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24403?af=R","date":1724762861000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Subways are widely used in major cities around the world, and subway fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is the main source of daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure for urban residents. Exposure to subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> leads to acute inflammatory damage in humans, which has been confirmed in mouse in vivo studies. However, the concrete mechanism by which subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> causes airway damage remains obscure. In this study, we found that subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> triggered release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 17E, tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin from human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) in a dose–effect relationship. Subsequently, supernatant recovered from the subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> group significantly increased expression of the aforementioned cytokines in BEAS-2B cells compared with the subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> group. Additionally, tight junctions (TJs) of BEAS-2B cells including zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin, and occludin were decreased by subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, supernatant recovered from the subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> group markedly decreased the expression of these TJs compared with the control group. Furthermore, inhibitors of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as chelate resins (e.g., chelex) and deferoxamine, remarkably ameliorated the observed changes of cytokines and TJs caused by subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> in BEAS-2B cells. Therefore, these results suggest that subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> induced a decline of TJs after an initial ascent of cytokine expression, and subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> altered expression of both cytokines and TJs by activating TLRs/NF-κB-dependent pathway in BEAS-2B cells. The metal components of subway PM<sub>2.5</sub> may contribute to the airway epithelial injury.</p>","author":"Fanmei Zeng, \nGuanhua Pang, \nLiwen Hu, \nYuan Sun, \nWen Peng, \nYuwei Chen, \nDan Xu, \nQing Xia, \nLuwei Zhao, \nYifei Li, \nMiao He","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"5c3f77fa3824ae118bcbd058331befd3a5d4bfbd6db8017302a7197f6d1a1289","category":"Environment"}
