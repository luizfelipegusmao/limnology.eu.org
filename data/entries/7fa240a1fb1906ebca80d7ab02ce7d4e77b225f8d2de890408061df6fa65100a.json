{"title":"Antibiotic Treatment of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infections in View of the Newly Developed &beta;-Lactams: A Narrative Review of the Existing Evidence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0203/v1","date":1714978042000,"content":"Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections represent the fourth-leading cause of death attributable to antimicrobial resistance globally, but a standardized therapy is still lacking. In this narrative review we focused the antibiotic treatment of CRAB infections in view of newly β-lactam agents (NBLs) like sulbactam/durlobactam and cefiderocol, discussing the main hot points such as the superiority of combination treatment over monotherapy and the best antibiotic partner to use in combination. Sulbactam/durlobactam seems to be the best candi-date to replace current back-bone agents. Cefiderocol, could play a crucial role in combina-tion-regimen. Due to toxicity and the PK/PD limitations, colistin (or polymyxin B) should be used as an alternative agent (when no other options are available). Tigecycline (or minocycline) and fosfomycin could represent suitable partners for both NBLs. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are needed to better evaluate the role of NBLs in CRAB infection treatment and to compare the ef-ficacy of tigecycline and fosfomycin as partner antibiotics. Synergism should be tested between NBLs and “old” drugs (rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Huge efforts should be made to accelerate pre-clinical and clinical studies on safer polymyxin candidates with lung im-proved activity, as well as on the i.v. rifabutin formulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fa240a1fb1906ebca80d7ab02ce7d4e77b225f8d2de890408061df6fa65100a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
