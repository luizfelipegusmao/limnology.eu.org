The benefit of treatment in mild cases remains a topic of debate. We evaluated the cost-benefit of reducing the blood-spot TSH cut-off (b-TSH) from 10 (Group 2) to 6 mIU/L (Group 1) in a public neonatal screening program. During the study period, 40% of 123 newborns with CH (n= 162,730; incidence = 1:1,323) had b-TSH between 6 and 10 mIU/L. Group 1 patients had fewer clinical symptoms (p=0.02), lower serum TSH (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8763e576cf407ca08c01381db40e8fbe514f8f1065deccfd249b90a1673cf18e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
