{"title":"Chronos vs Kairos - The Perception of Time in Near-Death Experiences, Mystical States of Consciousness, and Psychedelic-Induced States of Consciousness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1213/v1","date":1721107903000,"content":"Time can be a difficult concept to understand. Albert Einstein, who viewed time as an illusion, explained the passage of time is relative to the observerâ€™s frame of reference in the space-time continuum. However, the state of consciousness of the observer also influences the passage of time. This paper examines the relationship between the experience of time and different states of consciousness including near-death experiences, mystical states of consciousness, and psychedelic medicine-induced states of consciousness. Two different experiences of time are described. These are Chronos and Kairos. Chronos is described as 4th dimensional time whereas Kairos is 5th dimension time. Methods for facilitating the experience of Kairos are discussed and the potential benefits of experiencing Kairos are reviewed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73b8ca6759a923c5a15beca90762748036bd22cbec314ad300f4c6fa74a7a66c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
