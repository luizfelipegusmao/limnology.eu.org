{"title":"Zoonosis and Vaccination for Fish Health Managment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1997/v1","date":1717049656000,"content":"Vaccination is an important method of immunological preventive care required for health management of all animal including fish. More particularly, immunization is important in in-land fisheries for the management of diseases in fish brood stocks and healthy seed production. According to the latest statistics in 2020, 90.3 million tonnes of captured fish production was achieved from the aquaculture sector. Out of the above, 78.8 million tonnes from marine and 11.5 million tonnes from inland waters aquaculture sectors. About 4% decline in fish production was achieved in 2020 than 2018 from inland fisheries sectors. On the other hand, the digestive protein content, healthy fats and nutritional values of fish products are comparitively more affordable as compared to other meat sources. In 2014, about 10% aquatic cultured animals were lost (costing &amp;gt; 10 billion $ global annual loss) due to infectious diseases. Therefore, vaccination in fish especially in brood stocks is one of the most important approaches to stop such losses in the fisheries sector. Fish vaccines consist of either whole killed pathogens, subunit of a protein, a recombinant protein, DNA vaccines or live attenuated vaccines. Challenges existing are adaption of vaccination in fisheries sector, route of administration, use of effective adjuvants and most importantly lack of effective results. Use of autogenous vaccines, vaccination via intramuscular, intraperitoneal or oral routes, and most importantly adding vaccines in feed using top dressing methods or as a constituent in fish feed are now in emerging. These method shall lower the risk of using antibiotics in cultured water which in turn will reduce the environmental contamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"426ad5b77ada274949338128fba900031ab5aca0c30e81d68753f22884fe3d26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
