The investigation focuses on an online course format catering to students majoring in information systems, healthcare administration, business administration, and marketing. Traditional software installation hurdles, especially for complex systems like Microsoft Access and MySQL, can impede students' engagement and access. To overcome these challenges, the study proposes leveraging cloud-based solutions and clientless remote desktop gateways like Apache Guacamole. Results indicate that these approaches effectively eliminate software installation obstacles, ensuring seamless access to essential tools for all students. The study underscores the importance of innovative technological solutions in promoting inclusive and impactful learning environments in higher education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3074a616e4b4314e26b0be39165ee4902fafa6622fea75d466c1f2897f2b19a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
