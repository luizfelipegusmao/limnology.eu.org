{"title":"Brassinosteroid-dependent phosphorylation of PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE2 reduces its DNA-binding ability in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2253/7615506?rss=1","date":1709078400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are widely used as plant growth regulators in modern agriculture. Understanding how BRs regulate nutrient signaling is crucial for reducing fertilizer usage. Here we elucidate that the central BR signaling inhibitor GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 (GSK2) interacts directly with and phosphorylates PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE2 (OsPHR2), the key regulator of phosphate (Pi) signaling, to suppress its transcription factor activity in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). We identify a critical phosphorylation site at serine residue S269 of OsPHR2 and demonstrate that phosphorylation by GSK2 or phosphor-mimic mutation of S269 substantially impairs the DNA-binding activity of OsPHR2, and thus diminishes expression of OsPHR2-induced genes and reduces Pi levels. Like BRs, Pi starvation noticeably induces GSK2 instability. We further show that this site-specific phosphorylation event is conserved in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), but varies among the PHR-family members, being present only in most land plants. These results unveil a distinctive post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in Pi signaling by which BRs promote Pi acquisition, with a potential contribution to the environmental adaptability of plants during their evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"d15c02e629110fb907e81e65a8a4cf58d18ad2ad3d987b6cb70d31b7d0e53a0f","category":"Environment"}
