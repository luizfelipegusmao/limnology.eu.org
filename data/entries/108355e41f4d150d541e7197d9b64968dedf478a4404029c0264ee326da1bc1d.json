However, the regulatory mechanism of bud dormancy in tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa) remains largely unknown. Here, we observed dramatically reduced and increased accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and bioactive gibberellins (GAs) GA<sub>1</sub> and GA<sub>3</sub>, respectively, during bud endodormancy release of tree peony under prolonged chilling treatment. An Illumina RNA sequencing study was performed to identify potential genes involved in the bud endodormancy regulation in tree peony. Correlation matrix, principal component, and interaction network analyses identified a downregulated MYB transcription factor gene, <span>PsMYB306</span>, the expression of which positively correlated with <span>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 3</span> (<span>PsNCED3</span>) expression. Protein modeling analysis revealed 4 residues within the R2R3 domain of PsMYB306 to possess DNA binding capability. Transcription of <span>PsMYB306</span> was increased by ABA treatment. Overexpression of <span>PsMYB306</span> in petunia (Petunia hybrida) inhibited seed germination and plant growth, concomitant with elevated ABA and decreased GA contents. Silencing of <span>PsMYB306</span> accelerated cold-triggered tree peony bud burst and influenced the production of ABA and GAs and the expression of their biosynthetic genes. ABA application reduced bud dormancy release and transcription of <span>ENT-KAURENOIC ACID OXIDASE 1</span> (<span>PsKAO1</span>), <span>GA20-OXIDASE 1</span> (<span>PsGA20ox1</span>), and <span>GA3-OXIDASE 1</span> (<span>PsGA3ox1</span>) associated with GA biosynthesis in <span>PsMYB306</span>-silenced buds. In vivo and in vitro binding assays confirmed that PsMYB306 specifically transactivated the promoter of <span>PsNCED3</span>. Silencing of <span>PsNCED3</span> also promoted bud break and growth. Altogether, our findings suggest that PsMYB306 negatively modulates cold-induced bud endodormancy release by regulating ABA production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"108355e41f4d150d541e7197d9b64968dedf478a4404029c0264ee326da1bc1d","category":"Environment"}
