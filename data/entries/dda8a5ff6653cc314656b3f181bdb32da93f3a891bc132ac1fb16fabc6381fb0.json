{"title":"KIC (ketoisocaproic acid) and leucine have divergent effects on tissue insulin signaling but not on whole-body insulin sensitivity in rats","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309324","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Gagandeep Mann, Stephen Mora, Olasunkanmi A. John Adegoke</p>\r\n\r\nPlasma levels of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites, the branched-chain ketoacids are increased in insulin resistance. Our previous studies showed that leucine and its metabolite KIC suppress insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes along with the activation of the S6K1-IRS-1 pathway. Because other tissue and fiber types can be differentially regulated by KIC, we analyzed the effect of KIC gavage on whole-body insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling <i>in vivo</i>. We hypothesized that KIC gavage would reduce whole-body insulin sensitivity and increase S6K1-IRS-1 phosphorylation in various tissues and muscle fibers. Five-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were starved for 24 hours and then gavaged with 0.75ml/100g of water, leucine (22.3g/L) or KIC (30g/L) twice, ten minutes apart. They were then euthanized at different time points post-gavage (0.5-3h), and muscle, liver, and heart tissues were dissected. Other sets of gavaged animals underwent an insulin tolerance test. Phosphorylation (ph) of S6K1 (Thr389), S6 (Ser235/6) and IRS-1 (Ser612) was increased at 30 minutes post leucine gavage in skeletal muscles irrespective of fiber type. Ph-S6 (Ser235/6) was also increased in liver and heart 30 minutes after leucine gavage. KIC gavage increased ph-S6 (Ser235/6) in the liver. Neither Leucine nor KIC influenced whole-body insulin tolerance, nor ph-Akt (Ser473) in skeletal muscle and heart. BCKD-E1 α abundance was highest in the heart and liver, while ph-BCKD-E1 α (Ser293) was higher in the gastrocnemius and EDL compared to the soleus. Our data suggests that only leucine activates the S6K1-IRS-1 signaling axis in skeletal muscle, liver and heart, while KIC only does so in the liver. The effect of leucine and KIC on the S6K1-IRS-1 signaling pathway is uncoupled from whole-body insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that KIC and leucine may not induce insulin resistance, and the contributions of other tissues may regulate whole-body insulin sensitivity in response to leucine/KIC gavage.","author":"Gagandeep Mann","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dda8a5ff6653cc314656b3f181bdb32da93f3a891bc132ac1fb16fabc6381fb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
