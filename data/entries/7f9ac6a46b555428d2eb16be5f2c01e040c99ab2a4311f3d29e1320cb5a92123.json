{"title":"Dynamics of a stochastic SEIQR model driven by Lévy jumps with bilinear incidence rates","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305139","date":1718373600000,"content":"<p>by Qiuye Xia, Xiaoling Qiu</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, we propose a stochastic SEIQR infectious disease model driven by Lévy noise. Firstly, we study the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution of the model by using the stop-time. Secondly, the asymptotic behavior of the stochastic system at disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium are discussed. Then, the sufficient condition for persistence under the time mean is studied. Finally, our theoretical results are verified by numerical simulation.","author":"Qiuye Xia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7f9ac6a46b555428d2eb16be5f2c01e040c99ab2a4311f3d29e1320cb5a92123","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
