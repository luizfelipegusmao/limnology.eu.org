{"title":"Association between physical measures of spinopelvic alignment and physical functioning with patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) after total hip arthroplasty: Protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304382","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Sima Vatandoost, Katie Kowalski, Brent Lanting, K. C. Geoffrey Ng, Saghar Soltanabadi, Alison Rushton</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Prevalence of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has trended upwards over past decades and is projected to increase further. Optimizing outcomes after surgery is essential to avoid surgical revision and maximize outcomes. Low back pain is reported as a problem post THA. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are commonly used to evaluate THA outcomes but have limitations (e.g., ceiling effects). It is therefore important to assess a comprehensive range of outcomes. Physical outcome measures of spinopelvic alignment and physical functioning demonstrate potential value, but no evidence synthesis has investigated their association with PROMs. The objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate the association between spinopelvic alignment and physical outcome measures of physical functioning with PROMs and characteristics of low back pain after THA.</p> Methods and analysis <p>This protocol is aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies evaluating the association between the physical outcome measures and PROMs (any outcome measures reported) following THA by any approach/implant will be included except surface replacement and revision THA. Studies investigating THA for developmental pathology and inflammatory conditions will be excluded. A systematic search in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and the grey literature will be carried out from inception to July 31, 2023. Two independent reviewers will evaluate eligibility of retrieved articles, extract data and assess risk of bias (NIH quality assessment tool) of included studies. A third reviewer will mediate disagreements. Random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted if studies are sufficiently homogeneous in design, population, physical measures and PROMs; reporting odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Where meta-analyses are not possible, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. Confidence in cumulative evidence will be assessed using a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).</p> PROSPERO registration number <p>PROSPERO Registration number CRD42023412744.</p>","author":"Sima Vatandoost","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ad3d5f6f78234cef3625047661d90dc232a7e58b4c1dc1dccc426992d2f1c7e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
