{"title":"Radiotracer Innovations in Breast Cancer Imaging: A Review of Recent Progress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1433/v1","date":1724207590000,"content":"This review focuses on the pivotal role of radiotracers in breast cancer imaging, emphasizing their importance in accurate detection, staging, and treatment monitoring. Radiotracers, labeled with radioactive isotopes, are integral to various nuclear imaging techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and positron emission mammography (PEM). The most widely used radiotracer in breast cancer imaging is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which highlights areas of increased glucose metabolism, a hallmark of many cancer cells. This allows for the identification of primary tumors, metastatic sites, and assessment of tumor response to therapy. In addition to 18F-FDG, this review will explore newer radiotracers targeting specific receptors, such as estrogen receptors or HER2, which offer more personalized imaging options. These tracers provide valuable insights into the molecular characteristics of tumors, aiding in tailored treatment strategies. By integrating radiotracers into breast cancer management, clinicians can enhance early disease detection, monitor therapeutic efficacy, and guide interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Ongoing research aimed at developing more specific and sensitive tracers will also be highlighted, underscoring their potential to advance precision medicine in breast cancer care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60b1e3b8d181db784876779a036b677ac46ada38dd4d7516a89973dc30793b8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
