{"title":"Temperature regulates Synechococcus population dynamics seasonally and across the continental shelf","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10331?af=R","date":1683886548000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Hourly, year-round flow cytometry has made it possible to relate seasonal environmental variability to the population dynamics of the smallest, most abundant phytoplankton on the Northeast US Shelf. To evaluate whether the insights from these data extend to <i>Synechococcus</i> farther from shore, we analyze flow cytometry measurements made continuously from the underway systems on 21 cruises traveling between the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO) and the continental shelf break. We describe how seasonal patterns in <i>Synechococcus</i>, which have been documented in detail at MVCO, occur across the region with subtle variation. We find that the underlying relationship between temperature and division rate is consistent across the shelf and can explain much of the observed spatial variability in concentration. Connecting individual cell properties to annual and regional patterns in environmental conditions, these results demonstrate the value of autonomous monitoring and create an improved picture of picophytoplankton dynamics within an economically important ecosystem.</p>","author":"Bethany L.
