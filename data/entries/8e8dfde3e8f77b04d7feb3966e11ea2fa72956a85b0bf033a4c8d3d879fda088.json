{"title":"Successful Therapy over 12 Months of People with Cystic Fibrosis with Rare Non-phe508del-CFTR Mutations with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1731/v1","date":1729764938000,"content":"Background: Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) is a CFTR modulator therapy approved for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) who have at least one phe508del mutation. However, its approval in the EU for pwCF with non-phe508del mutations is lacking, with limited data on treatment response in this subgroup. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from six pwCF (ages 6 to 66) with responsive CFTR mutations (M1101K, R347P, 2789+5G&gt;A, G551D) undergoing off-label ETI therapy. Evaluations were conducted at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, assessing lung function (FEV1), sweat chloride levels, BMI, quality of life (CFQ-R), medication satisfaction (TSQM), ENT symptoms (SNOT-22), and physical performance. A control group of four pwCF with classic symptoms and no ETI treatment was included. Results: FEV1 improved significantly after 3 and 6 months (p&lt;0.05) and stabilized by 12 months. Sweat chloride levels decreased significantly, with four pwCF achieving levels below 60 mmol/l. Improvements in ENT and respiratory symptoms, medication satisfaction, and increased BMI were noted. Conclusion: ETI demonstrates high efficacy in selected non-phe508del mutations, offering an effective treatment option that warrants further monitoring and evaluation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e8dfde3e8f77b04d7feb3966e11ea2fa72956a85b0bf033a4c8d3d879fda088","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
