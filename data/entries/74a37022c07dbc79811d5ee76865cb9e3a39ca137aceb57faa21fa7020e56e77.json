{"title":"Wheat Flour Pasta Combining Bacillus Coagulans and Arthrospira platensis as a Novel Probiotic Food with Antioxidants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0151/v1","date":1722694065000,"content":"Arthrospira platensis (Ap) and Bacillus coagulans (Bc) have been successfully used to develop functional foods, but not a combination of both regarding functional implications in nutritional value and antioxidant capacity. This work aimed to develop an artisanal wheat flour pasta with egg using 5% A. platensis and 1% B. coagulans GBI 6068 (Bc+Ap). Uncooked pasta was characterized regarding nutritional value; furthermore, total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity (by ABTS and FRAP), pigment content (chlorophyll a + b, and total carotenoids), colorimetry assay, textural profile analysis, buffering capacity and probiotic viability were carried out on uncooked and cooked pasta to assess the changes induced by cooking. The Bc+Ap pasta showed enhanced nutritional value with a significant increase in protein content (30.61%). After cooking, the pasta increased phenolic content (14.22% mg GAE/g), antioxidant capacity (55.59% µmol Trolox Equivalents/g and 10.88% µmol Fe+2/g) for ABTS and FRAP respectively, pigment content (6.72 and 1.17 mg/100g), for chlorophyll a+b and total carotenoids respectively, but relative positive impacts on colorimetric parameters in contrast to control (wheat flour pasta). Furthermore, Bc+Ap showed improved firmness (59%, measured in g), buffer capacity (87.80% μmol H+(g × ΔpH)−1), and good probiotic viability (7.2 ± 0.17 log CFU/g) after the cooking process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74a37022c07dbc79811d5ee76865cb9e3a39ca137aceb57faa21fa7020e56e77","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
