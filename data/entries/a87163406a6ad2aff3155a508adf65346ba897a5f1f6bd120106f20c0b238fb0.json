{"title":"The genetic diversity and population structure of Macridiscus multifarius along the coast of China using IIB-RAD sequencing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/142/2/167/7329701?rss=1","date":1698192000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The clam <span>Macridiscus multifarius</span> is ecologically and economically important in the coastal regions of China. In this study, the IIB-RAD method was used to investigate the population diversity and structure of <span>M. multifarius</span> along the coast of China. Genomic DNA was extracted, sequenced, and subjected, resulting in 110.88 Gb of clean reads. Analysis showed that the <span>M. multifarius</span> populations along the coast of China exhibited a moderate to high level of genetic diversity (mean: <span>H</span><sub>O</sub> = 0.272, <span>H</span><sub>E</sub> = 0.365, <span>Ï€</span> = 0.390, and <span>F</span><sub>IS</sub> = 0.268). Further analysis of high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms was used to generate a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, principal component analysis, and <span>F</span><sub>ST</sub> values. The results revealed that there is no notable genetic differentiation among the nine <span>M. multifarius</span> populations south of the Yangtze River estuary. However, the Yancheng population shows clear genetic differentiation compared with the other nine populations, possibly linked to the barrier effect of the Yangtze dilution water and ocean current system. We believe that these results provide genetic insights for fisheries management to plan fisheries policies for <span>M. multifarius</span> and conserve natural resources.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"a87163406a6ad2aff3155a508adf65346ba897a5f1f6bd120106f20c0b238fb0","category":"Environment"}
