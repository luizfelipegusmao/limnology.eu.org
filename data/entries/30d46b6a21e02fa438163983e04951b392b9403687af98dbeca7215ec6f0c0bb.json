{"title":"Analytic Formulae for T Violation in Neutrino Oscillations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0105/v1","date":1714630028000,"content":"Recently, a concept known as μTRISTAN, which involves the acceleration of μ+, has been proposed. This initiative has led to considerations of a new design for a neutrino factory. Additionally, leveraging the polarization of μ+, measurements of T violation in neutrino oscillations are also being explored. In this paper, we present analytical expressions for T violation in neutrino oscillations within the framework of standard three flavor neutrino oscillations, a scenario involving nonstandard interactions, and a case of unitarity violation. We point out that examining the energy spectrum of T violation may be useful for probing new physics effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30d46b6a21e02fa438163983e04951b392b9403687af98dbeca7215ec6f0c0bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
