{"title":"The Finite-Size Nuclear Structure of the Black Hole","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202109.0354/v2","date":1720784494000,"content":"Although some alternative metrics have been proposed in classical gravity, the singularity problem remains unresolved perfectly. To satisfy the super-gravitational requirement of a black hole without singularities, we propose some possible finite-size structure to avoid the confused one. In this research, the degenerate Fermi electron gas is first used to reveal that the Fermi electron gas cannot shrink to a point regardless of how much energy it obtains; therefore, the singularity existing at the center becomes very unreasonable. To avoid these problems, a finite-size nucleus of the black hole is proposed and explained by the behaviors of the Fermi electron gas and Fermi neutron gas for this finite-size nuclear model. We construct the Kerr-Newman black hole by using a non-rotating but charged finite-size nucleus, a compact-like star, which is surrounded by counter-rotating and corotating electrons. Based on this model, the super-gravity the same as the one from a black hole is presented, and the speed of light observed at far-away places can be nonzero at the event horizon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e9fbf8e0cc34eb435a6b8c03d83892d0a5bd9ea1cfeb2d05fe463a3e02ce8c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
