{"title":"Analyzing the Possibilities of Using the Scilit Platform to Identify Current Energy Efficiency and Conservation Issues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0744/v1","date":1712753853000,"content":"Purpose of publication:  - Preparation of bibliometric data exported from the Scilit platform on energy efficiency and conservation for further analysis to identify relevant research topics. - To identify potential issues in the processing of data exported from the Scilit platform. - Providing colleagues with the opportunity to use the prepared data and examples of their analysis for independent research on topical issues of energy efficiency and energy conservation using materials provided by the Scilit platform. Research Materials: Files in CSV and RIS formats exported from Scilit for the query \"energy conservation OR efficiency\" in Common Fields [Title, Abstract, Keyword], using filters: Content Type → Journal Article; Year→2021-2023; Subject → Industrial Engineering (29.8K), Energy and Fuel Technology (9.8K), Manufacturing Engineering (9.2K). A total of 30K records sorted by their relevance (10K for each year) were exported. Data are current as of 14-03-2024. Methods: Preprocessing of title, annotation, and keyword field texts using lemmatization dictionaries collected on GitHub, removal of keywords taken from GATE and spaCy, and \"manual\" editing. Using VOSviewer to analyze publication topics by clustering keywords based on their co-occurrence. Using Scimago Graphica to build bubble diagrams.Application of the GSDMM algorithm for clustering bibliometric records by title and annotation texts. Creation of a dictionary for this algorithm using the keyword field.Use of the Carrot2 demo version and the NMF algorithm for a more detailed analysis of the topics of the record clusters obtained from GSDMM. Results: are presented in the form of initial and interim tables and graphs obtained in the course of this study. The full tables are provided as references to the attached materials.
