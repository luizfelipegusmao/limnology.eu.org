{"title":"Endovascular Aortic Repair in Traumatic Descending Thoracic Aortic Transection: A Case Report with Short Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1926/v1","date":1724770306000,"content":"Aortic transection, a near-complete tear through the layers of the aorta, is a critical condition often resulting from trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. The urgency of managing aortic transection underscores the critical need for effective interventions. We report the case of a male in his early 50â€™s with no significant medical history who presented to the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision, sustaining multiple injuries including a descending thoracic aortic transection. Rapid diagnostic assessment confirmed the severity of the injury, necessitating immediate intervention. Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was successfully employed, highlighting its efficacy in managing acute aortic injuries. The patient responded well to treatment, underscoring the importance of timely intervention in improving patient outcomes. This case emphasizes the critical role of rapid diagnostic assessment and endovascular intervention in managing life-threatening thoracic aortic injuries, particularly in the acute setting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60e458f77c373a1db73395b26bcae10e884f8e525ba6e5d5c9dfee04f7046133","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
