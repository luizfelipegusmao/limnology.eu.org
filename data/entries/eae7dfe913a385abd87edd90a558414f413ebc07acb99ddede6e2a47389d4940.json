{"title":"High- Flexibility Contact Force Sensor Based On The 8-Shaped Wound Polymer Optical Fiber For Human Safety In Human-Robot Collaboration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2019/v1","date":1721889038000,"content":"Human-robot collaboration is a new trend in modern manufacture. The safety or human protection is of great significance due to the share of the same workshop between humans and robots. To achieve effective protection, in this paper, a contact force sensor based on the 8-shaped wound polymer optical fiber is proposed. The 8-shaped wound structure can convert the normal contact force to the shrinkage of the 8-shaped optical fiber ring. The macro-bending loss of the optical fiber is used to detect the contact force. Compared with conventional sensors, the proposed scheme has the advantage of high flexibility, low cost, fast response, high repeatability, which shows the great promise on actively alarming collision and passively reducing the hurt.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eae7dfe913a385abd87edd90a558414f413ebc07acb99ddede6e2a47389d4940","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
