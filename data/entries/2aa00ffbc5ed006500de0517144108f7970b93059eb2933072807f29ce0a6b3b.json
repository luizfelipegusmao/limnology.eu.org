{"title":"The Prognostic and Predictive Utility of CDX2 in Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1687/v1","date":1721627582000,"content":"Caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) is a gastrointestinal cancer biomarker that regulates epithelial development and differentiation. Absence or low levels of CDX2 have been associated with poor prognosis and proposed as a chemotherapy response predictor. Tumour tissue of 668 patients with stage I-IV colorectal cancer were stained for CDX2 and stratified into two subgroups according to expression levels. Statistical tests evaluated CDX2 relationship with survival and chemotherapy response. Of 646 samples successfully stained, 51 (7.9%) had low and 595 (92.1%) had high CDX2 levels. Low CDX2 staining was associated with poor differentiation, presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and more common in colon and right sided tumours. Overall survival (p&amp;lt;0.001) and disease-free survival (p=0.009) was lower in low CDX2 expressing patients. Multivariable analysis validated CDX2 as an independent poor prognostic factor after excluding confounding variables. There was no statistically significant improvement in survival with adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer (p=0.11). In the rectal cohort, there was no relationship between CDX2 levels and therapy response. While confirming the prognostic utility of CDX2 in colorectal cancer, our study highlights larger studies are required to confirm utility as a predictive chemotherapy biomarker, especially in left sided and rectal cancers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2aa00ffbc5ed006500de0517144108f7970b93059eb2933072807f29ce0a6b3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
