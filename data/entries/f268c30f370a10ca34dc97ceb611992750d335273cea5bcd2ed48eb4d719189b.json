{"title":"259 Effect of very low calcium diet supplemented with microbial phytase in post-weaning piglets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/156/7664695?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Young piglets have an immature intestine that provides limited gastric acidity to digest nutrients compared with later stages of growth. Food has the intrinsic capacity to modify gastric acidity, particularly in relation to their concentrations of limestone, the ingredient with the greatest capacity to bind to acid. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the impacts of reducing dietary calcium (Ca) by reducing calcium supplementation immediately after weaning; compared with the recommendations of the NRC (2012), in association with phytase supplementation. The treatments were distributed during 3 phases [Phase 1 (P1, d 0-9), 2 (P2, d 10-16) and 3 (P3, d 17-35)]. Treatments were: 1) a diet low Ca that did not contained limestone during phase 1 (LowCa), P1 to P3 respectively, 0.51-0.60-0.65 % Ca and 0.48-0.43-0.38 % standardized ileal digestible P (STTD P), 2), diet 1 with microbial phytase (LowCa+PhytM); P1 to P3 respectively, 0.51-0.60-0.65 % Ca and 0.48-0.43-0.38% STTD P with 750 FTU phytase, and 3) a diet fulfilling requirement (NormalCa+PhytM) P1 to P3 respectively, 0.85-0.80-0.70 % Ca and 0.48-0.43-0.38 % STTD P with 750 FTU phytase. Piglets (n = 120) were allocated to 6 pens of 5 piglets per treatment in function of initial body weight (BW; 6.12 ± 0.028 kg). On d 0, 15 and 36, dual X-ray (DXA) bone densitometry was used to measure body fat, lean and mineral content (BMC) compositions using 8 piglets per treatment. At the end of phase 1 (d 9) a blood sample was collected. Data were analyzed using the SAS MIXED procedure with Tukey’s test to compare means. No differences were observed in growth performance or DXA measurements during the first phase. On d 9, LowCa piglets showed signs of hypocalcaemia with reduced plasma Ca (<span>P</span> = 0.03), increased plasma P (<span>P</span> = 0.02) and a lower Ca:P ratio in plasma (<span>P</span> = 0.04). From d 9-15, piglets that had received LowCa+PhytM showed greater average daily gain (ADG; <span>P</span> = 0.002) while other criteria did not differ between treatments. On d 15, the body composition evaluated by DXA showed no difference among dietary treatments. During phase 3, final BW and average daily feed intake were not modified by dietary treatments, while average daily gain and feed efficiency were greater in LowCa than in NormalCa+PhytM (+7.3 and 6.7%, respectively), and LowCa+PhytM was intermediate. Body composition on d 35 showed no difference among treatments while a tendency (<span>P</span> = 0.095) for greater BMC deposition (g/d) in LowCa in comparison with NormalCa+PhytM (+1.3 %). The implemented LowCa strategy resulted in momentary hypocalcemia which probably activated homeostatic mechanisms allowing piglets to be more efficient in using minerals and possibly other nutrients leading to better growth performance, without impact on bone mineralization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f268c30f370a10ca34dc97ceb611992750d335273cea5bcd2ed48eb4d719189b","category":"Environment"}
