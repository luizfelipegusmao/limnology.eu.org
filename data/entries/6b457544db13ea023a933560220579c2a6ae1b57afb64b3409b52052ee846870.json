{"title":"Innovation of Wooden Pile Foundation Model for Housing Development on Swampy Land","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0374/v1","date":1720077631000,"content":"This study examines the latest innovation in wooden pile foundation models using a combination of wood and concrete materials for house construction on swampy land. The focus of the research is on developing joints and materials that enhance the load-bearing capacity and stability of building structures on swampy terrain. The methods used include field observations, laboratory experiments, and descriptive analysis. The results show that the combination of wood and concrete in foundation piles can increase structural strength, reduce deformation, and extend the service life of buildings. The new joint techniques developed in this research are effective in improving structural integrity and minimizing the negative impacts of soft soil conditions. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of material innovation and joint techniques in construction on swampy land, providing practical guidance for construction practitioners and researchers in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b457544db13ea023a933560220579c2a6ae1b57afb64b3409b52052ee846870","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
