{"title":"Effect of Using Black Soldier Fly Larvae Thermocomposted Frass as a Germination Substrate on Phytotoxicity, Germination Index, Growth, and Antioxidants Content in Kale (Brassica oleracea)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0486/v1","date":1715154215000,"content":"Frass generated during the production of black soldier fly larvae is taking the interest of scientists and horticultural producers because it is a material from the biotransformation of organic waste, it has several nutrients that can be used by plants, and its recent focus on its biostimulant capacity. The thermal-composting process is a stabilization that improves physical and chemical properties of treated wastes, allowing better performance in plants compared to its fresh state. In this research, thermocomposted frass was evaluated as a germination substrate for kale seeds (Brassica olerasea). To achieve this, it was evaluated the phytotoxicity in different concentrations on the seeds, and seedlings were grown in a germination substrates mixed with 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of frass. The treatment with 20% frass showed the highest values of seedling height, stem diameter, number of leaves, length, and width of first true leaf and length and width of cotyledons, reduced the content of phenols and tannins antioxidants but the content of flavonoids increased compared to the control and the rest of mixtures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9aec95b189fd9bad129cd056d2c64cebf5811a3daa3266e6f7c661739266a3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
