{"title":"Challenges in Housing Accessibility towards Universal Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1620/v1","date":1729523810000,"content":"Housing is the most regulated type of building. Standards significantly influence the design and construction quality, often making universal design more expensive and challenging to implement. This study aims to review current Spanish regulations on accessibility in the housing sector, to promote non-discriminatory and independent access, while ensuring the safety of each resident. The research is exploratory and qualitative, involving a systematic bibliographic review through an exhaustive search of regulations in force until December 2023. In Spain, there are three laws (from 1999, 1960 and 2022), three decrees (from 2006, 2013 and 2015) and a national plan from the regulatory framework. The main regulation, the Technical Building Code, outlines the accessibility, safety and habitability requirements that buildings must adhere to. The most recent is Law 6/2022 on Cognitive Accessibility. Spain has robust legislation with innovative approaches and ambitious goals. However, there is a lack of societal awareness that housing is a fundamental right and that the regulations must be upheld. Several proposals for improvement have been made. These suggested changes address the specific challenges of each region and promote more inclusive and adaptable projects for all people from the early stages of design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9fa611520ffb5d456e8780407e9580209d3514e2f699ba002c19e00d1c0d3fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
