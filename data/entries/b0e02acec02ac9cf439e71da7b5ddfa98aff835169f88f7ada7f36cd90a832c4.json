Our findings reveal previously unreported sighting locations, often associated with tourism activities, underscoring the pivotal role played by nontraditional data sources in addressing knowledge gaps. These revelations emphasize the ongoing necessity for monitoring efforts. Additionally, we have found cases that raise concerns related to unregulated humanâ€“shark interactions in the region, highlighting the pressing need for sustainable tourism practices within Bahamian waters.</p>","author":"Natascha Wosnick, \nEric V.
