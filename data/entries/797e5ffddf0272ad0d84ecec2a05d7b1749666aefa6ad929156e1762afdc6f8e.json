{"title":"An open-source perceptual crossing device for investigating brain dynamics during human interaction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305283","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Stephen Estelle, Kenzo Uhlig, Leonardo Zapata-Fonseca, SÃ©bastien Lerique, Brian Morrissey, Rai Sato, Tom Froese</p>\r\n\r\nThe Perceptual Crossing Device (PCD) introduced in this report is an updated tool designed to facilitate the exploration of brain activity during human interaction with seamless real time integration with EEG equipment. It incorporates haptic and auditory feedback mechanisms, enabling interactions between two users within a virtual environment. Through a unique circular motion interface that enables intuitive virtual interactions, users can experience the presence of their counterpart via tactile or auditory cues. This paper highlights the key characteristics of the PCD, aiming to validate its efficacy in augmenting the understanding of human interactions. Furthermore, by offering an accessible and intuitive interface, the PCD stands to foster greater community engagement in the realm of embodied cognitive science and human interaction studies. Through this device, we anticipate a deeper comprehension of the complex neural dynamics underlying human interaction, thereby contributing a valuable resource to both the scientific community and the broader public.","author":"Stephen Estelle","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"797e5ffddf0272ad0d84ecec2a05d7b1749666aefa6ad929156e1762afdc6f8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
