{"title":"Thermo-Mechanical Uniaxial Compression of 4D Printed PLA in Wide Range of Strain Rates and Temperatures below Glass Transition Temperature Tg","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0290/v1","date":1714991915000,"content":"In this paper thermo-mechanical behavior of 4D printed Polylactic Acid (PLA) was investigated, focusing on its response to varying strain rates and temperatures below the glass transition temperature. Dynamic mechanical analysis and uniaxial tensile tests confirmed PLA's dependency on strain rate, showcasing its sensitivity to external stimuli. Stress-strain curves exhibited typical thermoplastic behavior, with yield stresses varying with strain rates, underscoring PLA's responsiveness to different deformation speeds. Clear strain rate dependence was observed, particularly at quasi-static rates, with temperature and strain rate fluctuations significantly influencing PLA's mechanical properties, including yield stress and deformation behavior. Isothermal compression tests demonstrated predictable stress-strain curves with distinct yield points, while adiabatic tests reveal additional complexities such as heat accumulation leading to further softening. Thermal imaging revealed temperature increase during deformation, highlighting the material's thermo-sensitive nature. These findings provide the basis for future research with the focus on advanced modeling techniques and mitigation strategies for self-heating effects, aiming to enhance PLA-based product reliability and performance in applications with deformations at higher strain rates, while also developing models to simulate shape recovery in 4D printed PLA structures at both cold and hot programming temperatures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d04305888ea02e7367ffc64c4c02cd235cef34c17094d38a5ef0e3d3bb2623c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
