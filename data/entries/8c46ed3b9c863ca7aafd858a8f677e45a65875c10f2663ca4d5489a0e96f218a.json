{"title":"Latest Insights into the In Vivo Studies Regarding the Role of TRP Channels in Wound Healing&mdash;A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1189/v1","date":1715954844000,"content":"Wound healing involves physical, chemical and immunological processes. Transient receptor potential (TRP) and other ion channels are implicated in epidermal re-epithelization. Ion movement across ion channels can induce transmembrane potential that leads to transepithelial potential (TEP) changes. TEP present in epidermis surrounding the lesion decreases and induces an endogenous direct current generating an epithelial electric field (EF) that could be implicated in wound re-epithelialization. TRP channels are involved in the activation of immune cells during the inflammatory phase of wound healing. The aim of the study was to review the mechanisms of ion channel involvement in wound healing in in vivo experiments in rodents (mice, rats, rabbits) and how can this process be influenced. This review used the latest results published in scientific journals over the last year and this year to date (1 January 2023â€“31 December 3000) in order to include the in-press articles. Some types of TRP channels, such as TRPV1, TRPV3, and TRPA1, are expressed in immune cells and can be activated by inflammatory mediators. The most beneficial effects in wound healing are produced using agonists of TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPA1 channels or by inhibiting with antagonists, antisense oligonucleotides or knocking down TRPV3 and TRPM8 channels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c46ed3b9c863ca7aafd858a8f677e45a65875c10f2663ca4d5489a0e96f218a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
