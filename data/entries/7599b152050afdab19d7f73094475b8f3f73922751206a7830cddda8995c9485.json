{"title":"31 Effects of dietary standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine (Lys) levels and dietary SID tryptophan to Lys ratios on growth performance and behavior of late-nursery to finish maternal barrows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/72/7664812?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to determine the effects of dietary standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine (Lys) levels and SID tryptophan (Trp) to Lys ratios on growth performance and behavior of late-nursery to finish maternal barrows. A total of 2,293 barrows (PIC Camborough, initially 11.9 Â± 0.35 kg) were used in this trial with 96 mixed-sex pens and 23 to 25 pigs/pen. There was a total of 6 dietary phases: P1:11.9-29.5 kg; P2:29.5-49.6 kg; P3:49.6-62.6 kg; P4:62.6-80.3 kg; P5:80.3-103.3 kg; and P6:103.3-137.8 kg. Pens were blocked by body weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 treatments:T1: 100% Lys (dietary SID Lys levels meet PIC SID Lys recommendation) and 21.0% of SID Trp:Lys ratio; T2: 100% Lys and 18.5% of SID Trp:Lys ratio; T3: 100% Lys and 16.0% of SID Trp:Lys ratio; T4: 80% Lys (dietary SID Lys levels meet 80% of PIC SID Lys recommendation) and 21.0% of SID Trp:Lys ratio; T5: 80% Lys and 18.5% of SID Trp:Lys ratio; and T6: 80% Lys and 16.0% of SID Trp:Lys ratio for P1-P2 and then 100% Lys and 18.5% of SID Trp:Lys ratio for P3-P6. Ear lesion (EL) was monitored during P2-P5. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model in R Studio (Version 3.5.2, R Core Team; Vienna, Austria). Pigs fed T1 and T2 showed improved average daily gain than T6 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with other treatments intermediate (Table 1). Pigs fed T2 showed improved average daily feed intake as compared with T6 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with other treatments intermediate. There was no evidence for significant difference on feed-to-gain ratio or mortality. Removal was significantly greater for pigs fed T6 compared with all other treatments (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Pigs fed T2 had significantly greater hot carcass weight than T4, with other treatments intermediate. There was no evidence for significant differences on carcass yield or lean percentage. Pig fed T6 had significantly greater incidence of EL in P2 than all other treatments (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Pigs fed T4 and T6 had greater incidence of EL in P3 than T1 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with other treatments intermediate. Pigs fed T5 and T6 had significantly greater incidence of EL in P4 than T1, T2, and T3 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with T4 intermediate. During P5, pigs fed T4 and T5 had the greatest incidence of EL (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), while pigs fed T6 had significant greater incidence of EL than T3 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with T1 and T2 intermediate. In conclusion, dietary SID Lys and SID Trp:Lys ratio less than PIC recommendation during late-nursery-to-grower phase resulted in compromised overall growth performance of maternal barrows, even with restored dietary SID Lys and SID Trp:Lys levels in finish phase. Dietary SID Lys level and/or SID Trp:Lys ratios lower than PIC recommendation may result in greater incidence of aggression behavior in maternal barrows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7599b152050afdab19d7f73094475b8f3f73922751206a7830cddda8995c9485","category":"Environment"}
