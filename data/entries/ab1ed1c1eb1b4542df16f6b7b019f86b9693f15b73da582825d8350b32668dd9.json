{"title":"QKD Security Through Three-Dimensional Angular Momentum Representation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1313/v1","date":1713511048000,"content":"This paper proposes an enhanced Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol by incorporating a Three-Dimensional Angular Momentum Representation (3D AMR) to address vulnerabilities inherent in traditional two-dimensional polarization states-based systems. The 3D AMR method expands the state space, potentially increasing security against sophisticated quantum attacks. We present a theoretical and computational framework that transitions from the conventional two-dimensional polarization to a three-dimensional angular momentum space, which inherently increases the complexity and security of the quantum states used in QKD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab1ed1c1eb1b4542df16f6b7b019f86b9693f15b73da582825d8350b32668dd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
