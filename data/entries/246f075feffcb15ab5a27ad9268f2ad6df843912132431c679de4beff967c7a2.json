{"title":"Alternative splicing of a potato disease resistance gene maintains homeostasis between growth and immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3729/7701255?rss=1","date":1719532800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants possess a robust and sophisticated innate immune system against pathogens and must balance growth with rapid pathogen detection and defense. The intracellular receptors with nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) motifs recognize pathogen-derived effector proteins and thereby trigger the immune response. The expression of genes encoding NLR receptors is precisely controlled in multifaceted ways. The alternative splicing (AS) of introns in response to infection is recurrently observed but poorly understood. Here we report that the potato (<span>Solanum tuberosum</span>) NLR gene <span>RB</span> undergoes AS of its intron, resulting in 2 transcriptional isoforms, which coordinately regulate plant immunity and growth homeostasis. During normal growth, <span>RB</span> predominantly exists as an intron-retained isoform <span>RB_IR</span>, encoding a truncated protein containing only the N-terminus of the NLR. Upon late blight infection, the pathogen induces intron splicing of <span>RB</span>, increasing the abundance of <span>RB_CDS</span>, which encodes a full-length and active R protein. By deploying the <span>RB</span> splicing isoforms fused with a <span>luciferase</span> reporter system, we identified IPI-O1 (also known as Avrblb1), the RB cognate effector, as a facilitator of <span>RB</span> AS. IPI-O1 directly interacts with potato splicing factor StCWC15, resulting in altered localization of StCWC15 from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. Mutations in IPI-O1 that eliminate StCWC15 binding also disrupt StCWC15 re-localization and <span>RB</span> intron splicing. Thus, our study reveals that StCWC15 serves as a surveillance facilitator that senses the pathogen-secreted effector and regulates the trade-off between <span>RB</span>-mediated plant immunity and growth, expanding our understanding of molecular plantâ€“microbe interactions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"246f075feffcb15ab5a27ad9268f2ad6df843912132431c679de4beff967c7a2","category":"Environment"}
