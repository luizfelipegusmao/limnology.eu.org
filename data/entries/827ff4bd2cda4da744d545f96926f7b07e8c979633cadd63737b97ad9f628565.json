{"title":"Redefining Priorities: Framework for Identifying and Mapping Critical Human Problems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2220/v1","date":1725004376000,"content":"This paper addresses the historically biased selection of problems in technoscience, which has been predominantly shaped by Western male perspectives. We propose a novel framework with objective criteria for identifying and prioritizing human problems worthy of scientific and technological attention. Our approach aims to transcend traditional biases, incorporating a more inclusive, global perspective. We outline metrics considering factors such as scale, urgency, potential impact, and relevance across diverse populations. Using these criteria, we identify key global challenges including climate change, pandemic preparedness, food and water security, education access, sustainable energy transition, AI governance, biodiversity conservation, and mental health. We present a network analysis of their interconnections, revealing complex interdependencies and potential cascading effects of interventions. Our mathematical framework, based on graph theory and network analysis, provides a rigorous foundation for understanding and quantifying these relationships. This research contributes to decolonizing and degendering technoscience, offering a more equitable framework for addressing pressing human problems \\cite{roy2018}. Our findings have significant implications for research prioritization, policy-making, and resource allocation in scientific and technological endeavors, potentially reshaping how we approach and address the most critical issues facing humanity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"827ff4bd2cda4da744d545f96926f7b07e8c979633cadd63737b97ad9f628565","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
