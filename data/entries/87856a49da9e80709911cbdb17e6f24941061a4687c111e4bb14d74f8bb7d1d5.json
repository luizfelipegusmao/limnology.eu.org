{"title":"Increasing marine trophic web knowledge through DNA analyses of fish stomach content: a step towards an ecosystem‐based approach to fisheries research","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15754?af=R","date":1715327055000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Multispecies and ecosystem models, which are key for the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, require extensive data on the trophic interactions between marine organisms, including changes over time. DNA metabarcoding, by allowing the simultaneous taxonomic identification of the community present in hundreds of samples, could be used for speeding up large-scale stomach content data collection. Yet, for DNA metabarcoding to be routinely implemented, technical challenges should be addressed, such as the potentially complicated sampling logistics, the detection of a high proportion of predator DNA, and the inability to provide reliable abundance estimations. Here, we present a DNA metabarcoding assay developed to examine the diet of five commercially important fish, which can be feasibly incorporated into routinary samplings. The method is devised to speed up the analysis process by avoiding the stomach dissection and content extraction steps, while preventing the amplification of predator DNA by using blocking primers. Tested in mock samples and in real stomach samples, the method has proven effective and shows great effectiveness discerning diet variations due to predator ecology or prey availability. Additionally, by applying our protocol to mackerel stomachs previously analyzed by visual inspection, we showcase how DNA metabarcoding could complement visually based data by detecting overlooked prey by the visual approach. We finally discuss how DNA metabarcoding-based data can contribute to trophic data collection. Our work reinforces the potential of DNA metabarcoding for the study and monitoring of fish trophic interactions and provides a basis for its incorporation into routine monitoring programs, which will be critical for the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.</p>","author":"Oriol Canals, \nAnders Lanzén, \nIñaki Mendibil, \nEneko Bachiller, \nXavier Corrales, \nEider Andonegi, \nUnai Cotano, \nNaiara Rodríguez‐Ezpeleta","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"87856a49da9e80709911cbdb17e6f24941061a4687c111e4bb14d74f8bb7d1d5","category":"Environment"}
