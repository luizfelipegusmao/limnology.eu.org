{"title":"Association between the intake/type of cheese and cognitive function in community-dwelling older women in Japan: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1472/v1","date":1721284797000,"content":"While many studies have described the association between cognitive decline and eating habits, little attention has been paid to its association with cheese intake. In this cross-sectional study of 1,035 community-dwelling women aged ≥ 65, we investigated the association between intake/type of cheese and cognitive function. The anthropometry, functional ability, and the frequency of food intake, including cheese, were assessed. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and a score of 20–26 was defined as mild cognitive decline (MCD). We found that MMSE score was significantly different between the presence of cheese intake (cheese intake: 28.3±1.9; non-cheese intake: 27.8±2.2) and between the type of cheese consumed (Camembert cheese: 28.7±1.3; others: 28.3±1.9). After adjusting for confounders, multiple logistic regression revealed four significant independent variables for MCD: Camembert cheese intake (odds ratio [OR] = 0.448, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.214–0.936), age (OR = 1.114, 95% CI = 1.059–1.171), usual walking speed (OR = 0.2620, 95% CI = 0.109–0.621), and repetitive saliva swallowing test scores (OR = 0.865, 95% CI = 0.750–0.995). Our results, while based on cross-sectional data from Japanese community-dwelling older women, demonstrated that Camembert cheese intake is significantly associated with MCD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7b063731408b8e68eab825de698a829c546c27f5d29b30aa321e16b97b191e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
