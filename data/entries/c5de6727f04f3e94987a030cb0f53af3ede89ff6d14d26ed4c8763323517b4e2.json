{"title":"Multisensory perceptual and causal inference is largely preserved in medicated post-acute individuals with schizophrenia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002790","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Tim Rohe, Klaus Hesse, Ann-Christine Ehlis, Uta Noppeney</p>\r\n\r\nHallucinations and perceptual abnormalities in psychosis are thought to arise from imbalanced integration of prior information and sensory inputs. We combined psychophysics, Bayesian modeling, and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate potential changes in perceptual and causal inference in response to audiovisual flash-beep sequences in medicated individuals with schizophrenia who exhibited limited psychotic symptoms. Seventeen participants with schizophrenia and 23 healthy controls reported either the number of flashes or the number of beeps of audiovisual sequences that varied in their audiovisual numeric disparity across trials. Both groups balanced sensory integration and segregation in line with Bayesian causal inference rather than resorting to simpler heuristics. Both also showed comparable weighting of prior information regarding the signalsâ€™ causal structure, although the schizophrenia group slightly overweighted prior information about the number of flashes or beeps. At the neural level, both groups computed Bayesian causal inference through dynamic encoding of independent estimates of the flash and beep counts, followed by estimates that flexibly combine audiovisual inputs. Our results demonstrate that the core neurocomputational mechanisms for audiovisual perceptual and causal inference in number estimation tasks are largely preserved in our limited sample of medicated post-acute individuals with schizophrenia. Future research should explore whether these findings generalize to unmedicated patients with acute psychotic symptoms.","author":"Tim Rohe","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"c5de6727f04f3e94987a030cb0f53af3ede89ff6d14d26ed4c8763323517b4e2","category":"Environment"}
