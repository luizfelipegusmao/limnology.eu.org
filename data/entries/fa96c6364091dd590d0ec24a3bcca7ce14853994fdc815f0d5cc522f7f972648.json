Hindiyeh</p>\r\n\r\nOn the 11<sup>th</sup> of March 2020, the world faced a new global pandemic, COVID-19 which is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus, it had multiple devastating outcomes on multiple sectors along with significant rates of mortality. These challenges encouraged the development of multiple testing methods, as well as anti-viral medications such as Molnupiravir, as well as evaluating the efficacy of available medications against it, like; Azithromycin, Ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. Vaccination against COVID-19 forged into a significant challenge, few months ensuing the first case of SARS-CoV-2, which was diagnosed in December 2019, in Wuhan-China, thus, multiple vaccines were approved for use around the world to combat this pandemic. Our study includes a sample of 556 oncology patients at Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem, all patients were tested using Panbio rapid antigen test and Allplex PCR Assay. The main objective was to study the sensitivity and specificity of Rapid antigen test, which contributes to a faster isolation call and management of infected patients, thus decreasing the risk on spread to other patients and health care. Patients were categorized based on two factors: Ct range and age group and studying their possible effect on false-negative results. Patients with Ct value less than 20, had the highest detection rate which is consistent with other studies in the literature. The sensitivity and specificity of Panbio Rapid Antigen testing were of 69.9% and 100%, respectively. A correlation between age group and false negative results could not be made, but a correlation between Ct value and false negative result was noticed, Ct value was directly related to false negative results. P-value of 0.007 indicated that results were statistically significant where PCR test is considered more sensitive compared to rapid antigen test.","author":"Ali Sabateen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fa96c6364091dd590d0ec24a3bcca7ce14853994fdc815f0d5cc522f7f972648","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
