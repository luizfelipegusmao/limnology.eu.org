{"title":"A Neuroprotective Peptide Modulates Retinal cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein (CREB), Synapsin I (SYN1), and Growth-Associated Protein 43 (GAP43) in Rats with Silicone Oil-Induced Ocular Hypertension.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0888/v1","date":1728645839000,"content":"This study evaluated the neuroprotective potential of peptain-1 conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP-P1) in an ocular hypertension model of glaucoma. Brown Norway (BN) rats were subjected to intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation via intracameral injection of silicone oil (SO), with concurrent intravitreal injections of either CPP-P1 or a vehicle. Retinal cross-sections were analyzed for markers of neuroprotection, including cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein (CREB), phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB), growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43), synapsin-1 (SYN1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess retinal layer thickness. SO-treated rats exhibited significant reductions in the thickness of the inner nuclear layer (INL, 41%, p=0.016), inner plexiform layer (IPL, 52%, p=0.0002), and ganglion cell layer (GCL, 57%, p=0.001). CPP-P1 treatment mitigated these reductions, preserving INL thickness by 32% (p=0.059), IPL by 19% (p=0.119), and GCL by 31% (p=0.057). Increased levels of CREB and p-CREB were observed in IOP-elevated, CPP-P1-treated retinas compared to IOP-elevated vehicle-treated retinas. Although overall GAP43 levels were low, there was a modest increase in expression within the IPL and GCL in SO- and CPP-P1-treated retinas (p=0.15 and p=0.09, respectively) compared to SO- and vehicle-treated retinas. SO injection reduced SYN1 expression in both IPL and GCL (p=0.01), whereas CPP-P1 treatment significantly increased SYN1 levels in the IPL (p=0.03) and GCL (p=0.002). While SOD2 expression in the GCL was minimal across all groups, a trend toward increased expression was observed in CPP-P1-treated animals (p=0.16). The SO model was replicated with SO removal after 7 days and monitored for 21 days followed by retinal flat-mount preparation to assess retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival. A 42% loss in RGCs (p=0.009) was observed in SO-injected eyes, which was reduced by approximately 37% (p=0.03) with CPP-P1 treatment. These findings suggest that CPP-P1 is a promising neuroprotective agent that promotes retinal ganglion cell survival and the preservation of other retinal neurons, potentially through enhanced CREB signaling in a rat model of SO-induced ocular hypertension.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abd50f7b35434241caa7e49d3aa5ece97a212545f17d5a07aa7787addde2ff71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
