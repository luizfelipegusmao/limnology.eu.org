In this study, we investigated the radon-induced DNA strand breaks, a critical event in lung carcinogenesis, and the corresponding DNA damage response (DDR) in mice and human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. Methods: Biomarkers of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), DNA repair response to DSBs, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, autophagy, and a cell apoptosis signaling pathway as well as cell-cycle arrest and the rate of apoptosis were determined in mouse lung and BEAS-2B cells after radon exposure. Results: Repeated radon exposure induced DSBs indicated by the increasing expressions of Î³-Histone 2AX (H2AX) protein and <span>H2AX</span> gene in a time and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, a panel of ATM-dependent repair cascades [i.e. non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), cell-cycle arrest and the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)/Bax apoptosis signaling pathway] as well as the autophagy process were activated. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine pre-treatment partially reversed the expression of NHEJ-related genes induced by radon exposure in BEAS-2B cells. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated that long-term exposure to radon gas induced DNA lesions in the form of DSBs and a series of ATM-dependent DDR pathways. Activation of the ATM-mediated autophagy may provide a protective and pro-survival effect on radon-induced DSBs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"7cfc8aa89f081a70e786115469a46aec6bd2a725628f463582906c6cf7cff91e","category":"Environment"}
