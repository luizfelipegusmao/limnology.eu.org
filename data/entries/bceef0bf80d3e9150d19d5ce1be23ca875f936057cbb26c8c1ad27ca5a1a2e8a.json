{"title":"A cascade training protocol for schoolteachers on oral health: Investigating the influence of primary and secondary mentors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309671","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Sarah Paul, Neha Chauhan, Ritu Duggal, Bharati Purohit, Harsh Priya</p>\r\nBackground <p>Oral health holds paramount importance for overall well-being, particularly among school-aged children, where inadequate oral health can cause significant discomfort and impede educational performance. Despite its critical nature, oral health awareness and practices within Indian school communities remain suboptimal. There exists an urgent necessity for efficacious educational initiatives to bridge this gap and foster oral health awareness among both schoolteachers and students.</p> Protocol <p>This monitored training introduces a pioneering cascade model training initiative aimed at evaluating its impact on enhancing oral health knowledge among schoolteachers and students in Indian schools. A total of 100 school teachers from 50 Centre government schools will undergo training in two distinct sessions. Following this, two teachers from each school will be selected to further train 24 class monitors from grades 6–9, who will subsequently impart knowledge to approximately 40 students per class. This phase of the training will be ongoing, ensuring training consistency through online supervision and active participation of the expert team in training activities with newly designated master trainers. Pre- and post-training assessments will be conducted at each level to gauge the monitored training’s effectiveness. The entire training is projected to conclude within a year.</p> Discussion <p>This cascade model monitored training initiative represents a novel approach in promoting oral health awareness in Indian schools, marking a pioneering endeavor in this domain. Through this program, we aim to empower 1200 class monitors as master trainers and reach approximately 24,000 school students across 480 supervised training sessions. The establishment of master trainers through a cascade process, coupled with the engagement of the CDER expert team, ensures accurate dissemination of information at every stage. The comprehensive evaluation facilitated by pre- and post-training assessments at each level further enhances the program’s effectiveness, laying a solid foundation for future oral health initiatives within school communities.</p>","author":"Sarah Paul","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bceef0bf80d3e9150d19d5ce1be23ca875f936057cbb26c8c1ad27ca5a1a2e8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
