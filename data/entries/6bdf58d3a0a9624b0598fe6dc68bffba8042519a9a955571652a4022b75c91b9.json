{"title":"Thermoforming Non-Developable Surfaces: Challenges in the Parametric Fabrication of Solid Surfaces, the Case of Krion K-Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0567/v1","date":1728386805000,"content":"This research arises from the need to rethink children’s play spaces found in the city through new manufacturing methods of Solid Surface materials such as Krion K-Life 1100 from the Porcelanosa Group, which allow the creation of complex ergonomic shapes. The method consisted of an iterative digital fabrication process, in which a series of molds were developed and adjusted to thermoform the Krion, adapting the design in each iteration according to the results obtained. Parametric digital modeling techniques and in-detph curvature analysis were used to optimize the geometry to meet the technical limitations of the material and the thermoforming process. The results showed that, through precise adjustments in the curvature and thickness of the surface, it is possible to thermoform Krion without defects such as folds or wrinkles, obtaining a complex modular and ergonomic surface suitable for children’s play. In conclusions, Krion is a viable material for the generation of complex double-curved geometries, thus opening up a range of possibilities from the creation of new children’s spaces to parametric facades optimized according to their location.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bdf58d3a0a9624b0598fe6dc68bffba8042519a9a955571652a4022b75c91b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
