{"title":"Prioritization of Critical Success Factors in Industrial Waste Management by Experts and Employees","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0508/v1","date":1720161575000,"content":"Today, with the increase in population, technological developments, industrialization and urbanization, the problems related to waste management (WM) have become increasingly important to sustainably global clean environment. The gradual change in the quality of the elements that make up the environment, increasing environmental problems, and gaining global quality have caused societies to focus more on environmental problems. Waste management is a form of management that includes the prevention, non-prevention, reuse, recovery, and disposal of domestic, medical, hazardous, and non-hazardous wastes. In this study, it is aimed to prioritize critical success factors with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in industrial waste management and to determine the most important critical success factor. The four main criteria and 23 sub-criteria were scored by the AHP method by five expert environmental engineers. Accordingly, after critical success factors were determined, survey questions were prepared to make employees rank these factors. While \"national/local waste management strategies and policies\" factor was the most important critical success factor according to experts, the most important critical success factor for employees was \"enterprise waste management strategies and policies\". In addition, differences in the priorities of CSFs were found in the opinions of employees in different sectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"139d96e35bd35d5ea23a1653f540ca1334624e1af1e5930650125dc5e8589e3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
