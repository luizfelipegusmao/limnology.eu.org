{"title":"Role of Glial Cells in Depression and Drug Addiction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0173/v1","date":1714715207000,"content":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorder (SUD) are of immense medical and social concerns. Although significant progress on neuronal involvement in mood and reward circuitries has been achieved, only relatively recently the role of glia in these disorders have attracted attention. Detail understanding of the glial function in these devastating diseases could offer novel interventions. Here, following a brief review of circuitries involved in mood regulation and reward perception, specific contribution of the neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation and gut microbiota to these diseases are highlighted. In this context, the role of specific glial cells (e.g., microglia, astroglia, oligodendrocytes and synantocytes) on phenotypic manifestation of MDD or SUD are emphasized. In addition, potential use of this knowledge in developing novel therapeutics is touched upon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdc99f8b80e011fb05012674811eec04cae9505d11b8a737f04d5034b14cbc0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
