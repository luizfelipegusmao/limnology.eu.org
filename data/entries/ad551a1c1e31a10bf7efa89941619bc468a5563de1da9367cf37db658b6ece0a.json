Peng</p>\r\n\r\n53BP1 is a well-established DNA damage repair factor that has recently emerged to critically regulate gene expression for tumor suppression and neural development. However, its precise function and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we showed that phosphorylation of 53BP1 at serine 25 by ATM is required for neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in cortical brain organoids. Dynamic phosphorylation of 53BP1-serine 25 controls 53BP1 target genes governing neuronal differentiation and function, cellular response to stress, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, ATM and RNF168 govern 53BP1â€™s binding to gene loci to directly affect gene regulation, especially at genes for neuronal differentiation and maturation. 53BP1 serine 25 phosphorylation effectively impedes its binding to bivalent or H3K27me3-occupied promoters, especially at genes regulating H3K4 methylation, neuronal functions, and cell proliferation. Beyond 53BP1, ATM-dependent phosphorylation displays wide-ranging effects, regulating factors in neuronal differentiation, cytoskeleton, p53 regulation, as well as key signaling pathways such as ATM, BDNF, and WNT during cortical organoid differentiation. Together, our data suggest that the interplay between 53BP1 and ATM orchestrates essential genetic programs for cell morphogenesis, tissue organization, and developmental pathways crucial for human cortical development.","author":"Bitna Lim","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"ad551a1c1e31a10bf7efa89941619bc468a5563de1da9367cf37db658b6ece0a","category":"Environment"}
