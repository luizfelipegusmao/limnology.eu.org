{"title":"Exploring the impact of the environment on physical activity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (EPCOT)—A comparative analysis between suggested and free walking: Protocol study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306045","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Larissa Guimarães Paiva, Túlio Medina Dutra de Oliveira, Nara Batista de Souza, Klaus Chaves Alberto, Daniela Pereira Almeida, Cristino Carneiro Oliveira, Anderson José, Carla Malaguti</p>\r\nBackground <p>Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhibit reduced levels of physical activity, which are associated with poorer outcomes. The number of clinical trials aiming to promote behavioral changes to increase physical activity in this population has grown; therefore, these trials have yet to produce satisfactory results. An ecological model encompassing individual, social, environmental, and political factors represent a potentially more effective approach to promoting physical activity. While favorable urban environments can positively impact physical activity, specifically tailored environmental interventions for individuals with COPD could enhance their engagement in physical activity. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was to analyze the effects of walking in a suggested environment and free walking on physical activity levels in individuals with COPD.</p> Methods <p>The environment on physical activity for chronic obstructive disease (EPCOT) is a randomized controlled clinical trial protocol approved by our institution’s Ethics Committee and registered with The Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) (https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br, number RBR-4tfwdhp). This protocol will involve 38 volunteers diagnosed with COPD recruited from the pulmonary physiotherapy and rehabilitation service. The volunteers were randomly divided into two walking groups: an experimental group (ERG) with guidance for walking in a suggested environment and an active control group (ACG) instructed to choose their own routes. The intervention consisted of eight consecutive weeks, with progressive walks carried out 3 to 5 times weekly. The primary outcome will be assessing participants’ physical activity levels. Secondary outcomes will include exercise capacity, quality of life, dyspnea levels, motivation, anxiety, depression, and perceptions of the environment. All assessments will occur before and after the intervention period, aiming to fill a literature gap by investigating the impact of urban environments on COPD-related physical activity. The results may shed light on the importance of environmental factors in promoting physical activity among individuals with COPD, helping to develop more effective interventions.</p>","author":"Larissa Guimarães Paiva","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5e058a6333e3a4087a45cce71e8209b5caa77828562dec275dc35c92ec8ffea1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
