{"title":"Investigation on Cement Stabilized Base with Recycled Aggregate and Desert Sand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1295/v1","date":1711090382000,"content":"This paper mainly explores the feasibility of using desert sand (DS) and recycled aggregate in cement stabilized base. Recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) and DS serve as the substitutes of natural coarse and fine aggregates, respectively, in cement stabilized base. A four-factor and four-level orthogonal test is designed to analyze the unconfined compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and compressive resilient modulus. Furthermore, this paper investigates the effects of cement content, fly ash (FA) replacement rate, RCA replacement rate, and DS replacement rate on the road performance of cement stabilized base composing of RCA and DS. The test results reveal that the performance of cement stabilized base with partial RCA instead of natural coarse aggregate (NCA) and partial DS instead of natural fine aggregate satisfy the road use. Meanwhile, DS is beneficial to improve the strength of cement stabilized base. The correlation and microscopic analyses of the test results imply the feasibility of applying DS and recycled aggregate to cement stabilized base. It is hoped that this paper can offer a solid theoretical foundation for promoting the application of DS and recycled aggregate in road engineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f8109b97523f30f133a0fee18a8b34ac96249b13b460956df31465f3c8393ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
