{"title":"Magnesium Ion: A New Switch in Tumor Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0230/v1","date":1714967117000,"content":"The magnesium ion is an essential cation in the human body and participates in numerous physiological activities. A deficiency in magnesium ions is closely associated with tumor development, and supplementation with magnesium ions has been shown to partially inhibit tumor growth. However, the specific mechanisms by which magnesium ions suppress tumor proliferation remain unclear. Currently, studies have revealed that mitochondria may serve as a crucial intermediate link in the regulation of tumors by magnesium ions. Mitochondria might intervene in the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells by modulating energy metabolism and oxidative stress levels. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive review of the relationship between magnesium ions and tumors, the mechanisms by which magnesium ions regulate mitochondrial function, and the theoretical basis and prospects of magnesium ion regulation of mitochondrial function for tumor treatment. This review aims to offer insights for clinical tumor treatment strategies involving magnesium ion intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6dc48c5201bb5e326900ed434d6ed4d2bec331e81b04614d8fe2de6ec4f237f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
