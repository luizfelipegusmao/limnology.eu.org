{"title":"387 Impacts of rumen protected omega-6 fatty acid supplementation on cow reproduction and calf growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/290/7757334?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is crucial for proper fetal development. Rumen protected omega-6 (ω-6) fatty acids (FA) may improve health and reproductive success in beef cattle. Previous research studied the effects of supplementing ω-6 on cow production either during late gestation or post-breeding but not during both stages. Our objective was to determine the effects of ω-6 supplementation during late gestation and post-breeding on cow reproduction and calf pre-weaning growth. Eighty cows were assigned to either a saturated FA control (C) or rumen protected ω-6 supplements for 40 d before parturition (PRE) and/or 35 d after artificial insemination (AI, POST) using a 2 × 2 factorial: PRE C-POST C(n = 19); PRE C-POST ω-6(n = 19); PRE ω-6-POST ω-6(n = 17); PRE ω-6-POST C(n = 18). Cows were fed ad libitum hay and water when on/off supplementation periods. Supplements were provided in low moisture tubs. Individual animal intake of supplement was measured by a GrowSafe system. Cow body weights and plasma FA concentrations were measured prior to and after supplementation during each period. Calves were weighed at birth, branding, 150 d old and weaning. Reproductive measurements included postpartum estrus activity, estrus response at fixed-time AI (FTAI), and pregnancy rates. Blood plasma for progesterone analysis was collected on d 7 post-AI on all cows. Corpus luteum (CL) area was measured on d 7 via transrectal ultrasonography on a subset of cows during the POST period (PRE ω-6-POST ω-6 n = 8; PRE C-POST C n = 8; PRE C-POST ω-6 n = 8; PRE ω-6-POST C n = 8). The relationship between supplement intake and plasma FA concentration was analyzed via linear regression, and all other variables were analyzed via ANOVA. Supplement intakes within treatments and between the PRE and POST supplemental periods were highly variable. Body weights remained similar for cows (<span>P</span> = 0.52), but POST ω-6 calves had larger weaning weights than POST C calves (<span>P</span> = 0.02). There was a positive linear relationship (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) between supplement intake and plasma FA for PRE ω-6 and POST ω-6. Positive linear relationships between intake and plasma ω-6 FA concentration were observed for PRE C (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.11, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), PRE ω-6 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.007) and POST ω-6 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.31, <span>P</span> = 0.0005). Post-partum estrus activity was similar (<span>P</span> = 0.81) between PRE C and PRE ω-6 cows, and estrus response at FTAI was similar (<span>P</span> = 0.13) between POST C and POST ω-6 cows. POST ω-6 cows had larger CL areas than POST C cows (<span>P</span> = 0.03); however, blood progesterone concentrations at d 7 did not differ between treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.65). There was no difference in conception to FTAI between POST C and POST ω-6 (<span>P</span> = 0.08). These results indicate that free choice ω-6 FA supplementation during late gestation and post-AI result in large variation in intake between cows that influence plasma concentrations, but did not markedly alter reproductive measures in mature beef cows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"18b7e92ef9d6acd8c7e73cc1824da05564b9f05559d3d41581c3f6c739c97295","category":"Environment"}
