{"title":"An extended PDE‐based statistical spatio‐temporal model that suppresses the Gibbs phenomenon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2831?af=R","date":1698388162000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Partial differential equation (PDE)-based spatio-temporal models are available in the literature for modeling spatio-temporal processes governed by advection-diffusion equations. The main idea is to approximate the process by a truncated Fourier series and model the temporal evolution of the spectral coefficients by a stochastic process whose parametric structure is determined by the governing PDE. However, because many spatio-temporal processes are nonperiodic with boundary discontinuities, the truncation of Fourier series leads to the well-known Gibbs phenomenon (GP) in the output generated by the existing PDE-based approaches. This article shows that the existing PDE-based approach can be extended to suppress GP. The proposed approach starts with a data flipping procedure for the process respectively along the horizontal and vertical directions, as if we were unfolding a piece of paper folded twice along the two directions. For the flipped process, this article extends the existing PDE-based spatio-temporal model by obtaining the new temporal dynamics of the spectral coefficients. Because the flipped process is spatially periodic and has a complete waveform without boundary discontinuities, GP is removed even if the Fourier series is truncated. Numerical investigations show that the extended approach improves the modeling and prediction accuracy.
