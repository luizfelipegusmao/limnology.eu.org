{"title":"Cell wall invertase 3 plays critical roles in providing sugars during pollination and fertilization in cucumber","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1293/7617586?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In plants, pollenâ€“pistil interactions during pollination and fertilization mediate pollen hydration and germination, pollen tube growth, and seed set and development. Cell wall invertases (CWINs) help provide the carbohydrates for pollen development; however, their roles in pollination and fertilization have not been well established. In cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span>), <span>CsCWIN3</span> showed the highest expression in flowers, and we further examined CsCWIN3 for functions during pollination to seed set. Both <span>CsCWIN3</span> transcript and CsCWIN3 protein exhibited similar expression patterns in the sepals, petals, stamen filaments, anther tapetum, and pollen of male flowers, as well as in the stigma, style, transmitting tract, and ovule funiculus of female flowers. Notably, repression of <span>CsCWIN3</span> in cucumber did not affect the formation of parthenocarpic fruit but resulted in an arrested growth of stigma integuments in female flowers and a partially delayed dehiscence of anthers with decreased pollen viability in male flowers. Consequently, the pollen tube grew poorly in the gynoecia after pollination. In addition, <span>CsCWIN3</span>-RNA interference plants also showed affected seed development. Considering that sugar transporters could function in cucumber fecundity, we highlight the role of CsCWIN3 and a potential close collaboration between CWIN and sugar transporters in these processes. Overall, we used molecular and physiological analyses to determine the CsCWIN3-mediated metabolism during pollen formation, pollen tube growth, and plant fecundity. CsCWIN3 has essential roles from pollination and fertilization to seed set but not parthenocarpic fruit development in cucumber.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"66182becc5606850f9eeb7cf0c410f72a2087fb2251094030be2d08f466f947d","category":"Environment"}
