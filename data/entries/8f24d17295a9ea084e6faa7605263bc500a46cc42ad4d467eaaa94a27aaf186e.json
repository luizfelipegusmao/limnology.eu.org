By identifying the optimal operating conditions such as pH, temperature, transmembrane pressure, and volume reduction factor, the study aims to maximize pollutant removal while minimizing membrane fouling, thus promoting environmental sustainability. The methodology employs a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors to reduce pollutants at various hydraulic retention times, with performance evaluated by measuring reductions in pollutants such as COD, BOD, total solids (TS), total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, and alkalinity. Results indicate significant pollutant reduction, demonstrating the efficacy of the optimized UF membranes.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study explored using ultrafiltration (UF) membranes to treat pulp and paper mill wastewater, implementing a novel Taguchi experimental design to optimize operating conditions for pollutant removal and minimal membrane fouling. Researchers examined four factors: pH, temperature, transmembrane pressure, and volume reduction factor (VRF), each at three levels. Optimal conditions (pH 10, 25°C, 6 bar, VRF 3) led to a 35% reduction in flux due to fouling and high pollutant rejections: total hardness (83%), sulfate (97%), spectral absorption coefficient (SAC254) (95%), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (89%). Conductivity had a lower rejection rate of 50%. Advanced imaging techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed reduced membrane fouling under these conditions. The Taguchi method effectively identified optimal conditions, significantly improving wastewater treatment efficiency and promoting environmental sustainability in the pulp and paper industry.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThis study optimized UF membrane conditions for pulp and paper mill wastewater, reducing fouling and enhancing pollutant removal, offering practical strategies for industrial treatment.\nAFM and SEM provided key insights into membrane fouling and mitigation, promoting real-time diagnosis and optimization for enhanced treatment efficiency.\nPrioritizing anaerobic fixed-bed systems in wastewater treatment is beneficial for achieving high COD removal efficiency. Optimizing hydraulic retention time (HRT) in these systems can further improve their overall effectiveness and sustainability.\n</p>","author":"Apourv Pant, \nAnuj Kumar Dwivedi, \nSurajit Murasingh, \nDeepak Singh, \nMuskan Mayank, \nChandra Shekhar Prasad Ojha","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"8f24d17295a9ea084e6faa7605263bc500a46cc42ad4d467eaaa94a27aaf186e","category":"Environment"}
