{"title":"The Impact of Digital Marketing on Brand Awareness in the Multinational FMCG Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0550/v1","date":1720505966000,"content":"This study examines the influence of digital marketing on brand awareness within the multinational Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, focusing on how various digital strategies contribute to overall marketing effectiveness. Utilizing a sample of 277 respondents, the research employs descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses to explore the relationships between digital marketing strategies, brand awareness outcomes, and perceived digital marketing effectiveness. The findings reveal that digital marketing strategies significantly enhance brand awareness and overall marketing effectiveness, underscoring the pivotal role of activities such as social media engagement, content marketing, and search engine optimization. Specifically, the regression analysis shows that digital marketing strategies have a positive and statistically significant impact on overall effectiveness, indicating that companies investing in these areas are better positioned to achieve higher levels of brand recognition and marketing success. However, the study also uncovers a complex relationship between brand awareness outcomes and overall effectiveness, where increased brand awareness does not directly correlate with enhanced digital marketing effectiveness. This suggests that while brand awareness is critical, its influence on marketing success is nuanced and may involve diminishing returns or additional mediating factors. The regression model explains a modest portion of the variance in marketing effectiveness, highlighting the need for a holistic evaluation approach that incorporates a broader set of performance metrics and contextual factors. The high reliability of the measures used affirms the robustness of the findings, which emphasize the importance of a strategic and integrated approach to digital marketing in the FMCG sector. Companies must continuously adapt and optimize their digital marketing strategies to align with dynamic market conditions and achieve sustainable success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e38f96003c10de6cce7c9d9ad5e86df90cf17c33d7fe157fe7d03af4c2cf925","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
