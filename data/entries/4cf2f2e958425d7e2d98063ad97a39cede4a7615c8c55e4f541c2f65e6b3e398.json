{"title":"Retinal Microcirculation Measurements in Response to Endurance Exercises Analysed by Adaptive Optics Retinal Camera","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1509/v1","date":1711450033000,"content":"Aim: To investigate the effects of intensive physical exercise on retinal microvascular regulation in healthy volunteers by the adaptive optics retinal camera measurement. \nMethods: We included healthy volunteers (11 men and 14 women) aged 20.6± 0.9. Heart rate (HR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were recorded before and after a submaximal physical exertion of continuously riding a training ergometer. The superior temporal retinal artery measurements were captured using the adaptive optics (AO) camera rtx1TM (Imagine Eyes, Orsay, France) without pupil dilatation. We compared measures of vessel diameter (VD), lumen diameter (LD), two walls (Wall 1, 2), wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR), and wall cross-sectional analysis (WCSA) before and immediately after the cessation of exercise.\nResults: Cardiovascular parameters: After exercise, SBP, DBP and HR changed significantly from 130.2±13.2 to 159.7±15.6 mm Hg, 81.2±6.3 to 77.1±8.2 mm Hg and 80.8±16.1 to 175.0±6.2 bpm, respectively (p &lt; 0.002). \nRetinal microcirculation analysis: Before the exercise, the mean LD was 96.0±6.8, VD 118.5±8.3, WLR 0.234±0.02, WCSA 3802.8±577.6. The mean LD and Wall 1 did not change significantly after exercise but slightly decreased. The VD, Wall 2, WLR and WCSA decreased significantly (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4cf2f2e958425d7e2d98063ad97a39cede4a7615c8c55e4f541c2f65e6b3e398","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
