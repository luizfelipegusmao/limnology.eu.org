{"title":"The Use of Diss Fibers to Enhance Lime Plaster Durability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0930/v1","date":1720769369000,"content":"The use of natural fibres is investigated in recent years in cement, lime or geopolymer mortars to increase their toughness, resistance, tensile strength and durability. These fibres, derived from sources such as jute, hemp, sisal, and flax, are added to the mortar mix to enhance its mechanical properties and reduce cracking. The choice of the natural source strongly depends on local availability of the plant, its use and harvesting. In this paper the fibres of Diss (Ampelodesmos Mauritanicus, Poir) were used as reinforcement for mortars prepared by using waste materials, such as waste glass powder and air hardening lime obtained by the kilning of marble slurry. The samples underwent artificial and natural ageing and were characterized by measuring apparent density, water sorption coefficient, compression and bending stress, indicating a positive role of fibres addiction in increasing mortars durability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4424a378ae67960c5a5a54f92a0f2ef1af3262f6b5c2ece000cb5094bded443","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
