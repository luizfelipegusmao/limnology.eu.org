{"title":"Transversal STEM Education for Improving Science learning in Secondary Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1522/v1","date":1718962530000,"content":"The text examines the assessment of learning in science and the use of technologies like Scratch to enhance this process. Assessment is crucial for measuring progress and guiding teaching, especially in science where it fosters scientific skills and understanding. The study focuses on third-year secondary education students, evaluating the impact of Scratch on their learning compared to a gamification approach. Scratch, developed by MIT, is effective in interactive teaching and improves academic performance and student motivation. The research used an experimental design with a control group (gamification) and an experimental group (Scratch), measuring acquired knowledge through pretests and posttests. Results show that both groups significantly improved their knowledge, although the control group had a higher baseline initially. Students valued collaboration and playful learning. However, they faced technical challenges and highlighted the importance of teamwork. The study concludes that Scratch has great educational potential, suggesting improvements such as redesigning activities and increasing work sessions to maximize its effectiveness in learning and student motivation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37dc71a57db75587150a5432049b43a33cd882721794f10712b52a83cb74f6d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
