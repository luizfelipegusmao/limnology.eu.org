The foundation of our methodology lies in the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (<i>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodology)</i>, 2014, 66, 497–546), and it naturally extends the work of Winter and Tawn (<i>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics)</i>, 2016, 65, 345–365; <i>Extremes</i>, 2017, 20, 393–415) and Tendijck et al. (<i>Environmetrics</i> 2019, 30, e2541) to include multivariate random variables. We use cross-validation-type techniques to develop a model order selection procedure, and we test our models on two-dimensional meteorological-oceanographic data with directional covariates for a location in the northern North Sea. We conclude that the newly-developed models perform better than the widely used historical matching methodology for these data.</p>","author":"Stan Tendijck, \nPhilip Jonathan, \nDavid Randell, \nJonathan Tawn","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmetrics: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4718a208dff669d8713b9a4772fb9e30bd4e6b10bc59ba738841df9ffc8f1e42","entryHash":"0ee54b8a3b1a4b7a37f914c33d90e6af85fd9f064c2b538566b6d8d59abab205","category":"Environment"}
