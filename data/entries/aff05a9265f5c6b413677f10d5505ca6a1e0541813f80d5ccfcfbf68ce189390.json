{"title":"Avian and Mammalian Diversity and Abundance in Jhalana Reserve Forest, Jaipur, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1561/v1","date":1721376542000,"content":"We utilized camera traps to assess animal diversity, relative abundance, and anthropogenic activities in the Jhalana Reserve Forest (JRF), located amidst Jaipur, with a population of 3.9 million people. Between November 2017 and November 2019, camera traps were strategically deployed in both the tourist zone and peripheral areas, capturing 16,328 photos. This study represents the first comprehensive baseline assessment of animal diversity in JRF, documenting a total of 39 species, including 18 bird species, 14 mammals, and six domestic species, alongside human activity. Among the 14 mammal species, seven were carnivores. Notably, we identified 25 individual Indian leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) during 2017-2018, comprising 8 males and 17 females, highlighting the leopard as the apex predator in JRF. Concurrently, domestic animals accompanied by humans were observed within JRF. However, rigorous conservation efforts and patrols by the Rajasthan Forest Department resulted in a notable decline in human intrusion, reducing from 28.0% in 2017-18 to 3.9% in 2018-2019, with domestic animal activity reaching zero in the latter period.\nConsequently, the relative abundance of wildlife species increased during the study period of 2018-2019, underscoring the positive impact of conservation strategies implemented by authorities. Our findings affirm that camera traps effectively establish baseline data, assess animal diversity, and evaluate relative abundance in reserve forests situated within human-dominated landscapes. This study provides critical insights to inform the development and implementation of conservation strategies in similar protected areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aff05a9265f5c6b413677f10d5505ca6a1e0541813f80d5ccfcfbf68ce189390","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
