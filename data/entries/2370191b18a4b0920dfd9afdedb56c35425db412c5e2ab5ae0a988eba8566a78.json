{"title":"Performance and protein conformation of thermally treated silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and scallop (Argopecten irradians) blended gels","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13608?af=R","date":1717209540000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The quality of surimi-based products can be improved by combining the flesh of different aquatic organisms. The present study investigated the effects of incorporating diverse ratios of unwashed silver carp (H) and scallop (A) and using various thermal treatments on the moisture, texture, microstructure, and conformation of the blended gels and myofibrillar protein of surimi.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A mixture ratio of A:H = 1:3 yielded the highest gel strength, which was 60.4% higher than that of scallop gel. The cooking losses of high-pressure heating and water-bath microwaving were significantly higher than those of other methods (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the two-step water bath and water-bath microwaving samples exhibited a more regular spatial network structure compared to other samples. The mixed samples exhibited a microstructure with a uniform and ordered spatial network, allowing more free water to be trapped by the internal structure, resulting in more favorable gel properties. The thermal treatments comprehensively modified the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins in unwashed mixed gel promoted protein unfurling, provided more hydrophobic interactions, enhanced protein aggregation and improved the gel performance.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The findings of the present study improve our understanding of the interactions between proteins from different sources. We propose a new method for modifying surimi's gel properties, facilitating the development of mixed surimi products, as well as enhancing the efficient utilization of aquatic resources. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xinru Fan, \nWenhao Geng, \nMeng Li, \nZixuan Wu, \nYing Li, \nShuang Yu, \nGuanhua Zhao, \nQiancheng Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2370191b18a4b0920dfd9afdedb56c35425db412c5e2ab5ae0a988eba8566a78","category":"Environment"}
