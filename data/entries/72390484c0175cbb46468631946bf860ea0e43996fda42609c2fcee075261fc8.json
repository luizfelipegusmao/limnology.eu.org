{"title":"Chronic Pediatric Headache as a Manifestation of Shunt Over-Drainage and Slit Ventricle Syndrome in patients harboring a Cerebrospinal Fluid Diversion System: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0440/v1","date":1712311879000,"content":"The ultimate goal of our review is to draw clinicianâ€™s attention, especially of those who are managing pediatric patients with permanent, long-standing, ventriculoperitoneal or, less commonly, ventriculo-atrial shunts. This specific subgroup of patients may eventually suffer from severe, intractable headaches which may negatively impair their quality of daily living. In the absence of any other clinical condition that could be attributed as the cause of the headache, shunt overdrainage should not be overlooked but, on the contrary, should be seriously taken into consideration in the therapeutic armamentarium of such cases, that are difficult to be handled.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72390484c0175cbb46468631946bf860ea0e43996fda42609c2fcee075261fc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
