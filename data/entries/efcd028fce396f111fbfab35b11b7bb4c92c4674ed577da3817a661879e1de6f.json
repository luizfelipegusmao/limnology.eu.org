{"title":"A Color-Detectable Vitamin C Controlled-Release System Fabricated Using Electrospinning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0475/v1","date":1712480295000,"content":"This study develops a vitamin C controlled-release system trackable via color changes as a function of vitamin C release. The system is composed of coaxial microfibers prepared via coaxial electrospinning, with a core of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) incorporating vitamin C, and a shell composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) containing polydiacetylene (PDA) as the color-changing material. The shell thickness was controlled by adjusting the amount of PCL ejected during electrospinning, allowing the regulation of the release rate of vitamin C. When vitamin C added to PEO penetrated the PCL layer, the color of PDA changed from blue to red, indicating a color change. The results of this study can be applied to devices that require immediate detection of vitamin C release levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"efcd028fce396f111fbfab35b11b7bb4c92c4674ed577da3817a661879e1de6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
