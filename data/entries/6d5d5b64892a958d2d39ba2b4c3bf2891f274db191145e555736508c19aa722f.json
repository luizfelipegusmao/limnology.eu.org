Each year an estimated 13,140 people are diagnosed in just the United States alone, and of those patients, roughly 10,000 people will die from the disease [<a href=\"#ozae044.201-B1\">1</a>]. The mean survival time of GBM patients lies between 12-18 months, and the five-year survival rate is only 6.8% [<a href=\"#ozae044.201-B1\">1</a>]. The main treatment options for these malignant tumors remain aggressive surgical resections and radiation treatments with chemotherapy [<a href=\"#ozae044.201-B2\">2</a>]. Yet even with these treatments, GBM has a very high treatment resistance and the patient survival and mortality rates have remained unchanged for the past 30 years [<a href=\"#ozae044.201-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6d5d5b64892a958d2d39ba2b4c3bf2891f274db191145e555736508c19aa722f","category":"Environment"}
