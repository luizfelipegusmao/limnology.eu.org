{"title":"Exploring the effects of two-segment loop tunnels on termite food transport efficiency: a simulation study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae076/7716309?rss=1","date":1721260800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study explores the food transport efficiency (<span>E</span>) in a termite tunnel consisting of a main tunnel and a 2-segment loop tunnel through a model simulation. Simulated termites navigate between the main and loop tunnels through branching nodes (<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span>, <span>d</span>) with associated probabilities (<span>P</span><sub>1</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>2</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>3</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>4</sub>). The loop tunnel locations (<span>δ</span>) are considered: near the nest (<span>δ</span> = 1), at the center of the main tunnel (<span>δ</span> = 2), and close to the food site (<span>δ</span> = 3). The results reveal that for <span>δ</span> = 1, paths such as <span>a</span> → <span>d</span> → <span>b</span> → <span>c</span> and <span>c</span> → <span>d</span> → <span>b</span> → <span>a</span> exhibited high <span>E</span> values. Conversely, for <span>δ</span> = 2, <span>P</span><sub>3</sub> and <span>P</span><sub>4</sub> demonstrate elevated <span>E</span> values ranging from 0.4 to 0.6. For <span>δ</span> = 3, paths like <span>c</span> → <span>d</span> or <span>c</span> → <span>b</span> display high <span>E</span> values, emphasizing the significance of in-loop separation tunnels (characterized by <span>P</span><sub>3</sub> and <span>P</span><sub>4</sub>) in alleviating traffic congestion. Partial rank correlation validates that <span>P</span><sub>1</sub> and <span>P</span><sub>2</sub> minimally influence <span>E</span>, while <span>P</span><sub>3</sub> and <span>P</span><sub>4</sub> significantly negatively impact <span>E</span>, regardless of <span>δ</span>. However, for <span>δ</span> = 2, the influence of <span>P</span><sub>3</sub> and <span>P</span><sub>4</sub> is notably reduced due to the positional symmetry of the loop tunnel. In the discussion, we address model limitations and propose strategies to overcome them. Additionally, we outline potential experimental validations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics governing termite food transport within tunnels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"0f8ef751e1dcee00a3a4efbb9041b92b2aa27163232ded601da6d17121b243b4","category":"Environment"}
