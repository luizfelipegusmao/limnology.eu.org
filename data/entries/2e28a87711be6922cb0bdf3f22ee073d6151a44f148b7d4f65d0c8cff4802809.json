The objective of this research was to characterize the inter-animal variation in biological processes of growing cattle selected to be divergent in RFI. Holstein heifers [n = 55; body weight (BW) = 351 ± 64 kg) with low- (n = 29) or high- (n = 26) genomically enhanced RFI (RFIg) were selected from a contemporary group of 453 heifers. Heifers were assigned to 1 of 2 pens, equipped with electronic feed bunks and a GreenFeed gaseous-exchange measurement system. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and feeding behavior data were collected for 84-d. Body weight was measured weekly, and spot fecal samples collected at weighing. Phenotypic RFI (RFIp) was calculated as the residual from regression of DMI on ADG and mid-test BW<sup>0.75</sup>. On d 70 of the study a rumen fluid sample was collected via esophageal tubing. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for complete blood count (CBC). A mixed model including the fixed effect of RFIg classification and random effect of pen was used to evaluate the effect of RFIg classification on response variables. There were no differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) in BW and ADG for heifers with divergent RFIg; however, low RFIg heifers consumed 7.5% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) feed per day. Consequently, low RFIg heifers exhibited a more favorable (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) RFIp (-0.188 vs 0.211 kg/d, respectively). Low RFIg heifers exhibited more favorable feeding behavior, with 8.7% fewer (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) bunk visit events per day and an 11.2% slower (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) eating rate. Low RFIg heifers had 12.5% greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) total rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations than high RFIg heifers, indicating potentially enhanced microbial fermentation and improved efficiency of feed utilization. Low RFIg heifers had 8.2% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) methane emissions (g/d), 6.3% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) carbon dioxide production (g/d), and 6.1% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) heat production (Mcal/d) calculated according to Brouwer (1965) than high RFIg heifers. Dry matter digestibility did not differ (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) between heifers with divergent RFIg. Overall, heifers selected to be more feed efficient exhibited more favorable energy efficiencies and feed efficiency phenotypes. To quantify the variation in RFIg explained by feeding behavior, gas flux, digestibility and rumen fermentation, and CBC partial least squares regression models were developed. Feeding behavior accounted for the largest proportion of variation in RFIg (28.8%). Upon sequential addition of gas flux, digestibility and rumen fermentation, and CBC to feeding behavior, 56.3% of the variation in RFIg was accounted for. Identifying the magnitude at which metabolic processes influence inter-animal variation in efficiency of nutrient utilization provides opportunities to discover valuable candidate biomarkers for selection of more feed efficient cattle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2e28a87711be6922cb0bdf3f22ee073d6151a44f148b7d4f65d0c8cff4802809","category":"Environment"}
