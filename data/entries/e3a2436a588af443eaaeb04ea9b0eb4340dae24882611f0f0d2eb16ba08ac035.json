Experiment 1 asked whether naïve C57BL/6 (B6) mice could identify 1 M glucose, fructose, or sucrose solutions based on odor cues, during a 30-min 2-bottle acceptability test. We tested mice both before and after they were rendered anosmic with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment. We used 2 indirect measures of odor-mediated response: number of trials initiated and latency to initiate licking. Before ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment, the mice learned how to identify 1 M glucose and fructose (but not sucrose) solutions based on odor cues. ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment eliminated their ability to identify the glucose and fructose solutions. Experiment 2 asked whether 2 d of exposure to a 1 M glucose, fructose, or sucrose solution improved the identification of the same sugar solution. Following exposure, the B6 mice identified all 3 sugar solutions based on odor cues. Experiment 3 asked whether T1R3 knockout mice (i.e. mice lacking the T1R3 subunit of the T1R2 + R3 sweet taste receptor) could learn to discriminate 0.44 M glucose and fructose solutions based on odor cues. All mice were subjected to a 1-h preference test, both before and after exposure to the 0.44 M glucose and fructose solutions. During exposure, the experimental mice received ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment, whereas the control mice received saline treatment. Before exposure, neither type of mouse preferred the glucose solution. After exposure, the control mice preferred the glucose solution, whereas the experimental mice did not. Our results reveal that mice can learn to use odor cues to identify and discriminate between sugar solutions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"e3a2436a588af443eaaeb04ea9b0eb4340dae24882611f0f0d2eb16ba08ac035","category":"Environment"}
