{"title":"Using Citizen Science and Field Survey to Document the Introduction, Establishment, and Rapid Spread of the Bare-eyed Pigeon, Patagioenas corensis, on the Island of Saint-Martin, West Indies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1049/v1","date":1720821744000,"content":"Early reporting of the introduction and establishment of exotic species is of paramount importance for successful management. Here we report the introduction and rapid spread of the Bare-eyed Pigeon, Patagioenas corensis, on the binational island of Saint-Martin, West Indies. This range-restricted species naturally occurs in the arid coastal areas of Columbia and Venezuela and nearby islands. Its introduction on Saint-Martin represents an expansion of about 1000 km beyond its established native range. Using observations recorded in e-bird and results from a recent field survey, we show that since its introduction, most probably between late 2012 and early 2013, the species is expanding fast in Saint-Martin and has recently broadened its habitat to include anthropized, built areas. The expansion of Bare-eyed Pigeon on Saint-Martin and the neighbouring Leeward Islands, possibly facilitated by climate change in the future, could be a threat to both native columbid species and other bird species, through competition for resources. We therefore recommend to local authorities and stakeholders to rapidly eradicate the species or at least prevent its further spread on Saint-Martin, possibly though listing it as a game species, while it is still possible to do so.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12325ec77b05c8f4f62436e42ef09df6b28eb4eca0e2067c4e50a414d84380af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
