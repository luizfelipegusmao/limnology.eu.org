{"title":"The RALF signaling pathway regulates cell wall integrity during pollen tube growth in maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1673/7492839?rss=1","date":1703289600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Autocrine signaling pathways regulated by RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTORs (RALFs) control cell wall integrity during pollen tube germination and growth in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). To investigate the role of pollen-specific RALFs in another plant species, we combined gene expression data with phylogenetic and biochemical studies to identify candidate orthologs in maize (<span>Zea mays</span>). We show that Clade IB <span>ZmRALF2/3</span> mutations, but not Clade III <span>ZmRALF1/5</span> mutations, cause cell wall instability in the sub-apical region of the growing pollen tube. ZmRALF2/3 are mainly located in the cell wall and are partially able to complement the pollen germination defect of their Arabidopsis orthologs AtRALF4/19. Mutations in <span>ZmRALF2/3</span> compromise pectin distribution patterns leading to altered cell wall organization and thickness culminating in pollen tube burst. Clade IB, but not Clade III ZmRALFs, strongly interact as ligands with the pollen-specific <span>Catharanthus roseus</span> RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) receptor kinases <span>Z. mays</span> FERONIA-like (ZmFERL) 4/7/9, <span>LORELEI</span>-like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor (<span>LLG</span>) proteins <span>Z. mays</span> LLG 1 and 2 (ZmLLG1/2), and <span>Z. mays</span> pollen extension-like (PEX) cell wall proteins ZmPEX2/4. Notably, ZmFERL4 outcompetes ZmLLG2 and ZmPEX2 outcompetes ZmFERL4 for ZmRALF2 binding. Based on these data, we suggest that Clade IB RALFs act in a dual role as cell wall components and extracellular sensors to regulate cell wall integrity and thickness during pollen tube growth in maize and probably other plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a090ec2cc8851950e8243a3f421dadc77b61dc5b9ed47b6b4444962380dd8ae7","category":"Environment"}
