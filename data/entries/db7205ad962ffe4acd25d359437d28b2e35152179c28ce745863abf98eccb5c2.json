The false ingestion of MPs causes harmful effects on organisms, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. The present review comprehended the current knowledge of MP contamination in Crustacea and Mollusca from 75 peer-reviewed articles published in Asia between 2015 and 2023. A total of 79 species (27 Crustacea and 52 Mollusca) have been recorded to be contaminated with MPs. Out of the total 27 species of Crustacea, <i>Metopograpsus quadridentatus</i> (327.56 MPs/individual) and <i>Balanus albicostatus</i> (0.42 MPs/individual) showed the highest and lowest contamination, respectively. Out of the total 52 species of Mollusca, <i>Dolabella auricularia</i> (2325 MPs/individual) and <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> and <i>Mytilus edulis</i> (0.2 MPs/individual) showed the highest and lowest contamination, respectively. In terms of country-wise MP contamination, China has the highest number of contaminated species in both phylums among Asia. Findings of pollution indices revealed a very high risk of MP contamination in all the countries. Fiber was reported predominantly in both groups. Blue and black-colored MPs having &lt;500 μm and &lt;500 μm–1 mm size were found dominantly in Crustacea and Mollusca, respectively. Polypropylene was recorded as the dominant plastic polymer in both Crustacea and Mollusca. In essence, this review has provided a comprehensive insight into MP concentration in Crustacea and Mollusca of Asia, highlighting variations among species and geographic locations. This understanding is crucial for tackling urgent environmental challenges, safeguarding human health, and promoting global sustainability initiatives amid the escalating issue of plastic pollution.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nMicroplastic pollution has created havoc on biodiversity and food safety.\nA total of 27 and 52 species of crustaceans and Mollusca have been recorded to be contaminated with MPs.\n<i>Metopograpsus quadridentate</i> and <i>Dolabella auricularia</i> have shown higher MPs contamination.\nPolypropylene was recorded as the dominant plastic polymer in both crustacean and Mollusca.\nFindings of pollution indices revealed a very high risk of MP contamination in all the countries.\n</p>","author":"Mahima Doshi, \nVasantkumar Rabari, \nAshish Patel, \nVirendra Kumar Yadav, \nDipak Kumar Sahoo, \nJigneshkumar Trivedi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"db7205ad962ffe4acd25d359437d28b2e35152179c28ce745863abf98eccb5c2","category":"Environment"}
