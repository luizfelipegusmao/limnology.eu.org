{"title":"Development of Multifunctional Tandem Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation to Higher Alcohols","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1763/v1","date":1714127852000,"content":"The direct hydrogenation of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) to higher alcohols (C2+OH), as an important research area in C1 chemistry, is one of the most essential approaches to convert CO2 into liquid fuels or other value-added chemicals. The high atom economy and direct pathway make this reaction attractive to convert CO2 to higher alcohols. However, due to the complicated reaction network and the difficulty of C-C coupling, the formation of higher alcohols is more difficult compared with methanol or other compounds containing one carbon. The key issue is development of novel catalysts with high conversion and space time yield. But this is still a huge challenge faced by researchers. In this review, the thermodynamics and reaction pathways of CO2 hydrogenation were firstly clarified. Subsequently, after reviewing single metal-based, bi-and multi-metallic catalysts, the recently progress of tandem catalytic system was emphasized. Finally, we also provided an overview about tandem catalysis for CO2 hydrogenation to higher alcohols.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a28fcd125e4b3981e22a390fdc11cbb04dac6b8ac755b011680abbe8c39e2802","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
