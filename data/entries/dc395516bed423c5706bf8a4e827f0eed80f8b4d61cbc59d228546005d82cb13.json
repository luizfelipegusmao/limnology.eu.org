{"title":"Lichen Amyloidosis in an Atopic Patient Treated with Dupilumab: A New Therapeutic Option","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1623/v1","date":1711522443000,"content":"Lichen Amyloidosis (LA) is a type of cutaneous amyloidosis characterized by brownish hyperkeratotic and itchy papules on the lower leg, back, forearm or thigh. It is associated with itching and Atopic Dermatitis (AD) according to an etiopathogenetic mechanism that has not yet been fully elucidated. Currently, available therapies for this condition include oral antihistamines, laser, cyclosporine, topical corticosteroids and phototherapy, but in light of the overlap with AD, Dupilumab may also be indicated. We report the case of a female, 52 years old, suffering from AD and LA for about 27 years. She had lesions attributable to both diseases on the trunk and lower limbs associated with severe itching and had proved resistant to cyclosporine therapy. It was decided to opt for Dupilumab with induction of 2 fl of 300 mg and maintenance with 1 fl every other week. The therapy proved effective, returning a total resolution of both diseases one year after the beginning of the treatment. Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in LA related to AD and led to clinical and quality of life improvement in this patient. Therefore, Dupilumab should be considered when treating LA. Further studies should be conducted focusing on the efficacy of the drug on LA (whether or not related to AD), changes in skin lesions after discontinuation, and the safety of long-term application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc395516bed423c5706bf8a4e827f0eed80f8b4d61cbc59d228546005d82cb13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
