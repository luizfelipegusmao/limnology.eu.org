{"title":"Dietary oxyclozanide influences antioxidant enzyme activities and damages DNA in Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/789/7731060?rss=1","date":1723161600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Oxyclozanide (OXY) is an anthelmintic widely used in the treatment of flatworm infection and fasciolosis. It also has antiadenovirus, antibiofilm, antifungal, and antibacterial activities. Various chemicals have been suggested as alternative chemicals in insect pest management. Here, the oxidative and genotoxic effects of OXY on 7th instars, pupae and adults of the model organism <span>Galleria mellonella</span> (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were examined. First-instar larvae were reared on 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, and 1.5 g OXY per 100 g artificial diets. Compared with all tested OXY concentrations and controls without OXY, dietary OXY led to increased antioxidant capacity and genotoxic effects. Concentrations of malondialdehyde, an oxidative stress marker, were significantly increased in adults of larvae reared on OXY-charged diets at 0.3 and 1.5 g/100 g compared to the adult control group. We also recorded a significant increase in the genotoxic test data (Tail length, Tail DNA %, Tail moment) at the same stages and concentrations. We recorded significant increases in glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activities in larvae fed high OXY concentrations. SOD and catalase activities were also significantly increased at the concentration of 0.03 g/100 g of OXY in the pupal and adult stages. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity was significantly increased at the highest concentration of OXY in the larval and pupal stages. Also, our regression analysis indicates a correlation between the markers of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes and comet parameters. These data indicate that OXY induces oxidative stress and antioxidative enzyme response.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"74eb45813cc9f18b82499e13d31ee51e3654927ea9cb6243d35f79e54963f0ce","category":"Environment"}
