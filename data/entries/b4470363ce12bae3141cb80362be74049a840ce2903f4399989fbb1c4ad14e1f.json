Therefore, it is necessary to adopt some modification methods to improve its performance and expand its application range.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>To improve these shortcomings of PS, the effect of yeast <i>β</i>-glucan (YG) at different concentrations (0%, 1%, 2% and 3%, w/v) on the gelatinization, structure and <i>in vitro</i> digestive properties of PS were investigated. The interaction of YG with PS was different because of different molecular weights. The addition of YG reduced the peak viscosity and increased the final viscosity of PS. YG made the texture of PS gel softer, and the effect of low molecular weight YG was more obvious. YG enhanced the thermal stability of PS. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that YG and PS interacted through hydrogen bonds. In addition, YG reduced the digestibility of PS <i>in vitro</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Collectively, the addition of <i>β</i>-glucan to PS can serve as a new approach to enhance the technological properties of PS in food applications. These results will provide theoretical basis for PS to develop into functional food. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lin Zhang, \nLin Dong, \nHua Zhang, \nYan He, \nXia Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b4470363ce12bae3141cb80362be74049a840ce2903f4399989fbb1c4ad14e1f","category":"Environment"}
