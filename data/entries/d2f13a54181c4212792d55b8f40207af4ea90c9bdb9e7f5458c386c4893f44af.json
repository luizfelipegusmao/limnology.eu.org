A particularly fascinating outcome of hybrid speciation is the formation of asexual hybrid species. The Amazon molly (<i>Poecilia formosa</i>) is such a hybrid and originated from a <i>P. mexicana</i> mother and a <i>P. latipinna</i> father. Consequently, a heterospecific mating must have occurred leading to the Amazon molly, indicating a breakdown of any potential prezygotic isolation between parental species. Here we studied the female mate preferences of extant <i>P. mexicana</i> and <i>P. latipinna</i> from several populations using standard binary choice tests with males of both sexual species that were matched for size. <i>Poecilia mexicana</i> and <i>P. latipinna</i> can be crossed in the lab, however, the offspring are not asexual, but sexual F<sub>1</sub>s. In our study, we generated F<sub>1</sub>s and tested their mating preferences with sexual males of both <i>P. mexicana</i> and <i>P. latipinna</i> against F<sub>1</sub> males. Overall, our results show that in extant <i>P. mexicana</i> and <i>P. latipinna</i> no female preference for conspecific males was detectable. Consequently, heterospecific matings are possible and not hindered by any apparent behavioral prezygotic isolation. If female preferences in these species were comparable around the time the Amazon molly originated as a hybrid species ca. 100,000 years ago, matings leading to hybrids would be very likely. F<sub>1</sub> females also have no discernable mating preferences for either sexual males or F<sub>1</sub> males. Such lack of prezygotic behavioral isolation could potentially lead to F<sub>2</sub> individuals, backcrosses, and introgression.</p>","author":"Caden Smith, \nWaldir Miron Berbel‐Filho, \nMontrai Spikes, \nFrederic Fyon, \nFrancisco Úbeda, \nIngo Schlupp","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"d2f13a54181c4212792d55b8f40207af4ea90c9bdb9e7f5458c386c4893f44af","category":"Environment"}
