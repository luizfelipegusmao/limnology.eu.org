{"title":"Impact of Polyonchobothrium magnum on health and gut microbial ecology of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus): Insights from morphological, molecular, and microbiological analyses","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14013?af=R","date":1725616739000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Parasites pose significant challenges to aquaculture and fisheries industries. Our study focuses on the <i>Polyonchobothrium magnum</i> and African catfish to address a potential health issue in aquaculture, explore host–parasite interactions that can help develop effective management practices to ensure fish health and industry sustainability. <i>P. magnum</i> was isolated from the stomach of African catfish (<i>Clarias gariepinus</i>) as the primary site of infection, with a prevalence of 10%. Most affected fish were heavily infected (8 out of 10). Infection was confirmed by sequencing the PCR-targeted region of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (<i>ND1</i>) gene, along with light and scanning electron microscopes. The parasite had an elongated scolex with deep bothria, a prominent apical disc wider than the scolex itself, and a four-lobed appearance. The scolex contained a central rostellum divided into two semicircles, bearing 26–30 hooks, with an average of 28. The apical disc had large hooks arranged in four quadrants, with 6–8 hooks each, averaging 7 per quadrant. No neck was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of our sequence showed a 100% match with isolates from Guangzhou, China. In infected fish, the anterior kidney showed increased expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B and lysozyme, but decreased levels of in major histocompatibility complex antigen II. Plasma analysis revealed a significant drop in superoxide dismutase, a rise in interleukin-1 beta, and lower IgM levels compared to non-infected controls. Non-infected fish displayed greater gut microbiota diversity, with dominant families including Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, and Caulobacteraceae, and prevalent genera such as <i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Cetobacterium</i>, and <i>Brevundimonas</i>. In contrast, infected fish exhibited very low diversity, with significantly higher proportions of Enterobacteriaceae (45.99%) and Aeromonadaceae (41.79%) compared to non-infected fish, which had 13.76% and 3.64% respectively. <i>Cetobacterium somerae</i> was prevalent in non-infected fish, while infected fish harboured <i>Aeromonas fluvialis</i>, <i>Plesiomonas shigelloides</i>, and <i>Gallaecimonas xiamenensis</i>. Overall, <i>P. magnum</i> disrupted the immune status and gut microbiota of the host, thereby impacting its health.</p>","author":"Alamira Marzouk Fouad, \nHaitham G. Abo‐Al‐Ela, \nEman A.
