{"title":"An Advanced Software Tool for Precision Laser Beam Propagation Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0371/v1","date":1725449600000,"content":"This paper presents an advanced software tool for precise laser beam propagation analysis, focusing on the calculation of the M2 value, a key measure of beam quality. Developed in Python, the software integrates libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy for robust data handling and accurate polynomial fitting. It features a user-friendly interface for easy data input, analysis, and visualization, making it accessible to both professionals and novices. The tool has been rigorously validated against theoretical models (M2=1) and experimental data (showing M2=1.2548 and 1.3166), ensuring high accuracy and reliability. It visualizes beam width data and fitted polynomial curves, aiding in assessing beam propagation characteristics and optimizing laser systems. Future enhancements include additional beam quality metrics, machine learning integration, and cloud-based functionality. This tool significantly advances laser beam analysis, benefiting research and industrial applications by improving performance and efficiency.
