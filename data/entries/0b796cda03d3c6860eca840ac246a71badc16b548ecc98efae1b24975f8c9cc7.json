{"title":"Supply Chain Waste Management Model: A Moderating Variable Between Sustainable Macro Ergonomics Process and Waste Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0443/v2","date":1728387958000,"content":"The implementation of waste management strategies informed by supply chain management methodologies may present a viable solution for the effective handling of waste, as exemplified by the waste management challenges observed in Indonesia. The waste management characteristics exhibited by each nation are inherently diverse, as they are influenced by various factors including supply chain management frameworks, the methodologies and technologies employed in waste processing, the cultural practices and behaviours of the populace regarding waste disposal, as well as the unique geographic conditions pertinent to each country. This study seeks to formulate a waste management supply chain framework that incorporates moderating factors influencing the relationship between sustainable macro ergonomic processes and waste management practices. The research methodology employed was purposive convenience sampling, encompassing a total of 224 participants engaged in waste management within the Semarang region of Central Java, Indonesia. The empirical results indicate that H2—TT exerts a statistically significant influence on RPPS (0.02 &amp;lt; 0.05), H3—TP demonstrates a significant impact on RPPS (0.001 &amp;lt; 0.005), H4—MGE displays a significant effect on RPPS (0.00 &amp;lt; 0.05), H5—seasonal floods (BM) reveal a significant effect on RPPS (0.001 &amp;gt; 0.05), and H6—cultural society (CC) manifests no significant impact on RPPS (0.755 &amp;gt; 0.05). The innovative aspect of this study lies in the finding that cultural society has not exerted an influence on waste management, whereas other macro ergonomic factors have shown a significant effect on this domain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b796cda03d3c6860eca840ac246a71badc16b548ecc98efae1b24975f8c9cc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
