{"title":"Photodynamic Therapy, Past, Current and Future","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1799/v1","date":1716882360000,"content":"Greek roots: \"phos\" (φῶς) - means \"light\" and \"dynamis\" (δύναμις) - means \"force\" or \"power\". Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an innovative treatment method based on the ability of photosensitizers to produce reactive oxygen species after exposure to light of a specific wavelength range, either in the visible or near infrared range. This process results in damage to pathological cells, such as cancer cells, while minimizing the impact on healthy tissues. PDT is a promising direction in the treatment of many diseases, with particular emphasis on the fight against cancer and other diseases asso-ciated with excessive cell growth. The power of light contributed to the creation of phototherapy, whose history dates back to ancient times. It was then noticed that some substances exposed to the sun have a negative effect on the body, while others have a therapeutic effect. \nThis work provides a detailed review of photodynamic therapy, from its origins to the present day. It is surprising how a seemingly simple beam of light can have such a powerful healing effect, which is used not only in dermatology, but also in oncology, surgery, microbiology, virology, and even dentistry. However, despite promising re-sults, photodynamic therapy still faces many challenges. The availability of this thera-py is limited due to the small number of centers offering this type of treatment and the high costs, which may be unaffordable for many patients. Moreover, photodynamic therapy requires further research and improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bac72e1468c2f322fb3756e63ed972c565b138315fa6ffab85fc35719430182","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
