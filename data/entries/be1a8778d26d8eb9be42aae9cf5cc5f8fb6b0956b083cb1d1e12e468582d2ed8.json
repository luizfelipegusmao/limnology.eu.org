{"title":"Fatigue and Ultimate Strength Evaluation of GFRP-Reinforced, Laterally-Restrained, Full-Depth Precast Deck Panels with Developed UHPFRC-Filled Transverse Closure Strips","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2169/v1","date":1724928528000,"content":"Full depth precast deck panel (FDDP) is one element of the prefabricated bridge element and systems (PBES) that allows for quick un-shored assembly of the bridge deck on-site as part of the accelerated bridge construction (ABC) technology. This paper investigates the structural response of full-depth precast deck panels (FDDPs) constructed with new construction materials and connection details. FDDP is cast with normal strength concrete (NSC) and reinforced with high modulus (HM) glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) ribbed bars. The panel-to-girder V-shape connections use the shear pockets to accommodate the clustering of the shear connectors. A novel transverse connection between panels has been developed, featuring three distinct female-to-female joint configurations, each with 175-mm projected GFRP bars extending from the FDDP into the closure strip, complemented by a female vertical shear key and filled with cementitious materials.  The ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) was selectively used to joint-fill the 200-mm transverse joint between adjacent precast panels and the shear pockets connecting the panels to the supporting girders to ensure full shear interaction. Two actual-size FDDP specimens for each type of the three developed joints were erected to perform fatigue tests under the footprint of the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) truck wheel loading. The FDDP had a 200-mm thickness, 2500-mm width, and 2400-mm length in traffic direction; the rest was over braced steel twin girders. Two types of fatigue tests were performed; incremental variable amplitude fatigue (VAF) loading and constant amplitude fatigue (CAF) loading, followed by monotonically loading the slab ultimate-to-collapse. It was observed that fatigue test results showed that the ultimate capacity of the slab under VAF loading or after 4 million cycles of CAF exceeds the factored design wheel load specified into the CHBDC. Also, punching shear failure mode was dominant in all the tested FDDP specimens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be1a8778d26d8eb9be42aae9cf5cc5f8fb6b0956b083cb1d1e12e468582d2ed8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
