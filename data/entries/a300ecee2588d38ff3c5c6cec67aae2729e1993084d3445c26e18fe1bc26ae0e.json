With the high 2\ncreep resistance, High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) and Low Cycle Fatigue (Single crystal nickel-based 3\nsuperalloys are extensively used in turbine blade applications due to their superior creep resistance 4\ncompared to polycrystalline counterparts. As a result, fatigue becomes the primary failure mechanism 5\nin such applications. Specifically, High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) and Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) are of 6\nsignificant concern under these conditions. This study investigates the fatigue life prediction of 7\nCMSX-4 using a combined crystal plasticity and lifetime assessment model. The constitutive crystal 8\nplasticity model simulates the anisotropic, rate-dependent deformation behavior of CMSX-4, while 9\na modified Chaboche damage model is used for lifetime assessment, incorporating anisotropy by 10\nfocusing on cleavage stresses on active slip planes. Both qualitative and quantitative data obtained 11\nfrom HCF experiments on single crystal superalloys with notched geometry were used to validate 12\nthe model. Furthermore, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed to enhance the accuracy 13\nof lifetime predictions across varying temperatures by analyzing the stress-strain data obtained from 14\nsimulations. The integration of crystal plasticity, damage mechanics, and ANNs resulted in accurate 15\npredictions of fatigue life and crack initiation points under complex loading conditions of single 16\ncrystal superalloys.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a300ecee2588d38ff3c5c6cec67aae2729e1993084d3445c26e18fe1bc26ae0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
