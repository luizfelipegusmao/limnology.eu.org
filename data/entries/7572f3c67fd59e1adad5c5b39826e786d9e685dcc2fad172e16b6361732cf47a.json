The conditions on the primary random variables, which are independent but generally not identically distributed, and counting random variable are given in order that the randomly stopped sum, random minimum and maximum is heavy/light tailed. The results generalize some existing ones in the literature. The examples illustrating the results are provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7572f3c67fd59e1adad5c5b39826e786d9e685dcc2fad172e16b6361732cf47a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
