{"title":"Novel Methodology for the Design of Personalized Cancer Vaccine Targeting Neoantigens: Application to Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1612/v1","date":1716522840000,"content":"Personalized cancer vaccines have emerged as a promising avenue for cancer treatment or prevention strategies. This approach targets the specific genetic alterations in individual patientâ€™s tumors, offering a more personalized and effective treatment option. Previous studies have shown that generalized peptide vaccines targeting a limited scope of gene mutations are ineffective, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches. While studies have explored personalized mRNA vaccines, personalized peptide vaccines have not yet been studied in this context. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains challenging in oncology, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed a personalized peptide vaccine design methodology, employing RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify prevalent gene mutations underlying PDAC development in a specific patient solid tumor tissue. We performed RNAseq analysis for trimming adapters, read alignment, and somatic variant calling. We also developed a Python program, called GeneFinder, which validates the alignment of the RNAseq analysis. The Python program is freely available to download. Using chromosome number and locus data, GeneFinder identifies the target gene along the UCSC hg38 reference set. Based on the gene mutation data, we developed a personalized PDAC cancer vaccine that targets 100 highly prevalent gene mutations in the individual patient. We predicted peptide-MHC binding affinity, immunogenicity, antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity for each epitope. Then, we selected the top 50 and 100 epitopes based on our previously published vaccine design methodology. Finally, we generated pMHC-TCR 3D molecular model complex structures which are freely available fo download. The designed personalized cancer vaccine contains epitopes commonly found in PDAC solid tumor tissue. Our personalized vaccine was composed of neoantigens, allowing for a more precise and targeted immune response against cancer cells. Additionally, we identified mutated genes which were also found in the reference study where we obtained the sequencing data, thus validating our vaccine design methodology. This is the first study designing a personalized peptide vaccine using human patient data to identify gene mutations associated with the specific tumor of interest.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16f9ed72627c722482796b47065bb60cd727abdcd6c0fc7f917c97f8445e2205","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
