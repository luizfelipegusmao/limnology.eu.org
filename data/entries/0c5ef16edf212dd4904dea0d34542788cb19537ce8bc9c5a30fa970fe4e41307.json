{"title":"PatchFusion: Patch-based Nonrigid Tracking and Reconstruction of Deformable Objects using a Single RGB-D Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1670/v1","date":1711545099000,"content":"This paper introduces PatchFusion, an innovative approach for nonrigid tracking and reconstruction of deformable objects using a single RGB-D sensor. Existing methods face challenges in accurately capturing the rapid deformations of soft and flexible objects, thereby limiting their utility in diverse scenarios. Our approach overcomes this challenge by employing a dynamic patch-based framework that adapts to rapid inter-frame motions. Firstly, patch-wise rigid transformation fields for non-overlapping patches are solved via Iterative Closest Point (ICP) by incorporating geometric features as additional similarity constraints, thereby enhancing robustness and accuracy. Secondly, deformation optimization based on a nonrigid solver is applied to refine the coarse transformation fields. In order to enable simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of deformable objects, the patch-based rigid solver is designed to run in parallel with the nonrigid solver, serving as a plug-and-play module requiring minimal modifications for integration while enabling real-time performance. Following a comprehensive evaluation, PatchFusion showcases superior performance in effectively dealing with rapid inter-frame deformations when compared to existing techniques, rendering it a promising solution with broad applicability across domains such as robotics, computer vision, and human-computer interaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c5ef16edf212dd4904dea0d34542788cb19537ce8bc9c5a30fa970fe4e41307","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
