{"title":"Exploring Context Allows Us to Better Understand Physical Activity in People with and without Parkinson&rsquo;s Who Have Fallen: A Mixed Methods Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1694/v1","date":1721633223000,"content":"Falls are a frequent and serious problem for older adults and especially those living with Parkinson’s. The relationship between falls and physical activity is complex and people often restrict activity following a fall. Exercise is an important aspect of re-ducing further risk of a fall and a key component of the management of Parkinson’s. The aim of this study was to understand the types of activity that are engaged in, the environments in which they take place and the experience of people with and without Parkinson’s who have fallen. 17 people with Parkinson’s and 13 older adults, who had experienced at least one fall in the previous year, were recruited to this mixed methods study. Activity levels were captured over one week using accelerometers and body worn cameras, allowing the type and location of activity to be recorded and analysed. This information informed an interview. Findings showed that although both groups often achieved up to 10,000 steps per day, this was in very short bouts of activity. Sedentary activity such as watching television dominated the findings. Participants were aware of the benefits of being active but described many barriers to achieving the level of activity they would like to.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1f2c7d5fefb6a8c83d163bf0f45a7f733174969d809633c5ec0bf12f0513d8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
