{"title":"Putative rhamnogalacturonan-II glycosyltransferase identified through callus gene editing which bypasses embryo lethality","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2551/7671040?rss=1","date":1715558400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex and conserved domain of the pectin present in the primary cell walls of vascular plants. Borate cross-linking of RG-II is required for plants to grow and develop normally. Mutations that alter RG-II structure also affect cross-linking and are lethal or severely impair growth. Thus, few genes involved in RG-II synthesis have been identified. Here, we developed a method to generate viable loss-of-function <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) mutants in callus tissue via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. We combined this with a candidate gene approach to characterize the <span>male gametophyte defective 2</span> (<span>MGP2</span>) gene that encodes a putative family GT29 glycosyltransferase. Plants homozygous for this mutation do not survive. We showed that in the callus mutant cell walls, RG-II does not cross-link normally because it lacks 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) and thus cannot form the α-L-Rha<span>p</span>-(1→5)-α-D-kdo<span>p</span>-(1→sidechain). We suggest that <span>MGP2</span> encodes an inverting <span>R</span>G-II <span>C</span>MP-β-<span>K</span>do <span>t</span>ransferase (RCKT1). Our discovery provides further insight into the role of sidechains in RG-II dimerization. Our method also provides a viable strategy for further identifying proteins involved in the biosynthesis of RG-II.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"daa83765d0db06954435d87108cef30d1886aac5ac9f3939361c22ea9737445a","category":"Environment"}
