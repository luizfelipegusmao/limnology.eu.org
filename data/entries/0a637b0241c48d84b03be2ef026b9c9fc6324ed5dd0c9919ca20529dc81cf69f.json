{"title":"Investigation of the Energy Dissipation Characteristics of a Nonlinear Suspension System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0709/v1","date":1723202275000,"content":"This paper investigates the energy dissipation level of a nonlinear vehicle suspension system. The suspension system is modelled as a mass-spring-damper system, which is designed using the output frequency response function (OFRF) method. This method enables the derivation of an explicit relationship, between the system output spectrum (or Performance metric) and the system nonlinear parameters of interest. The OFRF polynomial, of the energy dissipation level, was derived in terms of the nonlinear parameters of interest. The results obtained show that the OFRF model, of the energy dissipation level, could be used to estimate the amount of heat dissipated, for a set of design parameters. This has potentials of providing some insights, in the design of vibration-based energy harvesters, as some of the wasted heat energy could be converted to electrical energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a637b0241c48d84b03be2ef026b9c9fc6324ed5dd0c9919ca20529dc81cf69f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
