The “ideal” cryo-grid contains areas of thin vitreous ice, densely populated with randomly oriented particles. A variety of solid supports, like amorphous carbon [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B2\">2</a>] and monolayer graphene oxide [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B3\">3</a>], have been used as non-selective solid supports that concentrate samples in the grid and partially protect from the AWI. More recently, use of affinity grids, consisting of a chemically modified TEM grid and designed to bind selectively to a target protein complex, have proven useful in determining the structure of samples not amendable to traditional TEM grid design. Among these affinity grids include chemically-modified carbon films [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B4\">4</a>] and graphene oxide [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B5\">5</a>], 2D crystals of streptavidin [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.353-B7\">7</a>] designed to bind biotin-conjugated samples, and lipid monolayers [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B8\">8</a>] containing modified lipids. Lipid monolayers have been used as a support film for growing 2D crystals and concentrating large protein complexes on the grid for structural determination using cryoEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.353-B9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.353-B10\">10</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0f7eb793312a526302643aa6d8f92ea4541ab0b1572f79288230574ae636db1e","category":"Environment"}
