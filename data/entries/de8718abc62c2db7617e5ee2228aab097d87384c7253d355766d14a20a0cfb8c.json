{"title":"Evaluating the roughness dynamics of kefir biofilms grown on Amazon cupuaçu juice: a monofractal and multifractal approach","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/1/55/7237331?rss=1","date":1690156800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the surface microtexture of kefir biofilms grown on <span>Theobroma grandiflorum</span> Shum (cupuaçu) juice using atomic force microscopy. Our goal was to investigate the unique monofractal and multifractal spatial patterns of these biofilms to complement the existing limited literature. The biofilms were prepared dispersing four different concentrations of kefir grains in cupuaçu juice. Our morphological analysis showed that the surface of the obtained biofilms is essentially formed by the presence of cupuaçu fibers and microorganisms like lactobacilli and yeast. The topographic height-based parameter analysis reveals that there is a dependence between surface roughness and the concentration of kefir grains used. The strongly anisotropic well-centralized topographical height distribution of the biofilms also exhibited a quasi-symmetrical and platykurtic pattern. The biofilms exhibit comparable levels of spatial complexity, surface percolation and surface homogeneity, which can be attributed to their similar topographic uniformity. This aspect was further supported by the presence of similar multifractality in the biofilms, suggesting that despite their varying topographic roughness, their vertical growth dynamics follow a similar pattern. Our findings demonstrate that the surface roughness of kefir biofilms cultivated on cupuaçu juice is influenced by the concentration of kefir grains in the precursor solution. However, this dependence follows a consistent pattern across different concentrations.<strong>Graphical Abstract</strong>  </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"de8718abc62c2db7617e5ee2228aab097d87384c7253d355766d14a20a0cfb8c","category":"Environment"}
