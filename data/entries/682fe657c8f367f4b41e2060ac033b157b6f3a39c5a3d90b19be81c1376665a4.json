Moreover, there is a significant and fluctuating global genetic diversity that varies across diverse environments over time. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of data on the genetic diversity of NoV in Ethiopia.</p> Objective <p>This study was aimed to assess the genetic diversity and distribution of NoVs circulating in the Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia, by considering all age groups.</p> Methods <p>A total of 519 fecal samples were collected from diarrheal patients from May 01/2021 to November 30/ 2021. The fecal samples were screened for the presence of NoVs using real-time RT-PCR by targeting a portion of the major capsid protein coding region. The positive samples were further amplified using conventional RT-PCR, and sequenced.</p> Results <p>The positivity rate of NoV was (8.9%; 46/519). The detection rate of NoV genogroup II (GII) and genogroup I (GI) was 38 (82.6%) and 8 (17.4%), respectively. Overall, five distinct GII (GII.3, GII.6, GII.10, GII.17, and GII.21) and two GI (GI.3 and GI.5) genotypes were detected. Within the GII types, GII.3 was the predominant (34.2%) followed by GII.21 (15.8%), GII.17 (10.5%), GII.6 and GII.10 each (2.6%). Norovirus GII.21 is reported for the first time in Ethiopia. The genetic diversity and distribution of NoVs were significantly different across the four sampling sits and age groups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed close relatedness of the current strains with published strains from Ethiopia and elsewhere.</p> Conclusion <p>The distribution and genetic diversity of NoV was considerably high, with predominance of non-GII.4 genotypes. The GII.21 genotype is a new add on the growing evidences on the genetic diversity of NoVs in Ethiopia. Future nationwide surveillance studies are necessary to gain comprehensive data in Ethiopia.</p>","author":"Dessie Tegegne","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"682fe657c8f367f4b41e2060ac033b157b6f3a39c5a3d90b19be81c1376665a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
