We seek to determine whether these coherent dynamics are caused by smooth brainwave activity or by something else. By analyzing biological data, we find that their cross-correlograms exhibit not only slow undulation but also a cusp at the origin, in addition to possible signs of monosynaptic connectivity. Here we show that undulation emerges if neurons are subject to smooth brainwave oscillations while a cusp results from nondifferentiable fluctuations. While modern analysis methods have achieved good connectivity estimation by adapting the models to slow undulation, they still make false inferences due to the cusp. We devise a new analysis method that may solve both problems. We also demonstrate that oscillations and nondifferentiable fluctuations may emerge in simulations of large-scale neural networks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"ec3235d7f3c02dd29738b8791e02824355662cedeb5644e9c56b675c7e1315e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
