{"title":"Mannan oligosaccharides as a prebiotic for laying hens: effects on fertility, hatchability, productive performance, and immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae123/7739230?rss=1","date":1724371200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This experiment examined how adding mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) to the diet affected fertility, hatching rates, egg production, carcass characteristics, cost-effectiveness, and immune function in laying hens. One hundred and twenty Mandarah chickens (30 hens and 3 roosters per group) were randomly chosen between 34 and 50 wk old and divided into four groups. The first group was the control group, which was given just the basal diet. The basal diet was given to the second, third, and fourth experimental groups along with three different levels of MOS (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 g/kg diet, respectively). Results found that hens fed MOS at various levels laid eggs at a significantly higher rate, enhanced egg number, egg mass and feed conversion ratio than the control group (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). MOS seemed to improve carcass quality. The best results for egg quality (Haugh unit) and testosterone levels were seen with a dose of 0.5 g/kg of MOS compared to the control birds (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). All MOS levels led to higher estradiol-17β (E2) levels and better economic efficiency (EE). MOS also improved the hens’ immune systems as compared to the control group. Hens-fed MOS had significantly greater levels of antibodies against Influenza viruses (H9N2) and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Also, the spleen and thymus gland, both crucial immune system components, were slightly larger (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). It’s important to note that fertility rates, hatchability, and embryo mortality rates remained similar across all groups. So, our findings suggest that incorporating MOS into the birds’ diet enhances their productivity, strengthens their immune system, improves EE, and contributes to the overall health of the hens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"b0aca3dc43fdf9759c538863fb767cc3dc44b218968134a6b094f33468af3aad","category":"Environment"}
