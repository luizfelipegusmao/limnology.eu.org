{"title":"On the Use of Complex Systems Engineering for the Development of Industry 4.0 Technologies: Case for Robotic Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0055/v1","date":1719820839000,"content":"This paper presents a novel integration of Systems Engineering (SE) methodologies and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in the design of robotic systems, with a focus on enhancing underwater robotic missions. Using the conceptual design of an underwater exploration vehicle as a case study, we demonstrate how SE can systematically incorporate I4.0 tools to improve mission performance and meet stakeholder expectations. The study begins with an overview of the SE approach, emphasizing the conceptual design stage, aligning with the application and case study of design theories. We then explore various I4.0 technologies, highlighting their functional benefits rather than technical specifics, addressing design methods for Industry 4.0. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are examined in terms of classification, components, and tasks, showcasing their evolution driven by technological advancements, thus tackling the complexity and design of complex systems. The core of our study involves defining stakeholder expectations, using quality function deployment for requirements definition, and performing a functional and logical decomposition of the ROV system. Our approach underscores the importance of understanding and integrating new technologies functionally, aligning with the transition towards Industry/Society 5.0. This work not only illustrates the synergy between SE and I4.0 but also offers a structured methodology for advancing the design and functionality of complex systems, setting a blueprint for future developments in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc2cd110b7538ac7a13718e69ea3717f2b0b9c0f1594b12bbdc30089febdadea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
