Physiological studies support predictions from individual-level responses (biochemical, cellular, tissue, respiratory potential) based on laboratory experiments. The otolith-isotope method of recovering field metabolic rate has recently filled a gap for the bony fishes, linking otolith stable isotope composition to <span>in situ</span> oxygen consumption and experienced temperature estimates. Here, we review the otolith-isotope method focusing on the biochemical and physiological processes that yield estimates of field metabolic rate. We identify a multidisciplinary pathway in the application of this method, providing concrete research goals (field, modeling) aimed at linking individual-level physiological data to higher levels of biological organization. We hope that this review will provide researchers with a transdisciplinary ‘roadmap’, guiding the use of the otolith-isotope method to bridge the gap between individual-level physiology, observational field studies, and modeling efforts, while ensuring that <span>in situ</span> data is central in marine policy-making aimed at mitigating climatic and anthropogenic threats.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"1e54034a3d9eaba6f2c5aeabaf53a11ad96611d47ab0e43d62a395ea024abd7d","category":"Environment"}
