The apparatus of the three-dimensional inverse problem of quantum scattering theory is developed for this. It is shown that the unitary scattering operator can be studied as a solution of the Poincar\\'e--Riemann--Hilbert boundary-value problem. This allows us to go on to study the potential in the Schr\\\"odinger equation","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbd393eaa8639f79db8f9d7030d642556d36e98e74a468a8b163eb91688034b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
