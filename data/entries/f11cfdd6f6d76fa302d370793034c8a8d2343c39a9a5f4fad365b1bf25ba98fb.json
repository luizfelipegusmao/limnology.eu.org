{"title":"Investigating the Performance of Open Vocabulary Classification Algorithms for Pathway and Surface Material Detection in Urban Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1321/v1","date":1726569284000,"content":"Mapping pavement types, especially in sidewalks, is essential for urban planning and\nmobility studies. Identifying pavement materials is a key factor in assessing mobility, such as\nwalkability and wheelchair usability. However, satellite imagery in this scenario is limited, and\nin-situ mapping can be costly. A promising solution is to extract such geospatial features from\nstreet-level imagery. This study explores using open vocabulary classification algorithms to\nsegment and identify pavement types and surface materials in this scenario. Our approach uses\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy of classifying different pavement types.\nThe methodology involves two experiments: the first uses free prompting with random\nstreet-view images, employing Grounding Dino and SAM algorithms to assess performance across\ncategories. The second experiment evaluates standardized pavement classification using the\nDeep-Pavements Dataset and a fine-tuned CLIP algorithm optimized for detecting\nOSM-compliant pavement categories. The study presents open resources, such as the Deep\nPavements Dataset and a fine-tuned CLIP-based model, demonstrating a significant improvement\nin the True Positive Rate (TPR) from 56.04% to 93.5%. Our findings highlight both the potential\nand limitations of current open vocabulary algorithms and emphasize the importance of diverse\ntraining datasets. This study advances urban feature mapping by offering a more intuitive and\naccurate approach to geospatial data extraction, enhancing urban accessibility and mobility\nmapping.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f11cfdd6f6d76fa302d370793034c8a8d2343c39a9a5f4fad365b1bf25ba98fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
