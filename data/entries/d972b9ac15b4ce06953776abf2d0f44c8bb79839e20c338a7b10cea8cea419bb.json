{"title":"Supramolecular Systems Linked to Metal‚ÄêOrganic Frameworks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1346/v1","date":1713533258000,"content":"Supramolecular structures with specific applications are a pillar in several areas of science. Thus, from a contemporary point of view, there are several reasons to feel inclined to cover a systematic, or historic critique of the supramolecular concept itself. First, the idea of a supramolecular material seems more secure now than it was decades ago. Second, updating the interacting of MOFs and supramolecular chemical and conversely, supramolecularity to assemble MOFs and to make ef-ficient complex systems in multiple cutting-edge applications. Third, we should here simply confine to a consideration of how workers in this field have tried to correlate the notion of the idea of supramolecular systems linking self-assembly considerations. Thereby, this is clearly an ad-vantage that optimized geometries obtained on the conductive bases described that undoubtedly, some of these systems have substantial applications and create a significant practical interest. The outline of this review encompasses a general introduction to MOFs and supramolecularity, the key unit of the study presented here, followed by a survey of recent advances in supramolecular chemistry in confined space, relationships of MOFs with the supramolecular chemistry, electro-chemical synthesis of MOFs, and switchable MOFs. Finally, some discussion on possible future perspectives of this field is given.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d972b9ac15b4ce06953776abf2d0f44c8bb79839e20c338a7b10cea8cea419bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
