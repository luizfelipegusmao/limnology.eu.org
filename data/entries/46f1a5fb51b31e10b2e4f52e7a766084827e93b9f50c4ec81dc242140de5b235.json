Scanning TEM electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) thermometry has previously been used to map temperature, thermal expansion, and strain at sub-nanometer length scales [<a href=\"#ozae044.682-B1\">1-3</a>]. Similarly, four-dimensional (4D)-STEM has been used to map sub-nanometer strain in materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.682-B4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.682-B5\">5</a>]. In this work, we correlate TEM imaging, diffraction, and EELS of a freestanding, (100)-oriented Si thin film to quantify anisotropic thermal expansion and strain in three dimensions. The EEL spectra are calculated fully <span>ab initio</span>, which allows us to understand the many-body interactions that shift the volume plasmon mode with temperature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"46f1a5fb51b31e10b2e4f52e7a766084827e93b9f50c4ec81dc242140de5b235","category":"Environment"}
