{"title":"The Detection of Vaccine Virus and Protection of a Modified Live, Intranasal, Tri-Valent Vaccine in Neonatal, Colostrum-Fed Calves with an Experimental Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus Challenge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0505/v1","date":1715177344000,"content":"The efficacy of an intranasal (IN) bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) administered in the face of passive immunity was assessed.  Pooled colostrum was administered by intubation to fifty (50) beef-dairy crossbred calves the day they were born. The calves were transported to a research facility and were blocked by age and sex and randomly assigned into two groups, a sham-vaccinated intranasally with a placebo (sterile water) or vaccinated with a tri-valent modified live viral (MLV) vaccine. The calves were 9ï‚±2 days old when vaccinated (day 0). The calves were challenged by aerosolized BRSV on day 80 and day 81 as a respiratory challenge. The study was terminated on day 88. Lung lesion scores (LLS) were significantly lower for calves vaccinated with tri-valent MLV vaccine than those for calves that were sham-vaccinated. Serum neutralization (SN) antibody against BRSV in calves vaccinated with the tri-valent MLV vaccine demonstrated an anamnestic response on day 88. After challenge, the calves sham-vaccinated with the placebo lost weight while those vaccinated with the tri-valent MLV vaccine gained weight. In this study colostrum-derived antibodies did not interfere with the immune response or protection provided by one dose of the tri-valent MLV vaccine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a524464ddc0fc0f0147c79f88c0d34e2767ea61fbe71b6fd85d3916bce3bc86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
