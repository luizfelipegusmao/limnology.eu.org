{"title":"Process of Object-Oriented Design of Gear Size Ranges. Part I: Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0866/v1","date":1715611448000,"content":"Design process can be divided into stages of analysis and synthesis. This paper presents the application of the object-oriented technique to the analysis as well as theoretical considerations concerning to design of gear size ranges. This analysis consists in decomposition of the designed artefact (a gear) according to the rule “from general to details view”. The basics of the object-oriented analysis were formulated. Furthermore, design phases and the objects related to theses phases were discussed. The following models have been considered: hierarchical model, entity-relationship model, data-flow model and object model. Analysis is additionally connected with interactions between particular design phases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07f13c6ae6528c117d373771f949de7341fd3b2d5b1f21be2116f0bd5841bb6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
