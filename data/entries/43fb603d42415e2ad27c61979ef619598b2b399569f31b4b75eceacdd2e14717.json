Abacavir hypersensitivity (AHS), which is strongly associated with HLA-B*57:01, is one of the most representative examples. Conventionally, HLA transmits immunological signals via interactions with T cell receptors on the cell surface. This study focused on HLA-mediated intracellular reactions in keratinocytes that might determine the onset of skin immunotoxicity by drug treatments. Abacavir exposure resulted in keratinocytes expressing HLA-B*57:01 exhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, such as immediate calcium release into the cytosol and enhanced HSP70 expression. In contrast, keratinocytes expressing HLA-B*57:03 (closely related to HLA-B*57:01) did not show these changes. This indicated that HLA-B*57:01 has a specific intracellular response to abacavir in keratinocytes in the absence of lymphocytes. Furthermore, abacavir exposure in HLA-B*57:01-expressing keratinocytes elevated the expression of cytokines/chemokines such as interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and CCL27, and induced T lymphoblast migration. These effects were suppressed by ER stress relief using 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PB). HLA-B*57:01-transgenic mice also exhibited ER stress in epidermal areas following abacavir administration, and abacavir-induced skin toxicity was attenuated by the administration of 4-PB. Moreover, abacavir bound to HLA-B*57:01 within cells and its exposure led to HLA-B*57:01 protein aggregation and interaction with molecular chaperones in the ER of keratinocytes. Our results underscore the importance of HLA-mediated intracellular stress responses in understanding the onset of HLA-B*57:01-mediated AHS. We provide the possibility that the intracellular behavior of HLA is crucial for determining the onset of drug eruptions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"43fb603d42415e2ad27c61979ef619598b2b399569f31b4b75eceacdd2e14717","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
