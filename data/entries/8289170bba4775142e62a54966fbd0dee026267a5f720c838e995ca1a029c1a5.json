{"title":"Seismic Design and Analysis of a Cold-Formed Steel Exoskeleton for Retrofit of a RC Multi-story Residential Building","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0978/v1","date":1723553733000,"content":"The awareness of the vulnerability of existing structures under both seismic and energy viewpoints highlight the need to develop integrated retrofit solutions combining the structural and thermal performances. In this perspective, the study explores the efficacy of the Resisto 5.9 Tube system, a seismic coat that improves the seismic behaviour of masonry and reinforced concrete (RC) structures, also enhancing their energy performances, thanks to the thermal coat integrated in the basic steel system. The research involves the application of a design procedure specifically developed for this retrofit system from the seismic perspective. Once all the system elements are designed, non-linear static analyses are performed with a Finite Element software comparing the buildingâ€™s seismic performances before and after the application of Resisto 5.9 Tube. The results demonstrate a significant increase in seismic safety coefficient, proving that this intervention type can be useful to obtain the seismic upgrading of existing RC buildings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8289170bba4775142e62a54966fbd0dee026267a5f720c838e995ca1a029c1a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
