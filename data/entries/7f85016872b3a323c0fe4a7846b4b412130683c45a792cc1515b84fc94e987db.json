{"title":"Using Soil Survey and Land Evaluation Approaches for Sustainable Beetroot Production: A Case of Kgakotlou Circuit, South Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2064/v1","date":1719612845000,"content":"South Africa (SA) is grappling with a severe food insecurity crisis exacerbated by socioeconomic challenges. This resulted in the Department of Basic Education (DBE) advocating for the establishment of vegetable gardens at schools. However, information on the suitability of the soils in SA for sustainably growing Beetroot is unavailable. This study aimed to assess the suitability of soils for sustainable Beetroot production at various schools in the Kgakotlou circuit. Four Secondary Schools were selected: Mothimako, Madipoane, Klaas Mothapo and Phomolong. A detailed soil survey was carried out to study soils in vegetable gardens. Soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis of physicochemical properties. The soil suitability was evaluated using the physicochemical properties of the soils and optimal soil requirements for Beetroot production. We found various soils in the schools, including Cambisols (Hutton and Nkonkoni), Leptosol (Glenrosa), Plinthosol (Westleigh), and Acrisols (Tshiombo and Tubatse). Portions of the gardens on Hutton and Westleigh soil were moderately suitable (S2), limited by electrical conductivity (EC). Meanwhile, portions of Tshiombo, Tubatse, and Nkonkoni were marginally suitable (S3), limited by pH and EC. Portions on Glenrosa soil at Klaas Mothapo and Phomolong were not suitable (NS) and were limited by shallow depth, soil pH and EC. The results reveal the importance of considering soil suitability before establishing vegetable gardens in school settings. Indexing soil suitability using the physicochemical properties of soil resources for sustainable beetroot production is proposed for schools in the Kgakatlou circuit and other parts of SA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f85016872b3a323c0fe4a7846b4b412130683c45a792cc1515b84fc94e987db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
