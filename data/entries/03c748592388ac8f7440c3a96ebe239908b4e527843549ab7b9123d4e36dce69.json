Notwithstanding, the quantitative analytical prowess of EDS is contingent upon the availability of an extensive database of elemental standards, a resource that often entails considerable expenditure. In addressing this constraint, our study integrates the applications of neural networks with Monte Carlo simulations to enhance the cost-effectiveness of the analytical process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"03c748592388ac8f7440c3a96ebe239908b4e527843549ab7b9123d4e36dce69","category":"Environment"}
