{"title":"Exploring self-experience practices in dementia care: A scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302929","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Janina Wittmann, Anja Bieber, Joanne Carroll, Kealan Forristal, Louise Hopper, Niels Janssen, Gabriele Meyer, Marianna Riello, Marjolein de Vugt, Dorothee Bauernschmidt</p>\r\nBackground <p>Recognised as essential for high-quality dementia service, person-centred care aims to understand and respect the unique needs of each individual. Self-experience practices may offer caregivers an opportunity to acquire knowledge, empathy, and skills related to person-centred care, especially through recreating experiences similar to dementia. Given the need to enhance the understanding of self-experience practices in dementia care, a more comprehensive investigation of these training interventions for (future) caregivers is needed.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a scoping review to map the evidence on the use of self-experience practices in dementia training. We systematically searched Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We also searched for grey literature, as well as registry entries, and conducted backward citation tracking of included reviews. We analysed data on intervention characteristics, factors influencing the implementation, and learning outcomes based on Kirkpatrick’s model.</p> Results <p>We included 44 reports across 30 intervention programmes. The majority of reports (91%) were published from 2016 onwards, with 32% originating from the USA and 25% from the UK. We identified passive, interactive, immersive, and multicomponent self-experience interventions in dementia education and training. Learning outcomes based on Kirkpatrick’s model were fairly distributed across all identified modalities. Both consumers and providers emphasised aspects related to the development and implementation of practices, particularly organisational-related considerations such as temporal and spatial planning of trainings.</p> Conclusions <p>Our review highlights diverse interventions incorporating self-experience practices, with an increasing role for technological tools. While self-experience interventions engage participants, the impact on individuals with dementia and organisational levels remain largely unreported. Our overview, informed by current literature, underscores unique considerations and challenges associated with dementia-related self-experience practices. Implementing and evaluating complex training interventions using self-experience practices should consider ethical aspects.</p> Trial registration <p>Registry: Registered within the Open Science Framework (available at https://osf.io/fycxa/).</p>","author":"Janina Wittmann","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce6fec2137deeb930f86d13ad796037c97e289ab37f30fe708029b556e90eac8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
