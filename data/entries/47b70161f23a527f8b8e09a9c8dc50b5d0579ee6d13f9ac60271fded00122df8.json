Pressure application causes the reversible shift of all the observed Raman peaks to higher frequencies and changes in their relative intensities, with the intermolecular vibrational modes being by far more sensitive to pressurization compared to the intramolecular ones. The present high-pressure Raman data indicate the structural stability of the <i>trans</i>-cinnamic acid crystal and molecular conformation up to the highest pressure attained in the experiments, the importance of the hydrogen bonding, as well as the considerable strengthening of the intermolecular interactions at elevated pressures.</p>","author":"Anna Marinopoulou, \nVasiliki Christopoulou, \nOlga Karabinaki, \nDimitris Christofilos, \nJohn Arvanitidis","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"47b70161f23a527f8b8e09a9c8dc50b5d0579ee6d13f9ac60271fded00122df8","category":"Environment"}
