{"title":"Relationship between Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase and Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency with New Generation Inflammation Biomarkers of in Term Newborns with Prolonged Neonatal Jaundice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1649/v1","date":1711523525000,"content":"Background: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency increases the risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical findings of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, to prevent further examinations for prolonged jaundice, and to contribute by regulating its treatment. At the same time, it is to determine whether systemic-immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) can be used in addition to conventional complete blood count (CBC) parameters in the diagnosis of neonatal prolonged jaundice. Methods: In full term neonates with hyperbilirubinemia who were admitted to Medicine Hospital between January 2019 and January 2024 with the complaint of jaundice, 167 infants with a serum bilirubin level above 5 mg/dL, whose jaundice persisted after the 10th day, were included in the study. Results: 63.5% of the patients were male and the mean age was 31Â±6 days. G6PD was negatively perfectly correlated with NLR (r: -1; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8142f14461c4e28d8b734218e8d5014f768008d0c5d565dae4049cf29fd2f9fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
