{"title":"Dipeptidyl Peptidase 9 (DPP9) Depletion From Hepatocytes in Mice Retards Liver Tumour Growth and Increases Intrahepatic Caspase-1 Activation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1824/v1","date":1711697653000,"content":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is a multifunctional intracellular protease with roles in tumour growth, inflammation and mitochondrial function. We developed a hepatocyte-specific DPP9 knockout mouse (DPP9-KO) to explore DPP9 in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DPP9-KO mice were generated by crossing Albumin-Cre mice (Wt/Wt Cre+/+) with DPP9 floxed mice (Fl/Fl Cre-/-). Mice were treated with Diethylnitrosamine and Thioacetamide then an atherogenic High Fat Diet until 28 weeks of age. DPP9-KO mice had reduced liver and subcuta-neous adipose tissue mass and lower fasting plasma glucose, fewer small macroscopic liver nod-ules compared to DPP9-WT mice. However, there were no differences in the total number of mac-roscopic liver nodules, tumour burden, inflammation score and steatosis score. Consistent with the known ability of DPP9 to suppress NLRP1 activation, activated caspase-1 protein was ele-vated in DPP9-KO mouse liver. Additionally, Nfkbib, Cxcl10 and Ccl5 mRNA and protein levels of autophagy marker beclin1 and tumour suppressor p53 were increased. In conclusion, DPP9 de-pletion in hepatocytes may reduce liver cancer initiation, via mechanisms that may include in-creased autophagy and innate tumour suppression in this experimental model. Finally, the data supports DPP9 having a role in glucose regulation by the liver.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b2d72ec73440edec0c86527d4be4bd7294fbe74fb6edbe0ca160c1cf9b5ca3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
