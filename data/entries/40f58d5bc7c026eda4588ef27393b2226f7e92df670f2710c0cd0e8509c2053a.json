{"title":"The Hyper-Torus Universe Model&mdash;A New Paradigm for Understanding Reality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0674/v1","date":1718076950000,"content":"The Hyper-Torus Universe Model (HTUM) is a novel framework that unifies quantum mechanics, cosmology, and consciousness, proposing that the universe is a higher-dimensional hyper-torus containing all possible states of existence. This paper explores the fundamental concepts and implications of the HTUM, which suggests that the universe is a quantum system in which all possible outcomes are inherently connected, with consciousness playing a crucial role in actualizing reality. The HTUM addresses critical challenges in modern physics, such as the nature of quantum entanglement, the origin of the universe, and the relationship between mind and matter. By introducing concepts like singularity, quantum entanglement at a cosmic scale, and the self-actualization of the universe, the HTUM provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental nature of reality. This paper discusses the mathematical formulation of the HTUM, its implications for quantum mechanics and cosmology, and its potential to bridge the gap between science and philosophy. The philosophical implications of the HTUM are also examined, including its impact on free will, determinism, and the mind-matter relationship. The HTUM represents a significant shift in our understanding of the universe and our place within it, inviting further research and exploration into the nature of reality and consciousness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40f58d5bc7c026eda4588ef27393b2226f7e92df670f2710c0cd0e8509c2053a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
