{"title":"Combined Effect of Rice Husk Ash and Animal Bone Powder on Strength and Permeability of Concrete","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1052/v1","date":1718606661000,"content":"Infrastructure development is rapidly increasing, driving up demand for concrete, a key construction material. Cement and aggregate are essential constituents, with global cement production reaching 4.1 billion metric tons in 2011 and CO2 emissions hitting 1.7 billion metric tons by 2024, a significant contributor to carbon emissions. To address this, alternative constituents like Rice Husk Ash (RHA) and Animal Bone Powder (ABP) are proposed. With rice husk comprising 20% of rice weight and a substantial cattle population in Bangladesh, RHA and ABP offer promising alternatives. This study examines the benefits and limitations of incorporating RHA and ABP into cement, focusing on concrete strength and permeability. By replacing varying percentages of cement with RHA and ABP simultaneously, experiments evaluate their impact on concrete properties after 28 days of curing. The research aims to identify the optimal combination for sustainable concrete production, reducing environmental impact by curbing waste generation and pollution. Results show that compressive strength increases and permeability decreases with up to 5% replacement of RHA and ABP, highlighting their potential for enhancing concrete performance while mitigating environmental concerns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64abb4d77c41556c57e2a95371022bd19ce0681abff7de9339d5973c8a34b060","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
