{"title":"Nodulating another way: what can we learn from lateral root base nodulation in legumes?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3214/7627783?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Certain legumes provide a special pathway for rhizobia to invade the root and develop nitrogen-fixing nodules, a process known as lateral root base (LRB) nodulation. This pathway involves intercellular infection at the junction of the lateral roots with the taproot, leading to nodule formation in the lateral root cortex. Remarkably, this LRB pathway serves as a backbone for various adaptative symbiotic processes. Here, we describe different aspects of LRB nodulation and highlight directions for future research to elucidate the mechanisms of this as yet little known but original pathway that will help in broadening our knowledge on the rhizobiumâ€“legume symbiosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"924e8914123cbdc91f20a420939e0b8bc015ca3b8d4561858cc6bde3f7caeee1","category":"Environment"}
