{"title":"Artificial Intelligence as a New Field of Activity for Applied Social Psychology – A Reasoning for Broadening the Scope","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1586/v1","date":1719209789000,"content":"Interaction with social agents employing natural language have been discussed especially since Weizenbaum (1966) observed the social effects of his chatbot named 'Eliza', which imitated a cli-ent-centered conversation. With Nass and Reeves’ media equation theory and computers as social actors paradigm, a well-tested framework has been introduced to the study of human-computer interaction. In the 1990s, there was a renewed focus on natural language analysis, which has be-come a crucial area of research in machine learning. Recent advancements in data processing and storage capacities have led to the development of AI-generated utterances that closely resemble human utterances. As a result, AI-based systems can now mimic social relationships to a signifi-cant extent. In light of these technological developments, the article explores whether quasi-social relationships should be considered within the field of social psychology and examines the poten-tial advantages and challenges of this approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afc520d060011a6ab9641bab9a697c0667e89af1c2392934292d8488dee4402d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
