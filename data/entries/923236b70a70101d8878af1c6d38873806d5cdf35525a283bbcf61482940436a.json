{"title":"Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat malectin receptor–like kinases regulate pollen–stigma interactions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/343/7589261?rss=1","date":1706140800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Flowering plants contain tightly controlled pollen–pistil interactions required for promoting intraspecific fertilization and preventing interspecific hybridizations. In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), several receptor kinases (RKs) are known to regulate the later stages of intraspecific pollen tube growth and ovular reception in the pistil, but less is known about RK regulation of the earlier stages. The <span>Arabidopsis</span> RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE IN FLOWERS1 (RKF1)/RKF1-LIKE (RKFL) 1-3 cluster of 4 leucine-rich repeat malectin (LRR-MAL) RKs was previously found to function in the stigma to promote intraspecific pollen hydration. In this study, we tested additional combinations of up to 7 <span>Arabidopsis LRR-MAL RK</span> knockout mutants, including <span>RKF1, RKFL1-3</span>, <span>LysM RLK1-INTERACTING KINASE1</span>, <span>REMORIN-INTERACTING RECEPTOR1</span>, and <span>NEMATODE-INDUCED LRR-RLK2</span>. These LRR-MAL RKs were discovered to function in the female stigma to support intraspecific <span>Arabidopsis</span> pollen tube growth and to establish a prezygotic interspecific barrier against <span>Capsella rubella</span> pollen. Thus, this study uncovered additional biological functions for this poorly understood group of <span>RKs</span> in regulating the early stages of <span>Arabidopsis</span> sexual reproduction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"923236b70a70101d8878af1c6d38873806d5cdf35525a283bbcf61482940436a","category":"Environment"}
