{"title":"The Effects of Desiccation on the Antioxidant Defense, Immune Responses, and Nitrogen Metabolism of Red Swamp Crayfish Procambarus clarkii","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5767457?af=R","date":1721034317000,"content":"<p>Desiccation due to air exposure is a common environmental stress that harms the health of crustaceans. How crustaceans respond to air exposure remains largely unclear. In this research, we explored the physiological responses and gene regulation under air exposure of an invasive species <i>Procambarus clarkii</i>, which is the most commonly cultured freshwater crustacean in China. Toll3 belonging to the Toll-like receptor family and proPO in the prophenoloxidase-activating system were two important immune responses to air exposure. In addition, air exposure can also influence ammonia metabolism via regulating the expression of the key genes. <i>Prx6</i> and proPO showed quick responses and high sensitivity to air exposure, suggesting the potential to be the biomarker for desiccation stress assessment in crayfish. The results of this research can provide useful information for monitoring desiccation stress, as well as transport and sale management in red swamp crayfish.</p>","author":"Shuquan Ding, \nHaomiao Chi, \nKun You, \nMei Huang, \nMengxiao Wu, \nLinjiang Zhang, \nXingyan Cui, \nRan Xu, \nYunlong Zhang, \nGouranga Biswas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"1978d98b2ed22fc298a41395822467513c9b6dd97ad101fb99f789880252e163","category":"Environment"}
