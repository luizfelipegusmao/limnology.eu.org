{"title":"New Insights into Chronic Pancreatitis Treatment: Potential Mechanisms and Applications of Probiotics and Prebiotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0662/v1","date":1723424744000,"content":"Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive fibroinflammatory disorder with no currently satisfactory treatment. Emerging evidence suggests an association between gut microbial dysbiosis and chronic pancreatitis. Although direct causative evidence is lacking, it is hypothesized that the gut microbiota may play a pivotal role in modulating pancreatic function via the gut-pancreas axis. Thus, modulating the gut microbiota through the administration of probiotics or prebiotics may alleviate pancreatic disorders. In this review, we first propose the potential mechanisms by which specific probiotics or prebiotics may ameliorate chronic pancreatitis, including the alleviation of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), facilitation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production, activation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) in the pancreas. Since there are currently no probiotics or prebiotics used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis, we have discussed research in other disease models that use probiotics or prebiotics to modulate pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions and prevent pancreatic fibrosis. This provides indirect evidence for their potential application in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. We anticipate that this research will stimulate further investigation into the gut-pancreas axis and the potential therapeutic value of probiotics and prebiotics in chronic pancreatitis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d03b8c616ea74eb87eff34d3d5b40ee54b0ceba6774b4f18f036816017d0621c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
