HRS and HRH were obtained from subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) at different temperatures (180, 220, and 260°C). The Coats-Redfern method was used to analyze the thermal behavior through thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves. TG profiles showed higher decomposition in the range of 250–400°C, especially for rice straw (RS) and HRS (80 wt %). The pyrolysis curves were well predicted by a first-order reaction model. The kinetic analysis showed a variation in activation energy (<i>E</i>\n<sub>A</sub>) between 24.3 to 41.3 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and 40.4 to 54.7 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> for RS/HRS and rice husk (RH)/HRH, respectively. The enthalpy (Δ<i>H</i>), Gibbs free energy (Δ<i>G</i>), and entropy (Δ<i>S</i>) varied from 25.9 to 39.6 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, 35.4 to 69.6 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, and −64.1 to −6.7 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, for RS/HRS, and 35 to 49.8 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, 43.2 to 79.3 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, and −53.5 to −10.2 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, for RH/HRH. These results showed that the pyrolysis reactivity using HRS is higher than HRH, which indicates the pyrolysis of HRS is more advantageous than HRH.</p>","author":"Leonardo R.
