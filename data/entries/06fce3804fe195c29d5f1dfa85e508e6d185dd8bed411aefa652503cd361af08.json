{"title":"Behavioral and Psychosocial Dynamics of Studentâ€™s Engagements: The Digital Divide in AI Sport Podcasts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0174/v1","date":1727871257000,"content":"The digital divide, particularly within the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) sport podcasts, presents significant behavioral and psychosocial challenges for student engagement. This study examines the disparities in access to and proficiency with Information Communication Technologies (ICT) across different demographic groups, focusing on gender, age, and religious level. The advent of the commercial web has heightened the significance of these divides, as first-level digital divide concerns access to the internet, while the second-level digital divide pertains to the ability to use technology proficiently. Existing literature has consistently highlighted persistent inequalities in these areas, which significantly impact the extent to which students from various backgrounds can engage with AI sport podcasts effectively. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing strategies to bridge the gap and ensure equitable access to digital learning resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06fce3804fe195c29d5f1dfa85e508e6d185dd8bed411aefa652503cd361af08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
