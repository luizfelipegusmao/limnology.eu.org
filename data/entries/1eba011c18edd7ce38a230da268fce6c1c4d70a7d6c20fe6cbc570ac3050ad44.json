{"title":"An enhanced productivity of pink oyster mushroom with improved nutritional profile, characterization and attempt for commercial exploitation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13399?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>An attempt has been made to explore the nutritional profile of pink oyster mushrooms that have been grown in various agricultural residues, including sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, coconut coir and sawdust, along with other nutrient supplements such as defatted mustard and chickpea powder, for appropriate growth and fruiting body formation in a short span of time. The spawn production was experimented with five different grain varieties. The study became interesting when the observations differed slightly from the traditional practices, with the addition of defatted mustard supplements resulting in a positive correlation with respect to reducing the fruiting time, as well as improving yield and the nutritional profile of <i>Pleurotus djamor</i>.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>An elevated yield of 651.93 g kg<sup>−1</sup> was recorded in the medium where the RS and DM were used in the ratio of 1:0.01 (rice straw +1% w/w defatted mustard) bag, whereas, in terms of protein content, a maximum yield of 32.57 ± 0.79 mg g<sup>−1</sup> was observed when SB:DM was in the same ratio (sugarcane bagasse +1% w/w defatted mustard) bag.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To confer the best outcomes from the screened substrates, a series of experiments were performed by varying the concentration of RS and SB, with 1% w/w DM. It is worth noting that the highest protein content of 32.76 ± 0.38 mg g<sup>−1</sup> was obtained along with the total yield of 702.56 ± 2.9 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of mushroom when the ratio of RS:SB was 0.7:0.3. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Priyadharshini Jayaseelan, \nAishwarya Rajan, \nRintu Banerjee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1eba011c18edd7ce38a230da268fce6c1c4d70a7d6c20fe6cbc570ac3050ad44","category":"Environment"}
