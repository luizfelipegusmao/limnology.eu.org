This pretext task slightly-but-consistently improves baseline performances for both registration and few-shot change detection on OSCD, LEVIR-CD and S2looking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fa75409d5f4d0fe5665954e686d2e7019171dd14b58039772010b8c5fe32365","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
