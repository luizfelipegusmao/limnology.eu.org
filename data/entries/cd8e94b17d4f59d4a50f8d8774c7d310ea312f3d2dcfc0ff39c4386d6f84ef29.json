This study aimed to compare the performance, strain, and comfort of men and women using an upper-body exoskeleton. (2) n=20 female and n=16 male participants performed an overhead drilling task with and without a passive upper-body exoskeleton in a randomized cross-over study. Task performance of different movement phases, perceived exertion, and ease of use were measured to compare gender differences. One and two-way analyses were used to compare genders in the different conditions. (3) Gender differences after controlling for BMI in task performance were found for error integrals (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd8e94b17d4f59d4a50f8d8774c7d310ea312f3d2dcfc0ff39c4386d6f84ef29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
