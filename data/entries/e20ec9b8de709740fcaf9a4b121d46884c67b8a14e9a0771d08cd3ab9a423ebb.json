{"title":"Sun Declination and Distribution of Natural Beam Irradiance on Earth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0613/v1","date":1720428460000,"content":"The daily path of the Sun across longitude yields night and day, but the Sun also travels across latitude on a belt 47° wide. The Sun meridian declination explains the annual budget of natural beam irradiance (NBI), which is the irradiance delivered to the Earth’s surface as a normal projec-tion from the Sun. Data for the sun meridian declination data were obtained from the geometric model. The distribution of NBI was weighed between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The variation patterns of the solar declination conform to the dynamics of pendular motion. The joint distributions of velocity or acceleration of meridian declination against declination fit circular graphs. The NBI budget fluctuates in inverse proportion to the velocity of declination, yielding 18 sun-paths per degree for latitudes above 20°, and 6 sun-paths per degree for latitudes under 20°. All sites of the planet, whose latitude coincide, whether within or between hemispheres, accumu-late an equivalent budget of NBI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e20ec9b8de709740fcaf9a4b121d46884c67b8a14e9a0771d08cd3ab9a423ebb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
