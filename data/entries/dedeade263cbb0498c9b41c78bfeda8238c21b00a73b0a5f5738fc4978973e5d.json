{"title":"Identification of microbial antigens in liver tissues involved in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis using 16S rRNA metagenome analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308912","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Tomohiro Katsumi, Hidenori Sato, Ryoko Murakami, Takumi Hanatani, Fumi Uchiyama, Fumiya Suzuki, Keita Maki, Kyoko Hoshikawa, Hiroaki Haga, Takafumi Saito, Yoshiyuki Ueno</p>\r\nBackground <p>Multiple factors are involved in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic cholestatic liver disease, characterized by intrahepatic cholangiopathy. In particular, studies have suggested that environmental factors such as the presence of granulomas in the portal vein region are important for the development of PBC. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze and identify foreign-derived antigens in PBC liver tissue to confirm their involvement in PBC pathogenesis.</p> Methods <p>Portal areas and hepatocyte regions were selectively dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PBC liver tissue samples using the microlaser method, followed by total DNA extraction. We then validated whether the bacterial strains identified through 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis were detected in PBC liver tissues.</p> Results <p>The most frequently detected bacterial genera in the PBC liver tissue samples were <i>Sphingomonas panacis</i>, <i>Providencia</i>, and <i>Cutibacterium</i>. These bacterial genera were also detected in the other PBC samples. Validation for the detection of <i>S</i>. <i>panacis</i>, the most abundant genus, revealed polymerase chain reaction bands extracted from the portal areas of all samples. They were also more highly expressed than bands detected in the hepatocyte region.</p> Conclusion <p><i>S</i>. <i>panacis</i> antigen was specifically detected in the portal areas of PBC liver tissues. The introduction of foreign-derived antigens into the liver as an environmental factor could be a possible mechanism for the development of PBC.</p>","author":"Tomohiro Katsumi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dedeade263cbb0498c9b41c78bfeda8238c21b00a73b0a5f5738fc4978973e5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
