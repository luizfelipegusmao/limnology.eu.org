{"title":"Limosilactobacillus reuteri RE225 alleviates gout by modulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF‐κB inflammatory pathway and the Nrf2/HO‐1 oxidative stress pathway, and by regulating gut microbiota","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13908?af=R","date":1726748060000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Gout poses a significant health threat. The use of <i>Lactobacillus</i> from the gut microbiota is one potential remedy. However, the intricate molecular mechanisms governing the impact of <i>Lactobacillus</i> on gout remain largely uncharted. In this study, a strain of <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> RE225 was separated from the gut of mice and colitis was treated with polypeptide intervention.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p><i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> RE225 reduced foot tumefaction markedly in mice with gout and extended the pain threshold time in their feet. It also improved the health of gut microbiota. Intervention with <i>L. reuteri</i> RE225 also suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>κ</i>B and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathways in the mice, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines – interleukin 1<i>β</i> (IL-1<i>β</i>), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-<i>α</i> (TNF-<i>α</i>) – and increased the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10), thereby mitigating inflammation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study provides a theoretical basis for the comprehensive development of <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> and new ideas for the non-pharmacological treatment of gout. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yang Qin, \nYucong Zhou, \nJiayi Xiong, \nChenyang Lu, \nJun Zhou, \nXiurong Su, \nJiaojiao Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"10b4fc054f892f1ecd97ad8b66e1016177b7862176a3a7e3b4b114eb062e64bd","category":"Environment"}
