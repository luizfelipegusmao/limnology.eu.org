{"title":"Stochastic Modeling of Human Civilization's Future Under Competing AI Influences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1167/v1","date":1718705281000,"content":"This study explores the potential trajectories of human civilization influenced by the development and competition of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Using a system of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), we model the probability density function representing the state of civilization in a phase space defined by prosperity and knowledge. The model incorporates diffusion, growth, saturation, and drift terms, alongside stochastic noise to reflect the uncertainties and random fluctuations in AI impacts.The simulation results are visualized in a probability density graph, revealing the likelihood of various outcomes ranging from extinction and regression, to prosperity and technological advancement. The analysis highlights the balanced prospects of human future, with significant probabilities in both positive and negative directions. Positive scenarios suggest potential for increased prosperity and knowledge, emphasizing the importance of effective AI management and international cooperation. Conversely, the notable risks of regression and extinction underline the need for strategic interventions to mitigate adverse impacts. Our findings stress the stochastic nature of future developments and the critical role of adaptive and flexible policies in steering human civilization towards favorable outcomes. This study provides a simple yet comprehensive framework for understanding the complex dynamics at play and underscores the importance of proactive strategies in the age of AI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84fd6520ffe7a9428f265e08705d4319b9534ae3bb556378ce1485e37a3f0e64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
