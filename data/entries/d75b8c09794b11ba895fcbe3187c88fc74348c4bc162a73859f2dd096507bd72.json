{"title":"Research on Corrosion Detection Method of Oil Tank Bottom Based on Acoustic Emission Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0165/v1","date":1712067782000,"content":"This paper presents an acoustic emission (AE) detection method for refined oil storage tanks, enabling online detection of corrosion points and microleakage in the tank floor. The method utilizes an explosion-proof acoustic emission instrument to detect the floor of a refined oil storage tank. By calculating the time difference between the defective acoustic signal and the speed of acoustic wave transmission, a mathematical model is constructed to analyze the detected signals. A technical scheme for acoustic emission detection in storage tanks is designed, and the instru-ment is used to carry out acoustic emission testing on the product oil storage tank floor. Based on these test results, location analysis of acoustic emission sources is conducted on the bottom plate of the tank, evaluating its corrosion condition accurately. The consistency between the evaluation and subsequent open tank tests confirms that using acoustic emission technology effectively captures corrosion signals from product oil storage tank bottoms. Consequently, it significantly improves inspection efficiency by avoiding unnecessary tank-opening operations. Combining this method with open tank inspection operations such as the leakage magnetic method, one can fully grasp the status of the refined oil storage tanks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d75b8c09794b11ba895fcbe3187c88fc74348c4bc162a73859f2dd096507bd72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
