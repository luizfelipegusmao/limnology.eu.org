{"title":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapies and Acute Liver Injury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1317/v1","date":1713506731000,"content":"Drug-induced liver disease represents one of the main problems in the therapeutic field. As with most pathologies, also in this case various risk factors can be recognised, such as age, sex, but also the gut microbiota. Therefore all drugs on the market can, in fact, cause hepatotoxicity of varying degrees. Drugs used in the treatment of IBD can also cause these adverse effects and even lead to DILI. In this review, the various classes of drugs used in the treatment of IBD were taken into consideration and the various adverse effects on the liver were illustrated. In particular, a major role has emerged regarding hepatotoxicity of immunosuppressants. Biological drugs, however, seem to be responsible for these complications to a much lesser extent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"172da2a693438f05b4e78977c54fcf7f5812259db9489bb49f7874a5c6fa37ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
