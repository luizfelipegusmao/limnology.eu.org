{"title":"How Cognition Influences Chinese Residents&rsquo; Continuous Purchasing Intention of Prepared Dishes under the Distributed Cognitive Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1000/v1","date":1721051468000,"content":"Enhancing residents' purchasing intention of prepared dishes is crucial for the sustainable development of the prepared dishes industry. Understanding how residents' cognition influences their purchasing intentions can provide valuable insights for developing and refining industry policies.  Based on the theory of distributed cognition, this study utilizes questionnaire data from urban residents in Beijing and Shanghai, and employs Structural Equation Modeling to explore the influence of cognition on the continuous purchasing intention of Chinese urban residents towards prepared dishes. The study results reveal that: (1) individual and geographical power significantly positively impact on residents' continuous purchasing intentions of prepared dishes, while cultural power perception does not have a significant effect. (2) Risk perception partially mediates the effect of personal and geographical power on continuous purchasing intention and fully mediates the effect of cultural power on continuous purchasing intention. Recommendations include: (1) The government should enhance standardization and supervision to create a favorable consumption environment; (2) Enterprises should provide more objective and transparent information to improve residents' knowledge of prepared dishes and establish a good reputation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bb12527f16b94466e5ab1638d585e6549cf0ea8334a5e020e5d17fb8f388cc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
