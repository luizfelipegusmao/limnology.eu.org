{"title":"Dynamic dissipative control for fuzzy distributed parameter cyber physical system under input quantization and DoS attack","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311215","date":1727964000000,"content":"<p>by Jingzhao Chen, Liming Ding, Tengfei Li</p>\r\n\r\nThis article explores the dissipative control for a class of nonlinear DP-CPS (distributed parameter cyber physical system) within a finite-time interval. By utilizing a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to represent the systemâ€™s nonlinear aspects, the studied system is formulated as a class of fuzzy parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). In order to optimize network resources, both the system state and input signal are subjected to quantization using dynamic quantizers. Subsequently, a dynamic state control strategy is proposed, taking into account potential DoS attack. The finite-time boundedness of the fuzzy parabolic PDE is analyzed, with respect to the influence of quantization, through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional. The article then presents the conditions for finite-time dissipative control design, alongside the adjustment parameters for the dynamic quantizers within the fuzzy closed-loop system. Furthermore, the decoupling of interlinked nonlinear terms in the control design conditions is achieved by using an arbitrary matrix. Finally, an example is provided and the simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the dissipative control method proposed.","author":"Jingzhao Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e8e24b8a74e5ff415479614bdcf34c80e3e05c0139983616bee8122a1619e23b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
