{"title":"Safeguard stewards of biodiversity knowledge | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1749","date":1722517260000,"content":"In their Research Article “The global distribution of plants used by humans” (19 January, p. 293), S. Pironon et al. provide the first global assessment of the distribution and conservation status of 35,687 plants used by people. However, the paper includes no information about the identity of the original holders of this vast biodiversity knowledge. Biodiversity studies must properly recognize Indigenous Peoples and local communities to avoid the misunderstanding and appropriation of Indigenous and local knowledge systems by Western science (1). Scientific practices should be adjusted to safeguard the rights of the diverse stewards of biodiversity knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"5a05d39860877ce0ea67aecfa03f16bd58933f163577d22d2cb1f7c991afbcc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
