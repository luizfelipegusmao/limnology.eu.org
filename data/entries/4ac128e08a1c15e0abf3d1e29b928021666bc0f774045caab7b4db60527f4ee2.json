{"title":"The Practice and Reflection on Rammed Earth Architecture: A Case Study of &quot;Tiles Hill — New Reception Center for the Xiangshan Campus&quot;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0292/v1","date":1728022385000,"content":"This article documents the rammed earth construction practices undertaken by Wang Shu’s team during the “Tiles Hill — New Reception Center for the Xiangshan Campus” project. This building not only embodies the principle of “learning from nature” inherent in traditional vernacular construction but also profoundly interprets the concept of “the craftsmanship way”. Traditional rammed earth techniques represent a sustainable construction method, with a core focus on material composition and building techniques. Through more than a decade of continuous research, the team, combining modern technology, explored how to revive this nearly forgotten vernacular construction method in contemporary architecture. The article further highlights that the recyclability of rammed earth techniques is not only reflected in the reuse of materials but also in the material‘s inherent friendliness and non-destructive nature to the natural environment. This process showcases the fusion of traditional craftsmanship with modern construction technology, as well as the inheritance and innovation of the artisan spirit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ac128e08a1c15e0abf3d1e29b928021666bc0f774045caab7b4db60527f4ee2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
