{"title":"Gradual Loss of UV Tolerance with Increasing Habitat Depths in Deep-Freshwater Amphipods (Amphipoda, Crustacea) of Ancient Lake Baikal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0306/v1","date":1728030961000,"content":"Solar ultraviolet (UV) is among the most important ecological factors shaping the composition of biota on the planet surface, including upper layers of waterbodies. Inhabitants of dark environments recently descending from surface organisms provide natural opportunities to study the evolutionary losses of UV adaptation mechanisms and better understand how those mechanisms function at the biochemical level. Ancient Lake Baikal is the only freshwater reservoir, where deep-water fauna emerged, and its diverse endemic amphipods (Amphipoda, Crustacea) now inhabit the whole range from highly transparent littoral to dark depths of over 1600 m, which makes them a convenient model to study UV adaptation. Here we show that adults of deep-water Baikal amphipods Ommatogammarus flavus and O. albinus indeed have high sensitivity to environmentally relevant UV levels in contrast to littoral species Eulimnogammarus cyaneus and E. verrucosus. The UV intolerance was more pronounced in deeper-dwelling O. albinus and was explainable by lower levels of carotenoids and carotenoid-binding proteins. Signs of oxidative stress were not found but specifically UV-B seemingly led to accumulation of toxic compounds. Overall, the obtained results demonstrate that UV is an important factor limiting distribution of deep-water amphipods into the littoral zone of Lake Baikal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fde797b50be0158adea2703b3bf9ca563469ac3ac3c3ecf866cb6b2daddc94d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
