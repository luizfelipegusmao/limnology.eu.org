{"title":"Polyvinyl Alcohol Coatings Containing Lamellar Solids with Antimicrobial Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1396/v1","date":1716292879000,"content":"The design of an antimicrobial coating materials becomes ideal in order to prevent infections caused by the transmision of pathogens coming from humanâ€™s contact with contaminated surfaces. In that aim layered single hydroxides (LSH) and layered double hydroxides (LDH) containing Zn and Cu, in nitrate form and intercalated with antimicrobial molecules, were synthe-sized and characterized. Cinnamate and salicylate anions were chosen to be intercalated in the fillers because of their well known antimicrobial activity. Several coatings based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and LDH or LSH with increasing amounts of filler were prepared and filmed on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Coatings were characterized and their antimi-crobial activity was evaluated against pathogens critical in nosocomial infections, giving interesting results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a43ddcc756407e70188bc3b4eb6d842deecd3707e38c1cb34390125d433387e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
