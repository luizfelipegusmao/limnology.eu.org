{"title":"163 Impact of feeding wet or dry traditional or fractionated (Solbran) distiller’s grains on feedlot cattle performance and carcass characteristics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/207/7664716?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Solbran (ICM, Colwich, KS) is new corn byproduct of ethanol production composed of fiber plus condensed distiller’s solubles and can be fed dry (Dry Solbran; NDF = 41.1%; C<span>P</span> = 21.84%; Ether extract = 8.4%), or wet (Wet Solbran; NDF = 49.7%; C<span>P</span> = 22.67%; Ether extract = 8.5%). The objective of this study was to evaluate the energy value of dry and wet Solbran compared with traditional dry- (DDGS) and wet- distiller’s grains plus solubles (WGGS) in beef cattle finishing diets. The treatments included a control (CON) with no distiller’s grains compared with the inclusion of DDGS, WDGS, Dry Solbran and Wet Solbran at two levels (20% and 40%) resulting in a 2 × 2 × 2 + 1 factorial. Orthogonal contrasts defined linear and quadratic effects of byproduct inclusion through the common intercept of CON. Additionally, interactions among inclusion (20% or 40%), moisture (dry and wet) and processing method (Solbran or traditional) were evaluated as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial without CON. There was a linear increase in dry matter intake (DMI) by adding DDGS, Dry Solbran, and Wet Solbran (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and a tendency for a linear increase in dry matter intake (DMI) with WDGS (<span>P</span> = 0.07). There was a linear increase in ADG by adding DDGS or Wet Solbran (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and a tendency for a linear increase in average daily gain (ADG) with the addition of Dry Solbran or WDGS (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10). These changes in DMI and ADG resulted in a linear decrease in gain to feed ratio (G:F) when Dry Solbran was added (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), and a tendency towards a linear decrease in G:F when DDGS was added (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10). The inclusion of Wet Solbran or WDGS did not influence G:F (<span>P</span> = 0.45). For the 2 × 2 × 2 factorial, there was a 2-way interaction for moisture by inclusion of byproduct for G:F where wet byproduct fed at 40% of the diet resulted in the greatest G:F and 40% dry byproduct resulted in the least G:F (<span>P</span> = 0.04). This interaction was driven by an increase in DMI for 40% byproduct when fed dry, and a reduction in DMI for both 20 and 40% byproduct fed wet. There was no difference in ADG between the treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.75). For the main effect byproduct type, steers fed Solbran had greater DMI (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) with no difference in ADG (<span>P</span> = 0.79), resulting in a 3% reduction in G:F (<span>P</span> = 0.03) for steers fed Solbran but greater marbling (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Impact of feeding distillers grains byproducts on DMI, ADG, and G:F are impacted by the processes used in the ethanol plant, whether wet or dry, and dietary inclusion.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d908bd8c8c29a93ed1cf59dcaba97a630af652f1ee8717c2c3511b5286a51427","category":"Environment"}
