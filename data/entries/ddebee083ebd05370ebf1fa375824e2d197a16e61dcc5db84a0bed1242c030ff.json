{"title":"The Cycle 46 Configuration of the HARMONIE-AROME Forecast Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1023/v1","date":1720765862000,"content":"The aim of this technical note is to describe the Cycle 46 reference configuration of the HARMONIE-AROME convection-permitting numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. HARMONIE-AROME is a configuration of the shared ALADIN-HIRLAM system, which is developed, maintained, and validated in the ACCORD consortium, a collaboration of 26 countries in Europe and northern Africa on short-range mesoscale NWP. This technical note describes updates to the physical parametrizations, both upper-air and surface, configuration choices such as lateral boundary conditions, model levels, horizontal resolution, model time step and databases associated with the model, such as for physiography and aerosols. An outlook on upcoming developments is also included.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddebee083ebd05370ebf1fa375824e2d197a16e61dcc5db84a0bed1242c030ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
