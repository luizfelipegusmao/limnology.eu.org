{"title":"From Silver Nanoparticle to Thin Films Produced by Pulsed Laser Deposition: Effects of Ar Gas Pressure and Substrate Surface Free Energy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.636/7719621?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Thin films usually grow when doing deposition in vacuum using Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). However, when depositing silver (Ag) on silicon (Si) substrates using PLD in a vacuum, it consistently leads to the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) [<a href=\"#ozae044.636-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.636-B2\">2</a>]. In this study, we performed a systematic investigation of the effect of argon (Ar) gas pressure and substrate surface free energy on the formation of the Ag NPs prepared via PLD. The results show that the Ag NPs can form when the deposition is performed either in vacuum or in Ar with pressure higher than 10<sup>-2</sup> Torr on Si substrate. At an intermediate Ar pressure of 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr, a thin film can form due to lower energy of the Ag atoms upon reaching the substrate surface, as shown in Figure 1. Adding a buffer layer with a similar surface energy to that of Ag (such as a Ni layer) can also result a thin film formation. Additionally, it was observed that the deposition rate of Ag nanoparticles prepared in a vacuum does not correlate with the deposition time. To understand this phenomenon, another Si substrate was placed adjacent to the target to assess whether Ag atoms were rebounding from the substrate as schematized in Figure 2. As a result, a smooth Ag thin film formed on the second substrate (Figure 3b), while the first substrate continued to display only silver nanoparticles (Figure 3a). In conclusion, the formation of Ag NPs in vacuum prepared by PLD is due to a balance of the PLD deposition rate and a sputtering process of the silver deposited by high energetic Ag atoms from the plume [<a href=\"#ozae044.636-B3\">3</a>] in addition to a very different surface free energy of the substrate and the deposited material. Adding Ar gas can decrease the energy of the Ag atoms and thus thin films can be formed. Further increase of the Ar pressure induces more collision between Ag and Ar atoms. As a result, Ag NPs can be formed before they arrive at the substrate [<a href=\"#ozae044.636-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"708d0e294602d458334359502e5c828fb0c7b9cef0f300f1389cea147a06f26c","category":"Environment"}
