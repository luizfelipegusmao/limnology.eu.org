{"title":"Innovation support reduces quiet quitting and improves innovative behavior and innovation outputs among nurses in Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1133/v1","date":1718609557000,"content":"Innovation is a crucial issue in healthcare services since it can affect job-related variables such as productivity, satisfaction and burnout. The aim of our study was to examine the impact of innovation support on quiet quitting, innovative behavior and innovation outputs among nurses. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Greece during April 2024. We employed a convenience sample of nurses. We used the following instruments: (a) the Innovation Support Inventory (ISI) to measure innovation support, (b) the Quiet Quitting Scale (QQS) to measure quiet quitting, (c) the Innovative Behavior Inventory (IBI) to measure innovative behavior, and (d) the Innovation Outputs (IO) scale to measure innovation outputs. Our multivariable analysis identified a negative relationship between innovation support and quiet quitting. Moreover, we found that managerial support and cultural support improved several aspects of innovative behavior, such as idea generation, idea search, idea communication, implementation starting activities, involving others, and overcoming obstacles. Additionally, managerial support improved innovation outputs. Our findings suggested the positive impact of innovation support on quiet quitting, innovative behavior and innovation outputs among nurses. Organizations and nurses’ managers should establish an innovative working environment to improve nurses’ passion, motives and productivity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd591fb1cd9cb22dbff7051b3ddd7d4cd1e04f44c3c0ba0df02bbccf37998a0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
