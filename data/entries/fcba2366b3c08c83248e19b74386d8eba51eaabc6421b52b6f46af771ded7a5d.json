{"title":"NLP-Driven Analysis of Pneumothorax Incidence Following Central Venous Catheter Procedures: A Data-Driven Reevaluation of Routine Imaging in Value-Based Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0740/v1","date":1728548842000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The study outlines the systematic approach taken to develop and apply a robust NLP algorithm to determine the necessity of performing routine imaging after central venous catheter (CVC) placement and removal, based on the incidence of pneumothorax observed. \nMethods: Electronic health records from four university hospitals in Salzburg, Austria, on X-rays performed between 2012 and 2021 following CVC procedures, were analyzed using an NLP al-gorithm. The algorithm detected a pneumothorax in radiologists' reports and clinician requests, while excluding cases with contraindications such as chest injuries, prior pneumothorax, missing data, or unrelated follow-up X-rays. Chi-square tests were used to compare pneumothorax rates between CVC insertion and removal, and multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors, with a focus on age and gender.\nResults: The study analyzed 17,175 cases of patients aged 18 and older, with 95.4% involving CVC insertion and 4.6% involving CVC removal. Pneumothorax was identified in 106 cases after insertion (1.3%) and in 3 cases after removal (0.02%). The Chi-square test showed no statistically significant difference in pneumothorax incidence between insertion and removal (p = 0.4797), in-dicating no substantial difference in pneumothorax risk between these procedures.\nConclusions: Given the lack of significant difference in pneumothorax incidence between CVC insertion and removal, and the established consensus that routine imaging is unnecessary after CVC removal, these findings indicate that routine imaging following CVC insertion may also be unnecessary in asymptomatic patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcba2366b3c08c83248e19b74386d8eba51eaabc6421b52b6f46af771ded7a5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
