Therefore, improving the skinâ€™s ability to form an epidermal barrier and suppressing the production of cytokines that induce type 2 inflammatory responses are important for controlling atopic dermatitis symptoms. (-)-Blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin II inhibitor, has been suggested to improve pulmonary endothelial barrier function and control inflammation by suppressing immune cell migration; however, its efficacy in atopic dermatitis is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether (S)-(-)-blebbistatin O-benzoate, a derivative of (-)-blebbistatin, improves dermatitis symptoms in a mite antigen-induced atopic dermatitis model using NC/Nga mice. The efficacy of the compound was confirmed using dermatitis scores, ear thickness measurements, serum IgE levels, histological analysis of lesions, and filaggrin expression analysis, which is important for barrier function. (S)-(-)-Blebbistatin O-benzoate treatment significantly reduced the dermatitis score and serum IgE levels compared to those in the vehicle group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the histological analysis revealed enhanced filaggrin production and a decreased number of mast cells (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), indicating that (S)-(-)-blebbistatin O-benzoate improved atopic dermatitis symptoms in a pathological model. <i>In vitro</i> analysis using cultured keratinocytes revealed increased expression of filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin, and ceramide production pathway-related genes, suggesting that (S)-(-)-blebbistatin O-benzoate promotes epidermal barrier formation. Furthermore, the effect of (S)-(-)-blebbistatin O-benzoate on type 2 alarmin cytokines, which are secreted from epidermal cells upon scratching or allergen stimulation and are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, was evaluated using antigens derived from mite feces. The results showed that (S)-(-)-blebbistatin O-benzoate inhibited the upregulation of these cytokines. Based on the above, (S)-(-)-blebbistatin O-benzoate has the potential to be developed as an atopic dermatitis treatment option that controls dermatitis symptoms by suppressing inflammation and improving barrier function by acting on multiple aspects of the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.","author":"Shunya Sahara","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d35c277b6cd3babbd0f9becd6ec662cbc27de531e36bc355aefa9ee6364990f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
