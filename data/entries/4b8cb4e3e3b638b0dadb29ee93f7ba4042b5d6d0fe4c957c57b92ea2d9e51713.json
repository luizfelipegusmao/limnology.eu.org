{"title":"Combining Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) and Conventional Scientific Knowledge (CSK) for Exploring Nursery Grounds and Spawning Biology of Yellowtail Catfish Pangasius pangasius in the Meghna River Estuary, Bangladesh","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12746?af=R","date":1728717600000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The yellowtail catfish (<i>Pangasius pangasius</i>) population in Bangladesh is facing imminent threats that led to endangered status. We used conventional scientific knowledge (CSK) and local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers (<i>n</i> = 155) to identify nursery grounds and spawning seasons of yellowtail catfish in the Meghna river estuary. Nineteen nursery grounds were pinpointed using fishers' LEK (confluence/influent zone, current, depth, catch data, and turbidity) and later validated by CPUE data. The peak spawning season was identified in July–September based on GSI (gonadosomatic index) and LEK (58.06% of fishers identified the spawning season). Fecundity (810,980 ± 455,679) and condition factor (0.94–1.52) were quantified with CSK. Using CSK and LEK to delineate nursery grounds and spawning season underscores the value of LEK as a tool for fish population management that deserves policy recommendation and wider application.</p>","author":"Debasish Saha, \nNishita Mojumder, \nShuvagato Mondal, \nMd.
