{"title":"Fiber Speckle Sensing Scheme By Optical Power Filtering: Performance Analysis For Temperature Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1010/v1","date":1710753879000,"content":"This study introduces a Fiber Specklegram Sensor (FSS) design for temperature measurement utilizing a single-multi-single mode optical fiber configuration. FSS technology offers unique advantages for potential development into portable sensing systems. This investigation explores an FSS design compatible with miniaturization by optimizing the interrogation system based on the relationship between speckle grain size and filtering fiber area. Temperature variations are detected through fluctuations in optical power at the sensor output, offering a simple and reduced interrogation scheme. The performance of the FSS is assessed through post-calibration measurements compared to a commercial Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, demonstrating comparable results. These findings pave the way for compact and portable fiber optic temperature sensing systems leveraging FSS advantages while maintaining compatibility with established fiber optic measurements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbbf7af3ad8f036d7f5b47a83ece273135d1ea4d15cbe98cfb27a72556deb9e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
