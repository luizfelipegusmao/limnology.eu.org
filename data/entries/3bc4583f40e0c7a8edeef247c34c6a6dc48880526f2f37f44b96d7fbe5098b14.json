Utilizing a modified antisolvent procedure [<a href=\"#ozae044.646-B1\">1</a>], nanoparticles were synthesized and subjected to meticulous analysis to elucidate their dimensions (Dynamic Light Scattering), surface charge (Î¶-potential), morphology (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and chemical composition (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The obtained results unveiled a nanoparticle size distribution spanning from 120 to 170 nm (Fig. 1), which exhibited a direct correlation with fluctuations in zein concentration. Remarkably, akin to prior research findings [<a href=\"#ozae044.646-B2\">2</a>], [<a href=\"#ozae044.646-B3\">3</a>], the nanoparticles' size and morphology remained notably consistent across varying concentrations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3bc4583f40e0c7a8edeef247c34c6a6dc48880526f2f37f44b96d7fbe5098b14","category":"Environment"}
