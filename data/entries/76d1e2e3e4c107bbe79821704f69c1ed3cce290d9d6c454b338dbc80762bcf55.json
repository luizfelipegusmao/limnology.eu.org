{"title":"Topic Modeling for Faster Literature Screening Using Transformer-Based Embeddings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2198/v1","date":1721996818000,"content":"Systematic reviews represent a powerful instrument to summarize the existing evidence in medical literature. However, articles for a systematic review are hard to identify, and mostly require a structured search of the literature through a number of databases, using keyword-based search strategies, followed by the painstaking manual selection of pieces of evidence that are pertinent to the query. A.I. algorithms may offer solutions to reduce the workload on investigators. We applied BERTopic, a newer and much-recognized transformer-based topic-modeling algorithm, to two datasets of 6137 and 5309 articles of newly published systematic reviews in the area of peri-implantitis and bone regeneration in implant dentistry. In the two datasets, BERTopic identified 14 and 22 clusters, respectively, and it automatically created labels describing the nature of the topics for each individual cluster based on semantic interpretation of their titles. Most themes regarded the query theme, but in both conditions, BERTopic also uncovered articles related to off-themes, which composed around 30% of the datasetâ€”with sensitivity up to 0.79 and specificities of at least 0.99. Our results suggest that adding a topic-modeling step to the screening process could potentially save working hours for researchers involved in systematic reviews of the literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76d1e2e3e4c107bbe79821704f69c1ed3cce290d9d6c454b338dbc80762bcf55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
