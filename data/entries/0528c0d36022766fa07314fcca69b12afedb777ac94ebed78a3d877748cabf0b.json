Bangladesh is one of the largest producers of textile products in the World, and therefore, it is vulnerable to environmental degradation. Bangladesh is predominantly a cotton processing country; therefore, reactive dyes are commonly used, and the dye combination is very water and chemical-intensive. There is a scarcity of information on the consumption of water, textile dyes and the generation of wastewater in the textile sector. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the amount of water use, wastewater generation, and chemical use in textile wet processing units. Therefore, a face-to-face in-depth questionnaire-based survey was conducted in 18 textile wet processing factories, including knit composite, knit dyeing, yarn dyeing, denim dyeing, and knit and yarn dyeing. The average specific groundwater consumption to process 1 Kg of textile materials was 164 L/Kg (SD ~ 81.8); dyehouse water was136 L/Kg (SD ~ 70.6), while corresponding wastewater was 119 L/Kg (SD ~ 73.0). This high consumption of groundwater is directly linked to the depletion of groundwater in the region, where textile industries are situated and also, causes water pollution through wastewater generation. The water used in the dyehouse water was usually soft water and found to be in a range of 68% to 100% that of groundwater extracted. For chemical use, a factory used 449 g of chemicals to process 1 Kg of textile materials, in which the most widely used chemicals were inorganic and basic chemical in nature. However, the chemical use varied from 152 g/Kg to 705 g/Kg of textile production. The total chemical consumption ranged from 954 tons to 4,525 tons a year. More than 50% of the wastewater treatment plants were biological, a quarter of combination and physico-chemical and biological, and the rest were chemical treatment plants in this study. Even though this study may not represent the whole textile wet processing industry of Bangladesh, however, This study provides baseline information on water and chemical consumption and wastewater generation. Our findings would be helpful for policy makers and researchers to identify transformative challenges required at the national level.","author":"Mohammad Abbas Uddin","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"0528c0d36022766fa07314fcca69b12afedb777ac94ebed78a3d877748cabf0b","category":"Environment"}
