{"title":"TOGging up microtubule ends: The plant-specific microtubule minus-end tracking SPR2 has a unique TOG domain","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/803/7491481?rss=1","date":1703203200000,"content":"<span>Cortical microtubule arrays associated with the plasma membrane are crucial for cell shape and intracellular trafficking. They are distinctly arranged in different cell types and dynamically rearranged in response to various internal and external stimuli. Individual microtubules within the arrays exhibit hybrid treadmilling with the minus-ends predominantly pausing or depolymerizing and the plus-ends alternating between polymerizing and depolymerizing phases. Microtubule dynamics are regulated by a variety of microtubule-binding proteins, including stabilizers, destabilizers, capping proteins, and bundlers/cross-linkers. Regulation of microtubule dynamics is especially important at the many free minus-ends of the microtubule arrays and at the new minus-ends generated rapidly by severing during the creation of new microtubule arrays. In animals, proteins belonging to the CAMSAP/Patronin/Nezha family regulate microtubule minus-end dynamics. Plants lack CAMSAP/Patronin/Nezha proteins but instead have SPIRAL2 (SPR2). SPR2 tracks and stabilizes the microtubule minus-ends by reducing the depolymerization rate, thereby facilitating light-induced reorientation of the microtubule arrays (<a href=\"#koad323-B2\">Fan et al. 2018</a>; <a href=\"#koad323-B4\">Leong et al. 2018</a>; <a href=\"#koad323-B6\">Nakamura et al. 2018</a>). However, the structural features of SPR2 that determine its regulatory role at the microtubule minus-end remained unknown.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"667f327eebb2a73bfb897c787683b008cf83f99a4a2ce72fa124a8a2ff64196c","category":"Environment"}
