Most children have an asymptomatic or mild infection. Therefore, the incidence rate of COVID-19 in children might have been underestimated. This study aimed to determine (1) the seroprevalence (and seroconversion rates) of COVID-19, including associated risk factors, in pediatric patients visiting hospitals; and (2) the immunological responses to COVID-19. This was a prospective, cross-sectional study. Patients aged 0–18 years who visited the hospital from September 2020 to February 2022 were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were reviewed. A total of 1,443 pediatric patients were enrolled. Of these, 323 (22.6%) had a history of COVID-19. In the pre-Delta period, the seroprevalence increased from 4.1% to 70.6% in all included patients and from 0.5% to 10% in patients without a known history of COVID-19 compared with the Delta-Omicron period. The seroconversion rate was 6.8% (19 per 100 person-years) in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Risk factors for COVID-19 seropositivity were respiratory symptoms, being in an outpatient department setting, and infection during the Delta-Omicron period. Exposure to household members with confirmed COVID-19 was a risk factor for seropositivity and seroconversion. Infection during the Delta-Omicron period and testing conducted &gt;2 weeks after the onset of symptoms was associated with spike immunoglobulin (Ig) M and spike and nucleocapsid IgG, respectively. High nucleocapsid IgG levels were associated with pneumonia in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Pediatric patients exposed to household members with COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms should be tested for COVID-19. Nucleocapsid IgG can be used as a surrogate marker to identify patients who may have experienced pneumonia from COVID-19 and as a screening tool for the COVID-19 outbreak, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.","author":"Ploy Pattanakitsakul","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cf14a615daf19f677b8e26077cd5b7b58f50cf621b8d0ff7596c1d0d4a357853","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
