{"title":"Development of an Earth Field NMR Spectrometer: Paving the Way for AI-Enhanced Low Field NMR Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1650/v1","date":1721629777000,"content":"Today, it is difficult to have a high-field nuclear magnetic resonance device (NMR) due to the high cost of its acquisition and maintenance. These high-end machines require significant space and specialist personnel for operation and offer exceptional quality in the acquisition, processing, and other advanced functions associated with detected signals. However, alternative devices are low-field nuclear magnetic resonance devices. They benefit from the elimination of high-tech components that generate static magnetic fields and advanced instruments. Instead, they used magnetic fields induced by ordinary conductors. Another category of spectrometers uses the Earth's magnetic field, which is simple and economical, but limited in use. These devices are called Earth Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (EFNMR). This device is ideal for educational purposes, especially for engineers and those who study nuclear magnetic resonance, such as chemistry or other experimental sciences. Students can observe their internal workings and conduct experiments that complement their education without worrying about damaging equipment. This article provides a detailed explanation of the design and construction of electrical technology devices for the excitation of atomic spin resonance using Earth's magnetic fields. Covers all necessary stages, from research to analysis, from simulation, assembly, construction of each component, and the development of comprehensive software for spectrometer control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0dac173b1a82c2b55c42d2a7c6e323dcf92ba0f16520ab0747b8d429b3f478f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
