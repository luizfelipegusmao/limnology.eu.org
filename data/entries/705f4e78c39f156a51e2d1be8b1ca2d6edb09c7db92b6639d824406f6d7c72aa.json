{"title":"Cretaceous chloranthoids: early prominence, extinct diversity and missing links","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/2/225/7643367?rss=1","date":1712707200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>The Chloranthaceae comprise four extant genera (<span>Hedyosmum</span>, <span>Ascarina</span>, <span>Chloranthus</span> and <span>Sarcandra</span>), all with simple flowers. Molecular phylogenetics indicates that the Chloranthaceae diverged very early in angiosperm evolution, although how they are related to eudicots, magnoliids, monocots and <span>Ceratophyllum</span> is uncertain. Fossil pollen similar to that of <span>Ascarina</span> and <span>Hedyosmum</span> has long been recognized in the Early Cretaceous, but over the last four decades evidence of extinct Chloranthaceae based on other types of fossils has expanded dramatically and contributes significantly to understanding the evolution of the family.<div>Scope</div>Studies of fossils from the Cretaceous, especially mesofossils of Early Cretaceous age from Portugal and eastern North America, recognized diverse flowers, fruits, seeds, staminate inflorescences and stamens of extinct chloranthoids. These early chloranthoids include forms related to extant <span>Hedyosmum</span> and also to the <span>Ascarina</span>, <span>Chloranthus</span> and <span>Sarcandra</span> clade. In the Late Cretaceous there are several occurrences of distinctive fossil androecia related to extant <span>Chloranthus</span>. The rich and still expanding Cretaceous record of Chloranthaceae contrasts with a very sparse Cenozoic record, emphasizing that the four extant genera are likely to be relictual, although speciation within the genera might have occurred in relatively recent times. In this study, we describe three new genera of Early Cretaceous chloranthoids and summarize current knowledge on the extinct diversity of the group.<div>Conclusions</div>The evolutionary lineage that includes extant Chloranthaceae is diverse and abundantly represented in Early Cretaceous mesofossil floras that provide some of the earliest evidence of angiosperm reproductive structures. Extinct chloranthoids, some of which are clearly in the Chloranthaceae crown group, fill some of the morphological gaps that currently separate the extant genera, help to illuminate how some of the unusual features of extant Chloranthaceae evolved and suggest that Chloranthaceae are of disproportionate importance for a more refined understanding of ecology and phylogeny of early angiosperm diversification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"705f4e78c39f156a51e2d1be8b1ca2d6edb09c7db92b6639d824406f6d7c72aa","category":"Environment"}
