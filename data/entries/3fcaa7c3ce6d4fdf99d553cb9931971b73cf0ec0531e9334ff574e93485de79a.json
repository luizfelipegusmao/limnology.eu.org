{"title":"Distributions of larvae and juveniles of Pacific saury Cololabis saira during winter in relation to oceanographic structures in the central and western North Pacific Ocean","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12697?af=R","date":1723113562000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>For small pelagic fish, the physical and feeding environments during the larval and juvenile periods significantly affect recruitment to standing stock. To understand the variation in environmental conditions experienced by larvae and juveniles, this study determined the distribution of larval and juvenile Pacific saury <i>Cololabis saira</i> over a distance <b>of</b> more than 6900 km in an east–west direction in relation to the ocean environment in winter. Specimens were collected from the western and central parts of the North Pacific Ocean, mainly in January and February 2018 and 2020. Larvae (≤39.9 mm) were broadly distributed around the Kuroshio Current and the Kuroshio Extension Current. Larval densities in the water masses around the Kuroshio Extension Current were as high as, or even significantly higher than, those around the Kuroshio Current, which is considered the main spawning ground. Most juveniles (≥40.0 mm) were captured north of the Kuroshio Extension Current, where sea surface temperatures were lower and chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations were higher. The generalized additive model analysis also suggested that, compared to larvae, juveniles tended to be distributed in areas with lower sea surface temperatures and in more eastern areas. The extensive distribution of Pacific saury larvae and juveniles indicates that it is necessary to focus not only on the marine environment around the Kuroshio region but also on the Kuroshio Extension region to understand the recruitment variability of this species.</p>","author":"Fuji Taiki, \nMiyamoto Hiroomi, \nAbo Jun‐ichi, \nWatai Mikio","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"3fcaa7c3ce6d4fdf99d553cb9931971b73cf0ec0531e9334ff574e93485de79a","category":"Environment"}
