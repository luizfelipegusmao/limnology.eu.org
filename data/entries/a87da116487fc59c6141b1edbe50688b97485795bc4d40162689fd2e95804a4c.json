{"title":"A Two-Way Street: How Are Yeasts Impacted by Pesticides, and How Can They Help Solve Agrochemical Contamination Problems?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0212/v1","date":1727907115000,"content":"Plant-associated yeasts can also be part of soils’ and pollinating-insects’ microbiomes, where they play significant ecological roles. Indeed, in previous studies, we have shown that yeasts may help pollinators find nectar, which is crucial for their nutrition and for the reproduction of many angiosperms, and, in the soil, can act as plant-growth promoters. Given the importance of yeasts for plant development, in this review, we first delve deep into the biochemical processes behind the ecological role of these microorganisms in soil, insects, and in direct association with plants. Based on this premise, we discuss the influence of this relationship on agricultural production and the possible effects of pesticide use on the yeast microbiota. Finally, we address the most relevant studies in the literature that support the potential of these microorganisms (either indigenous or genetically engineered) as bioremediation agents for soils and foods contaminated by pesticides. Our review indicates that yeasts can be satisfactorily employed in organic agriculture to increase plant growth or bioremediate contaminated soil or food.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a87da116487fc59c6141b1edbe50688b97485795bc4d40162689fd2e95804a4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
