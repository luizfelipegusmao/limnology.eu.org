{"title":"Effects of marine climate variability on the relative abundance of Lutjanus purpureus (POEY, 1866) on the Amazon Continental Shelf","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12662?af=R","date":1707108047000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of climate and marine variability on the catches of <i>Lutjanus purpureus</i> in three sectors of the Amazon Continental Shelf. Remote sensing data were compared with landings (CPUE) between 1997 and 2007 and analyzed for partial influence obtained through the Generalized Additive Model. Additionally, significant variables were analyzed through Wavelet Cross-Spectrum, and periods of high correlation between variables in space and time were identified. The results indicated a high coherence between catch per unit effort (CPUE) and environmental variables on an interannual scale, suggesting that Red Snapper fishing is mainly influenced by the seasonal effects of oceanographic variables. These results suggest that fluctuations in Red Snapper catches between 1997 and 2007 may be the result of natural processes that occur in the Amazon Continental Shelf every year in synergy with environmental variables, which are also indirectly affected by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) pattern.</p>","author":"Diego Gomes Trindade, \nNelson de Almeida de Gouveia, \nNiedja Luana da Costa da Mescouto, \nHanna Tereza Garcia de Sousa Moura, \nUalerson Iran Peixoto da Silva, \nBianca Bentes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"87cda0876781cd19b5e01a02c75ef78e88961c1368d3c52cd11b831bf4eb18af","category":"Environment"}
