{"title":"Detection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) in Breast Cancer Patients from Northeastern Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1024/v1","date":1723646587000,"content":"This study evaluated the presence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) DNA in breast cancer (BC) samples from women in Northeastern Brazil. We analyzed 186 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue block samples using PCR and qPCR to detect HPV and BLV DNA. BLV DNA was not detected in any BC patients. However, HPV DNA was found in 46.2\\% of the BC samples: 44.6\\% were positive for HPV16, 3.5\\% for HPV31, and 2\\% were coinfected with HPV16 and HPV31. Additionally, we found an association between HPV-positive BC and Ki-67 expression (P=0.03, OR=1.85; CI=1.02-3.34), as well as between HPV31-positive BC and mitotic index (P=0.047). Although BLV was not detected in BC patients from Northeastern Brazil, the association between HPV and cell proliferation markers warrants further investigation, as HPV may contribute to the aggressiveness of BC in these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5008598a4a3f2e2b6d3dd4d53a4238a3738254919c883eac50e820caa5d6c6a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
