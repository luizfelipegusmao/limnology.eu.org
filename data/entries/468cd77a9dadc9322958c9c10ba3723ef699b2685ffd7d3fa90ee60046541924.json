{"title":"Analysis of the role of aquatic gases in the formation of sea ice porosity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1851/v1","date":1719390831000,"content":"The porosity of freshwater and sea ice is one of the main parameters that determine its strength. The strength of ice varies over a wide range of values, and the differ-ences in the intensity of the mechanisms of ice porosity formation in different water areas can be one of the possible reasons for these variations. The water mass contains gases in two forms: gases dissolved in the water mass, as well as gas bubbles that are formed when wind waves break up, and bubbles that float up from the seabed. The article presents the results of the analysis of the role of each of these forms in the formation of gas inclusions (pores) into the crystal structure of ice. The estimates showed that the main source of gas pores in ice crystals is the gas bubbles coming to the surface from the bottom, formed during the decomposition of bottom sediments or during gas leaks from near-bottom oil and gas fields. The possibility of gas bubbles occurring and rising to the ice-water boundary depends on the presence of bottom sources of the gases, the intensity of dissolution of the bubbles and the depth of the water area. Therefore, the variation in the porosity and the strength of ice over the space of the water areas can be associated with the changes in their depths, and the presence and location of the natural gas sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"468cd77a9dadc9322958c9c10ba3723ef699b2685ffd7d3fa90ee60046541924","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
