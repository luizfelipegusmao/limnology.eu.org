{"title":"Group Control of the Photo-responsive Colloidal Motors with Structured Light Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0178/v1","date":1712039213000,"content":"Using structured light to drive colloidal motors, due to its advantages of remote manipulation, energy tunability, programmability, and controllability of spatiotemporal distribution, has been attracting much attention in the fields of targeted drug delivery, environmental control, chemical agent detection, and smart device design. Here, we focus on studying the group control of colloidal made from a photo-responsive organic polymer molecule NO-COP (N,O-Covalent organic polymer). These colloidal motors mainly respond to the light intensity patterns. We chose a digital micromirror device (DMD) to modulate the structured light field shining on the sample, by considering its merit of fast refreshing speed, good programmability, and high-power threshold. It is found that under ultraviolet or green light modulation, such colloidal motors exhibit various group behaviors including group diffusion, group patterning, and group migration. The qualitative interpretation is also provided for these observations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac615b33ffa64017308e62980df392d2527b4e1b5968ea90a2cce0e76b88a92d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
