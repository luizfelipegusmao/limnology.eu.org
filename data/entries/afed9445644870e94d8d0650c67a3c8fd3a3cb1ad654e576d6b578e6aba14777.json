{"title":"190 Implementation of an updated beef energetics and body composition model in the Crop Livestock Enterprise Model (CLEM)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/347/7757161?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Crop Livestock Enterprise Model (CLEM) is a whole-farm bioeconomic model designed to simulate and explore ruminant performance across a wide range of production systems and management strategies. The model features a flexible, component-based structure that allows users to simulate multiple types of livestock production within the same system. Animals in the model are represented on an individual basis, allowing users to explore the effects of between-animal variation on a wide range of performance metrics at the animal and farm system levels. Recently, two new features were introduced to improve ability of CLEM to represent ruminant production systems: a user-defined timestep, and a new energetics model (based on the Australian ruminant feeding standards) that adds the ability to model changes in body composition in addition to existing predictions of body weight gain and feed intake. The change in timestep from monthly to daily was required to implement the new energetics model and allows for greater ability to compare CLEM results against field data, but other timesteps (e.g., weekly) can also be used depending on user preference. The Australian ruminant feeding standards were integrated with the existing CLEM modelling framework to create a revised energetics model for CLEM capable of predicting body composition, with additional updates to prediction of relative feed intake and the effect of diet type on feed quality. The energetics model was then evaluated for prediction of feed intake (DMI), final empty body weight (EBW), and fat and protein gain (Table 1) in feedlot cattle. The evaluation dataset consisted of treatment means (n = 29) from studies of Angus or British cross steers whose body composition (fat and protein) had been measured by serial slaughter. The updated model performed well for predicting final EBW, underpredicting by 2.35 kg on average (0.55% of the observed mean). Dry matter intake was underpredicted for 80% of treatments, with mean bias averaging 1.7 kg/d across all treatments and a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE, % of the observed mean) of 25%. Data on fat and protein gain was more variable than for EBW, and the model overpredicted protein gain and underpredicted fat gain in general, with mean bias of -51 g/d (RMSPE 42%) for protein and 270 g/d (RMSPE 58%) for fat. The addition of a daily timestep and a revised energetics model add to utility of CLEM by allowing for more in-depth exploration of the effects of feeding and management over time on intake, body weight gain, and body composition. The current version of CLEM can be downloaded from the APSIM Initiative website; and an upcoming update with additional options for prediction of intake and performance for both feedlot and grazing cattle will be made available.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"afed9445644870e94d8d0650c67a3c8fd3a3cb1ad654e576d6b578e6aba14777","category":"Environment"}
