For instance, determining the contribution of conduction phonon channels to the thermal conductance within a cavity represents an ongoing scientific challenge [<a href=\"#ozae044.071-B1\">1</a>]. Studying the thermal effects on coupled surface phonon requires the use of local spectroscopy probes with nanoscale thermal sensitivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.071-B2\">2</a>]. We will discuss spatially-resolved high energy resolution EELS studies in nanoscale cavities subjected to a thermal gradient. Our work focuses on understanding the role of temperature in the behavior of surface phonon coupling and inelastic electron scattering from phonons.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"409de2c9d28b27d659449e8de746bc6c447d6da37dfa72e11eeb66fea092c0c0","category":"Environment"}
