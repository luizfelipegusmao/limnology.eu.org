{"title":"Effect of different gliadin/glutenin on the oil content of fried dough sticks: insights obtained from macroscopic to microscopic scales","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13840?af=R","date":1724474686000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Fried dough sticks, widely enjoyed in southeast Asia, are made by frying a mixture of wheat flour and water at high-temperature. With the move towards industrial production, there is an increasing demand for healthier versions. Understanding the key properties of fried dough sticks and how the ingredients interact is crucial for meeting these health-focused consumer preferences.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In this study, the connections between the dough's rheological and thermal properties, alongside the interactions between gluten proteins and the oil content in fried dough sticks, were examined and analyzed at varying gliadin to glutenin mass ratios (Gli/Glu). The results indicated that a general decrease in the viscoelastic properties of the dough was associated with an increase in the Gli/Glu ratio. Furthermore, a heightened concentration of gliadin was observed to augment the mass loss of gluten proteins, thereby engendering a spatially sparse network structure. Additionally, this excessive presence of gliadin precipitated the thermal instability within the dough, necessitating an augmented chemical force to preserve the stability of the gluten network structure.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>At the Gli/Glu ratio of 5:5, the gluten protein exhibited enhanced thermal stability and minimal mass loss. At this specific ratio, the gluten network was characterized by a comparatively high prevalence of extended gluten films and short-chain structures, which resulted in the production of fried dough sticks possessing minimal structural oil content. The study provided a theoretical basis for identifying the Gli/Glu ratio as an effective approach to modulate the oil content in fried dough sticks.
