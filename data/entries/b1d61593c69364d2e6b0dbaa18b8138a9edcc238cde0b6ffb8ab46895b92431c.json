{"title":"Fractional Boundary Element Solution for Nonlinear Nonlocal Thermoelastic Problems of Anisotropic Fibrous Polymer Nanomaterials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1644/v1","date":1714272977000,"content":"Nonlocal theories are gaining prominence because they can solve problems which lead to unphysical conclusions in standard models. This study presents a novel fractional boundary element method (BEM) solution for nonlinear nonlocal thermoelastic problems of anisotropic fibrous polymer nanomaterials. This broad BEM solution combines two solutions: anisotropic fibrous polymer nanomaterials problem solution and nonlinear nonlocal thermoelasticity problem solution. The nonlinear nonlocal thermoelasticity problem solution divides the displacement field into complementary component and particular component. The overall displacement is generated using the boundary element technique, which is the solution to a Navier type problem, while the particular displacement is derived using local radial point. The New Modified Shift-Splitting (NMSS) approach, which reduces memory and processing time requirements, was used to solve linear systems created by BEM. Figures demonstrate the numerical findings, which show the effects of fractional and graded parameters on the thermal stresses of nonlinear nonlocal thermoelastic problems of anisotropic fibrous polymer nanomaterials. The numerical results indicate the consistency and efficiency of the proposed methodology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1d61593c69364d2e6b0dbaa18b8138a9edcc238cde0b6ffb8ab46895b92431c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
