{"title":"Superparamagnetic Graphene&ndash;Based Anticancer Drug Carrier for Targeted Drug Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0593/v1","date":1723099280000,"content":"A superparamagnetic graphene oxide based drug carrier Fe3O4@SiO2/N–rGO was prepared through surface modification, material doping, and composite methods. This carrier has a large number of active sites, suitable for loading anticancer drugs, It can increase the drug load. Currently, the widely used drug in clinical use is epirubicin hydrochloride (EPI). The graphene based complex has a pH sensitive property and exhibits a pH sensitive property at pH=4.3. The release efficiency (RE) is 77.4%, making it suitable for drug release in cancerous acidic liquids. The physicochemical properties of drug carriers were studied using X–ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical signals confirm that the anticancer drug EPI acts on the graphene plane through hydrogen bond interactions and π – π stacking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb4ac6485fda12f8923cbaf0f426657386ae4d9d6f9f8054b023fb1d2f2704a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
