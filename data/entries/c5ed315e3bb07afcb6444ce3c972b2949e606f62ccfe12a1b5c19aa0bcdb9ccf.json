{"title":"The Leaky-Wave Perspective for Array-Fed Planar Antennas: Principles, Design Criteria and Recent Developments for Advanced Radiating Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1655/v1","date":1719224764000,"content":"Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) represent a recent class of radiating systems, first appeared in the second half of the past century. Initially treated with a certain dose of skepticism due to the apparent non-physical nature of supported wave solutions, LWAs have so far deeply evolved from the original configuration of slotted metallic lossy waveguide and adapted to a huge number of practical application fields, from microwave to millimeter waves and even up to the terahertz frequency range. Due to physics of relevant working principle, LWAs are often found in planar and low-profile configurations, being critically required in many cutting-edge applications, where device miniaturization, scaling and integration are required. Here we propose a review of some of the most recent and perspective array-fed 2-D LWAs, selecting two of most widespread categories in applications, Fabry–Perot Cavity Antennas (FPCAs) and Bull’s-Eye Antennas (BEAs), discussing and illustrating some advanced features recently proposed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5ed315e3bb07afcb6444ce3c972b2949e606f62ccfe12a1b5c19aa0bcdb9ccf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
