{"title":"Aberrant accumulation of ceramides in mitochondria triggers cell death by inducing autophagy in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1314/7465195?rss=1","date":1702080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sphingolipids are membrane lipids and play critical roles in signal transduction. Ceramides are central components of sphingolipid metabolism that are involved in cell death. However, the mechanism of ceramides regulating cell death in plants remains unclear. Here, we found that ceramides accumulated in mitochondria of <span>accelerated cell death 5</span> mutant (<span>acd5</span>), and expression of mitochondrion-localized ceramide kinase (ACD5) suppressed mitochondrial ceramide accumulation and the <span>acd5</span> cell death phenotype. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we observed hyperaccumulation of ceramides in <span>acer acd5</span> double mutants, which are characterized by mutations in both <span>ACER</span> (alkaline ceramidase) and <span>ACD5</span> genes. The results confirmed that plants with specific ceramide accumulation exhibited localization of ceramides to mitochondria, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, when compared with the wild type, autophagy-deficient mutants showed stronger resistance to ceramide-induced cell death. Lipid profiling analysis demonstrated that plants with ceramide accumulation exhibited a significant increase in phosphatidylethanolamine levels. Furthermore, exogenous ceramide treatment or endogenous ceramide accumulation induces autophagy. When exposed to exogenous ceramides, an increase in the level of the autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like protein, ATG8e, associated with mitochondria, where it directly bound to ceramides. Taken together, we propose that the accumulation of ceramides in mitochondria can induce cell death by regulating autophagy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"201fd8c0ef1a53b6c4c0e4f87190b638513b5831e9c4ade09dd427b8fd40353a","category":"Environment"}
