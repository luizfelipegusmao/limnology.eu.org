Then the optimization parameters and scope were determined, and multi-objective optimization and direction preference algorithms were introduced. A chaotic optical performance optimization model based on improved multi-objective genetic algorithm was constructed using adaptive functions as evaluation indicators. These results confirmed that the larger the bandwidth of the controller, the faster the response speed of the resonant converter, but the stability was poor. When the input voltage underwent a sudden change, the current ripple coefficient of the PID algorithm was 0.55%. The linear active disturbance rejection control algorithm could ensure that the voltage and current maintained at the set values, and the output current of the algorithm was more stable when the load underwent sudden changes. The directional preference algorithm could further provide more valuable solutions on the basis of adaptive genetic algorithms. When the peak value of the autocorrelation function was equal to 0.2, the delay characteristics of chaotic light were effectively suppressed, having strong signal bandwidth and complexity. In summary, the constructed model has good application effects in optimizing chaotic optical performance and has certain positive significance for communication security.","author":"Jian Kong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3dbbf6c7894af7021524e9ddbaa4e4cd047bfb00eca9078a8a56671cca9539e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
