{"title":"Effects of Soil Compaction Stress Combined with Drought on Soil Pore Structure, Root System Development, and Maize Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2455/v1","date":1727746861000,"content":"Soil compaction is a major environmental stress to root development and plant growth. Meanwhile, drought always results in increasing soil mechanical impedance, which in turn aggravates soil compaction stress. In this study, a column experiment with three levels of compaction stress (low, moderate, and severe, respectively) and two levels of soil water content (well-watered and drought, respectively) was established to investigate the effects of soil compaction combined with drought on soil pore structure, root development and maize growth properties. Results showed that soil compaction combined with soil water stress significantly affected the characteristics of soil pore structure. With the increase of soil compaction, the porosity, larger pores (&gt; 500 μm), and the maximum pore diameter significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) regardless of soil water status. Additionally, pore morphology and network parameters were also deteriorated under soil compaction with drought conditions. Soil compaction substantially affected root length, root volume, root surface area and root average diameter in the whole profile (p &lt; 0.05). Compared to well-watered conditions, the effects of soil compaction on root characteristics under drought conditions was more obvious, which indicated that appropriate soil water content could alleviate compaction stress. Aboveground biomass and plant height showed a consistent trend with root traits under soil compaction stress regardless of water status. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations between most soil pore parameters and maize growth traits. In addition, soil compaction showed a significant effect on stomatal conductance and transpiration rate while soil water showed a significant effect on SPAD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7c689449f443d3f81d04891222e50b6cc2a4828fc9484bf5eb2b5942c2e8176","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
