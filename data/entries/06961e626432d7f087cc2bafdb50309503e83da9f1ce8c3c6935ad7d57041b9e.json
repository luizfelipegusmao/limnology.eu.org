{"title":"On the Received View vs. the Alternative View Controversy about Quantum (Non)individuality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1600/v1","date":1726812805000,"content":"Some philosophers of physics have addressed criticisms of the so-called Received View (RV) of non-individual quantum objects, also called the orthodox view. Dennis Dieks made a very good resume of these criticisms in [1] and Tomasz Bigaj in [2] has a more detailed account. In considering (mainly) these works and with some additional mentions, we hope to dissipate some misunderstandings about the RV and clarify what is happening with such a view. According to Dieks, the RV doesnâ€™t fit the practice of physics since in some situations the physicist assumes that quantum objects can be treated individually, imitating standard objects (individuals) of classical physics. Dieks also proposes an Alternative View (AV), generally called the heterodox view, which would give a view of the fundamental ontology of quantum physics and which would be more by the way physicists usually proceed. In my view, the AV cannot be viewed as the fundamental ontological theory despite being suitable for practical purposes. Furthermore, we think that it does not conflate the RV, but is complementary to it, substituting it when quantum objects are sufficiently apart and can be treated in conformity with the classical way. From our point of view, in the practice of physics, we can adopt AV. Still, the RV is more adequate when we are looking for logical and foundational analyses, at least when the supposed metaphysics comprises non-individuals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06961e626432d7f087cc2bafdb50309503e83da9f1ce8c3c6935ad7d57041b9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
