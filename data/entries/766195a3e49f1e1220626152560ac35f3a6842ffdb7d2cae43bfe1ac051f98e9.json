{"title":"Relationship between Countries Savings and Economic Growth: A Case of South Africa (1970 -2022)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0555/v1","date":1718007334000,"content":"The savings behavior of individuals has been a topic of both macroeconomic and policy importance throughout history. Theoretical and empirical research offers strong evidence that savings are the result of a number of demographic and economic factors working together to produce long-term, sustainable economic growth. This study therefore looked at how domestic savings affected South Africa's economic growth between 1970 and 2022. The ARDL framework was used to analyze data that came from the World Bank and the South African Reserve Bank. The results of the study demonstrate that corporate savings have a major effect on economic growth, especially over the long term. When corporate savings rise by 1%, the economy expands by 3.12%. On the other hand, savings by the government and the general public, especially in the long run, have no appreciable impact on economic growth. Given that domestic savings mobilization is the most suitable channel for financing capital accumulation to support economic growth and development, the study suggests reviewing current policies to encourage domestic savings mobilization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"766195a3e49f1e1220626152560ac35f3a6842ffdb7d2cae43bfe1ac051f98e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
