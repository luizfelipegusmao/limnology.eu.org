{"title":"Beyond the Objects of Barniz de Pasto mopa-mopa: Artisans and Harvesters in the 21st Century","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1919/v1","date":1719479178000,"content":"Abstract: This article intends to highlight and reconstruct the relationships between humans (harvesters, woodworkers and master artisans) and non-humans (raw materials, tools, places, products, etc.) in the Barniz de Pasto mopa-mopa tradition.1 These are relationships that were lost when the focus came to be primarily on the objects, as happens in most popular art forms world-wide. The text is organised in the form of ethnographic overviews: the home-workshops of the masters of Barniz de Pasto; the workshops of the woodworkers; the montañas-selvas (Andean rain-forest highlands or mountain jungle) and the mopa-mopa harvesters; and the works (objects, products, goods). Unlike a conventional article, it does not end with firm and immutable conclu-sions. Rather, the reflections resulting from ten years of accompanying artisans and harvesters during the process of patrimonialización 2 of the mopa-mopa are to be found in each of the sections, always open for discussion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba6473c3221e5d1f876c5e957f9dcee9ea4039968fb8137f5587b623ad096cba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
