{"title":"Positive perceptions and memories of invasive Acacia species in central Chile coupled with high willingness for its control","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10530-024-03415-1","date":1730419200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Invasive species pose a significant threat to biodiversity, particularly when local communities view them positively, presenting a key challenge for effective control. <em>Acacia</em> trees, native to Australia, have been introduced in various regions worldwide, including Chile. Our study focuses on the geographical distribution, perceptions, memories, and willingness to control <em>Acacia</em> species, especially <em>dealbata</em> and <em>A. melanoxylon,</em> in a basin in Central Chile. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images captured during the tree’s flowering season were employed to analyse the species’ distribution. We conducted an open survey with 81 participants to gauge the community’s perceptions and memories of these tree species. A binomial model was constructed, incorporating social and geographic variables, and analyses were conducted to assess the significance of memories. We found in the basin 613.200 hectares of <em>Acacia</em>, constituting 1.7% of the analysed basin<em>.</em> 59 sentences of expressing memories were analyzed; most of them were positive towards <em>Acacia</em>. 45.68% of interviewed believed that <em>Acacia</em> is a native tree, and 35.8% recognized it as a harmful species. Despite 72.84% considering <em>Acacia</em> a useful tree, 60.49% expressed a willingness to limit its expansion. Counterintuitively, the willingness to control the species was positively correlated with its use. The use of <em>Acacia</em> also proved positive interaction with the perception that it is expanding and is harmful. Younger and moderately educated participants exhibited more interest in controlling <em>Acacia</em> trees, and older participants when these variables interacted with their use. We interpret these results as an indication that individuals with greater knowledge of <em>Acacia</em> possess increased awareness of the importance of limiting its expansion. Furthermore, perceptions appear to transition from positive in childhood and youth to negative in adult life. We conclude that the current juncture is opportune for initiating <em>Acacia</em> control measures.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"01cfda020392a4d4b538302f25569bfe605472e64312d1bfbd51fc1d90c1283d","category":"Environment"}
