{"title":"Air Traffic Controllers&rsquo; Rostering: Sleep Quality, Vigilance, Mental Workload, and Boredom: A Report of Two Case Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1120/v1","date":1715925587000,"content":"Fatigue is a recognized concern in air traffic management, prompting international bodies like ICAO and EASA to advocate for Fatigue Risk Management Systems (FRMS). EU Regulation 2017/373, effective since January 2020, imposes specific requirements on air traffic service providers regarding controllers' fatigue, stress, and rostering systems, as part of safety management protocols. Despite active campaigns promoting fatigue awareness in air traffic control (ATC), there remains a need for standardized operational requirements. Eurocontrol recently published \"Guidelines on fatigue management in ATC rostering systems\" (April 23), aiming to facilitate the adoption of common fatigue operational standards. However, neither EU Regulation 2017/373 nor existing documentation specifies exact rostering criteria. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) typically derive these criteria from scientific literature, best practices, historical data, and legal and operational necessities. Yet, assessing and monitoring fatigue in operational settings can be complex and require long-term studies due to its multifaceted nature, spanning factors such as sleep quality, circadian rhythms, psychosocial influences, individual traits, and environmental conditions. The case studies reported in this paper represent an attempt to create an evidence-based protocol for fatigue risk monitoring in ATC operations, utilizing a non-invasive approach and collecting multidimensional data. The two case studies involved en-route and tower controllers from different ATC Centers, and the results underscore the importance of fatigue assessment in ATC and elucidates challenges in implementing fatigue monitoring within operational contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91dce2098dbc62157a6f261797f87f28ba68217dc0ada18f27e5b51d8f2f9aaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
