One possible solution is to incorporate hydrogen traps into steel microstructures, and hydrogen trapping capacity plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of this approach. Theoretical models have indicated that carbon vacancies in metal carbide precipitates are effective hydrogen traps for ferritic steels, compared to typical structural defect traps like dislocations and iron lattice vacancies, which have low trapping energies and a debatable influence on hydrogen embrittlement resistance. To this end, increasing the number of carbon vacancies in individual metal carbides is important since the overall hydrogen trapping capacity can be largely leveraged by introducing abundant metal carbides in steels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4f5cff01b844ec5bfd60ad5433fe7f30033304da366f7673743cc6ebfa9ebd8a","category":"Environment"}
