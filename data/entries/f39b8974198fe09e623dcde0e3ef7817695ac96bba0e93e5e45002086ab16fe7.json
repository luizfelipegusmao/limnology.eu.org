This optimized hardware-based strategy enables electron counting at a rate of more than one billion electrons per second—dramatically faster than any other large-format camera in electron microscopy—enabling high-resolution cryo-EM across a wide range of imaging conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.845-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f39b8974198fe09e623dcde0e3ef7817695ac96bba0e93e5e45002086ab16fe7","category":"Environment"}
