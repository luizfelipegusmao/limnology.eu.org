{"title":"Nephrectomy Due to Non-Functional Kidney Caused by Ureteral Calculus: a Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1369/v1","date":1721196711000,"content":"This case report details a 34-year-old male with asymptomatic ureteral calculus leading to non-functional kidney and subsequent nephrectomy. Initially diagnosed with left hydronephrosis and ureteral obstruction, nephrostomy treatment showed no kidney function improvement. Enhanced CT confirmed left ureteral calculus and hydronephrosis. After preoperative assessment and one month post-nephrostomy, robotic-assisted left nephrectomy was performed. Postoperative recovery was successful, with slight improvement in biochemical renal function. This report underscores the importance of early diagnosis and intervention of obstructive stones and the necessity of regular urinary system checks to prevent kidney function deterioration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5f0bc349dd8e91f315e10d88bb357f222284d96866fa58370e45b461e29d94b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
