{"title":"Information in the Three Dimensions of Time","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0130/v1","date":1712036328000,"content":"The relationship between physics and information processing is a topic of great significance in the realm of science and technology. The laws of physics, which govern the behavior of matter and energy, also have a profound influence on the way information is processed and utilized. While the mathematics governing information processing has not extensively utilized the laws of physics, it is evident that there is potential for these laws to play a more significant role, particularly in the context of quantum systems. based on the equivalence between information and energy, we can explore how other laws of physics can effectively contribute to more efficient and advanced information processing techniques. This research sheds light on the interconnectedness of physics and information processing, and its findings have the potential to significantly enhance our ability to process information, particularly in cutting-edge quantum systems. By recognizing and leveraging the influence of physics, we can pave the way for further advancements in information processing technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"305402d0c828274f482e4b58a0a8f17dfc7d82e49e37aa76cc02e7db121db4de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
