{"title":"A New Retrieval Algorithm of Fractional Snow over the Tibetan plateau Derived from AVH09C1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1802/v1","date":1716865013000,"content":"Snow cover products are primarily derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) datasets. MODIS achieves both snow/non-snow discrimination and snow cover fractional retrieval, while early AVHRR-based snow cover products only focused on snow/non-snow discrimination. The AVHRR Climate Data Record (AVHRR -CDR) provides a nearly 40-year global dataset that has a potential to fill a gap in long term snow cover fractional monitoring. Our study selects the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as the experimental area, utilizing AVHRR-CDR surface reflectance data (AVH09C1) and calibrating with MODIS snow product MOD10A1. The snow cover percentage retrieval from the AVHRR dataset is performed using Surface reflectance at 0.64μm (SR1) and Surface reflectance at 0.86μm (SR2), along with a simulated Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) model. Also, in order to detect the effects of land cover type and topography on snow inversion, we tested the accuracy of the algorithm with and without these influences, respectively (vanilla algorithm &amp; improved algorithm). The accuracy of the AVHRR snow cover percentage data product is evaluated using MOD10A1、 ground snow-depth measurements and ERA5. Results indicate that the logic model based on NDSI has the best fitting effect, with R-square and RMSE values of 0.83 and 0.10, respectively. Meanwhile, the accuracy was improved after taking into account the effects of land cover type and topography. The model is validated using MOD10A1 snow-covered areas, showing snow cover area differences of less than 4% across 6 temporal phases. Improved algorithm results in better consistency with MOD10A1 than vanilla algorithm. Moreover, the RMSE reaches greater levels when the elevation is below 2,000 meters or above 6,000 meters, and is lower when the slope is between 16° and 20°. Using ground snow-depth measurements as ground truth, the multi-year recall rates are mostly above 0.7, with an average recall rate of 0.81. Results also show a high degree of consistency with ERA5. The validation results demonstrate that the AVHRR snow cover percentage remote sensing product proposed in this study exhibits high accuracy in the Tibetan Plateau region, also demonstrating that land cover type and topographic factors are important to the algorithm. Our study lays the foundation for the global snow cover percentage product based on AVHRR-CDR，furthermore lays a basic work for generating a long-term AVHRR-MODIS fractional snow cover dataset.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a05a74836219ea753c5859454c785d0b9c6fd1795085a5874a4ad95efb89222","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
