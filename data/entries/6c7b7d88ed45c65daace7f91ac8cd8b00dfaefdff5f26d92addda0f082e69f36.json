This study aimed at decolourizing the ethanolic extracts of sugar beet leaves using a UV-A treatment (390 nm).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Exposure of the phenolic extracts to 30 UV-A LEDs at 8.64 J m<sup>−2</sup> radiation dose decreased the total chlorophyll content by 69.23% and reduced the greenness parameter (−<i>a</i>*) significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) from 27.33 ± 0.32 to 8.64 ± 0.16. Additionally, UV-A treatment increased the content of most individual phenolic compounds (e.g. gallic acid, ferulic acid, etc.) significantly, resulting in an increase in the overall phenolic content in the extracts from 900.56 ± 14.11 μg g<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight (FW) to a maximum of 975.09 ± 9.62 μg g<sup>−1</sup> FW at 0.67 J m<sup>−2</sup>. However, rutin content had a significant decrease at the highest radiation dose (8.64 J m<sup>−2</sup>). The soluble sugar content (i.e. glucose and fructose) increased simultaneously with phenolic compounds after the UV-A treatment. Although the UV treatment reduced the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, it had no significant effect on the ferrous chelating activity and the extract's ability to delay lipid oxidation in corn oil. The antioxidant activity index of the treated extract was comparable to that of butylated hydroxytoluene, a synthetic antioxidant.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Key findings of this study include successful decolourization of the extract, decomposition of bound polyphenols to their free form, and maintaining the antioxidant activity of the extract in the oil system after UV-A exposure. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Peyman Ebrahimi, \nLuziana Hoxha, \nDasha Mihaylova, \nMarino Nicoletto, \nAnna Lante","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6c7b7d88ed45c65daace7f91ac8cd8b00dfaefdff5f26d92addda0f082e69f36","category":"Environment"}
