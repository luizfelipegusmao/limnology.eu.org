{"title":"Oral responsive delivery systems for probiotics targeting the intestinal tract","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13938?af=R","date":1729305601000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The increasing prevalence of health issues, driven by sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets in modern society, has led to a growing demand for natural dietary supplements to support overall health and well-being. Probiotic dietary supplements have garnered widespread recognition for their potential health benefits. However, their efficacy is often hindered by the hostile conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. To surmount this challenge, biomaterial-based microencapsulation techniques have been extensively employed to shield probiotics from the harsh environments of stomach acid and bile salts, facilitating their precise delivery to the colon for optimal nutritional effects. With consideration of the distinctive gastrointestinal tract milieu, probiotic delivery systems have been categorized into pH-responsive release, enzyme-responsive release, redox-responsive release and pressure-triggered release systems. These responsive delivery systems have not only demonstrated improved probiotic survival rates in the stomach, but also successful release in the intestines, facilitating enhanced adhesion and colonization of probiotics within the gut. Consequently, these responsive delivery systems contribute to the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation in intervening with gastrointestinal diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse oral responsive delivery systems tailored for probiotics targeting the intestinal tract. Furthermore, the review critically examines the limitations and future prospects of these approaches. This review offers valuable guidance for the effective delivery of probiotics to the intestinal tract, enhancing the potential of probiotics as dietary supplements to promote gastrointestinal health and well-being.
