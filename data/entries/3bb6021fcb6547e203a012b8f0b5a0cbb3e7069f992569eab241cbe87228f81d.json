{"title":"Assessing the impacts of urbanization and climate change on urban drainage system","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.83?af=R","date":1713262465000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Urban flooding is one of the significant issues that many cities are dealing with to ensure sustainable development. Upgrading the drainage systems is a standard measure that engineers have often used to reduce the risk of flooding. Because of climate change and urbanization, stormwater management systems may be inadequate to convey generated overflow in their catchment, which results in severe flooding in many cities worldwide. This research investigates climate change and urbanization's influence on urban flooding by simulating the EPA Stormwater Management Model for drainage systems in an urban catchment in An Ha, Tam Ky, Quang Nam. The results showed that urbanization shortens the initial abstraction ability while climate change increases extreme rainfall and water levels of receiving sources. Additionally, the impacts are even more substantial when the high urbanization rate increases by more than 70%, together with climate change.</p>","author":"Hoang Nghia Le, \nDuc‚ÄêPhuoc Vo, \nQuang Dinh Nguyen, \nBinh Quang Nguyen, \nChi Cong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"3bb6021fcb6547e203a012b8f0b5a0cbb3e7069f992569eab241cbe87228f81d","category":"Environment"}
