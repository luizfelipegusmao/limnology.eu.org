Aluminum matrix composites (AMCs) reinforced with carbon have garnered significant interest because of their low density and impressive mechanical characteristics (Prieto et al., 2008). GraphiteÂ´s (Gr) unique attributes, including a low thermal expansion coefficient and high thermal conductivity, make it an ideal choice for reinforcement (Moghadam et al., 2014). Consequently, aluminum-graphite composites demonstrate enhanced properties such as reduced density, increased strength, and improved toughness. There are many techniques to sinter the obtained powders by HEBM; however, conventional methods promote grain growth due to the high temperature and sintering time, which negatively modifies their mechanical response (Kubota et al., 2010). In recent years, there has been a development and widespread adoption of the high-frequency induction heating technique for sintering nanostructured materials; this approach offers enhanced control over grain growth while the sintering process occurs (Xue et al., 2023).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"52d3374c1afa7bcc8c957ae3af17bb04b294173324cd196c9ccd772de7970e02","category":"Environment"}
