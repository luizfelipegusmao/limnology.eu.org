{"title":"Zero-Day Exploits in Cybersecurity: Case Studies and Countermeasure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2338/v1","date":1722263305000,"content":"Zero-day threats are a more severe and constantly developing menace to various participants including large companies, government offices, and educational establishments. These entities may contain valuable information and essential operations that attract cyber attackers. These exploits are especially devastating as they target weaknesses that an organization’s vendors are not even aware of, making them have no protection against them. This paper focuses on the background and use of zero-day exploitation and the structure and technologies of these complex malware attacks. We examine two notable real-life cases: the case of ‘HAFNIUM targeting Exchange Servers with zero-day exploits’ that was investigated by Microsoft 365 Security and Microsoft Threat Intelligence, and the ‘Log4j vulnerability’ case that was reported by the National Cyber Security Centre. These cases show the critical effects of zero-day vulnerabilities and measures taken to combat them. Additionally, this paper outlines different strategies that can be used to prevent zero-day attacks with the help of modern technologies. These are fast patch release, effective IDS/IPS, and a security model that involves constant vigilance and use of behavioral analytics. Thus, by studying the lifecycle of zero-day vulnerabilities and the structure of the exploits, one can enhance the protection of the organization against the threats that are invisible to traditional security systems. This extensive survey is designed to be useful in understanding the characteristics of zero-day vulnerabilities, the technologies for their mitigation, and the constant threat and development in the field of cybersecurity. Thus, it is possible to strengthen the protection against these threats that are constant and develop with time by analyzing the previous events and predicting potential problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a8bbbbfe25ae56730b08bb117ecee209d0f670fd084c3b2d3bdfa1707d5f852","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
