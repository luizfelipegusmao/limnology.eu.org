{"title":"From Food Supplements to Functional Foods: Emerging Perspectives on Post-Exercise Recovery Nutrition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1811/v1","date":1729677286000,"content":"Post-exercise recovery is fundamental to optimizing athletic performance, focusing on muscle repair, glycogen replenishment, rehydration, and reducing exercise-induced inflammation. This review examines the evolving landscape of recovery nutrition, highlighting the transition from conventional supplements—such as protein, carbohydrates, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)—to functional foods rich in bioactive compounds. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of functional foods like tart cherry juice, turmeric, and omega-3 fatty acids in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, thus accelerating recovery. Additionally, probiotics and prebiotic-rich foods are gaining recognition for enhancing gut health, promoting nutrient absorption, and strengthening immune function, which are crucial in recovery processes. The concept of personalized nutrition, guided by genetic and metabolic profiling, is explored as a promising approach to tailor recovery strategies to individual physiological needs. Continued research into the long-term effects of supplements, the role of functional foods, and nutrient interactions is essential for developing more comprehensive and individualized recovery protocols. Integrating functional foods with personalized nutrition offers a holistic strategy to enhance recovery, optimize performance, and promote long-term health in athletes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9af32898a06b8f7d2e22657f91982a2d208b34b6435063d84a45db076a0ccf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
