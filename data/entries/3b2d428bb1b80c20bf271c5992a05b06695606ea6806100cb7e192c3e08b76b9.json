{"title":"Probability Bracket Notation for Probability Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1399/v1","date":1713777381000,"content":"Following Dirac’s notation in Quantum Mechanics (QM), we propose the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), by defining a probability-bra (P-bra), P-ket, P-bracket, P-identity, etc…Using the PBN, many formulas, such as normalizations and expectations in systems of one or more random variables, can now be written in abstract basis-independent expressions, easy to expand by inserting a proper P-identity. The time evolution of homogeneous Markov processes can also be formatted in such a way. Our system P-kets are identified with probability vectors and our P-bra system is comparable with Doi’s state function or Peliti’s standard bra. In the Heisenberg picture of the PBN, a random variable becomes a stochastic process, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations are obtained by inserting a time-dependent P-identity. Also, some QM expressions in Dirac notation are naturally transformed to probability expressions in PBN by a special Wick rotation. Potential Applications show the usefulness of the PBN beyond the constrained domain and range of Hermitian operators on Hilbert Spaces in QM all the way to IT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b2d428bb1b80c20bf271c5992a05b06695606ea6806100cb7e192c3e08b76b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
