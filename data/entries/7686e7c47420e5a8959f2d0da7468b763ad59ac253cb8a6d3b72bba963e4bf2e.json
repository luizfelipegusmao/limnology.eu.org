{"title":"Soil phosphorus fractionations as affected by cropping systems in the central mid-hills region of Nepal","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307139","date":1727186400000,"content":"<p>by Dinesh Khadka, Keshab Raj Pande, Bhaba Prasad Tripathi, Roshan Man Bajracharya</p>\r\n\r\nSoil plays a critical role as the primary reservoir of phosphorus (P) in terrestrial ecosystems. Sequential fractionation has been extensively utilized to gain insights into the characteristics and dynamics of soil P. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the different P pools in Nepalese soils. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of cropping systems on soil P fractions in the central mid-hills of Nepal. The study focused on four cropping systems: vegetable, fruit, rice, and maize-based systems, which exhibited variations in nutrient management, topography, and cropping intensity. A total of 240 soil samples (60 samples from each cropping system) were collected from multiple sites within the central mid-hill region. Standard analytical methods were used to determine the general parameters of the soils, while the sequential fractionation method was employed to assess the organic and inorganic P pools. The results indicated that the effect of cropping systems on soil pH, calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) content, and the proportion of sand, silt, and clay was not statistically significant in terms of general parameters. However, significant differences were observed among the different cropping systems in organic matter (OM), electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and available phosphorus. Similarly, in terms of inorganic phosphorus fractions, loosely bound P (LB-P), aluminum bound P (Al-P), iron bound P (Fe-P), and reductant soluble P (RS-P) were significantly affected, while calcium bound P (Ca-P) did not show a significant difference. Furthermore, in terms of organic phosphorus fractions, labile organic P (L-Po), fluvic acid organic P (FA-Po), and non-labile organic P (NL-Po) exhibited significant differences, whereas moderately labile organic P (ML-Po) and humic acid organic P (HA-Po) did not show a significant difference. Additionally, reductant soluble P showed a significant difference, while total P did not differ significantly. The vegetable-based system exhibited higher levels of the majority of P fractions, followed by the fruit-based, maize-based, and rice-based systems. These findings emphasize the importance of considering cropping systems and their response to different phosphorus pools, as this knowledge can contribute to the development of improved soil phosphorus management strategies and promote sustainable agricultural practices in the region.","author":"Dinesh Khadka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7686e7c47420e5a8959f2d0da7468b763ad59ac253cb8a6d3b72bba963e4bf2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
