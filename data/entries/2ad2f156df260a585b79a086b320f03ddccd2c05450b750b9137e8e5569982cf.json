{"title":"Willingness to Pay for Agricultural Soil Quality Protection and Improvement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0543/v1","date":1720444560000,"content":"We estimate general public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for agricultural soil quality protection and improvement in Spain (n=1000) and the UK (n=984) using data from a cross-sectional survey via Qualtrics panels in March-April 2021. We use a double bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation approach to elicit the individuals’ WTP. We investigate the effect of uncertainty on the success of policies aiming at achieving soil protection. In addition, to understand the heterogeneity in individuals’ WTP for agricultural soil quality protection and improvement we model individuals’ WTP through individual’s awareness and attitudes toward agricultural soil quality protection and the environment, trust in institutions; risk and time preferences; pro-social behavior and socio-demographics in Spain and the UK. We found that there is significant public support for agricultural soil quality protection and improvement in Spain and the UK. We also found that the support does not vary significantly under uncertainty of success of policies aiming at achieving soil protection. However the individual’s reasons for supporting agricultural soil quality protection and improvement are found to depend on the level of uncertainty and country. Hence, promoting public support for soil protection needs to be tailored according to the level of general public’s perceived uncertainty and geographic location.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ad2f156df260a585b79a086b320f03ddccd2c05450b750b9137e8e5569982cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
