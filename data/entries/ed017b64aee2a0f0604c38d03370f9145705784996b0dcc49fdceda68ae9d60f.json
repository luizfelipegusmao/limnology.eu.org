{"title":"Glial Connectomics: Inner Retinal Müller Cell Connectivity in the Healthy and Degenerate Retina","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.476/7720047?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Müller cells are highly specialized glia found within the retina of all known species, with individual cells extending from the outer limiting membrane at the inner segments of the photoreceptors to the vitreous [<a href=\"#ozae044.476-B1\">1</a>]. As the primary macroglia of the retina. Müller cells are essential to the survival of retinal neurons, providing metabolic support as well as regulation of extracellular ion concentrations, waste removal, and neurotransmitter recycling [<a href=\"#ozae044.476-B2\">2</a>]. Additionally, Müller cells are implicated in specialized functions such as light guidance and structural support of the retina. Beyond these established roles, Müller cells have been implicated in new functions involving glial transmission effects on surrounding neurons [<a href=\"#ozae044.476-B3\">3</a>], as well as specialized roles in injury and disease such as mitochondrial transfer [<a href=\"#ozae044.476-B4\">4</a>] and secretion of neurotrophic factors [<a href=\"#ozae044.476-B5\">5</a>]. Central to each of these functions is the spatial relationships between Müller cells and the neurons they support, particularly at the synaptic contacts. Unfortunately, while we know that these relationships are important to metabolite and neurotransmitter cycling, they are only understood at a layer-specific level rather than at a more precise synaptic level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ed017b64aee2a0f0604c38d03370f9145705784996b0dcc49fdceda68ae9d60f","category":"Environment"}
