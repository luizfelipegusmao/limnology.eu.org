{"title":"Effect of Punica Granatum Pericarp and Amifostine on Cecal-Ligation-Puncture-Induced Sepsis-Associated Acute Lung Injury in Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0952/v1","date":1726148394000,"content":"One-third of approximately 10 million deaths due to sepsis in a year are due to acute lung injury, and there is no effective treatment yet. Due to its high phenol content, Punica granatum L. bark extract exhibits high antioxidant activity. Amifostine is a free radical scavenger that converts into active thiol in tissues. This study aimed to investigate the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of 2 different doses of PG peel extract and amifostine in sepsis-related acute lung injury. Fifty rats were randomly allocated into 5 groups. Group 1 served as the control group with no sepsis. The remaining groups 2-5 served as the cecal-ligation-puncture (CLP) groups.  Group 3 was administered 200 mg/kg amifostine intraperitoneally (ip) 15 minutes before sepsis induction. Groups 4 and 5 received, respectively, 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg PG peel extract by oral gavage 9 days before and 30 minutes after the CLP procedure, with a total of 10 doses. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were investigated by immunohistochemical methods. MMP-2 and MMP-9 concentrations significantly increased in the sepsis group compared to the other 4 groups. This study provides evidence that Amifostine and Punica granatum pericarp benefit lung tissue in a rat model of sepsis induced by cecal-ligation puncture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf50e96832ecf30b6bb2dd35300b16ccf361a74a5f6831543c3ea0e963ca559a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
