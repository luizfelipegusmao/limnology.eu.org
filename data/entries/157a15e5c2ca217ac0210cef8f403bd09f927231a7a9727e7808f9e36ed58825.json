{"title":"Peritoneal Dialysis Induced Encapsulating Peritonitis &ndash; Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges in Women with Benign Gynecological Pathology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0266/v1","date":1712125986000,"content":"Background Peritoneal sclerosis (PS) and its most severe form, encapsulating PS (EPS), are rare entities that can occur in various procedures (liver transplantation, intraperitoneal chemotherapy), secondary to medications ( beta-blockers); however, PS or EPS typically occur in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis as a form of renal function substitution. Medical or surgical treatments can be applied, but morbidity and mortality have high rates . This condition typically presents clinically as an intestinal obstruction caused by the inclusion of the intestinal loops in the peritoneal fibrous membrane. Methods: Herein we present data from a single tertiary surgery center that has dedicated teams for patients receiving dialysis. In 12 years we analyzed a group of 63 patients admitted for catheter replacement/removal or for acute surgical pathology. In 5 cases (7,9%) we diagnosed EPS . Two patients with EPS presented with atypical abdominal pathologies requiring emergency surgery: one case of hemoperitoneum caused by a ruptured ovarian cyst and one case of uterine fibroids and metrorrhagia. Results: The definitive diagnoses were established intraoperatively and by analyzing the morpho-pathological changes of the peritoneum. The possible intraoperative challenges included laborious dissection, difficulties in restoring the correct anatomical landmarks, increased duration of the surgical intervention and a high rate of incidents and accidents Conclusions: The aim of the present study was to emphasize the possibility of other surgical pathologies overlapping with EPS, increasing the complexity of the surgical intervention. Also, we sought to determine whether there is a correlation between the morpho-pathological results of these patients who underwent emergency surgery and the common EPS morpho-pathological changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"157a15e5c2ca217ac0210cef8f403bd09f927231a7a9727e7808f9e36ed58825","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
