{"title":"Research of Stroke Patient Occurence Associate with Meteorological Factors in Guizhou Mountain Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2034/v1","date":1717059100000,"content":"As previous study in many countries shown that stroke patient onsets are not distributed randomly, but associate with meteorological factors. However, the relationship between stroke occurence and meteorological factors remain unknown in mountain area in Guizhou China. This paper firstly introduces multi-source fusion data which is integrated by the mountain meteorological factor, geographic mapping elevation information data and stroke population monitoring of Guizhou province. Mainly elaborates from a few aspects, which concludes data collection, data sorting, data extraction, data cleaning and data production in detail. A completed and detailed meteorological stroke data set was successfully established and multi-source data fusion was realized by the use of Gbase and unified data service interface of Guizhou meteorological big data cloud platform. And we report the impact of meteorological variables in Guizhou mountain area climate on stroke. In this study, we performed a statistical fusion data between January 2017 and December 2020 about stroke incidence rate and meteorological factors respectively, for instance, concerning the mean (Mean), maximum (Max), minimum (Min), median (Median), standard deviation (Std) . We calculated stroke rates (date stroke occurence)/(year stroke occurence) and we investigated the distribution of days included in the label. Results: the distribution of the incidence rate basically conforms to the normal distribution with the label Max 0.007399, label Min 0.000204, label Mean 0.002738, label Median 0.002643, label Std 0.00076. We observed a positive significant correlation of stroke incidence rate directly proportional to the daily temperature difference (between 0 and 20 degrees Celsius), as the value of this factor exhibits variation larger, the incidence rate is gradually increasing. And we investigated from the Pearson correlation coefficients that stroke incidence increasing when meteorological factors at low humidity (less than 40% (RH 80%), temperature higher than 31℃); the 24-hour daily temperature difference varies between 6 and 10℃ (6","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73bb5bb2e1d065bf7e68c5360850de0a4b671d2aee1ce6da7709c72a42adea74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
