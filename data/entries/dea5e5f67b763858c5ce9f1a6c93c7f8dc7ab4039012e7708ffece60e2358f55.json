{"title":"Role of Community Infrastructure in Improving Nutrition in Under-Five Children for Better Implementation of Integrated Child Development Services","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1577/v1","date":1711458931000,"content":"BackgroundIn India, 26 million children are born every year. These Children (0-6 years) comprise 13% of the country's total population.  MethodsWe used anonymized, publicly available secondary data from the India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). Descriptive statistical analysis and regression analysis of the data have been done.   ResultsThe study shows a linear correlation between the variables of internet access to women and children under five years who are underweight (weight-for-age) in India. The analysis shows Goodness of Fit with an R square value of 0.9960.  ConclusionThe study clearly shows that when compared, community daycare centers (AWCs) have a limited role in the child's nutrition, but Internet access to the mothers can be a determinant of the child's nutrition. Internet access to women can help reduce the number of underweight children under five years and improve overall maternal and child health as well as public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dea5e5f67b763858c5ce9f1a6c93c7f8dc7ab4039012e7708ffece60e2358f55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
