{"title":"Study of the Leakage Current Transport Mechanisms in Pseudo-Vertical GaN-on-Silicon Schottky Diode Grown by Localized Epitaxy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1611/v1","date":1716522752000,"content":"In this work, a GaN-on-Si quasi-vertical Schottky diode was demonstrated on a locally grown n-GaN drift layer. The diode achieves a high current density of 2.5 kA/cm², a specific on-resistance RON,sp of 1.9 mΩ.cm² despite the crowding effect in quasi-vertical device and on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 1010. Temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics have been measured in the range of 300-433 K to investigate the mechanisms of leakage conduction in the device. At near zero bias, thermionic emission (TE) was found to dominate. At voltage range from -1 to -10 V, electrons gain enough energy to excite into trap states, leading to the dominance of Frenkel-Poole emission (FPE). For a higher voltage range (-10V to -40V), the increased electric field promotes electron hopping along the threading dislocations in the “bulk” GaN layers, and thus, Variable Range Hopping becomes the main mechanism for the whole temperature range. This work provides an in-depth insight into the leakage conduction mechanisms on vertical GaN-on-Si Schottky barrier Diodes (SBDs) grown by localized epitaxy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba28eda417c4a4385a1ae16d498bbb4d214e73dba299786478b22aa9012f2522","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
