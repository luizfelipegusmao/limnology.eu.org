{"title":"AI-Driven Decision-Making in Healthcare Information Systems: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0790/v1","date":1718184020000,"content":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing decision-making procedures in healthcare information systems (HIS), increasing the efficacy, accuracy, and personalization of healthcare. Notwithstanding remarkable progresses, yet there remain gaps in the holistic comprehension and implication of AI-driven technologies across various HIS scenarios. These gaps, consisting limited integration of AI across a variety of HIS parts and inadequate emphasize on interpretability and privacy, motivate our study to conduct a structured evaluation of recent AI applications in this domain. In this study, we present a novel taxonomy for the AI implication in medical decision-making. We analyzed 30 articles and categorized them into six groups including: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Predictive Analytics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer-Aided Diagnostics (CAD), Robotic-Assisted Surgery, and Virtual Health Assistants (VHAs/chatbots). Our study aims to propose a holistic perspective of the fast evolving perspective of AI in HIS. The majority of the investigated studies were published from 2023 and 2022, with Springer as the leading publisher (33%). Python and MATLAB were the most well-known simulation languages, applied in 48% and 20% of the papers, respectively, reflecting the technical trends in the area. By emphasizing on pivotal criteria like interpretability, accuracy, and privacy, this research aims to elucidate the crucial issues and development driving AI-driven decision-making in HIS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71482d853628f48203103fc25692c6546cbf9d4ecf303de2a5271b6aee8e13cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
