{"title":"Crosstalk between Rho of Plants GTPase signalling and plant hormones","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/3778/7645609?rss=1","date":1713139200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rho of Plants (ROPs) constitute a plant-specific subset of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins within the Cdc42/Rho/Rac family. These versatile proteins regulate diverse cellular processes, including cell growth, cell division, cell morphogenesis, organ development, and stress responses. In recent years, the dynamic cellular and subcellular behaviours orchestrated by ROPs have unveiled a notable connection to hormone-mediated organ development and physiological responses, thereby expanding our knowledge of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of this signalling pathway. This review delineates advancements in understanding the interplay between plant hormones and the ROP signalling cascade, focusing primarily on the connections with auxin and abscisic acid pathways, alongside preliminary discoveries in cytokinin, brassinosteroid, and salicylic acid responses. It endeavours to shed light on the intricate, coordinated mechanisms bridging cell- and tissue-level signals that underlie plant cell behaviour, organ development, and physiological processes, and highlights future research prospects and challenges in this rapidly developing field.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7d872d769fdf54f25b7d9cff205eda93174ece22836c4bebf13d0ee315f40751","category":"Environment"}
