{"title":"Clinicopathologic features and outcomes of bilateral lacrimal gland lesions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305717","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Lvfu He, Weimin He</p>\r\nBackground <p>The present study reviewed the clinicopathological features and outcomes of bilateral lacrimal gland lesions.</p> Methods <p>The data of 113 patients who underwent lacrimal gland biopsy at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China, between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021, are presented in this case series. The patients all presented with bilateral lacrimal gland lesions. The collected data included patient demographics, clinical features, the results of laboratory examinations, imaging presentations, histopathological diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.</p> Results <p>The mean age of the 113 enrolled patients was 47.4 ± 14.9 years (range, 11–77 years) with a predominance of females (54.9%, n = 62). The lacrimal gland was the source of the majority of biopsy tissue (98.2%, n = 111). The most prevalent etiology was immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) (32.7%, n = 37), followed by idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) (28.3%, n = 32), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (17.7%, n = 20), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) (10.6%, n = 12), and mantle cell lymphoma (4.4%, n = 5). Patients with IOI were significantly younger than those with IgG4-ROD and MALT lymphoma (t = 2.932, <i>P</i> = 0.005; t = 3.865, <i>P&lt;</i>0.001, respectively). Systemic symptoms were more prevalent among patients with IgG4-ROD (χ2 = 7.916, <i>P</i> = 0.005). The majority of patients were treated with surgery (53.1%, n = 60), with surgery combined with corticosteroid therapy (21.2%, n = 24) being the second most common treatment. The majority of patients (91.2%, n = 103) attained complete resolution, stable disease, or significant improvement.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, there are several aetiologies associated with bilateral lacrimal gland lesions, the most prevalent being IgG4-ROD, IOI, and MALT lymphoma. Systemic symptoms were more common in patients with IgG4-ROD. The majority of patients who presented with bilateral lesions of the lacrimal glands responded satisfactorily to treatment, with favorable results.</p>","author":"Lvfu He","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86e70fe3ee8c332c54072a8b06218da64e1a2af1a3ee162b8bc28902544577d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
