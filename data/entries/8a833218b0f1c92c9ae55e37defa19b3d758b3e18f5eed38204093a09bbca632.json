{"title":"Association between dietary copper intake and bone mineral density in children and adolescents aged 8–19 years: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310911","date":1727791200000,"content":"<p>by Aiyong Cui, Juan Yan, Haoran Li, Zhiqiang Fan, Xing Wei, Hu Wang, Yan Zhuang</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Some studies showed the possible role of copper intake on bone mineral density (BMD) in adults or the elderly, but the association remained uncertain in children and adolescents. Our research explored the association between copper intake and BMD in individuals aged 8–19 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2016.</p> Methods <p>In the present study, 6,965 individuals aged 8–19 (mean age 13.18 ± 3.38 years) were enrolled from the NHANES 2011–2016. Copper intake was evaluated by averaging two 24-hour copper dietary intake recalls. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between copper intake and total BMD, subtotal BMD, and total spine BMD in children and adolescents. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were performed by age, gender, and race.</p> Results <p>Participants of the higher quartile of copper intake were more likely to be older, men, Non-Hispanic White, and Other Hispanic. They have higher values of poverty income ratio (PIR), serum phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, serum vitamin D, and BMD and lower values of body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, total protein, and serum cotinine. In the fully adjusted model, we found positive associations between copper intake and total BMD (β = 0.013, 95CI: 0.006, 0.019)), subtotal BMD (β = 0.020, 95CI: 0.015, 0.024), and total spine BMD (β = 0.014, 95CI: 0.009, 0.019). Stratified analyses showed that the association was stronger in men, individuals aged 14–19, Non-Hispanic White, and Other Hispanic.</p> Conclusions <p>Our study suggests that copper intake is positively associated with BMD in U.S. children and adolescents. The study emphasizes the role of copper intake on bone health in the early stages of life. However, more investigations are needed to verify our findings and their underlying mechanisms.</p>","author":"Aiyong Cui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8a833218b0f1c92c9ae55e37defa19b3d758b3e18f5eed38204093a09bbca632","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
