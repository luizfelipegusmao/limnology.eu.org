{"title":"Robot for Inclusive Education, Made by Students and Teachers of the EET No. 2 &ldquo;Independence&rdquo; of Concordia (ER), Argentina. Computer Technique Specialty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0922/v1","date":1718270713000,"content":"This study focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of an educational mobile robot, named Robot-T2, to be used in educational activities within a technical school. The primary objective was to create a versatile platform that allows students to explore programming, engineering, and science concepts in a practical and collaborative manner. The methodology included an iterative design and testing approach, incorporating feedback from students and teachers to continuously improve the robot's functionality. The tests covered autonomous navigation, line following, and object manipulation, using the OnBotJava programming software and the Control Hub as the main interface. The results demonstrated that Robot-T2 is highly efficient and adaptable in various educational contexts, showing remarkable precision in navigation and object manipulation. The design iterations significantly improved the robot's performance, enriching the educational experience and promoting active learning. In conclusion, educational robotics, represented by Robot-T2, has great potential to enhance the teaching and learning process in technical schools, fostering teamwork, problem-solving, and the integration of technology in the classroom. This project is expected to inspire future developments in educational robotics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e646a1a4bde062bb24ae314d2c9714fdf093fe7d4588802b49ad0c2b5b43929d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
