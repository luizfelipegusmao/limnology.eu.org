{"title":"Characteristics of Patients with Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Advanced Ovarian, Fallopian Tube and Primary Peritoneal Cancer in 2018&ndash;2023 and the Impact of Molecular Diagnostics on the Chemotherapy in Clinical Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0783/v1","date":1725953610000,"content":"High-grade advanced ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal (HGAOC) cancer are malignancies in which, apart from surgical treatment, systemic treatment plays an important role. The improvement in treatment results is associated with the introduction of polyADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPis). The aim of this study is to present a cross-section of patients treated for HGAOC, in one center, including the distribution of treatment principles following the most up-to-date guidelines. We observed patients who reported to the Department of Gyneacological Oncology between January 2018 and December 2023. We analyzed 437 women with a first diagnosis of HGAOC, who had not been treated before. The introduction of combined treatment with bevacizumab and PARPi into the first line of treatment, regardless of any remnants left during cytoreductive surgery, was introduced in November 2022. Since then, 30% (18/60) of patients (14 with olaparib and 4 with niraparib) have used the above regimen. Previously, in May 2021 - October 2022, it was 27% of patients (13/81 with olaparib and 9/81 with niraparib). Among patients starting treatment in January 2018 - April 2021, only 4.7% (5/106) received the platinum + paclitaxel + olaparib regimen. In both groups – with and without BRCA1/2 pathogenic or likely- pathogenic variant, significantly more patients used PC + PARPi or PC + BEV + PARPi in periods II and III than in period I (p&lt;0.01). The introduction of modern treatment in our center very quickly changed the structure of patient treatment. Carriers of BRCA1/2 pathogenic or likely-pathogenic variant had previously received only chemotherapy, disappeared after the introduction of PARPi, in favor of new therapies. Most patients with no BRCA1/2 pathogenic or likely-pathogenic variant, who used PARPi in therapy in our center – received niraparib and therefore they are beneficiaries of molecular diagnostics in the field of HRD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d3949ee9d7a3bb74ca6b627d731ebb7321e2b683327afe6b783eaa801f44fb1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
