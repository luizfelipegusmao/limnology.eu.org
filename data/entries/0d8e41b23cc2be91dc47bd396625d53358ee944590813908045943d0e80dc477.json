{"title":"Impact of Residual Strains on the Carrier Mobility and Sability of Perovskite Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1972/v1","date":1719575449000,"content":"Solution-based inorganic-organic halide perovskites are of great interest to researchers because of their unique optoelectronic properties and easy processing. However, polycrystalline perovskite films often show inhomogeneity due to residual strain induced during the filmâ€™s post-processing phase. In turn, these strains can impact both their stability and performances. An exhaustive study of residual strains can provide a better understanding and control of how they affect the performance and stability of perovskite films. In this work, we explore this complex interrelationship between residual strains and electrical properties for methylammonium \\chemform{CH_3NH_3PbI_{3-x}Cl_x} films using grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). We correlate with their resistiviy and carrier mobility using Hall effect. The sin^2($\\psi$) technique is used to optimize the annealing parameters for the perovskite films. We also establish that temperature-induced relaxation can yield significant enhancement of the charge carrier transports in perovskite films. Finally, we also use Raman micro-spectroscopy to assess the degradation of perovskite films as a function of their residual strains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d8e41b23cc2be91dc47bd396625d53358ee944590813908045943d0e80dc477","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
