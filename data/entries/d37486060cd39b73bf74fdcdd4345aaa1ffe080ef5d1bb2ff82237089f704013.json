{"title":"Amphidromous shrimps (Decapoda: Caridea): current knowledge and future research","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae003/7604398?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The caridean shrimps comprise one of the largest groups of amphidromous species, sharing their life cycle between freshwater habitats and the ocean. Key species of tropical ecosystems, some of which are also targets for local or international markets without any regulations being implemented, make carideans particularly vulnerable to the threats facing natural populations. We present an inventory of amphidromous carideans and an overview of their habitats, the interests they arouse, because of their ecological role as well as for their commercial importance and the threats they face. We suggest directions for future research following an experimental-biology approach, that may help to assess risks and impacts on natural habitats and ultimately prioritize conservation and management projects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"d37486060cd39b73bf74fdcdd4345aaa1ffe080ef5d1bb2ff82237089f704013","category":"Environment"}
