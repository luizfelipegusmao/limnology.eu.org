{"title":"A prion-like domain is required for phase separation and chloroplast RNA processing during cold acclimation in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2851/7667881?rss=1","date":1715212800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) plants can produce photosynthetic tissue with active chloroplasts at temperatures as low as 4Â°C, and this process depends on the presence of the nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-localized RNA-binding protein CP29A. In this study, we demonstrate that CP29A undergoes phase separation in vitro and in vivo in a temperature-dependent manner, which is mediated by a prion-like domain (PLD) located between the two RNA recognition motif domains of CP29A. The resulting droplets display liquid-like properties and are found near chloroplast nucleoids. The PLD is required to support chloroplast RNA splicing and translation in cold-treated tissue. Together, our findings suggest that plant chloroplast gene expression is compartmentalized by inducible condensation of CP29A at low temperatures, a mechanism that could play a crucial role in plant cold resistance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a093bcef0de8b9cc4660e838953bb619ab8bf1a655ad9d8e7321889f62a7e1c3","category":"Environment"}
