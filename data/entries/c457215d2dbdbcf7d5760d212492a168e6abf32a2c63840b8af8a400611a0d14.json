Family involvement enhances the intervention outcome. This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of an early intervention home program manual for toddlers with ASD. Method: This study involved three phases: (I) formulation of manual concept and content design (II) manual development through focus group discussion (n = 10) and content validation by experts (n = 9); (III) cognitive interview (n = 6) and feasibility study (n = 8). Result: Content Validity Index (I-CVI) for the developed manual ranged from .78–1.0, S-CVI/Ave .96, and S-CVI/UA .79. Cognitive interview among six parents reported that the manual was easy to understand. The feasibility study reported all eight parents benefitted from coaching sessions. Approximately 87.5% of the respondents found the program benefited their children and could easily implement the activities in their daily routines. Approximately 75% of respondents reported having greater confidence in managing their child’s behaviors at home. Parent coaching using the developed home program is feasible and accepted by parents of a toddler with ASD. Further study should be developed to explore the effectiveness of parent coaching using the manual.","author":"JieYi Png","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c457215d2dbdbcf7d5760d212492a168e6abf32a2c63840b8af8a400611a0d14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
