{"title":"The Models of Primary Particles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1065/v3","date":1722511589000,"content":"If we assume that: a. The four fundamental forces of nature are independent waves without rest masses, and their speeds are constant in a vacuum, just like light. b. Light or electromagnetic waves and gravity are comparable in structures. Weak and strong interactions are similar in structures. c. Light and weak interaction have the same speed cL with spin number +1 or â€“1. d. Gravity and strong interaction have the same speed cG without spin. e. The primary particles, namely electrons, electron neutrinos, and dark neutrinos in this paper, are made by the above four waves. We can find and describe some fundamental characteristics of the primary particles (e.g., their sizes, energies, and interactions) and introduce new attractive results from them (e.g., the source of the Pauli exclusion principle, the solution to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, and cG slightly faster than cL).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ea82c538318b10d65b6b537aa0be5dc24a1a3e4d7808391a141e3ca8bac4fdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
