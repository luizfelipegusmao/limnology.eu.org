{"title":"Effects of the N-butanol Extract of Pulsatilla Decoction on Neutrophils in a Mouse Model of Ulcerative Colitis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1654/v1","date":1719209786000,"content":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease, the incidence of which is increasing worldwide. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of UC remains unclear. The n-butanol extract of pulsatilla decoction (BEPD) of the traditional Chinese medicine herbal formula has been shown to be effective in treating UC. We aimed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of BEPD on UC, in particular its effects on neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation by neutrophils. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the principal compounds of BEPD. UC was induced in mice using dextran sodium sulfate, and mice were treated with 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg BEPD daily for seven days. Colonic inflammation was determined by assessing the disease activity index, histopathology, colonic mucosal damage index, colonic mucosal permeability, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. The infiltration and activation status of neutrophils in the colon were determined by analyzing the levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)1 and CXCL2, reactive oxygen species, Ly6G, and numerous NET proteins. Our results showed that BEPD improved the disease activity index, histopathology, and colonic mucosal damage index scores of mice with UC, and restored colonic mucosal permeability compared with untreated mice. The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in colon tissues were significantly decreased, while the expression levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues were significantly increased, exceeding those of control mice. In addition, BEPD reduce the expression of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 in the colon tissue of mice with UC, reduced neutrophil infiltration, reduced reactive oxygen species levels, and significantly reduced the expression of NET proteins. BEPD also significantly reduced NET formation. The results of this study suggest that BEPD exerts therapeutic effects in a murine model of UC by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and activation in the colon, as well as by inhibiting the expression of key proteins involved in NET formation and reducing NET formation, thereby alleviating local tissue damage and disease manifestations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6cf0d49d86e6577120bd010ea05007df6956476120b63e87c5c9108876009cf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
