{"title":"Marine Delivery Vehicles: Molecular Components and Applications of Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0457/v1","date":1720140614000,"content":"In marine ecosystems communication among microorganisms is crucial since the distance is significant if considered on a microbial scale. One of the ways used by microorganism cells to reduce this gap is the production of extracellular vesicles. Marine bacteria release extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membrane-bound structures of 50 to 250 nm diameter, into their surrounding environment. The vesicles contain various cellular compounds, including lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and glycans. EVs may mediate the communication between microorganisms in aquatic environments thus influencing ecosystem function and determining the structure and composition of microbial populations. This review will focus on marine bacterial EVs analysing their structure, composition, functions, and applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"026e1e1f569f6265633b0732eec218b2df90b054541d1e5ab4fd1089281da126","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
