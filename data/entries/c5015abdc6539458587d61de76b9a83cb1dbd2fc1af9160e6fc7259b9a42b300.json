{"title":"Microflow Injection System for Efficient Cu(II) Detection Across a Broad Range","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1940/v1","date":1716984358000,"content":"In this study, a modular multi-step photometric microflow injection analysis (micro-FIA) system for the automatic determination of Cu(II) in a bioreactor has been developed. The system incorporates diverse 3D-printed modules, including a platform formed by a mixer module to mix Cu(II) with hydroxylamine which reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I) linked to a diluter module via a Tesla valve, a chelation mixer module, a disperser module, and a detector module provided by a LED light source at λ= 455 nm and a light dependence resistor (LDR) as a light intensity detector. The system measures the color intensity resulting from the chelation between Cu(I) and neocuproine. The micro-FIA system has demonstrated good capability for automatic and continuous Cu(II) determination, in a wide range of Cu concentrations from 34 to 2000 mg L-1. The device exhibits a good repeatability (coefficient of variation below 2% across the concentration range), good reproducibility, and has an accuracy of around 100% between 600 to 1900 mg·L-1. Real samples were analyzed using both the micro-FIA system and an atomic absorption spectroscopy method, revealing no statistically significant differences. Additionally, a Tesla valve located before the detector substituted a 3-way solenoid valve, eliminating the need for moving parts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5015abdc6539458587d61de76b9a83cb1dbd2fc1af9160e6fc7259b9a42b300","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
