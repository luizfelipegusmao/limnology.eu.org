{"title":"Health professionals’ attitudes towards traditional healing for mental illness: A systematic review protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310255","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Alemayehu Molla Wollie, Kim Usher, Reshin Maharaj, Md Shahidul Islam</p>\r\nBackground <p>Mental illness is a global problem that receives less attention, particularly in developing countries. Integrating modern treatment with traditional healing approaches has been proposed as one way to address mental health problems, especially in developing countries. Despite health professionals’ participation in traditional healing being crucial to integrative approaches, their participation is limited to date. This review protocol is designed to explore the attitudes of health professionals towards traditional healing practices in mental health services.</p> Methods <p>The review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching databases, including PubMed/Medline, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Web of sciences will be conducted. Additionally, Google and Google Scholar will be searched for other information, including grey literature. Moreover, a manual search of identified articles’ reference lists will also be conducted to help ensure all potential papers are included in the review. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed study methods published in English between January 2014 and April 2024 will be included. The qualities of the included studies will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) Version 2018. A mixed-method synthesis will be used to synthesis the results.</p> Discussion <p>It is crucial for healthcare professionals to provide culturally sensitive care to empower people to manage their health. This systematic review will summarize the attitudes of health professionals towards the adoption and delivery of traditional healing approaches to people experiencing mental illness. Therefore, the findings of this review will support integration between traditional healers and modern mental health practitioners for the treatment of mental illness.</p> Trial registration <p>Protocol registration number: CRD42024535136.</p>","author":"Alemayehu Molla Wollie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"902f0d31d16d34ef89f27ea9009f8cdf6a502d6b0efd410fe5a337e5f3bbc524","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
