{"title":"Development of a Simple Prime Number Determination Method by excluding Composite Numbers on 6n&plusmn;1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2314/v1","date":1722290858000,"content":"A prime number is a natural number with no divisors other than itself and the number 1. There are many unsolved problems related to prime numbers. One such problem is finding a general method for identifying prime numbers. Although it is known that all prime numbers fall under the categories of 2, 3, or 6n±1 (where n≥1), a formalized method for eliminating composite numbers (non-prime numbers) from these categories has yet to be developed. This paper aims to explore a possible method for such elimination, which involves checking whether there exists an n that satisfies n = 6km+k+m or n = 6km+k-m (where k and m are non-zero integers). This method is expected to be a major step forward in the derivation of prime numbers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6065bfe13a6e437c60d0eaf4d720d12c415b06b292038873c9ecef28da27c53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
