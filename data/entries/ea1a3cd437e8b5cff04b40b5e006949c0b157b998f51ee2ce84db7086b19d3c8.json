{"title":"Using IoT for Cistern and Water Tank Level Real-Time Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0695/v1","date":1728471713000,"content":"This paper proposes an experimental design to publish on the Internet the measurements resulting from the use of four sensors: a sensor inside a cistern to measure the level of drinking water, a sensor inside a water tank to measure the water level, a sensor to measure the water flow or pressure brought by the pipes, and another sensor to measure the water quality. Using these sensors, data was collected and published in real-time on the Internet, and at the same time, it was recorded in a database. Several tests of filling and emptying the cistern were performed. A system analyzes, makes decisions, and acts on the data collected by the sensors.  Finally, experimental results demonstrated that if the cistern perceived that there was no water in the tank, it turned on the water pump to fill the tank to 100\\% of its storage capacity; while this was happening, the water level in the cistern and tank, the flow of water from the piped water, and the quality of the water could be visualized on a dashboard. In short, this proposal monitors water levels and flows through the Internet of Things.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea1a3cd437e8b5cff04b40b5e006949c0b157b998f51ee2ce84db7086b19d3c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
