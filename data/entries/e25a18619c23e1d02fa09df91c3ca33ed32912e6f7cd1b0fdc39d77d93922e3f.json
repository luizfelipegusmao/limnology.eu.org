{"title":"Identifying and prioritizing recommendations to optimize transitions across the care journey for hip fractures: Results from a mixed-methods concept mapping study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307769","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Sara J.

Wodchis, Kednapa Thavorn, Kerry Kuluski</p>\r\nBackground <p>Individuals who experience a hip fracture have numerous care transitions. Improving the transition process is important for ensuring quality care; however, little is known about the priorities of different key interest groups. Our aim was to gather recommendations from these groups regarding care transitions for hip fracture.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a concept mapping study, inviting persons with lived experience (PWLE) who had a hip fracture, care partners, healthcare providers, and decision-makers to share their thoughts about ‘what is needed to improve care transitions for hip fracture’. Individuals were subsequently asked to sort the generated statements into conceptual piles, and then rate by importance and priority using a five-point scale. Participants decided on the final map, rearranged statements, and assigned a name to each conceptual cluster.</p> Results <p>A total of 35 participants took part in this concept mapping study, with some individuals participating in multiple steps. Participants included 22 healthcare providers, 7 care partners, 4 decision-makers, and 2 PWLE. The final map selected by participants was an 8-cluster map, with the following cluster labels: (1) access to inpatient services and supports across the care continuum (13 statements); (2) informed and collaborative discharge planning (13 statements); (3) access to transitional and outpatient services (3 statements); (4) communication, education and knowledge acquisition (9 statements); (5) support for care partners (2 statements); (6) person-centred care (13 statements); (7) physical, social, and cognitive activities and supports (13 statements); and (8) provider knowledge, skills, roles and behaviours (8 statements).</p> Conclusions <p>Our study findings highlight the importance of person-centred care, with active involvement of PWLE and their care partners throughout the care journey. Many participant statements included specific ideas related to continuity of care, and clinical knowledge and skills. This study provides insights for future interventions and quality improvement initiatives for enhancing transitions in care among hip fracture populations.</p>","author":"Sara J. T.
