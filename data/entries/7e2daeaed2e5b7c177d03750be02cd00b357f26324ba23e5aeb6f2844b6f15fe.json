{"title":"Dietary rutin improves the antidiarrheal capacity of weaned piglets by improving intestinal barrier function, antioxidant capacity and cecal microbiota composition","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13456?af=R","date":1711170197000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Early weaning is prone to damage intestinal barrier function, resulting in diarrhea, whereas rutin, as a natural flavonoid with multiple biological functions, shows potential in piglets. Therefore, the effects of dietary rutin on growth, antidiarrheal, barrier function, antioxidant status and cecal microbiota of weaned piglets were investigated with the control group (CON) (basal diet) and Rutin (basal diet+500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> rutin) groups fed for 14 days.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that dietary 500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> rutin significantly decreased diarrhea index, serum diamine oxidase activity and total aerobic bacterial population in mesenteric lymph nodes, whereas it significantly increased the gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) and serum growth hormone content, jejunal villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio, and also enhanced jejunal claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 mRNA and protein expression. Meanwhile, dietary rutin significantly decreased inflammation-associated mRNA expression, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, swollen mitochondrial number and mitochondrial area in the jejunum, whereas it increased the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activities and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, dietary rutin significantly increased <i>Firmicutes</i> abundance and decreased <i>Campylobacterota</i> abundance, which were closely associated with the decreased diarrhea index and MDA content or increased Claudin-1 expression and T-SOD activity.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Dietary 500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> rutin increased G:F by improving intestinal morphology, and alleviated diarrhea by enhancing intestinal barrier, which might be associated with the enhanced antioxidant capacity via activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway and the improved cecal microbial composition in weaned piglets. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Longfei Ma, \nBinbin Zhou, \nHuijuan Liu, \nShun Chen, \nJiaqi Zhang, \nTian Wang, \nChao Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7e2daeaed2e5b7c177d03750be02cd00b357f26324ba23e5aeb6f2844b6f15fe","category":"Environment"}
