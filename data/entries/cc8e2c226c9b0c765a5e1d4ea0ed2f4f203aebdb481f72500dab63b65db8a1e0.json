{"title":"Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of sepsis: Identifying key aging‚Äêrelated biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of sepsis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24198?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Sepsis remains a crucial global health issue characterized by high mortality rates and a lack of specific treatments. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis and to identify potential therapeutic targets and compounds.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>High-throughput sequencing data from the GEO database (GSE26440 as the training set and GSE13904 and GSE32707 as the validation sets), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, alongside a combination of PPI and machine learning methods (LASSO and SVM) were utilized.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>WGCNA identified the black module as positively correlated, and the green module as negatively correlated with sepsis. Further intersections of these module genes with age-related genes yielded 57 sepsis-related genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, PPI, LASSO, and SVM selected six hub aging-related genes: <i>BCL6</i>, <i>FOS</i>, <i>ETS1</i>, <i>ETS2</i>, <i>MAPK14</i>, and <i>MYC</i>. A diagnostic model was constructed based on these six core genes, presenting commendable performance in both the training and validation sets. Notably, <i>ETS1</i> demonstrated significant differential expression between mild and severe sepsis, indicating its potential as a biomarker of severity. Furthermore, immune infiltration analysis of these six core genes revealed their correlation with most immune cells and immune-related pathways. Additionally, compounds were identified in the traditional Chinese medicine Danshen, which upon further analysis, revealed 354 potential target proteins. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of these targets indicated a primary enrichment in inflammation and immune-related pathways. A Venn diagram intersects these target proteins, and our aforementioned six core genes yielded three common genes, suggesting the potential efficacy of Danshen in sepsis treatment through these genes.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>This study highlights the pivotal roles of age-related genes in the molecular mechanisms of sepsis, offers potential biomarkers, and identifies promising therapeutic compounds, laying a robust foundation for future studies on the treatment of sepsis.</p>","author":"Jie Zhou, \nJiao Liu, \nChuanwu Zhang, \nYihua Zhou, \nZemao Zheng, \nHaoguang Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"cc8e2c226c9b0c765a5e1d4ea0ed2f4f203aebdb481f72500dab63b65db8a1e0","category":"Environment"}
