{"title":"Is Revision Arthroscopic Bankart Repair a Viable Option? A Systematic Review of Recurrent Instability Following Bankart Repair","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1266/v1","date":1713513488000,"content":"Background/Objectives\nRecurrent shoulder instability following Bankart lesion repair often necessitates surgical revision. Identified risk factors include young age, glenoid bone loss, and off-track Hill-Sachs lesions.  This systematic review aims to understand failure rates of arthroscopic revision Bankart repair and if these aforementioned factors influence its success.\nMethods\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review, registered on PROSPERO, included twenty-four articles. Two independent reviewers assessed eligibility across three databases, focusing on recurrent instability as the primary endpoint, while also noting functional measures, adverse events, revision operations, and return-to-sport rates when available.\nResults\nKey surgical techniques for recurrent instability post-Bankart repair were identified, with revision arthroscopic Bankart being the most common (685/1032). Despite generally endorsed effectiveness, recurrence rates have increased over the past four years.  Comparative analysis revealed significantly lower recurrence for open Latarjet compared to revision arthroscopic Bankart (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ee616d9972d6f53af996af628342d538f293b6531e0207823260b16bbad09bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
