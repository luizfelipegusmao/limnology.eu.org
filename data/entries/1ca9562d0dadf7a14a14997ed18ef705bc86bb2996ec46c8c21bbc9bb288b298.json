{"title":"Recursive Formula for Sum of Powers of Natural Numbers and Its Generalization to Arithmetic Progression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1648/v1","date":1721617089000,"content":"In this paper, we derive a formula for sum of powers of integers from Abel’s Summation Formula. This formula enables us to generate the formula for the sum of k-th power of integers, denoted by Sk(n), given the formulas of S1(n), S2(n), ..., Sk−1(n). Furthermore, we shall extend this formula to compute the sum of powers of an arithmetic progression. Moreover, we can combine the formula with the result of Bernoulli to derive another result which enables us to find Bernoulli Numbers recursively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ca9562d0dadf7a14a14997ed18ef705bc86bb2996ec46c8c21bbc9bb288b298","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
