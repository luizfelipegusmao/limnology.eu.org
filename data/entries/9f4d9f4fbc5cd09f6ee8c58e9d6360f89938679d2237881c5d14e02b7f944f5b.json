{"title":"Performance Parameters of Paralarvae and Postparalarvae Rearing of Patagonian Red Octopus, Enteroctopus megalocyathus, under Experimental Conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/2675578?af=R","date":1704700800000,"content":"<p>Patagonian red octopus, <i>Enteroctopus megalocyathus</i>, an interesting species for Chilean aquaculture diversification, requires the improving of their experimental technology to obtain early juveniles. The first objective of the study was to enhance aspects of feeding and temperature management in broodstock, egg incubation, paralarvae rearing, and early juveniles’ growth. The results indicated that female weight decreases up to 46.0 ± 8.6% during the egg incubation. Test of 8, 14, and 18°C during egg incubation shows that at 18°C embryos do not survive. Paralarvae reared under four diet treatments: (1) unfed, (2) enriched <i>Artemia</i> (<i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp.), (3) copepod (<i>Acartia</i> spp.), and (4) juvenile crabs (<i>Petrolisthes</i> spp.) showed survival quadruplication when they fed copepods and crabs instead of <i>Artemia</i>. Juveniles reared at 11, 13, and 15°C improved feed conversion and protein efficiency ratios at 15°C. The second objective was to analyze batches of paralarvae and early juveniles of two different periods to obtain their performance indicators and to compare them between productive periods. The results of growth rates, the relative weight condition coefficient, and morphometric relationships are discussed in the context of paralarvae culture from 1 to 90 days after hatching (DAH) and early juveniles from 1 to 135 days postsettlement (DPS).</p>","author":"Iker Uriarte, \nMaría Hernández, \nFernanda Peñailillo, \nNicole Montero, \nRanferi Gutiérrez, \nVarinia Araya, \nViviana Espinoza, \nJorge Hernández, \nRicardo Enríquez, \nAna Farías, \nCarlos Rosas, \nJianguang Qin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"9f4d9f4fbc5cd09f6ee8c58e9d6360f89938679d2237881c5d14e02b7f944f5b","category":"Environment"}
