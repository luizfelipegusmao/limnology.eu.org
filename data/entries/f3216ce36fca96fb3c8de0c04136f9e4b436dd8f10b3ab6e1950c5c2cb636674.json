{"title":"Participation and returns from informal service-oriented non-farm enterprises: Evidence from a survey of Nigerian households","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298794","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Ikechukwu Darlington Nwaka, Okechukwu Lawrence Emeagwali</p>\r\n\r\nWe investigate the factors that influence the selection and productivity of informal service-oriented family enterprises in Nigeria. Using nationally representative micro-data from the Nigerian General Household Survey (2010–2015), we employed random-effect probit and selectivity-adjusted regression models to estimate and analyze the results. The findings reveal that the location of informal Non-Farm Household Enterprises (NFHEs)–whether home-based or non-home-based—significantly impacts the wholesale, retail, personal, and consultancy service sectors operated by informal NFHEs. This impact remains significant even after accounting for variations in individuals, households, or locational characteristics. Furthermore, when considering selectivity in the earnings equation, we found that home-based informal enterprises exhibit lower productivity compared to non-home-based enterprises, a difference that varies across sectors. Overall, factors such as the gender of business owners, educational levels, geopolitical zones, infrastructure, and business characteristics play a crucial role in determining the locational and productivity disparities among service-oriented enterprises in Nigeria. Key recommendations stemming from this study include addressing gender-based segregation and economic disparities, prioritising financial inclusion for small business development, bridging infrastructure gaps, and implementing policies that acknowledge and bolster the informal sector.","author":"Ikechukwu Darlington Nwaka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f3216ce36fca96fb3c8de0c04136f9e4b436dd8f10b3ab6e1950c5c2cb636674","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
