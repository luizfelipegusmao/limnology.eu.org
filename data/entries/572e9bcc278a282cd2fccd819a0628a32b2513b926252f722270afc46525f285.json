{"title":"Moderate Aerobic Exercise Induces the Homeostatic IgA Generation in Senile Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1077/v1","date":1718603835000,"content":"T-cell independent (TI) pathway activated by microbiota results in the generation of low-affinity homeostatic IgA with a critical role in intestinal homeostasis. Moderate aerobic exercise (MAE) provides a beneficial impact on intestinal immunity but the action of MAE on TI-IgA generation under senescence conditions is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effects of long-term MAE on TI-IgA production in young (3 months old) BALB/c mice exercised until adulthood (6 months) or aging (24 months). Lamina propria (LP) from the small intestine was obtained to determine B cells and plasma cells sub-populations by flow cytometry and molecular factors related to class switch recombination (TSLP/APRIL/BAFF/iNOS/RDH) and synthesis of IgA (α-chain/IL-6/IL-21/TGF-β); and epithelial cells to evaluate IgA-transitosis (pIgR/TNFα/IFN-/IL-4), by RT-qPCR technique. Results were compared with data obtained from sedentary age-matched mice. Statistical analysis was computed with ANDOVA and P&amp;lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant difference. Under senescence conditions MAE promoted the B cell and IgA+B cells and APRIL that may im-prove the intestinal response and ameliorated the inflammatory environment associated pre-sumably with the downmodulation of pIgR. Data suggested that MAE improved the IgA and downmodulate the cytokine pro-inflammatory expression favoring homeostatic conditions in aging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"572e9bcc278a282cd2fccd819a0628a32b2513b926252f722270afc46525f285","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
