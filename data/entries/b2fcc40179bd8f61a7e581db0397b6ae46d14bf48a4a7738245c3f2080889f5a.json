{"title":"Is the Earth Now in a Multifactorial CO2 Tipping Point? The Case for More Aggressive Carbon Dioxide Removal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1979/v1","date":1724838685000,"content":"The Keeling Curve shows that in addition to the progressive increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, the rate of increase in the rate of uptake of CO2 into the atmosphere, both in ppm and  gigatons C/year, has been progressively increasing from 1960 to the present, despite some leveling off of man-made emissions. There is a similar processive increase in the earthâ€™s heat imbalance. I propose that this is due to the additive effect of multiple partially activated tipping points putting the earth into a positive feedback mode such that these increases in rate will continue even after net zero emissions from fossil fuels is attained. As a result, controlling global warming will require a marked acceleration of Carbon Dioxide Removal using multiple Negative Emission Technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2fcc40179bd8f61a7e581db0397b6ae46d14bf48a4a7738245c3f2080889f5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
