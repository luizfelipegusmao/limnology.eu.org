{"title":"Survivin as a Therapeutic Target for the Treatment of Human Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1255/v1","date":1711014235000,"content":"Survivin was initially identified as a member of the inhibitor apoptosis (IAP) protein family and has been shown to play a critical role in regulation of both apoptosis and mitosis. Survivin has emerged as an attractive target for cancer therapy because its overexpression has been found in most human cancers and is frequently associated with chemotherapy resistance, recurrence, and poor survival rate in cancer patients. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of how survivin mediates various aspects of malignant transformation and drug resistance, as well as efforts that have been made to develop therapeutics targeting survivin for the treatment of cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b89f34368c93c8592699446f13e0a982aaf17e6bbb1c4409e1779d766850b63f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
