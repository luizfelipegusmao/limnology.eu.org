Scanning nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) combined with new high-speed, pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) detectors make it possible to measure a diffraction pattern (k<sub>x</sub>, k<sub>y</sub>) at every scan position (x, y). This opens doors to investigate crystalline properties such as lattice parameters, local fields, polarization directions, and charge densities with relatively low beam dose over large fields of view. However, extracting these signals of interest from confounding signals such as thickness or crystallographic mistilt effects remains challenging. Here, we combine a cepstral approach, which is similar to a 2D pair-correlation function, with precession electron diffraction (PED) to measure local polar displacements in non-centrosymmetric materials while suppressing artifacts from dynamical or mistilt effects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"20f15a87d486c2a06c0be6196e8b7908a05cbc45912db8a17d0d2f032c86f311","category":"Environment"}
