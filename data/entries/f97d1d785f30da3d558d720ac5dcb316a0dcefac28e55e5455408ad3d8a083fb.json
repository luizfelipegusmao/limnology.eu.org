This article provides a systematic review of publications from 1978-2022 that examine the effectiveness of residential water use restrictions as the primary demand-side management tool. Our results indicate the significant overall effect of restrictions on reducing water consumption, with an average reduction of 12.3% from the 23 studies reviewed in this article. When evaluating effect strength by restriction type (mandatory versus voluntary), voluntary restrictions have a significantly lower effect than mandatory restrictions on water use. We also find an inverse correlation between the number of irrigation days allowed and the estimated effect strength.</p>","author":"Stephen Morkel, \nMehdi Nemati","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Contemporary Water Research & Education: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b3db72dc581bb02a697df2c99e39cca4549085da8786047d814851ca018c4f9a","entryHash":"f97d1d785f30da3d558d720ac5dcb316a0dcefac28e55e5455408ad3d8a083fb","category":"Environment"}
