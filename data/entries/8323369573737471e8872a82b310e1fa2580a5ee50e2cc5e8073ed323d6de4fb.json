{"title":"Binder-type effect on the physico-mechanical, combustion and emission properties of <i>Alstonia boonei</i> De Wild. sawdust and <i>Theobroma cacao</i> L. pod biochar briquettes for energy applications","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306827","date":1722261600000,"content":"<p>by Mark Glalah, Charles Antwi-Boasiako, Derrick Adu-Gyamfi</p>\r\n\r\nEnergy application potential from the abundant biomass residues is inadequately exploited. Over-dependence on forest trees, its negative environmental impacts, and ever-rising energy costs require alternative production technologies including briquetting. The physico-mechanical and combustion properties of binderless and bindered <i>Alstonia boonei</i> sawdust and <i>Theobroma cacao</i> (cocoa) pod briquettes, carbonized in a steel kiln (at 410±5°C, and a heating rate of 4°C/min from the ambient temperature of 25°C), piston-pressed at 9.0 MPa, were studied. The binders were starch, wax, and clay. Starch-bindered <i>T</i>. <i>cacao</i> pod briquettes recorded the maximum bulk density (640 kg/cm<sup>3</sup>), while basic density was greatest for sawdust/clay briquette (433 kg/cm<sup>3</sup>). Sawdust/wax briquette produced much Water Resistance Capacity (76.76%) with safer carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (0.67 ppm). <i>A</i>. <i>boonei</i> sawdust/starch briquettes recorded the greatest calorific value (24.023 MJ/kg), least specific fuel consumption (0.0483 kg/l), and slowest burning rate (0.0005 kg/min). All but <i>T</i>. <i>cacao</i> pod/starch and Sawdust/starch emitted CO below the safe air quality Standard of ≤ 6ppm (24h mean). Binderless sawdust, sawdust/starch and <i>T</i>. <i>cacao</i> pod/starch briquettes recorded 47.86, 20.95 and 11.40 μg/m<sup>3</sup> particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) respectively, which are below WHO Air Quality Standard safe for domestic uses. Binderless <i>T</i>. <i>cacao</i> pod produced more harmful CO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> than its non-bindered <i>A</i>. <i>boonei</i> sawdust counterpart. Clay-bindered briquettes were the most durable. Briquetting, ‘a waste-to-energy technology’, enhances bio-residue management for domestic and industrial spaces in the global energy mix.","author":"Mark Glalah","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8323369573737471e8872a82b310e1fa2580a5ee50e2cc5e8073ed323d6de4fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
