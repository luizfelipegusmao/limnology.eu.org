Detection depth of dFAD echosounder buoys was divided into three layers, for estimation of biomass density in each layer based on detected water volume. Temporal variation and spatial distribution of biomass density in each layer were compared. Similarity of biomass density gravity center shifts in each layer were assessed using the dynamic time warping (DTW) regularization algorithm. Biomass density varied regularly over ~1 month, with the 2nd and 3rd layers delayed ~14 days compared to the 1st layer. Biomass distribution range and density values were higher in the 1st layer than the 2nd and 3rd layers, but locations of maximum biomass density were close. The distribution of biomass density gravity centers between adjacent water layers were similar, with gravity centers of the 2nd and 3rd layers shifted over time in relationd to the 1st layer. Our study demonstrated that the aggregation behavior of species from different water layers attracted by dFADs were related, and emphasized the necessity for ecosystem-based fisheries management.</p>","author":"Tianjiao Zhang, \nJia Xin, \nLiming Song, \nHongchun Yuan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"b7d82e4dc58ed8fe80fdf2984436df7cf6ac4fe921dda68c9f4b63b39df94a12","category":"Environment"}
