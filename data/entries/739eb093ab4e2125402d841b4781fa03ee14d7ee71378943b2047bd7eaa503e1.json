{"title":"The expansion of the Atlantic–Mediterranean ghost crab Ocypode cursor (Linnaeus, 1758): Distribution, environmental niches and future perspectives","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4119?af=R","date":1709725411000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The tufted ghost crab <i>Ocypode cursor</i> (Linnaeus, 1758) found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean is currently a great example that elucidates concerns within scientific and conservation communities. This species, native to the subtropical Atlantic Ocean and the warmest southeastern Mediterranean Sea (Egypt), has been extending its distribution in both regions since the 1980s, likely due to the warming sea temperatures. These small nocturn crabs are typically found inhabiting sandy beaches and dune environments. This species is an opportunistic predator eating terrestrial and marine prey, especially on sea turtle eggs. Despite its status as a threatened species by two European conventions, there is a lack of knowledge of its ecology and biology. Sometimes considered as an indicator of good ecological status of beaches where it lives, this ghost crab could nevertheless benefit from climate change to extend its distribution range. This review aims to create a baseline on the current knowledge and gaps in the published scientific literature on the ghost crab. Additionally, through an analysis of the existing literature, we also offer insights into the potential risk of beach erosion associated with the expansion of this species.</p>","author":"Guillaume Marchessaux, \nVojsava Gjoni, \nMario Francesco Tantillo, \nThéo Bejean, \nGianluca Sarà","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"739eb093ab4e2125402d841b4781fa03ee14d7ee71378943b2047bd7eaa503e1","category":"Environment"}
