{"title":"On Proving Ramanujan&rsquo;s Inequality Using a Sharper Bound for the Prime Counting Function &pi;(x)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0451/v2","date":1724287885000,"content":"This article provides a proof that the Ramanujan's Inequality given by,   \\begin{align*}     \\pi(x)^2 &lt; \\frac{e x}{\\log x} \\pi\\left(\\frac{x}{e}\\right)  \\end{align*} holds unconditionally for every $x\\geq \\exp(43.5102146)$. In case for an alternate proof of the result stated above, we shall exploit certain estimates involving the Chebyshev Theta Function, $\\vartheta(x)$ in order to derive appropriate bounds for $\\pi(x)$, which'll lead us to a much improved condition for the inequality proposed by Ramanujan to satisfy unconditionally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58b015797c4b0aed6a59ea7a86b0567b264c2ddcc28c944df9553f8e3c74fc16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
