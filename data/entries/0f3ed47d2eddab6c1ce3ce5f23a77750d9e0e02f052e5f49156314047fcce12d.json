{"title":"Adaptive temporal patterns of echolocation and flight behaviors used to fly through varied-sized windows by 2 species of high duty cycle bats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/69/1/32/6548798?rss=1","date":1647302400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As actively sensing animals guided by acoustic information, echolocating bats must adapt their vocalâ€“motor behavior to various environments and behavioral tasks. Here, we investigated how the temporal patterns of echolocation and flight behavior were adjusted in 2 species of bats with a high duty cycle (HDC) call structure, <span>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</span> and <span>Hipposideros armiger</span>, when they flew along a straight corridor and then passed through windows of 3 different sizes. We also tested whether divergence existed in the adaptations of the 2 species. Both <span>H. armiger</span> and <span>R. ferrumequinum</span> increased their call rates by shortening the pulse duration and inter-pulse interval for more rapid spatial sampling of the environment when flying through smaller windows. Bats produced more sonar sound groups (SSGs) while maintaining a stable proportion of calls that made up SSGs during approaches to smaller windows. The 2 species showed divergent adjustment in flight behavior across 3 different window sizes. <span>Hipposideros armiger</span> reduced its flight speed to pass through smaller windows while <span>R. ferrumequinum</span> increased its flight speed. Our results suggest that these 2 species of HDC bats adopt similar acoustic timing patterns for different tasks although they performed different flight behaviors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"0f3ed47d2eddab6c1ce3ce5f23a77750d9e0e02f052e5f49156314047fcce12d","category":"Environment"}
