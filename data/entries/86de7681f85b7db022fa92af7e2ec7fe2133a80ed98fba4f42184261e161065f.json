{"title":"Wrinkled TiNAgNW Nanocomposites for High-Performance Flexible Electrodes on TEMPO-Oxidized Nanocellulose","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0175/v1","date":1717550190000,"content":"In this study, we present a novel method for fabricating semi-transparent electrodes by combining silver nanowires (AgNW) with titanium nitride (TiN) layers, resulting in conductive nano-composite coatings with exceptional electro-mechanical properties. These nano-composites were deposited on cellulose nanopaper (CNP) using a plasma-enhanced pulsed laser deposition (PE-PLD) technique at low temperatures (below 200Â°C). Repetitive bending tests demonstrate that incorporating AgNW into TiN coatings significantly enhances the microstructure, increasing the electrodes electro-mechanical robustness by up to four orders of magnitude compared to commercial PET/ITO substrates. Furthermore, the optical and electrical conductivities can be optimized by adjusting the AgNW network density and TiN synthesis temperature. Our results also indicate that the nanocomposite electrodes exhibit improved stability in air and superior adhesion compared to bare AgNW coatings. These findings are crucial for advancing bio-compatible flexible electronics and could lead to the development of new wearable and implantable medical devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86de7681f85b7db022fa92af7e2ec7fe2133a80ed98fba4f42184261e161065f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
