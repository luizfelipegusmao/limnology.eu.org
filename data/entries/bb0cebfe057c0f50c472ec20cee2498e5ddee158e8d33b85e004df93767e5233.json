{"title":"Benefits of Badminton for Preventing Cognitive Decline and Dementia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1689/v1","date":1711545248000,"content":"Badminton is one of the most popular racket sports played by children up to the elderly worldwide. Everyone can practice and play badminton as a leisure or competitive sport, regardless of age, experience, or skill level. It does not require physical contact among players and expensive equipment. Compared with closed-skill exercise (e.g., running, swimming), open-skill exercise (e.g., badminton, table tennis) has been reported to intervene more with cognitive function and prevent cognitive decline. In this review, we outline the characteristics of badmintonâ€™s beneficial effects on physical and cognitive aspects. The characteristics presented here indicate that intervention with regular badminton exercise could effectively improve cognitive function and prevent cognitive decline in the elderly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb0cebfe057c0f50c472ec20cee2498e5ddee158e8d33b85e004df93767e5233","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
