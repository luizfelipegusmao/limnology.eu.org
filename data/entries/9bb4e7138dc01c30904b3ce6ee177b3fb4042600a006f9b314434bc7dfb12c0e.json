{"title":"Evaluation of Photodynamic Therapy as a New Therapeutic Approach Using Quinizarin-Loaded Nanocapsules: In Vitro Cytotoxicity, Permeation in 3D Bioprinted Skin Equivalent and In Vitro Cytokines Modulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1323/v1","date":1716304961000,"content":"Skin inflammation associated with chronic diseases has the direct action of keratinocytes in its immunopathogenesis, leading to a series of immune responses. However, there are still no highly targeted treatments, and the development of more specific therapies is highly desirable. In the present work, nanocapsules containing quinizarin (QZ/NC) were developed, evaluating their act in a model of the keratinocytes inflammatory process in vitro with the action of Photodynamic Therapy, analyzing the permeation in a 3D skin model. Physicochemical, stability, cytotoxicity and permeation analyses of the nanomaterials were carried out. The nanocapsules showed desirable physicochemical characteristics and were stable during the analysis period, without spectroscopic modifications. The cell viability test carried out showed no cytotoxicity at the lowest QZ/NC concentrations. The permeation and cellular uptake studies showed the permeation of QZ/NC in 3D skin models and the intracellular incorporation and internalization of the drug, enhancing its action in the drug delivery technique. Promising results were presented using the model developed to induce the inflammatory process in vitro and applying the synthesized nanomaterial in conjunction with PDT, where a decrease in the levels of cytokines analyzed was observed, representing a possible new therapeutic approach for inflammatory skin diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bb4e7138dc01c30904b3ce6ee177b3fb4042600a006f9b314434bc7dfb12c0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
