{"title":"Fourier Features and Machine Learning for the Contour Profile Inspection in CNC Milling Parts: A Novel Intelligent Inspection Method (NIIM)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0741/v1","date":1723431460000,"content":"Form deviation generated during the milling profile process poses challenges to the precision and functionality of industrial fixtures and product manufacturing across various sectors. The inspection of contour profile quality often relies on commonly employed contact methods for measuring form deviation, but these methods frequently face limitations that can impact the reliability and overall accuracy of the inspection process. This paper introduces a novel approach, the novel intelligent inspection method (NIIM), developed to accurately inspect and categorize contour profiles in machined parts manufactured through the milling process by computer numerical control (CNC) machines. The NIIM integrates a calibration piece, a vision system (RAM−StarliteTM), and machine learning techniques to analyze the line profile and classify the quality of contour profile deformation generated during CNC milling. The calibration piece is specifically designed to identify form deviations in the contour profile during the milling process. The RAM−StarliteTM vision system captures contour profile images corresponding to curves, lines, and slopes. An algorithm generates a profile signature, extracting Fourier descriptor features from the contour profile to analyze form deviations when compared to an image reference. A feed-forward neural network is employed to classify contour profiles based on quality properties. Experimental evaluations involving 60 machined calibration pieces, resulting in 356 images for training and testing, demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed NIIM for profile line tolerance inspection. Results demonstrate that the NIIM offers 96.99% accuracy, low computational requirements, 100% inspection capability, quality classification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5ec0316777202c02c27819f2abb9ef0ecff0fe4b7f22f6712ded5e31707fd06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
