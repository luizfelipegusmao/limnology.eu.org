{"title":"The Role of Interoceptive Sensitivity and Hypnotizability in Motor Imagery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0121/v1","date":1719919500000,"content":"Motor imagery requires mental representation of the body, which is obtained by the integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive information. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of interoceptive sensitivity in motor imagery performed through visual and kinesthetic modalities in participants with low (lows, N = 26), medium (mediums, N = 11) and high hypnotizability scores (highs, N = 16), measured by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form A. These groups display different motor imagery abilities and interoceptive sensitivity. The efficacy of motor imagery was measured by chronometric index and self-reported experience, and interoceptive sensitivity by the Multisensory Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire. EEG alpha and beta power spectral densities were extracted from recordings acquired during baseline, actual movement, visually and kinesthetically imagined movements. The chronometric indices did not reveal significant differences among groups and between imagery modalities. In contrast, the self-reported imagery efficacy indicated better kinesthetic imagery in highs and mediums than in lows, and no modality difference among lows. MAIA dimensions sustained the differences in sub-jective experience and almost all the EEG differences, slightly different in highs, mediums and lows. This is the first report of a major role played by interoceptive sensitivity in motor imagery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c678de6d1aab4542fa91d2d6e01326d4e8e039aa22f3706bfb6601b3dbd7cf8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
