{"title":"A Tumor Homing Peptide-Linked Arsenic Compound Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Growth and Enhances the Inhibitory Effect of Gemcitabine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0107/v1","date":1719838966000,"content":"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to inhibit pancreatic cell growth in vitro and to promote the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer in vivo. However, the high toxicity of ATO associated with the required high doses and indiscriminate targeting has limited its clinical application. This study aimed to determine whether coupling arsenic to a tumor homing peptide would increase the inhibitory potency against pancreatic cancer cells. The effects of this peptide-linked arsenic compound and ATO on pancreatic cancer growth were tested in vitro and in a mouse model. The data demonstrated that the peptide-linked arsenic compound inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth more potently with IC50 values 10 times lower than ATO. Like ATO, the peptide-linked compound induced cell death and cell cycle arrest. More importantly, the peptide-linked arsenic compound inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in mice and enhanced the inhibitory effect of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer growth at 2 times lower molar concentration than ATO. These results indicate that the peptide-linked arsenic compound inhibited pancreatic cancer more potently than ATO and suggest a potential clinical use for the combination of gemcitabine with the peptide-linked arsenic compound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2f3ac4e5c5c66d2ed8038f553d98d71f1d1d6b57b486a716c1fa52328ffa06a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
