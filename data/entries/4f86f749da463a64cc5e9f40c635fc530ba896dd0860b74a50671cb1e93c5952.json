To understand these 3D nanostructures and to guide their fabrication, the lack of rapid 3D metrology remains a critical blind spot. Though transmission electron microscopes (TEM) are the most prominent tool for investigating materials at the nanoscale resolution, they are predominantly used for 2D measurements. Furthermore, routine inspection and defect analysis of fabricated 3D nanostructures in multi-layered planar microelectronics is still limited to 2D.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4f86f749da463a64cc5e9f40c635fc530ba896dd0860b74a50671cb1e93c5952","category":"Environment"}
