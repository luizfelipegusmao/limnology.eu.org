{"title":"MutL homolog 1 participates in interference-sensitive meiotic crossover formation in soybean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2579/7630459?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), a member of the MutL homolog family, is required for normal recombination in most organisms. However, its role in soybean (<span>Glycine max</span>) remains unclear to date. Here, we characterized the <span>Glycine max female and male sterility 1</span> (<span>Gmfms1</span>) mutation that reduces pollen grain viability and increases embryo sac abortion in soybean. Map-based cloning revealed that the causal gene of <span>Gmfms1</span> is <span>Glycine max MutL homolog 1</span> (<span>GmMLH1</span>), and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout approach further validated that disruption of <span>GmMLH1</span> confers the female–male sterility phenotype in soybean. Loss of <span>GmMLH1</span> function disrupted bivalent formation, leading to univalent mis-segregation during meiosis and ultimately to female–male sterility. The <span>Gmmlh1</span> mutant showed about a 78.16% decrease in meiotic crossover frequency compared to the wild type. The residual chiasmata followed a Poisson distribution, suggesting that interference-sensitive crossover formation was affected in the <span>Gmmlh1</span> mutant. Furthermore, GmMLH1 could interact with GmMLH3A and GmMLH3B both in vivo and in vitro. Overall, our work demonstrates that GmMLH1 participates in interference-sensitive crossover formation in soybean, and provides additional information about the conserved functions of <span>MLH1</span> across plant species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5257e946bba446413d44f6e324ac2652e41c48b451b5042c7389e8fa291b7966","category":"Environment"}
