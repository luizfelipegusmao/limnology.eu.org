{"title":"The Influence of Sodium Benzoate as Corrosion Inhibitor on Physical and Mechanical Properties of Concrete: Kinetics Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0507/v1","date":1723032088000,"content":"This research aims to explore the use of sodium benzoate C6H5-COOH as corrosion inhibitor added to the mixing water of concrete, and test the mechanical performances of five types of concretes over several time periods, 7, 28, 56 and 90 days, in the absence and in the presence of limestone fillers. Hence the results confirm the increase in this resistance over time. Through this, tests were carried out cement paste after addition of sodium benzoate and limestone fillers, we see clearly that the start and the and setting time of cement shift out considerably which indicates that sodium benzoate aims to delay start and end setting time of cement. In addition, Abrams cone slump tests on concrete in the fresh state were carried out in order to see the influence of the addition of sodium benzoate and tests on the cement consistencies in the absence and presence of superplasticizing adjuvant “ORAFLOW THM 17200” which has the main role of improving the workability and quality of the concrete while comparing with ordinary concrete.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95d7f0cbbeae85f971a831761d732858d69533a2d1937a967f629af0bb8b84ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
