{"title":"Financial Contagion between Eurozone and BRICS Stock Markets under Multiscale Scrutiny","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1986/v1","date":1717063257000,"content":"We use the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) to analyse the interconnectedness between the stock markets of continental Europe and the BRICS countries. More specifically, we examine the presence of financial contagion in the stock markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa subsequent to the EuroZone Sovereign Debt Crisis (EZDC). We find evidence of co-movement and volatility spillover at short time scales between the Eurozone equity market and the equity markets in South Africa and Russia, with the Eurozone stock market leading the BRICS markets. The presence of co-movement in short time scales is indicative of the presence of financial contagion. No financial contagion is observed in the Brazilian, Chinese, and Indian stock markets during the European sovereign debt crisis. The absence of financial contagion observed in these three BRICS countries during the European sovereign debt crisis suggests that policymakers in these countries should prioritise addressing idiosyncratic shock channels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"196881be6e1d4022de372c296053b164cc87f88e770d526f5bf1c20f8701b220","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
