{"title":"Effects of arabinoxylan extracted from vinegar residue on physicochemical and structural properties of gluten proteins obtained from freeze–thaw wheat dough","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13983?af=R","date":1729683569000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Arabinoxylan is commonly used as a hydrocolloid in frozen dough to improve the texture and the sensory qualities of the products. The effects of vinegar residue arabinoxylan (VRAX) on the secondary structures and microstructures of gluten proteins during freeze–thaw storage were studied, and the underlying mechanism governing these effects was clarified.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results revealed that VRAX improved the textural properties of gluten proteins, but had a negative impact on their viscoelasticity. Additionally, the addition of VRAX increased the number of disulfide bonds and also improved the freezing tolerance of the gluten proteins. It was found that the enthalpy of the gluten proteins decreased by 19.78% following VRAX addition. As a result of the use of VRAX, the freezing procedure resulted in reduced formation of ice crystals, protecting the gluten network structure and preserving the dough's elasticity. The network structure of gluten proteins after VRAX treatment was more ordered and integrated relative to that of frozen blank control gluten proteins.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, the freeze–thaw stability of the gluten proteins was enhanced by VRAX. These results suggest that VRAX has potential as an effective cryoprotectant in frozen dough. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuanyuan Zhu, \nQian Yan, \nYongjian Yu, \nKe Wang, \nZhen Yu, \nYuqin Wang, \nPeng Liu, \nDong Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"96620f6ef822f681bc7992334e5d330eb4f147b3f4d7e106223fa7c67f6134fb","category":"Environment"}
