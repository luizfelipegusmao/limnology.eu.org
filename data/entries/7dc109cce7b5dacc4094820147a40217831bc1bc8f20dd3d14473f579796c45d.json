{"title":"Modern Interpretation of Banjarese Traditional House Design: A Case Study of Bubungan Tinggi&rsquo;s Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0186/v2","date":1718704203000,"content":"This the term \"Bubungan Tinggi\" (High Roof) in this study refers to the banjarese traditional house. A significant artifact in South Kalimantan is called Bubungan Tinggi. With its unique typology and anatomy, this particular building has evolved into an iconic structure that symbolizes the collective memory of the Banjarese people. This research aims to showcase the versatility of the Bubungan Tinggi design in modern architecture by exploring different transformation models. By applying various techniques and approaches, the study provides insights into how this traditional Banjarese character can be adapted for new house designs. The Bubungan Tinggi's transformation process reveals characteristics in its fundamental components, which are distinguished by their geometric objects. Experimental design is the methodology employed in this study. This methodology shows that a variety of transformation models may be carried out by introducing and identifying the Bubungan Tinggi, observing objects in case studies, using transformation techniques and their application, and creating transformation models. This research produced a variety of modeling results that illustrated new interpretations of bubungan tinggi's in modern house design. The incorporation of traditional elements like the bubungan tinggi in modern house design can help preserve cultural heritage while also creating unique and innovative architectural solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7dc109cce7b5dacc4094820147a40217831bc1bc8f20dd3d14473f579796c45d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
