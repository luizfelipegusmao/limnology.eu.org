Changes in the acoustic emissions of resident bottlenose dolphins in the proximity of vessels","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13090?af=R","date":1712234898000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maritime traffic is a major contributor of anthropogenic disturbance for cetaceans, especially for coastal populations, such as that of resident common bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) in the Sado estuary (Portugal). Animals have been found to adjust their vocal behavior by changing vocal rates, or call frequency and/or duration, to overcome masking effects of underwater noise. To evaluate the potential impacts of boat traffic on the acoustic behavior of these dolphins, emission rates and acoustic characteristics of whistles and burst-pulsed signals were analyzed with and without boats operating nearby. In this study, no significant differences were found for emission rates of each type of vocal element in the presence of vessels. However, significant differences were found in acoustic parameters, namely changes in frequency and duration, for whistles and for pulsed sounds (creaks, grunts, squeaks, and gulps). These changes, such as a shift in vocal frequencies and production of shorter signals, may represent behavioral strategies to compensate for the noisy environment. Although resident bottlenose dolphins in the Sado region seem to have developed some tolerance to vessel noise, continuous noise exposure and noise-induced frequency shifts in vocal outputs could have indirect fitness costs for this population.</p>","author":"Filipa V.
