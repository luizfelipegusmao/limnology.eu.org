{"title":"Method of Safety-Related Software Development and Its Verification &amp; Validation for Small Digital Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1038/v1","date":1718787111000,"content":"This paper proposes a methodology for the development and its Verification and Validation(V&amp;amp;V) of safety-rated software. The development methodology is based on the structured analysis and structured design methodology, which has been proven in the field of safety software development during long period. The suggested the development and the V&amp;amp;V methodology additionally focuses on the quality attributes 3C+T (completeness, Correctness, Consistency and traceability), which are important criteria in IEC international standards. The software development life cycle is compiled from IEC international standardization, which are of the requirements analysis phase, design phase, implementation phase, testing phase, installation/commissioning phase, and operation &amp;amp; maintenance phases. The activities of the development process method were defined from requirements analysis to implementation, and the activities of the verification and validation were defined to include the scope of the developer's activities and then to include the test phase, installation/commissioning phase, and operation phases additionally. In other words, testing phase performed by the developer was defined as informal testing, and testing performed by the verifier according to test criteria, test plans, and test procedures was defined as formal testing. According to proposed methodology, the requirements phase defines the sequence of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)-Context Diagram-Data Flow Diagram (DFD), functional decomposition process and defines operational scenario. In the design phase, module design such as task analysis and task allocation were defined. In the implementation phase, we listed the coding guidelines that must be followed for safety-related system. The test phase defined the test criteria, test plan, test procedure, and test result report activities. In the installation/commissioning and operation phases, recommendations for improving reliability, quality, and safety were proposed for deliverables such as user documentation and technical documentation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39ae653101e17cd4f216603d244eaa86e246c5a4d5366802305de9e32da67e98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
