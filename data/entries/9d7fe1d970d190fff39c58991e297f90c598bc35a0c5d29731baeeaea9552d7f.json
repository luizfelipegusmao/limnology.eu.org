{"title":"Urinary L-FABP as an Early Biomarker for Pediatric Acute Kidney Injury Following Cardiac Surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0155/v1","date":1712041437000,"content":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) following surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB-AKI) is common in pediatrics. Urinary liver-type fatty acid binding protein (uL-FABP) increases in some kidney diseases and may indicate CPB-AKI earlier than current methods. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the potential role of uL-FABP in early predicting CPB-AKI. Databases Pubmed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched on November 12th, 2023, using the MeSH terms “Children”, “CPB”, “L-FABP”, and “Acute Kidney Injury”. Included papers were revised. AUC values from similar studies were pooled by meta-analysis, performed using random- and fixed-effect models, with p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d7fe1d970d190fff39c58991e297f90c598bc35a0c5d29731baeeaea9552d7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
