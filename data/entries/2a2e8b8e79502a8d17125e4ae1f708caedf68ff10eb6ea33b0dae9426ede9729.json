{"title":"Maternal Behavioral Patterns and Their Impact on Fetal Development Trajectories","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0624/v1","date":1725863297000,"content":"Poor perinatal mental health can have significant and lasting impacts on a woman’s overall health and the well-being of her children and family. From conception, a baby's behavior, appearance, aversions, and interests can be influenced by the prenatal environment. Thus, the quality of prenatal care is crucial. Factors such as maternal stress, environmental conditions, cravings, mood swings, hormonal changes, and emotional experiences during pregnancy can profoundly affect the baby’s behavior once born. The baby's interaction with the external world begins from conception, not just at birth. For instance, maternal depression can negatively affect both the mental and physical health of the infant. Therefore, fostering a supportive environment for expectant mothers is essential for their health and that of their unborn child. Promoting the mother’s well-being through happiness and comfort is critical.This review paper aims to synthesize current research on maternal-fetal attachment during pregnancy, its evolution, and its postpartum effects on the mother-infant relationship. It will explore how these dynamics change over time, both during pregnancy and after delivery, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing attachment and related outcomes. As Alan Soufre, a famous developmental psychologist would state, \"Attachment would begin before birth. The mother’s emotional state can shape the child’s development trajectory long before the child is born.\"","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a2e8b8e79502a8d17125e4ae1f708caedf68ff10eb6ea33b0dae9426ede9729","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
