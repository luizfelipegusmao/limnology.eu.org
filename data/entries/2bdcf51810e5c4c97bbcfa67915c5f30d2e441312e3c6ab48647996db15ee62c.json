{"title":"Polymicrobial bloodstream infections a risk factor for mortality in neonates at the national hospital, Tanzania: A case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302076","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Joel Manyahi, Agricola Joachim, Frank Msafiri, Mary Migiro, Anthon Mwingwa, Mabula Kasubi, Helga Naburi, Mtebe Venance Majigo</p>\r\nBackground <p>Polymicrobial bloodstream infections (BSI) are difficult to treat since empiric antibiotics treatment are frequently less effective against multiple pathogens. The study aimed to compare outcomes in patients with polymicrobial and monomicrobial BSIs.</p> Methods <p>The study was a retrospective case-control design conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital for data processed between July 2021 and June 2022. Cases were patients with polymicrobial BSI, and controls had monomicrobial BSI. Each case was matched to three controls by age, admitting ward, and duration of admission. Logistic regression was performed to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital and 30-day mortality.</p> Results <p>Fifty patients with polymicrobial BSI and 150 with monomicrobial BSI were compared: the two arms had no significant differences in sex and comorbidities. The most frequent bacteria in polymicrobial BSI were <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> 17% (17/100) and <i>Enterobacter</i> species 15% (15/100). In monomicrobial BSI, <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> 17.33% (26/150), <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> 16.67% (25/150), and <i>Acinetobacter</i> species 15% (15/150) were more prevalent. Overall, isolates were frequently resistant to multiple antibiotics tested, and 52% (130/250) were multidrug resistance. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality were 33.5% (67/200) and 36% (72/200), respectively. On multivariable analysis, polymicrobial BSIs were independent risk factors for both in-hospital mortality (aOR 2.37, 95%CI 1.20–4.69, p = 0.01) and 30-day mortality (aOR 2.05, 95%CI 1.03–4.08), p = 0.04). In sub-analyses involving only neonates, polymicrobial BSI was an independent risk factor for both 30-day mortality (aOR 3.13, 95%CI 1.07–9.10, p = 0.04) and in-hospital mortality (aOR 5.08, 95%CI 1.60–16.14, p = 0.006). Overall, the median length of hospital stay post-BSIs was numerically longer in patients with polymicrobial BSIs.</p> Conclusion <p>Overall, polymicrobial BSI was a significant risk for mortality. Patients with polymicrobial BSI stay longer at the hospital than those with monomicrobial BSI. These findings call for clinicians to be more aggressive in managing polymicrobial BSI.</p>","author":"Joel Manyahi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2bdcf51810e5c4c97bbcfa67915c5f30d2e441312e3c6ab48647996db15ee62c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
