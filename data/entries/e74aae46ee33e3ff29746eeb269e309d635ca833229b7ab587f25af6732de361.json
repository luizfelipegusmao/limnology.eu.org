{"title":"Integrated analysis revealing novel associations between dietary patterns and the immune system in older adults","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyae010/7685005?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>With the expanding ageing population, there is a growing interest in the maintenance of immune health to support healthy ageing. Enthusiasm exists for unravelling the impact of diet on the immune system and its therapeutic potential. However, a key challenge is the lack of studies investigating the effect of dietary patterns and nutrients on immune responses. Thus, we have used an integrative analysis approach to improve our understanding of diet–immune system interactions in older adults. To do so, dietary data were collected in parallel with performing immunophenotyping and functional assays from healthy older (n = 40) participants. Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was utilised to derive food group intake and multi-colour flow cytometry was performed for immune phenotypic and functional analysis. Spearman correlation revealed the strength of association between all combinations of dietary components, micronutrients, and hallmarks of immunesenescence. In this study, we propose for the first time that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a positive immune-ageing trajectory (Lower IMM-AGE score) in older adults due to the immune protective effects of high dietary fibre and PUFA intake in combating accumulation or pro-inflammatory senescent T cells. Furthermore, a diet rich in Vit A, Vit B6 and Vit B12 is associated with fewer features of immunesenescence [such as accumulation of terminally differentiated memory CD8 T cells] in older adults. Based on our findings we propose a future nutrition-based intervention study evaluating the efficacy of adherence to the MED diet alongside a multi-nutrient supplementation on immune ageing in older adults to set reliable dietary recommendations with policymakers that can be given to geriatricians and older adults.<div><strong>Insight box:</strong> There is a growing interest in the maintenance of immune health to boost healthy ageing. However, a key challenge is the lack of studies investigating the effect of dietary patterns and nutrients on immune responses. Thus, to do so we collected dietary data in parallel with performing immunophenotyping and functional assays on healthy older (n = 40) participants, followed by an integrative analysis approach to improve our understanding of diet–immune system interactions in older adults. We strongly believe that these new findings are appropriate for IB and will be of considerable interest to its broad audience.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"e74aae46ee33e3ff29746eeb269e309d635ca833229b7ab587f25af6732de361","category":"Environment"}
