{"title":"A comprehensive sampling of mitogenomes shows the utility to infer phylogeny of termites (Blattodea: Termitoidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae029/7630386?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The mitogenome sequence data have been widely used in inferring the phylogeny of insects. In this study, we determined the complete mitogenome for <span>Macrotermes</span> sp. (Termitidae, Macrotermitinae) using next-generation sequencing. <span>Macrotermes</span> sp. possesses a typical insect mitogenome, displaying an identical gene order and gene content to other existing termite mitogenomes. We present the first prediction of the secondary structure of ribosomal RNA genes in termites. The rRNA secondary structures of <span>Macrotermes</span> sp. exhibit similarities to closely related insects and also feature distinctive characteristics in their helical structures. Together with 321 published mitogenomes of termites as ingroups and 8 cockroach mitogenomes as outgroups, we compiled the most comprehensive mitogenome sequence matrix for Termitoidae to date. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using datasets employing different data coding strategies and various inference methods. Robust relationships were recovered at the family or subfamily level, demonstrating the utility of comprehensive mitogenome sampling in resolving termite phylogenies. The results supported the monophyly of Termitoidae, and consistent relationships within this group were observed across different analyses. Mastotermitidae was consistently recovered as the sister group to all other termite families. The families Hodotermitidae, Stolotermitidae, and Archotermopsidae formed the second diverging clade, followed by the Kalotermitidae. The Neoisoptera was consistently supported with strong node support, with Stylotermitidae being sister to the remaining families. Rhinotermitidae was found to be non-monophyletic, and Serritermitidae nested within the basal clades of Rhinotermitidae and was sister to Psammotermitinae. Overall, our phylogenetic results are largely consistent with earlier mitogenome studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"07abc4a469ddb1261e5ea7227cfc5c1c14b65635fb4706302c6dd6abfbae62ad","category":"Environment"}
