{"title":"Time Out: Architecture as a Refuge from the Temporal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0769/v1","date":1723452498000,"content":"Indications of the passage of time are indirect reminders of our mortality. Humans have often responded to this discomforting thought by attempting, temporally at least, to escape its relentless march through the notion of a timeless present. This essay explores how architecture can assist us in that objective. It suggests that there are at least three different ways that buildings can offer us temporary psychological refuge from the progress of time. They can include the fascination of seemingly timeless natural movement patterns. They can recall archetypal environments, and they can isolate us from the external world of perpetual temporal progress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7723b761df14188889aa1abf9666a98b14928396474edefeb8de5da4eb3c012f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
