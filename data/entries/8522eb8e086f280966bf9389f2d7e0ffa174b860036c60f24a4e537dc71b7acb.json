{"title":"Power Flow in Pseudo-Coupled Three-Row Cylindrical Series-Parallel Planetary Gear Systems. Part II: Without Power Losses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0441/v1","date":1718087075000,"content":"Part II, like Part I, discusses geometry, kinematics and statics in detail without taking into account power losses in meshing. The main goal of Part II, however, is to prove that there are complex and structurally coupled planetary gear systems, i.e. containing a closed circuit in which no circulation of power flow is generated. The power flow analysis is also carried out using the direct method, with a slight modification in the way of writing the equations identifying active and passive gears, i.e. at the same time the directions of power flow on all transmission paths. The analysed planetary gear system (PGS) is characterised by mobility equal to 1, i.e. single degree of freedom (DoF). It consists of three subsystems in the form of the 2KH type planetary units connected in series-parallel, specially selected to demonstrate the thesis of this paper. It consists of three subsystems in the form of single planetary subsystems of the 2KH type connected series-parallel, specially chosen to illustrate the thesis of this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8522eb8e086f280966bf9389f2d7e0ffa174b860036c60f24a4e537dc71b7acb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
