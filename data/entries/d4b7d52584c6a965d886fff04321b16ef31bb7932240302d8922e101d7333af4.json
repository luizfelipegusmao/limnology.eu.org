{"title":"Supercritical carbon dioxide systems for sustainable and efficient dissolution of solutes: a review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-023-01681-4","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Green chemistry aims at replacing toxic solvents by safer solvents such as supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>), which displays zero surface tension, outstanding transport properties, high diffusivity, and tuned solubilization by changing the pressure and temperature, or adding cosolvents. Nonetheless, the practical application of scCO<sub>2</sub>-based technologies under supercritical conditions requires sophisticated systems for optimal operation. Here, we review scCO<sub>2</sub>-based systems with focus on dyeing, extraction, chromatographic, and cleaning systems. All scCO<sub>2</sub>-based systems consist of a CO<sub>2</sub> supply and pumpÂ part, a cosolvent providing part, and a parameters controlling part, yet there are different reaction vessels depending on solute types and practical functions. Developing more normalized, intelligentized, and durable scCO<sub>2</sub>-based systems should render the scCO<sub>2</sub>-based technologies be more economic, controllable, flexible, and suitable for wider applications.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"d4b7d52584c6a965d886fff04321b16ef31bb7932240302d8922e101d7333af4","category":"Environment"}
