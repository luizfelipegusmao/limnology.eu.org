{"title":"The Impact of Foreign Language Exposure on Early Childhood Language Development: A Critical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1216/v1","date":1716213276000,"content":"This critical review delves into the often-overlooked aspect of early childhood language development: the potential impact of exposure to foreign languages. While multilingualism is widely celebrated for its cognitive and cultural benefits, emerging research suggests that early exposure to foreign languages may pose challenges for young children's linguistic development. The review synthesizes findings from 17 studies to explore the complexities surrounding this issue, including linguistic confusion, language delay, reduced vocabulary growth, impaired language processing, and socio-emotional implications. Additionally, mitigating factors and future directions for research and intervention are discussed. By shedding light on this topic, the review aims to inform educators, parents, and policymakers about the nuances of bilingual language acquisition and the importance of providing tailored support to optimize early childhood language development in multilingual contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1877f05b4ea21bb1d573f4cb32cafbe532e03e5f17466667bc1f73dce1c09690","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
