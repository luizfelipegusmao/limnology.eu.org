{"title":"Prolonged Visual Evoked Potential Latencies in Dogs Naturally Infected with Canine Distemper Virus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1362/v1","date":1726655695000,"content":"Canine distemper (CD) is a deadly, multi-system infection caused by a Morbillivirus. The Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) frequently affects the nervous system with demyelinating leukoenceph-alitis, the most common neurological manifestation. The disease has been linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans due to the similar clinical presentation and pathophysiological mecha-nisms. In MS, visual evoked potentials (VEP) have been identified as a reliable marker for disease progression, enabling early detection of clinically suspected lesions. The aim of this study was to determine if there are any abnormalities in VEP responses in dogs with neurological CD. Visual evoked potentials and Electroretinogram (ERG) were recorded at both the cranial and spinal levels in dogs naturally infected with CDV and in healthy dogs. The results revealed a bilateral increase in the latency of N1, P1, N2, P2 and N3 waves of the VEP, without any alterations in their amplitudes. No significant differences were observed in the ERG, between both groups. These results suggest that altered VEP responses could serve as an early diagnostic indicator of neu-rological damage caused by distemper. Therefore, conducting these studies could potentially aid in the detection of central nervous conduction disorders during the subclinical phases of the disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1612ac5287dde8fd0db269aea5df16394569020ff71eea1c387e1b726f7c8a41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
