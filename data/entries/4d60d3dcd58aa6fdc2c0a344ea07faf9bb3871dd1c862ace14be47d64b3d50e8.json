However, little is known about soil P availability and its biological acquisition strategies in permafrost environment.\n\nBased on a large-scale survey along a ~1000 km transect, combining with shotgun metagenomics, we provided the first attempt to explore soil microbial P acquisition strategies across the Tibetan alpine permafrost region.\n\nOur results showed the widespread existence of microbial functional genes associated with inorganic P solubilization, organic P mineralization and transportation, reflecting divergent microbial P acquisition strategies in permafrost regions. Moreover, the higher gene abundance related to solubilization and mineralization as well as an increased ration of metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) carrying these genes were detected in the active layer, while the greater abundance of low-affinity transporter gene (<i>pit</i>) and proportions of MAGs harbouring <i>pit</i> gene were observed in permafrost deposits, illustrating a stronger potential for P activation in active layer but an enhanced P transportation potential in permafrost deposits.\n\nOur results highlight multiple P-related acquisition strategies and their differences among various soil layers should be considered simultaneously to improve model prediction for the responses of biogeochemical cycles in permafrost ecosystems to climate change.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/06/21/divergent-microbial-phosphorous-acquisition-strategies-between-active-layer-and-permafrost-deposits-on-the-tibetan-plateau/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Lu Wang, \nDianye Zhang, \nLuyao Kang, \nZiliang Li, \nYuanhe Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"4d60d3dcd58aa6fdc2c0a344ea07faf9bb3871dd1c862ace14be47d64b3d50e8","category":"Environment"}
