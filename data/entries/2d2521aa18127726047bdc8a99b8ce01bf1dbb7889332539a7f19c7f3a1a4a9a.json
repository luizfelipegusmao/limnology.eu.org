This study focuses on individuals aged 30-75+ to understand the prevalence, severity, and impact of these symptoms. By exploring their lasting consequences and potential risk factors, we aim to provide valuable insights for healthcare and mental health professionals, guiding the development of effective support systems to address the psychological aftermath of COVID-19. In this study, a quantitative research design was used to investigate the effects of depressive and anxiety behaviors in patients aged 30-75+ who had experienced COVID-19. The research employed a cross-sectional approach, collecting data at a specific time to assess the prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the target population. A total of 422 patients were recruited through convenience sampling from various sources, including healthcare facilities, community organizations, and online platforms. Inclusion criteria encompassed individuals aged 30-75+ who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had recovered from the infection. Those with pre-existing mental health conditions significantly affecting depressive and anxiety symptoms were excluded. The sample was diverse in terms of age, gender, employment status, education level, marital status, and past chronic problems. Data collection involved administering standardized questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive behaviors and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) for anxiety behaviors. These questionnaires assessed symptom severity, while demographic variables were collected separately. The collected data underwent analysis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, encompassing descriptive statistics, reliability assessments, normality tests, non-parametric tests for demographic comparisons, correlation analyses, and linear regression. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained, ensuring participant confidentiality and data privacy. Several limitations were acknowledged, including the cross-sectional design's inability to establish causal relationships, potential selection bias due to convenience sampling, susceptibility to response biases with self-report measures, and assumptions and limitations inherent in statistical tests. Overall, the study aimed to provide insights into the effects of depressive and anxiety behaviors in COVID-19 survivors aged 30-75+ and contribute to the development of targeted interventions and support services for this population. This study explored the impact of depressive and anxiety behaviors in COVID-19 survivors aged 30-75+. It involved data collection through validated questionnaires and rigorous statistical analysis. The findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions and support systems to address the long-term psychological effects of the pandemic. Healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers must collaborate to prioritize mental well-being and allocate resources accordingly, ultimately improving the quality of life for survivors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d2521aa18127726047bdc8a99b8ce01bf1dbb7889332539a7f19c7f3a1a4a9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
