The mode of choline supplementation, <i>via</i> diet and additional sources, synthetic and natural, and the data of performance, carcass quality, blood parameters, and hepatic steatosis were compared. A total of 1050 day-old male Cobb 500 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 10 treatments, using a completely randomized design model in a factorial scheme, with 6 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. Choline was supplemented using three sources: synthetic choline chloride 60% (CC), and two sources of natural choline A (NCA), and B (NCB). The Control treatment did not receive any choline supplementation. The diets were supplemented with low, intermediate and high doses of choline sources (400g/t, 800g/t, and 1200g/t of CC; 100g/t, 200g/t, and 300g/t of both NCA and NCB). Data analysis was performed using a factorial model to investigate the effects of choline supplementation (CC, NCA, NCB) and doses on the measured variables. Overall, the results indicated that the the performance of NCA was better than CC &amp; NCB, specifically the dose of 100g/t of NCA outperformed MAR at 100g/t &amp; CC at 400g/t, leading to a significant increase in body weight gain (85.66g &amp; 168.84g respectively), and a noteworthy (9- &amp; 12-point respectively) improvement in feed conversion ratio. Furthermore, NCA contributed to a reduction in steatosis when contrasted with various NCB &amp; CC doses, likely due to the presence of curcumins and catechins in the natural choline source. These findings demonstrated that NCA supplementation yielded superior results compared to CC and NCB across both performance and liver health aspects in broilers aged 1 to 42 days. In conclusion, NCA can be used to replace the CC 60% without compromise on the zootechnical performance in broilers.","author":"Matheus Ramalho de Lima","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c86ba45a2da7bfbba6833345ada20ca2771edcef1cba2f737d68af4bb040864e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
