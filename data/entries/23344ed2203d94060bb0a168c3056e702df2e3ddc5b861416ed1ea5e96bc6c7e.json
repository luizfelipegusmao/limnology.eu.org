{"title":"Three Cubes Packing for All Dimensions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1460/v1","date":1713802719000,"content":"Let Vn(d) denote the least number such that every collection of nd-cubes with total volume 1 in d-dimensional (Euclidean) space can be packed parallelly into some d-box of volume Vn(d). We show that V3(d)=r1−dd if d≥11 and V3(d)=1r+1rd+1r−rd+1 if 2≤d≤10, where r is the only solution of the equation 2(d−1)kd+dkd−1=1 on 22,1 and (k+1)d(1−k)d−1dk2+d+k−1=kddkd+1+dkd+kd+1 on 22,1, respectively. The maximum volume is achieved by hypercubes with edges x, y, z such that x=2rd+1−1/d, y=z=rx if d≥11, and x=rd+(1r−r)d+1−1/d, y=rx, z=(1r−r)x if 2≤d≤10. We also proved that only for dimensions less than 11 there are two different maximum packings, and for all dimensions greater than 10 the maximum packing has the two smallest cubes the same.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23344ed2203d94060bb0a168c3056e702df2e3ddc5b861416ed1ea5e96bc6c7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
