{"title":"Leaf Vein Analysis of Different Plant Species Using Multifractal Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0412/v1","date":1728292874000,"content":"Understanding plant species and community status is the most fundamental step in assessing biodiversity and considering environmental conservation, and these depend on the identification of plant species. Plant identification is usually done manually using botanical illustrations, but due to the diversity of plant species, identifying a single species from among many candidates listed in illustrated books is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, even for experts. Against this background, systems for automatic plant species recognition are in demand by experts and amateurs alike. In this study, we proposed a method for automatic plant identification by applying multifractal analysis to images of leaf veins, including veinlets. In the experiment, we conducted two experiments: one to see if there is a change in the number of dimensions depending on the degree of leaf growth, and the other to see how the number of dimensions changes depending on the taxonomic group. As a result, there was almost no change depending on the degree of growth, and the number of dimensions varied depending on the taxonomic group, suggesting that different taxonomic groups can be classified into different taxonomic groups, suggesting that multifractal analysis can be applied to leaf vein images, including veinlets, to enable automatic plant identification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b0c31482a7ec642af3c15374bb6829390d47e8b66b3330818e3b737f9deb393","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
