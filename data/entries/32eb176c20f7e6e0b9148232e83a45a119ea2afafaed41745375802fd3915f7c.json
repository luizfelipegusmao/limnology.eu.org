{"title":"Induced Scratches and Fatigue in Aircraft-Grade Aluminium Alloys. A Statistical Analysis on the UTS and Elongation at Break","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1962/v1","date":1724759006000,"content":"The present study analyses the influence of scratches and fatigue on the mechanical characteristics of aluminium alloys commonly used in the aviation industry: 2024-T4, 6061-T4, 6061-T4 uncoated, 6061-T6 uncoated, 7075-T0, and 7076-T6. 120 specimens were used for the study. Out of these, 60 samples were scratched, and the other 60 samples were also scratched under the same circumstances and then subjected to low-cycle fatigue (LCF) before undergoing the tensile test. Based on the statistical examination of the measured data, mathematical prediction models have been established. Compared to their unscratched counterparts, the results indicate a significant decrease in the mechanical properties of both scratched and scratched-fatigued sample sets. The LCF pre-treatment contributes to the negative impacts of scratches, resulting in a reduced value for the ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break. The results conclude that surface integrity plays an essential role in preserving aircraft components' structural strength.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32eb176c20f7e6e0b9148232e83a45a119ea2afafaed41745375802fd3915f7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
