{"title":"Development of an <i>in vivo</i> syngeneic mouse transplant model of invasive intestinal adenocarcinoma driven by endogenous expression of <i>Pik3ca</i><sup>H1047R</sup> and <i>Apc</i> loss","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308051","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Francesc de las Heras, Camilla B. Mitchell, William K. Murray, Nicholas J. Clemons, Wayne A. Phillips</p>\r\n\r\nPreclinical models that replicate patient tumours as closely as possible are crucial for translational cancer research. While <i>in vitro</i> cancer models have many advantages in assessing tumour response therapy, <i>in vivo</i> systems are essential to enable evaluation of the role of the tumour cell extrinsic factors, such as the tumour microenvironment and host immune system. The requirement for a functional immune system is particularly important given the current focus on immunotherapies. Therefore, we set out to generate an immunocompetent, transplantable model of colorectal cancer suitable for <i>in vivo</i> assessment of immune-based therapeutic approaches. Intestinal tumours from a genetically engineered mouse model, driven by expression of a <i>Pik3ca</i> mutation and loss of <i>Apc</i>, were transplanted into wild type C57BL/6 host mice and subsequently passaged to form a novel syngeneic transplant model of colorectal cancer. Our work confirms the potential to develop a panel of mouse syngeneic grafts, akin to human PDX panels, from different genetically engineered, or carcinogen-induced, mouse models. Such panels would allow the <i>in vivo</i> testing of new pharmaceutical and immunotherapeutic treatment approaches across a range of tumours with a variety of genetic driver mutations.","author":"Francesc de las Heras","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3e8c86f7a6835ec3dec039a4cda6736f4a02d87a85ef7a896a3f58b7249891ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
