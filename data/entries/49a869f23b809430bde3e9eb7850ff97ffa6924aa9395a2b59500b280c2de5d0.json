{"title":"Analysis of EU&rsquo;s Coupled Carbon and Electricity Market Development Based on GPT Large Model and Applications in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1677/v1","date":1729581817000,"content":"With increasing global attention on carbon emission control, the carbon market has become an important tool for carbon emission regulation. As an important part of energy trading, the electricity market is closely related to the carbon market. Given the relative maturity of the EU carbon market and electricity market, this paper identifies key points of market volatility through the Coupling coordination model analysis, and uses the GPT large model analysis to analyze policy factors that have a greater impact on carbon market and electricity market transactions. The research results show that market-regulating policies and expectation management policies have the greatest impact on the degree of coupling between the carbon and electricity markets. The impact of secondary policies such as international cooperation policies and structural adjustment policies is relatively insignificant. Although the development of China's carbon market faces many challenges, reasonable policy interventions are expected to achieve significant results in the domestic carbon market. Finally, this paper also draws on analogy analysis to draw corresponding implications for China from the EU's carbon-electricity coupling policy promulgation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49a869f23b809430bde3e9eb7850ff97ffa6924aa9395a2b59500b280c2de5d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
