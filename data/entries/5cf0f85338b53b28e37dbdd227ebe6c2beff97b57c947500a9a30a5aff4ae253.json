{"title":"A Rationally Designed H5 Hemagglutinin Subunit Vaccine Provides Broad-Spectrum Protection against Various H5Nx highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Chickens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1019/v1","date":1720766553000,"content":"The evolution of the H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses has led to the emergence of distinct groups with genetically similar clusters of hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. In this study, a consensus H5 HA sequence was cloned into the baculovirus expression system. The HA protein was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and utilized as the antigen for the production of an oil emulsion-based H5 avian influenza vaccine (rBacH5Con5Mut). 21-day old SPF chickens were immunized with this vaccine and then challenged at 21 days post-vaccination (dpv) with clade 2.3.2.1, clade 2.3.4.4 and clade 7.2 of H5 HPAI virus, respectively. The chicken sera of vaccinated chickens exhibited high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against the rBacH5 vaccine antigen, while lower HI titers were observed against the different challenge virus H5 hemagglutinins. Furthermore, the rBacH5Con5Mut vaccine provided 100% protection from mortality and clinical signs. Virus isolation results showed that oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding was prevented in 100% of the vaccinated chickens when challenged with clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses. When the rBacH5Con5Mut vaccine candidate was administrated at one day of age, 100% protection was demonstrated against challenge of clade 2.3.4.4 virus at 3 weeks of age, indicating the potential of this vaccine for hatchery vaccination. Overall, the rBacH5Con5Mut vaccine candidate with a consensus HA antigen and a single dose can protect chickens against different clades of H5 HPAI viruses throughout the rearing period of broiler chickens without a boost, thus fulfilling the criteria for an efficacious broad-spectrum H5 avian influenza vaccine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cf0f85338b53b28e37dbdd227ebe6c2beff97b57c947500a9a30a5aff4ae253","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
