{"title":"The evolution of ontogenetic “decision-making” in the wood of a clade of tropical plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/3/480/7502710?rss=1","date":1703635200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Greater diversity in functional morphology should be associated with the evolution of greater ontogenetic diversity, an expectation difficult to test in most long-lived wild organisms. In the cells derived from the wood meristem (vascular cambium), plants provide extraordinary systems for reconstructing ontogenies in often long-lived organisms. The vascular cambium produces files of cells from the stem center to the periphery, with each cambial derivative “deciding” which of four cell types it differentiates into. Wood cell files remain in place, allowing tracing of the ontogenetic “decisions” taken throughout the life of a stem. We compared cell files from the Pedilanthus clade (genus <span>Euphorbia</span>), which span a range of growth forms from small trees and shrubs of tropical habitats to desert succulents. Using language theory, we represented wood cell types as “letters” and combinations of cell types in cell files as “words,” allowing us to measure the diversity of decisions based on word frequency matrices. We also used information content metrics to compare levels of predictability in “decision-making.” Our analyses identified a wider array of developmental decisions in woody trees as compared to succulent shrubs, illustrating ways that woody plants provide unparalleled systems for studying the evolution of ontogeny in long-lived, non-model species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"1565808af0fe140eea6585e1d9702c6937f5b4003dd4f932d2b982d426b7cfea","category":"Environment"}
