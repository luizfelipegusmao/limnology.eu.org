{"title":"Effects of Initial Injection Condition on Colloid Retention","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036877?af=R","date":1718175600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigates the impact of initial injection conditions on colloid transport and retention in porous media. Employing both uniform and flux-weighted distributions for the initial colloid locations, the research explores diverse flow scenarios, ranging from simple Poiseuille flow to more complex geometries. The results underscore the pivotal role the injection mode plays on the shape of colloid retention profiles (RPs), particularly those that display anomalous non-exponential decay with distance. Broadly, uniform injection yields multi-exponential profiles, while flux-weighted injection can lead to nonmonotonic profiles in certain conditions. The study identifies preferential flow paths as a key factor in producing nonmonotonic RPs. Notably, variations in fluid velocity, colloid size, and ionic strength affect attachment rates near the inlet but do not significantly alter the qualitative transition between multi-exponential and nonmonotonic profiles. The study emphasizes that the chosen injection mode dictates retention profile shapes, highlighting its crucial role in porous media colloid transport. These insights provide a possible partial explanation of previously observed anomalous transport behaviors, urging consideration of injection conditions in interpretations of experiments, where they can be difficult to accurately control and measure with high precision.</p>","author":"Bashar M.
