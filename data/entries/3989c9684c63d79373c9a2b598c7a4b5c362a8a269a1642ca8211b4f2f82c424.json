{"title":"Nutritive Value and Degradation Kinetic Parameters of Three Plants for Feeding Bradypus variegatus Schinz","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1685/v1","date":1721625418000,"content":"It was aimed evaluate the nutritive value of three foods (Cecropia sp., Pterodon sp., and Inga sp.), for sloths (Bradypus variegatus), based on in vitro gas production. After a 14-day adaptation period to these foods, approximately 500g of gastric contents were collected from three female sloths, processed, and incubated with food samples to evaluate digestibility and in vitro degradation kinetics. The neutral detergent fiber (NDFcp) was greater (P&amp;lt;0,05) in the leaves of Cecropia sp. The non-fibrous carbohydrate contents were greater in Pterodon sp. The greatest cellulose content was found in the leaves of C. pachystachya, as well as lowest value for hemicellulose. There were differences in the in vitro digestibility of crude protein (P&amp;lt;0.05), higher for Inga sp. In terms of kinetic parameters, Pterodon sp. demonstrated higher production of total gases (Vt) and digestion rates of fibrous carbohydrates (kdNFC) (P&amp;lt;0.05), possibly related to the lower NDF content and higher values of soluble carbohydrates, which favored fermentative processes. The leaves of Pterodon sp. and Inga sp. demonstrated potential for feeding B. variegatus. Feeding B. variegatus with Cecropia sp., due to the NDF content, can cause negative effects on dry matter consumption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3989c9684c63d79373c9a2b598c7a4b5c362a8a269a1642ca8211b4f2f82c424","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
