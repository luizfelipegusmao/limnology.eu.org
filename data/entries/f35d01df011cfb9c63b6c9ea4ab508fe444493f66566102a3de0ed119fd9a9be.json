{"title":"Autophagosome biogenesis and organelle homeostasis in plant cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3009/7635905?rss=1","date":1711497600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Autophagy is one of the major highly inducible degradation processes in response to plant developmental and environmental signals. In response to different stimuli, cellular materials, including proteins and organelles, can be sequestered into a double membrane autophagosome structure either selectively or nonselectively. The formation of an autophagosome as well as its delivery into the vacuole involves complex and dynamic membrane processes. The identification and characterization of the conserved autophagy-related (ATG) proteins and their related regulators have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying autophagosome biogenesis and function in plant cells. Autophagosome biogenesis is tightly regulated by the coordination of multiple ATG and non-ATG proteins and by selective cargo recruitment. This review updates our current knowledge of autophagosome biogenesis, with special emphasis on the core molecular machinery that drives autophagosome formation and autophagosome-organelle interactions under abiotic stress conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"f35d01df011cfb9c63b6c9ea4ab508fe444493f66566102a3de0ed119fd9a9be","category":"Environment"}
