{"title":"Novel program for automatic calculation of EPG variables","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae063/7701043?rss=1","date":1719532800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique is the most powerful tool for studying the feeding behavior of pierce-sucking insects. However, calculating EPG variables is often very time-consuming, and consequently, several software programs have been developed for the automatic calculation of EPG variables. Here we present a new user-friendly Excel Workbook that uses a standardized list of EPG variables and follows expert guidelines for calculating them. The program developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a step up from the existing software and allows easy data analysis and interpretation. It also includes a novel option for dealing with the common problem of “truncated”—waveforms artificially terminated by the end of recording. The only requirement to run the program is Microsoft Excel software running under a PC environment. The Workbook was validated by calculating variables from EPG recordings of aphids and psyllids and the results obtained were compared with those of existing software such as the Sarria Workbook. Our EPG Workbook provides researchers with a reliable and standardized tool for the automatic calculation of up to 127 EPG variables from phloem-sap-sucking insects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"a3669a8baabab12b9e2d497a17af62a7e611d6fbb911df5294b9f58e68ece68d","category":"Environment"}
