Although FIB instruments are routinely used to prepare TEM samples, they often introduce damage and contamination that can have a significant undesired effect on the electrical properties of the samples under investigation. In-situ sample preparation on MEMS chips is more challenging as it involves extraction of lamellae from the bulk sample, a transfer to the MEMS device, and final thinning to electron transparency.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dc93168d7de576c64ecc690080b8bffe3d8be281d189eccce0bc8ba3fff1b257","category":"Environment"}
