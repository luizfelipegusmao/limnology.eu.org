{"title":"Effects of Dietary Glutamate on the Growth Performance and Antioxidant Capacity of Juvenile Chinese Mitten Crab (Eriocheir sinensis)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1227/v1","date":1716213909000,"content":"In order to explore the effects of glutamate on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity and protein metabolism of juvenile Chinese mitten crab. 0%, 1% and 2% glutamate were supplemented to low protein (30%) and normal protein (35%) diets respectively. There were 5 parallel tanks in each treatment, and the feeding duration was 8 weeks. The results showed that dietary glutamate did not significantly affect the weight gain of Chinese mitten crab. Diets supplemented with 2% glutamate significantly decreased the crude protein of crabs. The T-AOC of crabs fed the 30% protein diets was significantly lower than crabs fed the 35% protein diets. At 30% protein level, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased with the increase of glutamate content. Dietary glutamate significantly down-regulated the relative expressions of mTOR, PI3K, S6K1 and 4EBP at 35% protein level. In conclusion, dietary glutamate cannot significantly increase the growth of Chinese mitten crab, but it can improve the antioxidant capacity in Chinese mitten crab under low protein condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7edeea3eacb412e20bcdf713147a5d1a6419649573176039a4666a96ebd1bf75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
