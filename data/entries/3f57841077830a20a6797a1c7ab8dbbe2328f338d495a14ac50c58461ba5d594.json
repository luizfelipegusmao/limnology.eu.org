On the visualization and simulation end, we have a need to use atomic structures which resemble and mimic experimental nanostructures as closely as possible. In computational workflows relying on the development of machine learning models, we need to sample many different atomic structures–potentially tens of thousands or even more–in order to satisfy the data-intensive training needs of modern ML techniques. Reproducibly generating and managing atomic structures at all scales remains a critical task in developing new computational workflows for TEM modeling and analysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3f57841077830a20a6797a1c7ab8dbbe2328f338d495a14ac50c58461ba5d594","category":"Environment"}
