{"title":"Targeting Mycobacterial Polyketide Synthase Pks13-TE Domain with Small Organic Molecular Scaffolds: QSAR-Driven Modelling Studies to Identify Novel Inhibitors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0035/v1","date":1714574815000,"content":"This study presents a detailed computational investigation aimed at identifying and evaluating potential small organic molecular scaffolds as inhibitors targeting the Pks13 protein, a critical enzyme in tuberculosis (TB) drug discovery. Our approach integrates multiple computational techniques, including quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling, compound library generation, molecular docking, biological activity prediction, re-evaluation of screened compounds, molecular dynamics (MD) analysis, and binding free energy estimation using the MM-GBSA approach. We developed a robust QSAR model using multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques, specifically tailored to predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of potential anti-TB agents. This model demonstrated excellent predictive performance, validated through rigorous internal and external validation procedures. Through molecular docking simulations, we identified five promising inhibitors Ethyl (R,Z)-2-(2-((2-chlorobenzyl) oxy)benzylidene)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-methyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-5H-thiazolo [3,2-a] pyrimidine-6-carboxylate (PKD1), (7R,9aR)-7-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-7,8,9,9a-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-b]quinolin-5(6H)-one (PKD2), (7-(4-methoxy phenyl)-2-methyl-3-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5-yl)(4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) piperazin-1-yl)methanone (PKD3), (8S,10S)-10-(((2R,4S,5S,6S)-4-amino-5-hydroxy-6-methyl tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-7,8,9,10-tetra-hydrotetracene-5,12-dione (PKD4), 3-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-5-((2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl) thio)-6-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3,5,7a-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one (PKD5)with high binding affinities, prioritizing them based on their binding energies. These selected compounds were further assessed for their biological activity predictions, guiding the selection of candidates for experimental validation. Subsequent re-evaluation using absolute binding free energy estimation and MD simulations provided insights into the stability and dynamics of the protein-ligand complexes over time. Our findings highlighted the potential of identified compounds as stable binders within the Pks13-TE domain binding pocket, underscoring their viability as drug candidates. Additionally, binding free energy analysis using MM-GBSA reaffirmed the strong affinity of the proposed compounds towards Pks13. Our integrated computational approach offers a systematic and detailed framework for the identification and characterization of potential Pks13 inhibitors with specific relevance to TB drug discovery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"904c7e8b3bffa8f5be72fe2decdd9d321265d3da3f0011a80b5c2f4c07b755c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
