{"title":"Cardiac Contractility Modulation Therapy in a Transplant Candidate Patient with Advance Heart Failure to Improve Cardiac Function and Restore Sinus Rhythm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0479/v1","date":1715249509000,"content":"This strategy had a very fast and good impact on the patientâ€™s health; the CCM improved heart failure symptoms, hemodynamics flow and cardiac functionality. Moreover, after a relatively short time, the patient comes from persistent AF to Sinus Rhythm, although he starts with a severe bi-atrial dilatation.
