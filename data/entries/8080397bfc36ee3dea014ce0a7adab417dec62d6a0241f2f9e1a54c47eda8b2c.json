{"title":"A Novel Technique for Monitoring Carbonate and Scale Precipitation Using Batch Process Based Hetero-Core Fiber Optic Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1520/v1","date":1729446870000,"content":"Techniques for monitoring calcium carbonate and silica deposits (scale) in geothermal power plants and hot spring facilities using fiber optic sensors have already been reported. These sensors continuously measure changes in light transmittance with a detector, and when applied to field tests, require the installation of a power supply and sensor monitoring equipment. However, in some sites, a power supply may not be available, or a specialist skilled in handling scale sensors is required. To overcome this problem, we have developed a method for evaluating scale formation based on a batch process that can be used by anyone. In other words, this method involves depositing scale on a section of the optical fiber sensor, then fusing this section to the optical fiber and measuring it. Using this sensor, a technician in the field can simply place the sensor at the desired location, collect the samples at any given time, and send them to the laboratory to measure the transmittance. This simple and easy method were achieved by using a hetero-core type of fiber optic. This evaluation method can measure with the same sensitivity as conventional real-time methods, while the transmittance response corresponds to the saturation index (SI) changes of scale components in the solution due to increases in temperature and concentration. In the field of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), this evaluation method can be used to quantitatively measure the formation of carbonate minerals, and it can also be used as an indicator for determining the conditions for CO2 mineral fixation, as well as in experiments using batch-type autoclaves in the laboratory testing. It is also expected to be used in geothermal power plants as an evaluation method for scale formation such as amorphous silica and to prevent agents that hinder stable operation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8080397bfc36ee3dea014ce0a7adab417dec62d6a0241f2f9e1a54c47eda8b2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
