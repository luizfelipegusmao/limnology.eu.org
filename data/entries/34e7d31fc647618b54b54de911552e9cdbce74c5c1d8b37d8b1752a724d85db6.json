{"title":"&alpha;‐Catenin and Piezo Mediate Cell Mechanical Communication through Cell Adhesions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1106/v1","date":1713345851000,"content":"Cell-to-cell distant mechanical communication has been demonstrated by using in-vitro and in-vivo models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying long-range cell mechanoresponsive interactions remain to be more elucidated. This study further examined the roles of α-Catenin and Piezo in traction force-induced rapid branch assembly of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells on Matrigel hydrogel containing type I collagen. Our findings demonstrate that siRNA-mediated downregulation of α-Catenin or chemical inhibition of Piezo activity significantly reduced both cell directional movement and branching assembly. In regarding the role of N-cadherin in regulating branch assembly but not directional migration, our results further confirmed that siRNA downregulation of α-Catenin caused a remarked reduction of focal adhesion formation, as assessed by focal Paxillin and Integrin α5 localization. These observations implied that mechanosensitive α-Catenin was involved in both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Additionally, Piezo showed partial localization with Paxillin in focal adhesions, which was inhibited by α-Catenin downregulation with siRNA. This provides a plausible clue for Piezo mechanosensing traction force in the hydrogel. Collectively, our findings highlight the significance of α-Catenin in regulating cell-matrix interactions along with possible interpretation for Piezo mechanosensation at focal adhesions during cell-cell distant mechanical communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34e7d31fc647618b54b54de911552e9cdbce74c5c1d8b37d8b1752a724d85db6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
