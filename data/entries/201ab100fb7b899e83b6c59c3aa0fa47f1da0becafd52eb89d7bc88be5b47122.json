{"title":"Exploring the potential of phenolic and antioxidant compounds in new Rosaceae fruits","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13255?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Rosaceae fruits have been used in traditional medicine for the prevention and treatment of diseases. However, these fruits have not extensively been studied regarding their phenolic composition. Thus, this research focuses on the determination of phenolic compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, flavan-3-ols by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, and the antioxidant activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and ferric reducing antioxidant power of the fruits of five species of genera <i>Crataegus</i> and <i>Sorbus</i> (Rosaceae).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>We found a total of 71 phenolic compounds from which 30 were identified in these berries for the first time. <i>Crataegus monogyna</i> and <i>Crataegus laciniata</i> revealed higher total phenolic and flavan-3-ol contents than the other species and the highest antioxidant activities.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>Therefore, the fruits evaluated have demonstrated to be important sources of bioactive compounds with huge potential for being used in nutraceutical or food scopes. Additional studies could be needed to evaluate the influence of the different production areas on the phenolic content. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"María del Carmen Razola‐Díaz, \nMaría José Aznar‐Ramos, \nGuillermo Benítez, \nAna María Gómez‐Caravaca, \nVito Verardo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"201ab100fb7b899e83b6c59c3aa0fa47f1da0becafd52eb89d7bc88be5b47122","category":"Environment"}
