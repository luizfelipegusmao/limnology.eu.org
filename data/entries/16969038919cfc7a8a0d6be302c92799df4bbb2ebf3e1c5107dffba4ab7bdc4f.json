{"title":"Implementation of Methylation Profiling of Central Nervous System Tumors At Largest Public Health Center in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2300/v1","date":1722251389000,"content":"Tumor entities of the Central Nervous System (CNS) are defined by the WHO \nclassification and range from benign neoplasms to highly malignant tumors, making \nhistopathological classification challenging. This diverse spectrum complicates clinical \ndecision-making and the interpretation and validation of clinical trial results. The \nmethodology based on DNA methylation profiling of CNS tumors offers greater \ndiagnostic precision compared to traditional morphological methods. In this study, we \nanalyzed 16 DNA samples from medulloblastomas and ependymomas, obtained from \nparaffin-embedded blocks from the Pathology Division archives of HCFMUSP, and with \nprior histological analysis. The samples were processed using the Infinium \nMethylationEPIC BeadChip (IlluminaÂ®) and methylation data analysis tools in R Studio. \nThe data were submitted to the MolecularNeuropathology.org platform for methylation\nbased classification and CNV chart generation. The classifier was consistent with the \nprevious diagnosis in all cases, refining the diagnosis in 54% of cases to subclass, 38% \nto subtype, and 8% to family. The platform also provided CNV estimates for 87% of \ncases, revealing crucial information on genetic alterations such as gains, losses, \namplifications, and gene fusions. Despite the challenges of implementation within the \nBrazilian Public Health System (SUS), the results demonstrate the method's robustness \nand reproducibility, promising invaluable support for precise diagnoses and the \ndevelopment of more effective therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16969038919cfc7a8a0d6be302c92799df4bbb2ebf3e1c5107dffba4ab7bdc4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
