{"title":"Jordan-Type Inequalities and Stratification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1726/v1","date":1711598621000,"content":"In this paper, two double Jordan-type inequalities are introduced based on the papers [1]-[5]. These inequalities generalize the inequalities obtained in [1]-[5]. As a result, some new upper and lower bounds of the sinc function are obtained. This extension of Jordanâ€™s inequality is enabled by considering the corresponding inequalities through the concept of stratified families of functions elaborated in [6]. Based on this approach, some optimal approximations of the sinc function are derived by determining corresponding minimax approximants, also described in the paper [6].","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33f88b377e5b6d12be5b3be9b980b4b5d615ee93c3040f1e26fc4ec3909c5be7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
