Early detection and quantification of these pathogens would enable us to ascertain both economic and biological thresholds required for a timely treatment, thus improving effective disease management. Here, we used Oxford nanopore MinION amplicon sequencing to analyze microbial communities in irrigation water collected from greenhouses used for growing tomato, cucumber and <i>Aeschynanthus</i> sp. Fungal and oomycete communities were characterized using primers that amplify the full internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. To assess the sensitivity of the MinION sequencing, we spiked serially diluted mock DNA into the DNA isolated from greenhouse water samples prior to library preparation. Relative abundances of fungal and oomycete reads were distinct in the greenhouse irrigation water samples and in water samples from setups with tomato that was inoculated with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>. Sequence reads derived from fungal and oomycete mock communities were proportionate in the respective serial dilution samples, thus confirming the suitability of MinION amplicon sequencing for environmental monitoring. By using spike-ins as standards to test the reliability of quantification using the MinION, we found that the detection of spike-ins was highly affected by the background quantities of fungal or oomycete DNA in the sample. We observed that spike-ins having shorter length (538bp) produced reads across most of our dilutions compared to the longer spikes (&gt;790bp). Moreover, the sequence reads were uneven with respect to dilution series and were least retrievable in the background samples having the highest DNA concentration, suggesting a narrow dynamic range of performance. We suggest continuous benchmarking of the MinION sequencing to improve quantitative metabarcoding efforts for rapid plant disease diagnostic and monitoring in the future.","author":"Enoch Narh Kudjordjie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"98ad34aef4de958a4aad6be0f3a97453441eaf50cff9d52e13373cbe2ee527e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
