{"title":"Individual attitudes towards environmentally friendly choices: a comprehensive analysis of the role of legal rules, religion, and confidence in government","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13412-024-00913-5","date":1712016000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>This study investigates the dynamic interplay between individual attitudes towards legal rules, religious beliefs, and confidence in government institutions, and their collective impact on environmentally friendly choices (EFC). Amidst growing environmental concerns, this research explores how these societal elements influence individuals’ willingness to financially support environmental causes, accept tax increases for pollution prevention, and prioritize environmental conservation over economic growth. By incorporating a comprehensive set of socio-demographic controls, including country, religious denomination, and town size, the study provides a nuanced understanding of the factors driving EFC. The study reveals that increased confidence in government institutions, such as police and armed forces, relates positively to engagement in EFC. It highlights the essence of building trust among citizens to foster responsible environmental behavior. The research also brings to light the significant influence of religious involvement and participation on individuals’ environmental choices, suggesting that active engagement in religious communities builds religion-dependent social capital that steers individuals towards more sustainable living practices. Results highlight the importance of trust in institutions and government policies in facilitating the transition towards a digitally empowered, environmentally conscious society. Conversely, a lack of trust can breed skepticism and hinder the adoption of sustainable practices. The study’s insights are instrumental for policymakers, religious leaders, and environmental organizations in devising targeted strategies that encourage responsible consumption and strengthen collective efforts towards a sustainable future.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"a7d28dd18ad5ed967c9266d5e182fec02734f75b8aaa7f23125d672253416bd2","category":"Environment"}
