{"title":"Implementation of IoT Sensors in Fog Collector Systems and Flowmeters for the Control of Eater Collection and Distribution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0117/v1","date":1714636325000,"content":"This study describes the implementation of IoT sensors in drinking water systems and fog collector systems in low-income communities in Ecuador. The influence and handling of these sensors are analyzed, as well as the materials and methods used in their implementation. The importance of validating the accuracy and reliability of IoT sensors compared to professional devices, especially in mountain areas, is highlighted. In addition, it is mentioned that the cost-benefit of using IoT sensors in fog catchers and drinking water networks depends on several factors, such as the scale of the project, specific objectives, and available resources. Finally, it is highlighted that the use of IoT sensors in smart construction and water collection systems has proven to be beneficial in preventing effects on the operation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2567b0b831bc51042f7fd337ef9e0ad21b13c07371104d8c312a2d889ebe345e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
