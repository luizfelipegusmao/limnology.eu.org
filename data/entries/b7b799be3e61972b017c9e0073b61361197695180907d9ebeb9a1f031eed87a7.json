{"title":"Non-Insulin Antidiabetic Agents and Lung Cancer Risk in Drug-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide Retrospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2086/v1","date":1717135828000,"content":"Lung cancer (LC) is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Insulin therapy, a key treatment for managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), may increase LC risk. The impact of non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), on LC risk is not well understood. This study evaluated LC risk in T2DM patients comparing seven non-insulin antidiabetic agents to insulin. Using the TriNetX Analytics platform, we analyzed de-identified electronic health records of 1,040,341 T2DM patients treated between 2005-2019, excluding those with prior antidiabetic use or LC diagnoses. We calculated hazard ratios and confidence intervals for LC risk and used propensity score matching to control for confounding factors. All non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, except alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, significantly reduced LC risk compared to insulin, with GLP-1RAs showing the greatest reduction (HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.59). GLP-1RAs were consistently associated with lowered LC risk across all histological types, races, genders, and smoking statuses. These findings suggest that non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, particularly GLP-1RAs, may be preferable for managing T2DM while reducing LC risk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7b799be3e61972b017c9e0073b61361197695180907d9ebeb9a1f031eed87a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
