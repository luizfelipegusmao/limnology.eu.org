{"title":"Improvement of physicochemical properties of lycopene by the self‐assembly encapsulation of recombinant ferritin GF1 from oyster (Crassostrea gigas)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13163?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Lycopene (LYC), a carotenoid found in abundance in ripe red fruits, exhibits higher singlet oxygen quenching activity than other carotenoids. However, the stability of LYC is extremely poor due to its high double-bond content. In this paper, a nano-encapsulation strategy based on highly stable marine-derived ferritin GF1 nanocages was used to improve the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of LYC, thereby boosting its functional effectiveness and industrial applicability.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The preparation of GF1-LYC nanoparticles benefited from the pH-responsive reversible self-assembly of GF1 to capture LYC molecules into GF1 cavities with a LYC-to-protein ratio of 51 to 1. After the encapsulation of the LYC, the reassembled GF1 nanocages maintained intact morphology and good monodispersity. The GF1-LYC nanoparticles incorporated the characteristic LYC peaks in spectrograms, and their powder form contained the crystalline form of LYC. Molecular docking revealed that LYC bound with the inner triple-axis channel areas of GF1, interacting with VAL139, LYS72, LYS65, TYR69, PHE129, HIS133, HIS62, and TYR134 amino acids through hydrophobic bonds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also demonstrated the bonding of GF1 and LYC. In comparison with free LYC, GF1 reduced the thermal degradation of encapsulated LYC at 37 °C significantly and maintained the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging ability of LYC.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>As expected, the water solubility, thermal stability, and antioxidant capacity of encapsulated LYC from GF1-LYC nanoparticles was notably improved in comparison with free LYC, indicating that the shell-like marine ferritin nanoplatform might enhance the stable delivery of LYC and promote its utilization in the field of food nutrition and in other industries. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiaoyu Xia, \nHan Li, \nXianbing Xu, \nChao Wu, \nZhenyu Wang, \nGuanghua Zhao, \nMing Du","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"da10bfc6a0a9e722bc6c3149fbbd5c159a668b3d79bf2bd86110a6bc0200dbd4","category":"Environment"}
