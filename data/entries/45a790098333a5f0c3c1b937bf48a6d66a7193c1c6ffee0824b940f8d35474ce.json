{"title":"RNAi-based Approaches to Control Mycotoxin Producers: Challenges and Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2049/v1","date":1724838345000,"content":"Mycotoxin contamination of food and feed is a worldwide problem that needed to be addressed with highly efficient and biologically safe techniques. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism playing an important role in different processes in eukaryotes, including regulation of gene expression, maintenance of genome stability, protection against viruses and others. Recently, RNAi-based techniques have been widely applied for the purposes of food safety and management of plant diseases, including those caused by mycotoxin-producing fungi. In this review, we summarize the current state-of-art of RNAi-based approaches for reducing aggressiveness of key toxigenic fungal pathogens and mycotoxin contamination of grain and its products. The ways of improving RNAi efficiency for plant protection and future perspectives of this technique, including progress in methods of double-stranded RNA production and its delivery to the target cells are also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45a790098333a5f0c3c1b937bf48a6d66a7193c1c6ffee0824b940f8d35474ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
