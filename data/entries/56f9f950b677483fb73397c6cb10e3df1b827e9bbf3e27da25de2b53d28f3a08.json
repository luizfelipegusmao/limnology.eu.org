As a response to drought, plants generally allocate more biomass to roots over shoots, thereby facilitating water uptake. However, whether this biomass allocation shift is modulated by AM fungi remains unknown. Based on 5691 paired observations from 154 plant species, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate how AM fungi modulate the responses of plant growth and biomass allocation (e.g., root-to-shoot ratio, R/S) to drought. We found that AM fungi attenuate the negative impact of drought on plant growth, including biomass production, photosynthetic performance and resource (e.g. nutrient and water) uptake. Accordingly, drought significantly increased R/S in non-inoculated plants, but not in plants symbiotic with established AM fungal symbioses. These results suggest that AM fungi promote plant growth and stabilize their R/S through facilitating nutrient and water uptake in plants under drought. Our findings highlight the crucial role of AM fungi in enhancing plant resilience to drought by optimizing resource allocation. This knowledge opens avenues for sustainable agricultural practices that leverage symbiotic relationships for climate adaptation.</p>","author":"Bo Tang, \nJing Man, \nFerran Romero, \nJoana Bergmann, \nAnika Lehmann, \nMatthias C.
