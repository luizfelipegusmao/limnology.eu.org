{"title":"A Step Forward in Enhancing the Health-Promoting Properties of Whole Tomatoes as a Global Functional Food to Lower the Impact of Non-Communicable Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1997/v1","date":1724834703000,"content":"Nutritional interventions facilitating the consumption of available, affordable, and environment-compatible health-promoting functional foods (FF) are a promising strategy for controlling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) responsible for decreasing health expectancy. Given that the complex of tomato micronutrients produces healthier outcomes than lycopene, its major antioxidant component, we have devised a new controlled berry processing to improve its health-supporting properties. The newly generated whole tomato food supplement (WTFS), enriched by 2% olive wastewater polyphenols, contains a complex of healthy nutrients with converging biologic activities superior to those provided by tomato commodities. WTFS equals the antioxidant activity of N-acetyl-cysteine and interferes with multiple inflammation-eliciting and sustaining metabolic pathways. WTFS inhibits prostate experimental tumors, and improves benign prostate hypertrophy-associated symptoms. No side effects have been so far reported for dietary supplementation with WTFS compared to the culinary use of tomatoes. Although WTFS may be susceptible to further improvements and clinical scrutiny, its composition embodies the features of an advanced FF to ease adherence to dietary regimens, i.e. the Mediterranean diet, aimed at contrasting the low-grade inflammation. Ongoing investigations suggest new areas of potential translational use of WTFS, as a basis for developing more targeted FF interceptive or preventive of NCDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23179edc56a859e03e674cfb4351e8bafba49506fa79d26d16c9616a42ebc884","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
