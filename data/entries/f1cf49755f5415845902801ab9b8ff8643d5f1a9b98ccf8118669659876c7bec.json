The solar panel and motor pump set are the important parts of solar pump. The overall performance of the solar pump has been depending on the performance of solar panels and motor pump set. The tilt angle, surface azimuth angle, module temperature and speed of motor are most important input parameters on which whole performance of solar pump depends. So, for fulling these objectives a 5 hp (horsepower) solar pump has been installed in FET MJP Rohilkhand University, Bareilly located at 28.36° N, 79.43° E. The experimental data of output parameters at the different settings of input parameters and data generated by model equations have been optimized by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) tool of Design of Experiments (DOE). The optimum setting of input parameters are Tilt Angle (TA) (36.22°), Surface Azimuth Angle (SA) (−1.26°), Module Temperature (MT), and speed of the motor (2169.69 RPM). On the optimum setting of input parameters, the values of the response are maximum Solar Flux (SF) (762 W/m<sup>2</sup>), maximum power output (3661.4578 W), minimum discharge (19.2681 m<sup>3</sup>/h), head developed (55.17 m), maximum motor efficiency (90.7488%), maximum exergetic efficiency (15.3799%), minimum Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) (0.0361 $/KWh), maximum panel efficiency (17.1774%) and maximum overall efficiency (15.0117%).</p>","author":"Vineet Singh, \nVinod Singh Yadav, \nVaibhav Trivedi, \nManoj Kumar Singh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"f1cf49755f5415845902801ab9b8ff8643d5f1a9b98ccf8118669659876c7bec","category":"Environment"}
