{"title":"Number of Hamiltonian Cycles in Certain Bipartite Graphs of Size 4k+2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0686/v1","date":1720489081000,"content":"We will try to use the approach of labeled cycle cover sum to count the number of hamiltonian cycles in a special type of bipartite graphs, with 4k + 2 vertices which can also be considered as an alternative method to check hamiltonicity in such bipartite graphs. This graph is such that, there exists at least 1 vertex which is not a part of any cycle of size 4m + 2 where m &lt; k, in O∗(1.414n) time. The algorithm is inspired by Bjorklund’s approach where instead of working on the field of GF(2k), we will be working on C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03732d6e75f7134bcb678998fca95c4379753a1b9a2208a8059bc333675c5e45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
