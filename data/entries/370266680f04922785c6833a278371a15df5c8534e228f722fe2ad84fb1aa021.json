Cases of re-infection with schistosomiasis after being treated using modern medication has opened ways to seeking alternative treatment modalities using medicinal plants. This study aims to explore and understand the way traditional healers diagnose schistosomiasis, the types of traditional medicines they use to treat it in communities with a high prevalence of infection, and to establish whether the unavailability of prescribed anti-schistosomal medicines leads to the use of traditional medicine. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using a questionnaire from December 2022 to March 2023 in the iLembe District, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. In-depth individual interviews were carried out among traditional health practitioners (THPs) involved in managing female urogenital schistosomiasis (FUS). Recorded narrative data was transcribed verbatim, read through thoroughly and coded, and analysed using thematic or content analysis Results: Traditional Health Practitioners provide services to many women who did not want to be treated in the mainstream health care system for their FUS. The disease was perceived and understood the same way by most of the respondents, that being caused by use of fresh water. Various plants species, either alone or in combination, were used to manage bilharzia in women. Senecio serratuloides (Asteraceae) and Hypoxis hemerocallidea (Hypoxidaceae) were prominently used by THPs in FUS management. Conclusion: Traditional Health Practitioners are playing a key role in managing bilharzia in women in rural areas of the iLembe District, this study reported that THPs can diagnose schistosomiasis symptoms based on their knowledge and experience. Respondents indicated that modern conventional treatment was readily available and free in public sector healthcare facilities; however, they consulted patients suffering from FUS. Various traditional herbal medicines are reportedly used by THPs to manage bilharzia in women. Further studies are needed to investigate the views and experiences of clients regarding the success of the treatments used and why they seek care from THPs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"370266680f04922785c6833a278371a15df5c8534e228f722fe2ad84fb1aa021","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
