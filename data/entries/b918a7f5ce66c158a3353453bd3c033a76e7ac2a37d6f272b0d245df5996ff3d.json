{"title":"Protocol for a community-based digital storytelling pilot intervention to reduce Hispanic parents’ vaccine hesitancy to immunize their children against COVID-19","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299787","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Alexis Koskan, Linda Larkey, Michael Todd, Sunny Wonsun Kim</p>\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 vaccines, currently available to children over six months old, are a powerful method of reducing the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and death. However, vaccination rates among Hispanic children remain suboptimal, primarily due to parental vaccine hesitancy. Health communication researchers have suggested using culturally aligned storytelling to reduce vaccine hesitancy; however, few studies have evaluated this approach for Hispanic parents of unvaccinated children. Working with community health workers, we will engage Hispanic parents who were previously hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren) against COVID-19 but currently support vaccination. We will ask them to share their stories of conversion in COVID-19 vaccine perspectives to help other parents overcome their mistrust of COVID-19 vaccines. We will then assess the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based pilot digital storytelling intervention based on these conversion stories vs. an information-only control among 80 parents and/or legal guardians of children who are not up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccines. We will also examine pre- to post-intervention changes in vaccine perceptions, hesitancy, intentions, and uptake of children’s COVID-19 vaccination at two months post-intervention. If our pilot study demonstrates feasibility and acceptability while reducing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccine uptake, we will conduct a full-scale randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of the DST intervention to reduce vaccine hesitancy.","author":"Alexis Koskan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b918a7f5ce66c158a3353453bd3c033a76e7ac2a37d6f272b0d245df5996ff3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
