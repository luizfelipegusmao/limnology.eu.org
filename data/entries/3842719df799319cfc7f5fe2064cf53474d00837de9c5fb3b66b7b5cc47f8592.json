{"title":"Lagrange Duality and Saddle Point Optimality Conditions for Nonsmooth Interval-Valued Multiobjective Semi-infinite Programming Problems with Vanishing Constraints","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1566/v1","date":1721379200000,"content":"In this article, we consider a class of nonsmooth interval-valued multiobjective semi-infinite programming problems with vanishing constraints (in short, NIMSIPVC). We introduce the VC-Abadie constraint qualification (in short, VC-ACQ) for NIMSIPVC and employ it to establish Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (in short, KKT)-type necessary optimality conditions. Related to NIMSIPVC, we formulate interval-valued vector Lagrange type dual and scalarized Lagrange type dual problems. Subsequently, we establish weak, strong, and converse duality results relating NIMSIPVC and corresponding dual problems. In addition, we introduce the notions of saddle points for interval-valued vector Lagrangian and scalarized Lagrangian of NIMSIPVC. Moreover, we establish the saddle point optimality criteria for NIMSIPVC. Various non-trivial examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of established results. To the best of our knowledge, optimality conditions, Lagrange type duality, and saddle point optimality criteria for NIMSIPVC have not been investigated yet via Clarke subdifferentials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3842719df799319cfc7f5fe2064cf53474d00837de9c5fb3b66b7b5cc47f8592","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
