Manuals on pig farming and data combined from multiple sources were used to assess the current market situation, design a profit stabilization tool for pig producers, and evaluate the performance of this solution. We found that implementing the tool reduces the profits variability of finishers and piglets producers by 45% and 30%, respectively, while keeping the long-term average of profits constant.","author":"Michał Litwiński","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4999bfb1cbd0490458623c0924dea7115098d823ca3664b18adddacc636240fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
