{"title":"Investigation of miniature goat cheese produced from Cynara scolymus L. pistil cell suspension culture extracts elicited with melatonin and salicylic acid","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13834?af=R","date":1724758424000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of enzymes produced by artichoke (<i>Cynara scolymus</i> L.) flower cell suspension cultures elicited by melatonin (5 μ<span>m</span>) and salicylic acid (50 μ<span>m</span>) on the production and characteristics of miniature goat cheeses. In this study, five types of fresh miniature goat cheese were produced using whole artichoke flower extract, salicylic acid (50 μ<span>m</span>) or melatonin (5 μ<span>m</span>) treated artichoke suspension cell culture extracts, a culture extract without elicitor treatment (control) and rennin enzyme.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The milk clotting activity values of the enzymes were measured in the range 0.52–0.74. The effect of the enzymes on the titratable acidity, water-soluble nitrogen, ripening index, αs-caseins and β-caseins of goat cheese was significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The highest level of casein degradation was observed in the cheese produced with the enzyme containing melatonin, followed by the cheese produced with the enzyme containing salicylic acid.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the enzymes produced by the suspension cell culture method, the addition of melatonin and salicylic acid had a slightly positive effect on the proteolytic activity of the extracts. It was also found that the enzymes obtained from artichokes by the suspension cell culture method did not achieve successful cheese production in terms of chemical, textural and biochemical aspects compared to those obtained from animal enzymes. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ufuk Çelikkol Akçay, \nÖzlem Çayir, \nBedia Şimşek","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f73583c0c3ae40287c9e5b57007f4b2974d0ecd13f993fb0cc672c62e27d33e2","category":"Environment"}
