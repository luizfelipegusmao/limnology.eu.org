{"title":"A Formal Model for Reliable Data Acquisition and Control in Legacy Critical Infrastructures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1611/v1","date":1711460130000,"content":"The digital transformation of critical infrastructures, such as energy or water distribution systems, is essential for their smart management. Faster issue identification and smoother services enable better adaptation to consumers' evolving demands. However, these large-scale infrastructures are often outdated. Their digital transformation is crucial to enable them supporting societies. This process must be carefully planned, providing guidance that ensures that the data they rely on is dependable and that the system remains fully operational during the transition. This paper presents a formal model that supports reliable data acquisition in legacy critical infrastructures, facilitating their evolution towards a data-driven smart system. Our model provides the foundation for a flexible transformation process while generating dependable data for system management. We demonstrate the model's applicability in a use case within the water distribution domain and discuss its benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"498196df81177add320970a32d1ea7032e98ca1ca5c1ce4825d25ad43d37c6d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
