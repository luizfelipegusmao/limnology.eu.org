Yet, functional trait variation is often not strongly correlated with growth and mortality, and few studies have investigated the relationships of both traits and niches, specifically encompassing above and belowground resources, to the trade-off itself. These relationships are particularly relevant for seedlings, which must often survive resource limitation to reach larger size classes.\n\nWe investigated the functional basis of the interspecific growth–mortality trade-off and its relationship with ecological niches for seedlings of 14 tree species in a tropical forest in southwest China.\n\nWe found evidence for an interspecific growth–mortality trade-off at the seedling stage using 15 functional traits and 15 ecological niche variables. None of the organ-level traits correlated with growth, mortality, nor the trade-off, whereas specific stem length (SSL), a biomass allocation trait, was the only trait to have a significant correlation (positive). Moreover, light-defined niches were not correlated with growth, mortality or the trade-off, but soil-defined niches did. Species at the faster growth/higher mortality end of the trade-off were associated with higher fertility defined by lower soil bulk density and slope, and higher soil organic matter concentration and soil total nitrogen.\n\nOur findings indicate the importance of stem elongation and soil fertility for growth, mortality and their trade-off at the seedling stage in this Asian tropical forest. Our findings contrast with analogous studies in neotropical forests showing the importance of photosynthesis-related leaf traits related to insolation. Therefore, the functional drivers of demographic rates and trade-offs, as well as their consequences for ecological niches, can vary among forests, likely owing to differences in biogeography, canopy disturbance rates, topography and soil properties. Moreover, the effects of functional trait variation on demographic rates and trade-offs may be better revealed when biomass allocation is accounted for in a whole-plant context.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/07/12/biomass-allocation-traits-and-soil-fertility-determinants-of-the-growth-mortality-trade-off-among-seedlings-of-dominant-tropical-tree-species/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>\n\n种间生长-死亡权衡主要受功能性状的调控，并且有助于物种生态位的分化。然而，功能性状变异通常与生命率 (如生长率和死亡率) 间的相关性较弱。很少有研究建立地上和地下性状及生态位与生长-死亡权衡之间的联系。\n\n我们研究了中国西南热带森林中14种树种幼苗的种间生长-死亡率权衡及其与功能性状和生态位的关系。\n\n结果表明，幼苗阶段存在显著的种间生长-死亡率权衡。在15种功能性状中，器官水平的性状与生长率、死亡率和权衡无显著相关性，而比茎长(与生物量分配有关的性状)与生命率和权衡显著正相关。此外，生命率和权衡与光生态位无显著相关性，但与土壤定义的生态位显著相关。例如，位于高生长高死亡权衡轴一端的树种，占据更肥沃的土壤，这些土壤通常具有低的土壤容重和坡度，高的土壤碳和氮含量。\n\n比茎长和土壤肥力对亚洲热带森林树种幼苗阶段生长率、死亡率及其权衡具有重要作用。这与新热带森林的类似研究形成鲜明对比，后者强调了与光合作用相关的叶片性状及光的重要性。因此，不同森林的生物地理背景、林冠干扰频率、地形和土壤等差异导致驱动种间生长-死亡权衡的因素不同。此外，基于整株植物的生物量分配性状应纳入到性状对生命率和权衡影响的研究中。\n</p>","author":"Caicai Zhang, \nRong Gu, \nLuxiang Lin, \nSabrina E.
