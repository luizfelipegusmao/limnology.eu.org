{"title":"Optimization of Tool Wear and Cutting Parameters in SCCO2-MQL Ultrasonic Vibration Milling of SiCp/Al Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0506/v1","date":1720175393000,"content":"Silicon carbide particle-reinforced aluminum matrix (SiCp/Al) composites are significant lightweight metal matrix composites extensively utilized in precision instruments and aerospace sectors. Nevertheless, the inclusion of rigid SiC particles exacerbates tool wear in mechanical machining, resulting in a decline in the quality of surface finish. This work undertakes a comprehensive investigation into the problem of tool wear in SiCp/Al composite materials throughout the machining process. Initially, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to analyze the effects of cutting velocity vc, feed per tooth fz, milling depth ap, and milling width ae on tool wear during high-speed milling under SCCO2-MQL (Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Minimum Quantity Lubrication) ultrasonic vibration conditions. Furthermore, a prediction model for tool wear was developed by employing the orthogonal test method and multiple linear regression. The model's relevance and accuracy were confirmed using F-tests and t-tests. Ultimately, through the utilization of a genetic algorithm, the milling parameters were optimized, resulting in the identification of the most optimal combination of parameters. Empirical findings suggest that the careful selection of milling parameters can significantly mitigate tool wear, extend the lifespan of the tool, and enhance the quality of the surface. This work serves as a significant point of reference for the processing of SiCp/Al composite materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"812d23aad05121b84f0709e6340e13dab5d310111f2b75c533684dac25e21ee8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
