{"title":"Experimental Tip Shape Imaging Routes to Assist Data Reconstruction in Atom Probe Tomography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.031/7719483?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Offering 3-dimensional elemental mapping with sub-nanometer spatial resolution, Atom Probe Tomography (APT) finds applications in various research domains [<a href=\"#ozae044.031-B1\">1</a>]. Despite an improved description of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning this technique, major challenges remain when analyzing heterogenous materials, such as the reliable and accurate reconstruction of the 3D point cloud of the analyzed volume. This forms a critical step in the workflow of any tomographic method, as it defines its spatial resolution and analytical performance. At present, reconstruction protocols in APT rely on the Bas protocol [<a href=\"#ozae044.031-B1\">1</a>], a quasi-stereographic projection-based model, with a simplified description of the atom probe tip geometry and ion trajectories. When analyzing heterogeneous systems these assumptions are too simplistic and yield to misplaced atoms in the reconstructed volume, causing faulty dimensions and distorted shapes. With the understanding of the root-causes of these artefacts, focus has shifted towards implementing more realistic ion trajectories, based on electrostatic field calculations solved for the actual tip geometry. Consequently, knowledge of the (evolving) geometry of an atom probe tip could represent an important cornerstone for an accurate 3D reconstruction, which lead us to develop two complementary, contact-less imaging routes for such purposes. In this contribution we will showcase images of atom probe tips obtained by these imaging methods, highlight respective advantages, summarize current state-of-the-art, as well as discuss potential challenges for their implementation and use in data reconstruction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1425ca31aeedc37c88d651b53e94653a91e5bab4c42cbd7c32b5497263a13758","category":"Environment"}
