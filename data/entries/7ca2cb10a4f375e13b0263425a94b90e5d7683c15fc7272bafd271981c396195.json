{"title":"In Vitro Antibacterial Activities of Sodium Phenyl Dithiocarbamate Crystal with Its Corresponding oxovanadium(IV) and zinc(II) Coordination Compounds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1001/v1","date":1723631018000,"content":"Sodium phenyl dithiocarbamate (pl-dtc) as a ligand was prepared from the reaction of aniline (C6H5-NH2) and carbon(IV) sulfide (CS2) in the presence of sodium hydroxide via method of one-pot synthesis. Two coordination compounds ([VO(sfz)(pl-dtc)] and [Zn(sfz)(pl-dtc)]) from respective oxovanadium (IV) sulfate hydrate and zinc (II) chloride were prepared with mixed ligands involving sodium sulfadiazine (sfz) and the synthesized pl-dtc crystals, also via the method of one-pot synthesis. Structural analyses of the ligand and coordination compounds were assessed using characterization techniques involving physicochemical parameters and spectral analysis ( FT-IR, UV-Vis and NMR (1H NMR and 13C NMR) to confirm their synthenses and structures. Additionally, pl-dtc crystals which grew from the pl-dtc solution when refrigerated after five days, has its structure confirmed and revealed when subjected to single crystal x-ray crystallography technique. Differences in results of spectral analysis between ligands and their respective coordination compounds confirmed the coordination between ligands and coordination compounds. The in vitro antibacterial studies showed that the ligands had modest activity against Gram positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, while, the coordination compounds had modest activities against the Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli when compared with ligand of pl-dtc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ca2cb10a4f375e13b0263425a94b90e5d7683c15fc7272bafd271981c396195","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
