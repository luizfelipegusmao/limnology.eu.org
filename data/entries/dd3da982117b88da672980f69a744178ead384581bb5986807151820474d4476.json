By automating complex tasks like data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, AutoML reduces the time and resources needed to develop and deploy machine learning models. This accelerates decision-making and enables quicker responses to market changes. AutoML empowers businesses to build accurate predictive models using sophisticated algorithms, optimizing model performance for reliable insights and better outcomes. A key advantage of AutoML is its accessibility; even organizations without a dedicated data science team can leverage machine learning, reducing technical barriers and democratizing innovation. As businesses grow, AutoML scales to handle larger datasets and more complex problems without extensive manual intervention. AutoML enhances efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, becoming a crucial driver of business innovation and success. The systematic review will examine the bibliometric literature on how AutoML can boost business, analyzing 74 academic and scientific documents from the Scopus database.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd3da982117b88da672980f69a744178ead384581bb5986807151820474d4476","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
