This suggests that the current focus on selecting crop varieties based on a plant’s light-use efficiency (photosynthetic and nitrogen-use-efficiency metrics) may not be sensitive to the site’s edaphic parameters, which limit growth. This study introduces a new framework to determine if crops can achieve higher yield potentials by assessing how plants adapt to the edaphic properties that impact growth, especially when contending with climate change. The new approach calculates an Ecosystem Fit index using a ratio of remotely sensed (or observed) total net primary productivity to the theoretical maximum productivity of the site. Then, it uses that index as a benchmark to judge quantitatively whether any new crop species or variety is improving potential biomass or economic yields at that specific site. It can also determine the best soil types for those crop varieties and monitor their potential adaptability relative to climate change over time. This study used a database of 356 spatially independent reference sites to develop this framework using a landcover classification of crops across 21 ecoregions and five biomes in India. It includes total net primary productivity data, theoretical maximum productivity potential, and soil and climatic data. This comparison showed that the light-use efficiency model, as intended, was not sensitive to variations in soil characteristics, temperature, or precipitation. Our framework showed significant differences in growth by soil type and precipitation and three significant productivity thresholds by soil type. The results of this study demonstrate that total crop productivity and Ecosystem Fit create a useful index for local land managers to assess growth and yield potentials across diverse edaphic landscapes and for decision-making with changing climates.","author":"Angela M.
