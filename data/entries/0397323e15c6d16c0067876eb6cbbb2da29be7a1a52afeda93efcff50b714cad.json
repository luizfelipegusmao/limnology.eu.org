{"title":"Early Diagnosis of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia with E-Nose: A Pilot Study in Preterm Infants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0579/v1","date":1725861778000,"content":"Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common respiratory disease in pre-term and is still associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The great interest lies in iden-tifying early biomarkers that can predict the development of BPD. \nObjectives: This pilot study explores the potential of e-nose for early identification of BPD risk in premature infants by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath con-densate (EBC).\nMaterials and Methods: Fourteen mechanically ventilated very preterm infants were included in the study. Clinical parameters and EBC were collected within the first 24 hours of life. The dis-criminative ability of breath-prints between preterms who did and did not develop BPD was in-vestigated by pattern recognition, machine learning algorithm, and standard statistical methods.\nResults: We found that e-nose probes can significantly predict the outcome of “no-BPD” vs “BPD”. Specifically, a subset of probes (S18, S24, S14, and S6) were found to be significantly predictive, with an AUC of 0.87, 0.89, 0.82, 0.8 and p=0.019, 0.009, 0.043, 0.047, respectively. \nConclusion: The E-nose is an easy-to-use, handheld, non-invasive electronic device that quickly samples breath. Our preliminary study has shown that it has the potential for early prediction of BPD in preterms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0397323e15c6d16c0067876eb6cbbb2da29be7a1a52afeda93efcff50b714cad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
