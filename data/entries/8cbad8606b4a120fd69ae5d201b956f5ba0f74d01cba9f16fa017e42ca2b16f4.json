{"title":"Uncovering the Diversity and Distribution of Fungal Infections in Rwanda: Assessing Risks and Documenting Knowledge and Policy Gaps","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0756/v1","date":1720605411000,"content":"Fungal infections (FIs) are spreading globally causing a significant public health concern. However, its documentation remains sparse in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. This literature review, aims to assess the risk and document current gaps in evidence and policy. It summarizes the published data about FIs in Rwanda, including ten reports published between 1972-and-2022. Blastomyces, Candida, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Microsporum, Pneumocystis, Rhinosporidium, and Trichophyton caused human infections. These infections primarily affected the brain, respiratory, urinary and reproductive organs, and they were diagnosed using culturing, histopathology, immunology, and/or microscopic techniques. Our findings provide an overview of the diversity and distribution of FIs, highlighting significant limitations in the countryâ€™s diagnostic capacity and surveillance system for FIs. Also, indicating severe gaps in evidence to inform policymaking, guide strategic planning and intervention, underscoring the urgent need to build national capacity in fungal diagnosis, surveillance, and research. Raising awareness among the public, scientific community, healthcare providers, and policymakers remains crucial. Furthermore, this report reveals the threats of FIs on public health and food insecurity in Rwanda. A Multisectoral One Health Strategy is essential in research and intervention to determine and reduce the health and safety impacts of fungal pathogens on human, animal, and the environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cbad8606b4a120fd69ae5d201b956f5ba0f74d01cba9f16fa017e42ca2b16f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
