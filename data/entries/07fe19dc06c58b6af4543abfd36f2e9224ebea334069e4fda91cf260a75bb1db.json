{"title":"Changes in Spring Snow Cover over the Eastern and Western Tibetan Plateau and Their Associated Mechanism","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-023-3111-9","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The spring snow cover (SC) over the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) (TPSC) (W_TPSC) and eastern TPSC (E_TPSC) have displayed remarkable decreasing and increasing trends, respectively, during 1985â€“2020. The current work investigates the possible mechanisms accounting for these distinct TPSC changes. Our results indicate that the decrease in W_TPSC is primarily attributed to rising temperatures, while the increase in E_TPSC is closely linked to enhanced precipitation. Local circulation analysis shows that the essential system responsible for the TPSC changes is a significant anticyclonic system centered over the northwestern TP. The anomalous descending motion and adiabatic heating linked to this anticyclone leads to warmer temperatures and consequent snowmelt over the western TP. Conversely, anomalous easterly winds along the southern flank of this anticyclone serve to transport additional moisture from the North Pacific, leading to an increase in snowfall over the eastern TP. Further analysis reveals that the anomalous anticyclone is associated with an atmospheric wave pattern that originates from upstream regions. Springtime warming of the subtropical North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperature (SST) induces an atmospheric pattern resembling a wave train that travels eastward across the Eurasian continent before reaching the TP. Furthermore, the decline in winter sea ice (SIC) over the Barents Sea exerts a persistent warming influence on the atmosphere, inducing an anomalous atmospheric circulation that propagates southeastward and strengthens the northwest TP anticyclone in spring. Additionally, an enhancement of subtropical stationary waves has resulted in significant increases in easterly moisture fluxes over the coastal areas of East Asia, which further promotes more snowfall over eastern TP.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"07fe19dc06c58b6af4543abfd36f2e9224ebea334069e4fda91cf260a75bb1db","category":"Environment"}
