{"title":"Alteration of volatile profiles in heat‐sterilized cloudy muskmelon juice as affected by pectin fractions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13238?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Flavor is considered as a key quality attribute of fruit juice affecting consumer acceptance. During processing, the flavor loss of cloudy juice always occurs due to the variations of juice cloud particles. Pectin, a major component of cloud particles, plays an important role in cloud stability. In this work, we focused on the effects of variation of three pectin fractions caused by gentle centrifugation and clarification on the physicochemical properties, volatile content and sensory profile of heat-sterilized muskmelon cloudy juice.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Centrifugation treatment reduced the total soluble solids and viscosity of cloudy juice and increased cloud stability. With centrifugation increased, the contents of most monosaccharides in the three pectin fractions were reduced. Most aroma-active aldehydes and alcohols, such as (2<i>E</i>,6<i>Z</i>)-nonadienal, 1-octen-3-ol and (<i>E</i>)-non-2-enal, after gentle centrifugation and clarification, were maintained, but most esters were decreased. The volatile compositions were highly related to the three pectin fractions. The addition of chelator-soluble pectin and sodium carbonate-soluble pectin could decrease the formation of dimethyl trisulfide and dimethyl disulfide in clarified juice, thereby improving the sensory profile.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The results suggested that endogenous chelator-soluble pectin and sodium carbonate-soluble pectin can be used in heat-sterilized fruit juice to improve flavor quality, with an emphasis on a significant reduction in volatile sulfur compounds. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xin Pan, \nShuang Bi, \nYingying Xu, \nYanpei Cai, \nFei Lao, \nJihong Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e124207a8052bc3895a7a3989b5e5c6aae40a54e12fc3177420c6940ea63f239","category":"Environment"}
