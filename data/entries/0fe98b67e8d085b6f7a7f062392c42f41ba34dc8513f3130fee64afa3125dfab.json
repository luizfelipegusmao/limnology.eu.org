{"title":"The Prognostic Role of Advanced Lung Inflammation Index in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1233/v2","date":1724331005000,"content":"Background: The Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) is a novel, comprehensive index that integrates inflammation and nutritional status, incorporating parameters such as albumin, body mass index (BMI), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Unlike traditional inflammation biomarkers, this study aims to evaluate the prognosis of IPF patients by considering both inflammation and nutritional status. Method: A total of 102 patients with IPF were included in the study. Clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical records. NLR and ALI score were calculated based on data collected at the initiation of antifibrotic treatment using the following formula: Neut/Lym and albumin × BMI / NLR. Results: IPF subject subgroups in terms of ALI based on gender–age–physiology (GAP) stages (1,2,3), FVC (median split,","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0fe98b67e8d085b6f7a7f062392c42f41ba34dc8513f3130fee64afa3125dfab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
