{"title":"Can Selected Parameters of Brain Injury Reflect Neuronal Damage in Smoldering Multiple Sclerosis?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2041/v1","date":1721901693000,"content":"Background: Inflammatory demyelination and impaired recovery processes result in permanent neurodegeneration and neurological disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In terms of smoldering MS, chronic neuroinflammation develops in the early period of the disease and leads to confirmed disability accumulation. There is a great need to identify biomarkers of neuro-degeneration and disease progression. Methods: We evaluated the concentrations of the param-eters of brain injury (NF-H, GPAF, S100B, UCHL1) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the se-lected interleukins (ILs) in serum of 123 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 88 progressive MS (PMS) patients. Results: The levels of GFAP, S100B and UCHL were higher in the PMS group compared to RRMS as opposed to the levels of NF-H. We observed a positive correlation be-tween the selected pro-inflammatory cytokines and the parameters of brain injury. The Ex-panded Disability Status Scale score (EDSS) increased with GFA and NF-H levels and correlated with the selected ILs. The concentrations of S100B, UCHL1 and NF-H reflected the duration of MS symptoms. Conclusions: The levels of brain injury parameters in the CSF and the selected serum ILs in MS patients seem to be promising biomarkers to determine neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in smoldering MS. Further studies are warranted in this respect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a41fadc08a53b97e2d2568677f3380de61b4092b799fd2d8f577d2b0254c64d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
