{"title":"Adaptive Control of Quadrotors in Uncertain Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0637/v1","date":1710161865000,"content":"The problem addressed in this article consists of the motion control of a quadrotor, comprising model disturbances and uncertainties. In order to tackle model uncertainty, adaptive control based on reinforcement learning is used. The distinctive feature of this article, in comparison with other works on quadrotor control using reinforcement learning is the exploration of the underlying optimal control problem in which a quadratic cost and a linear dynamics allow an algorithm that runs in real time. Instead of identifying a plant model, adaptation is obtained by approximating the performance index given by the Q-function using directional forgetting recursive least squares that rely on a linear regressor build from quadratic functions of input/output data. The adaptive algorithm proposed is tested in simulation in a cascade control structure that drives a quadrotor. Simulations show the improvement in performance that results when the proposed algorithm is turned on.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"362ffa92909ddf5f333327b554f5ace5b201ff4cf9f7d1c4ceab3050202d3fe9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
