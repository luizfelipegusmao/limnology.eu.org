Lung tissues from COPD patients and mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke, cultures of human primary alveolar macrophages and macrophages derived from blood (MDM) or THP-1 monocytes were analysed for markers of macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation and accelerated senescence using multifluorescence quantitative confocal microscopy, Western blot, flow cytometry and histochemistry. Cultured macrophages were stimulated with 10% cigarette smoke extract (CSE), with or without presence of non-antibiotic macrolides 2'-desoxy-9-(S)-erythromycylamine and azithromycin-based 2'-desoxy molecule. Cigarette smoke and CSE induced in macrophages significant (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f47270705acf44cc4216f4661c594dc623fee783f799a5883e722a4dbd8f0d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
