{"title":"Screening of Nias World Rice Core Collection for Seeds with Long Longevity as Useful Potential Breeding Materials Focusing on the Stability of Embryonic RNAs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0030/v1","date":1717462353000,"content":"Seed longevity is a crucial trait for the seed industry and genetic resource preservation. To develop excellent cultivars with extended seed lifespans, it is important to understand the mechanism of keeping seed germinability long-term and to find useful genetic resources as prospective breeding materials. This study was conducted to identify the best cultivars with a high and stable seed longevity trait in the germplasm of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and to analyse the correlation between seed longevity and embryonic RNA integrity. Seeds from 69 cultivars of the world rice core collection selected by the NIAS in Japan were harvested in different years and subjected to long-term storage or controlled deterioration treatment (CDT). The long-term storage (4 °C, RH under 35%, 10 years) was performed on seeds harvested in 2010 and 2013. The seeds harvested in 2016 and 2019 were used for CDT (36 °C, RH of 80%, 40 days). Seed longevity and embryonic RNA integrity were estimated by a decrease in germination rate and RNA integrity number (RIN) after long-term storage, or CDT. The RIN value was obtained by electrophoresis of total RNA extracted from seed embryos. Seeds of ‘Vandaran (Indica)’, ‘Tupa 729 (Japonica)’, and ‘Badari Dhan (Indica)’ consistently showed higher seed longevity and embryonic RNA integrity both under long-term storage and CDT conditions, regardless of the harvest year. A strong correlation (R2 = 0.93) was observed between germination rates and RIN values of the seeds after long-term storage or CDT among nine cultivars selected based on differences in their seed longevity. The study findings revealed the relationship between rice seed longevity and embryo RNA stability and suggested potential breeding materials, including both Japonica and Indica cultivars, for improving rice seed longevity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4536d3cc3e4837c6762d5ddb0f842233b9115f5e79e0fc8e34aec83a9af718a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
