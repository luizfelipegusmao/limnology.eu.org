{"title":"From single to multi‚Äêpurpose reservoir: A framework for optimizing reservoir efficiency","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13231?af=R","date":1726550741000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The prevailing challenge centers on the limited application of single-purpose flood control reservoirs transitioning to multi-purpose reservoirs, which, despite their potential, often fall short in addressing the escalating demands for diverse water resource management. These challenges are compounded by outdated operational rules and changing environmental conditions. This research develops a framework to enhance the dual functionality of reservoirs, initially designed for flood control, to also support water supply through the determination of maximum safe water levels (MSWLs). Utilizing historical inflow data and reservoir simulation models, the study identifies opportunities for optimizing United States Army Corps of Engineers Louisville District reservoirs. It highlights certain reservoirs as ideal for augmenting water supply capabilities without compromising flood control performance. Others remain critical for flood management due to limited water supply potential, underscoring the importance of maintaining a focus on flood control. The findings illuminate the intricate balance required between managing flood risks and enhancing water supply, indicating that precise operational adjustments can significantly improve reservoir sustainability and efficiency. This method offers a viable pathway to convert single purpose reservoirs into multi-purpose reservoirs, meeting growing water demands while ensuring robust flood mitigation, and making a step toward better water utilization.</p>","author":"Mingda Lu, \nVenkatesh Merwade","siteTitle":"Wiley: JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b7070794a350c180e68e2251d6fc4f4ad5be669c5d24d82d3d55b25b0dce7a23","entryHash":"1b10bc4d64e47dfc2c32a2d9135ba7aa1c0a2f51716ad68a526cb54a2ade116b","category":"Environment"}
