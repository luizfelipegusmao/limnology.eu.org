A kind of novel technique based on pre-whitening scale-transformation symmetric bistable parallel stochastic resonance (SR) is proposed to solve the problem. Firstly, the pre-whitening can ensure the even distribution of the receiving signal to fit the requirement of SR processing. Secondly, the scale- transformation can help to utilize the weak signal improvement property especially under low frequency band more effectively. Thirdly, the symmetric bistable parallel SR can try to reduce the variance of the clutter and additive noise fluently. Fourthly, by subtracting the steady state re-sponse of the selected symmetric bistable SR system from the parallel SR output, the weak signal spectral detection objective can be realized successfully. Simulation results based on the real sea clutter radar data guarantee the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed symmetric bistable PSR processing approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19fc25d9413fc7853f84e56ed7bf66e9f013880c27807215cb1fc4c6523df628","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
