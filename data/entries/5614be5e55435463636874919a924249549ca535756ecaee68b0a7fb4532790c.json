{"title":"Cooperative effects of three preservatives on physiological quality, endophytic bacterial community and volatile organic compounds of postharvest Codonopsis pilosula var. modesta roots","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13694?af=R","date":1721041121000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Codonopsis pilosula</i> var. <i>modesta</i> (CPVM) is a famous medicinal and edible plant of Campanulaceae. However, fresh CPVM roots (FCPVR) are prone to softening, browning and spoilage after concentrated harvesting in the main production area of Gansu Province, China in autumn, which poses great challenges to their large-scale storage and modern processing. In this study, effects of chitosan (CS), natamycin (NA) and modified atmosphere agent (MA) on the postharvest quality of FCPVR were first investigated. The roots after different treatments were stored at 4 °C and relative humidity of 75 ± 5% for 100 days. Their overall quality changes were evaluated from three perspectives: physiological quality, endophytic bacterial community and volatile organic compounds.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The clustering heatmap and principal component analysis results indicated that CS (2 g kg<sup>−1</sup>), NA (0.5 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) and MA (5 g) had a synergistic effect on physiological quality. The roots in the CS + NA + MA group maintained better physiological state, effective components and antioxidant capacity throughout the storage process. On this basis, compared with room temperature storage, the relative abundance of the main spoilage bacterium <i>Pseudomonas</i> in the CS + NA + MA group roots decreased by 44% on the 100th day of storage. Furthermore, after CS + NA + MA composite treatment, the roots produced richer esters with fruit aroma during low-temperature storage.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The CS + NA + MA composite treatment could maintain the physiological quality and flavor of FCPVR, inhibit spoilage by microbial contamination and maintain the optimal quality during low-temperature storage for up to 100 days. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yanping Wang, \nLongxia Wen, \nZexin Tao, \nPingping Song, \nFang Cui, \nYanjun Jia, \nZixia Wang, \nGuolin Chai, \nFangdi Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5614be5e55435463636874919a924249549ca535756ecaee68b0a7fb4532790c","category":"Environment"}
