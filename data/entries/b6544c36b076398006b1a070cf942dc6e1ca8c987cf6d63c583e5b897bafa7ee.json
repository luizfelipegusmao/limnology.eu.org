{"title":"On the Screened Kratzer Potential and Its Variants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2080/v1","date":1717142470000,"content":"We argue that several potentials proposed recently for the analysis of the vibrational-rotational spectra of diatomic molecules and their thermodynamic properties exhibit a flaw. One can easily show that the parameters $D_e $ and $r_e$ in those potentials are not the dissociation energy and equilibrium bond length, respectively, as the proposers believe. We show how to overcome the mistake in a simple and quite general way.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6544c36b076398006b1a070cf942dc6e1ca8c987cf6d63c583e5b897bafa7ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
