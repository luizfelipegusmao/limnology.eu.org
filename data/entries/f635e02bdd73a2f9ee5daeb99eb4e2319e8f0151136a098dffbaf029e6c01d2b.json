{"title":"A convenient five-segment cassette procedure for DNA insertions coding for novel peptides","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307713","date":1722002400000,"content":"<p>by Jonathan Filley</p>\r\n\r\nA DNA cassette assembly method is described which utilizes inexpensive oligomers no longer than 40 nt in length. The five-segment cassettes have 20 nt overlaps which give an effective length of 80 nt, making it possible to code for peptides up to 20 amino acids long. The cassettes have three phosphate free nicks, which can be successfully inserted into plasmid DNA and used to transform <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. The nicks are repaired <i>in vivo</i> by an unknown mechanism. Insertions are not successful for cassettes with greater than three nicks. A procedure is provided for rapid turnaround from DNA design to peptides, which are easily isolated as C-terminal fusions with GFP. The technique generally gives the expected sequence, with errors which occur about 1% of the time. Several representative DNA inserts are described which illustrate the method, as well as chemical details on the new peptides coded for. The peptides can be readily mutated to make it possible to understand how polar and aromatic residues affect GFP-fusion solubility, and how histidine residues can be strategically placed in a peptide for good IMAC retention. The method can be used to explore a large number of new designed peptides as fusion products quickly and economically.","author":"Jonathan Filley","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f635e02bdd73a2f9ee5daeb99eb4e2319e8f0151136a098dffbaf029e6c01d2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
