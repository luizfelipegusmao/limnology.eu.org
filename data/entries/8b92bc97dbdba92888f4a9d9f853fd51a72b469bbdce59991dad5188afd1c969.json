{"title":"Bioinformatic Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy in Uterine Leiomyosarcoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0638/v1","date":1720504093000,"content":"Uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare and aggressive form of uterine cancer, with a poor prognosis and high number of uterine cancer-related deaths. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is an immunotherapy approach to antigen specific of cancer cell, thereby enhancing the immune system's ability to target and destroy cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the potential of targeting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as a novel therapeutic strategy using CAR T-cell technology in LMS. Genome datasets were obtained from NCBI-GEO database, Of the five datasets, genes that experienced significant overexpression in at least three datasets were categorized as DEGs, and DEGs were evaluated for protein localization, Gene Ontology, bioactivity, interaction, and overexpression. The results identified 25 DEGs, with ten of them expressed on the plasma membrane; four of them—HMMR, KIF20A, PRC1, and ZWINT—were part of the main protein network derived from the 25 DEGs. The dominant bioactivity of these PMGs involves influencing the cell cycle, particularly processes related to chromosome segregation. In conclusion, HMMR, KIF20A, PRC1, and ZWINT are high-potential DEGs as candidates for tumor-associated antigen CAR T-cell therapy. Further research, both in vitro and in vivo, is needed to enhance the validity of these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b92bc97dbdba92888f4a9d9f853fd51a72b469bbdce59991dad5188afd1c969","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
