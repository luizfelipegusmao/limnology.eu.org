{"title":"Persimmon tannin promotes the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ethanol stress","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13439?af=R","date":1710504567000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> plays a pivotal role in various industrial processes, including bioethanol production and alcoholic beverage fermentation. However, during these fermentations, yeasts are subjected to various environmental stresses, such as ethanol stress, which hinder cell growth and ethanol production. Genetic manipulations and the addition of natural ingredients rich in antioxidants to the culture have been shown to overcome this. Here, we investigated the potential of persimmon tannins, known for their antioxidative properties, to enhance the ethanol stress tolerance of yeast.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Assessment of the effects of 6.25 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> persimmon tannins after 48 h incubation revealed cell viability to be increased by 8.9- and 6.5-fold compared to the control treatment with and without 12.5% ethanol, respectively. Furthermore, persimmon tannins reduced ethanol-induced oxidative stress, including the production of cellular reactive oxygen species and acceleration of lipid peroxidation. However, persimmon tannins could hardly overcome ethanol-induced cell membrane damage.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The findings herein indicate the potential of persimmon tannin as a protective agent for increasing yeast tolerance to ethanol stress by restricting oxidative damage but not membrane damage. Overall, this study unveils the implications of persimmon tannins for industries relying on yeast. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ilhamzah, \nYuka Tsukuda, \nYoshihiro Yamaguchi, \nAkira Ogita, \nKen‐ichi Fujita","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"dd4127a2e5bee50b9a7811ed4e5d38eb4d27d66c806a549b76d93f5972dcad58","category":"Environment"}
