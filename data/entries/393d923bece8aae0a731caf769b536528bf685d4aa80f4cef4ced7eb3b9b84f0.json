{"title":"Vascular Ring Surgical Repair: Re-implantation of the Left Subclavian Artery into the Left Carotid Artery in a Pediatric Patient.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1771/v1","date":1719352919000,"content":"Vascular rings are a rare congenital anomaly of the aortic arch in which a ring-shaped structure forms surrounding the trachea and/or esophagus, potentially causing compression. We describe the case of a 14-month-old female patient with failure to thrive secondary to dysphagia, and a vascular ring formed by a right aortic arch, an aberrant left subclavian artery, and a left liga-mentum arteriosum. Surgical repair involved ligamentum arteriosum division, Kommerellâ€™s di-verticulum obliteration, and left subclavian artery re-implantation into the left carotid artery. Endoscopy and EndoFLIPTM evaluated intraoperative improvement in esophageal narrowing and impedance, respectively. Postoperative period was uneventful and follow-up visits demonstrated dysphagia resolution and a patent re-implanted left subclavian artery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"393d923bece8aae0a731caf769b536528bf685d4aa80f4cef4ced7eb3b9b84f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
