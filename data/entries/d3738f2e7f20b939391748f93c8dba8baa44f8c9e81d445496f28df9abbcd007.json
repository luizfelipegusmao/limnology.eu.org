The unique mechanical resistance is attributed to the coherent γ/γ' microstructure in which the cuboidal γ' precipitates exhibit an ordered L1<sub>2</sub> crystal structure embedded in γ matrix channels, which is a solid solution with a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.625-B1\">1</a>]. In severely harsh operation environments, the mechanical properties of superalloys are primarily controlled by the precipitate shearing events associated with elemental segregation to and away from dislocations and planar faults within the γ' phases [<a href=\"#ozae044.625-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d3738f2e7f20b939391748f93c8dba8baa44f8c9e81d445496f28df9abbcd007","category":"Environment"}
