{"title":"Hand Carriage of Yeast in Student of Medicine, Nurses and Medical Laboratory Scientist. Impact of Infection Control Measures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1367/v1","date":1724117963000,"content":"We studied yeast hand carriage of 260 students from medicine (78), nursing (89), and medical laboratory scientist (93). We isolated yeasts in 27 students (10.4%), with no differences between careers or gender. A significant lower prevalence of carriage was shown in the clinical cycle (2.7%) compared to the basic cycle (13.5%) (p=0.022) and the preclinical cycle (13.5%) (p=0.014).Increased handwashing frequency and alcohol gel use decreased yeast carriage. Students who applied moisturizing hand cream two or more times a day had a lower frequency of yeast carriage (3.4%) compared to those who did not use it or used it only once a day (16.5%), showing a significant difference (p=0.016). The most prevalent species was C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (81.5%), followed by Meyerozyma guilliermondii (C. guillermondii) (7.4%), Trichosporon mucoides (7.4%), and R. mucilagenosa (3.7%). And one case showed mixed carriage of C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. All strains were sensitive to voriconazole, caspofungin, and anidulafungin. This study shows the yeast carriage on the hands of health students, especially of C. parapsilosis, and its reduction with the frequent use of infection control measures and moisturizing hand cream.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bd2dd9036ac96978e7001d6a8f13478caeb490d5f92ba84c269b39840f212d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
