{"title":"In-Vivo Glucose Assay on the Living Fish Brain Molecule and Human Urine by Using of Bismuth-Immobilized Carbon Nanotube Paste Electrode","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0990/v1","date":1728985514000,"content":"Background/Objective: In-vivo diabetes detection of glucose were sought using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SW), with bismuth-immobilized carbon nanotube paste electrode (BCE). Methods: The optimum analytical results indicated sensitive peak signals on the BCE. The raw voltammogram was approached within the 1 mgL-1-14 mgL-1 and 10 ugL-1-140 ugL-1, detection limits with preconcentration times of 100 and 200 sec. Results: The relative standard deviation was 0.02 % (n = 15) of 10.0 mgL-1 under optimum conditions. The analytical detection limit (S/N) was attained at 8 ugL-1. The handmade microsensor was directly used in vivo on the living fish brain and human urine.Conclusion: The method was applied at real time in vivo, without requiring any pretreatment and other ionic electrolyte solutions. It can be used for medicinal and other materials requiring biological-fluid detection in real time. This study was designed to be suitable for real-time unmanned remote diagnosis and therapeutic drug injection into the body, micro-needle long-term administration, wearable artificial skin tattoo sensor, and real-time control. In addition, the glasses monitor was designed to be suitable for multitasking and multi-user control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9a477f5b11ca0d300fd23266fd63ed7581f1cd7b9b49a4e520cffaba03e74a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
