{"title":"Effect of Curcumin plus Piperine on Redox Imbalance and Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0011/v1","date":1714530422000,"content":"Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) present chronic inflammatory challenges marked by increased oxidative stress. This study assessed the collective impact of Curcumin plus piperine on oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers in mild to moderate IBD patients. Methods Patients diagnosed with CD or UC, aged ≥18 years with preserved kidney and liver functions, were randomized into three groups: placebo, Curcumin (1000 mg/day), and Curcumin plus piperine (1000 mg + 10 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected to analyze oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, before and after the intervention period. Results: Curcumin plus piperine group had significantly higher serum SOD compared to the placebo group, after adjusting for sex, age, and type of IBD (4346.9 ± 879.0 vs 3614.5 ± 731.5; p=0.041). There were no significant differences in the other oxidative stress or inflammatory markers between groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that 12 weeks of Curcumin plus piperine supplementation effectively enhances the enzymatic antioxidant defense, particularly SOD, in IBD patients. These findings hold promise for managing redox imbalance in individuals with IBD, highlighting potential therapeutic benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c7ae6f0df31ef9e5b92240c21fc867c12fd3585811a955e31d05e633e563e40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
