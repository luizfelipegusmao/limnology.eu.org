Scholars have developed diverse network protocols on how to ensure data transmission while maintaining its self-organizational nature. However, it is difficult for traditional network protocols to meet the needs of increasingly complex networks. In order to solve the problem that the better node set may not be selected when selecting the node set responsible for forwarding in the traditional OLSR protocol, a multi-objective optimized OLSR algorithm is proposed in this paper, which incorporating a new MPR mechanism and an improved NSGA-II algorithm. In the process of route discovery, the intermediate nodes responsible for forwarding packets are determined by the new MPR mechanism, and then the main parameters in the OLSR protocol are provided by the multi-objective optimization algorithm. Matlab was used to build a self-organizing network in this study. In addition, the conventional OLSR protocol, NSGA-II algorithm and multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm are selected to compare with the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce packet loss and end-to-end delay while obtaining better results in HV and Spacing, two multi-objective optimization result evaluation metrics.","author":"Wenhong Wei","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2c96837c3cfb9c6c15ae96eb2848e165a05e863b70d34332bbaa70bfd1be2ae7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
