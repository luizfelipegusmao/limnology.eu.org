{"title":"Technological Interventions to Implement Prevention and Health Promotion in Cardiovascular Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2266/v1","date":1725024960000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The aim of the narrative review was to identify information on the impact of technological interventions (such as telehealth and mobile health) on the health promotion of cardiac patients from diverse populations; Methods: Online databases of PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles in the English language regarding technological interventions for health promotion in cardiac patients. In addition, a methodological quality control process was conducted. Exclusion was based on first reading the abstract and then the full manuscript confirming content was not related to cardiac patients and technological interventions; Results: 11 studies were included in the review after quality control analysis. The sample size reported in these studies ranged from 12 to 1424 subjects. In 8 studies mobile phones, smartphones and apps were used asÂ mHealth intervention with tracking and texting component; 2 studies used videoconferencing as a digital intervention program, while one study focused on using physical activity trackers; Conclusions: This review highlights the digital divide as individuals with limited eHealth literacy and lack of technological knowledge are not motivated or able participate in these interventions. Finding methods to overcome these barriers are important and can be solved to some extent by providing the technology and technical support.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b7d3728c22de6e5ba4f483d70a5ec3f2e2acce2cbbaa7ff63429aeb66f796cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
