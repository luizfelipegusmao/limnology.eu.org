{"title":"A Possibilistic Formulation of Autonomous Search for Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1538/v1","date":1716455767000,"content":"Autonomous search is an ongoing cycle of sensing, statistical estimation and motion control with objective to find and localise targets in a designated search area. Traditionally, the theoretical framework for autonomous search combines the sequential Bayesian estimation with the information theoretic motion control. This paper formulates autonomous search in the framework of possibility theory. Although the possibilistic formulation is slightly more involved than the traditional, it provides means for quantitative modelling and reasoning in the presence of epistemic uncertainty. This feature is demonstrated in the paper in the context of partially known probability of detection, expressed as an interval value. The paper presents an elegant Bayes-like solution to sequential estimation, with the reward function for motion control defined to take into account the epistemic uncertainty. The advantages of the proposed search algorithm are demonstrated by numerical simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"627203d4c176d479528fc09b0baed4f5cb28516688703f957b90ee7cd1c87e14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
