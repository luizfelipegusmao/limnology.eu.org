{"title":"Regulation of hepatic xenosensor function by HNF4alpha","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/200/2/346/7684956?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nuclear receptors such as constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), and transcription factors with nuclear receptor type activity such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) function as xenobiotic sensors. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4α) is a highly conserved orphan nuclear receptor essential for liver function. We tested the hypothesis that HNF4α is essential for the function of these 4 major xenosensors. Wild-type (WT) and hepatocyte-specific <span>Hnf4a</span> null (HNF4α-KO) mice were treated with the mouse-specific activators of AhR (TCDD, 30 µg/kg), CAR (TCPOBOP, 2.5 µg/g), PXR, (PCN, 100 µg/g), and PPARα (WY-14643, 1 mg/kg). Blood and liver tissue samples were collected to study receptor activation. TCDD (AhR agonist) treatment did not affect the liver-to-body weight ratio (LW/BW) in either WT or HNF4α-KO mice. Further, TCDD activated AhR in both WT and HNF4α-KO mice, confirmed by increase in expression of AhR target genes. TCPOBOP (CAR agonist) significantly increased the LW/BW ratio and CAR target gene expression in WT mice, but not in HNF4α-KO mice. PCN (a mouse PXR agonist) significantly increased LW/BW ratio in both WT and HNF4α-KO mice however, failed to induce PXR target genes in HNF4α-KO mice. The treatment of WY-14643 (PPARα agonist) increased LW/BW ratio and PPARα target gene expression in WT mice but not in HNF4α-KO mice. Together, these data indicate that the function of CAR, PXR, and PPARα but not of AhR was disrupted in HNF4α-KO mice. These results demonstrate that HNF4α function is critical for the activation of hepatic xenosensors, which are critical for toxicological responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"3f98c2c1f8a10c90d83694ecad298fa332a84db8512e2ce142a20dda0491c1c7","category":"Environment"}
