{"title":"Patent Review of Novel Compounds Targeting Opioid Use Disorder (2012‚ÄêPresent)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1582/v1","date":1721379333000,"content":"Opioids have served as a cornerstone in pain management for decades. However, the emergence of increasingly potent synthetic analogs brings forth a range of side effects, including respiratory depression, tolerance, dependence, constipation, and, more importantly, the development of severe and debilitating opioid use disorder (OUD). Search for therapeutics to mitigate OUD has been challenging and this has called for novel approaches that include design of small molecules targeting neuronal circuits involved in addiction (opioid, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamate receptors, etc.) and development of biologics that target circulating opioids/opiates. In this review, we retrieved and discussed over two dozen of relevant patents filed in the past twelve (12) years that focus on novel approaches to produce therapeutics for OUD. The current review excluded patents on biologics and concentrated on small molecules, which will be discussed separately in a subsequent sequel. The chemical entities disclosed were highlighted and specific examples were provided where necessary. Although the number of patents in the realm of drug discovery for OUD is currently limited, we foresee a continued expansion in the quest for therapeutics for OUD in the years to come.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"545cfe428df94d718563f17d551c2f396bf6ee1bc0ed85a98ad82422375ff46d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
