{"title":"Lead exposure aggravates glucose metabolism disorders through gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier damage in high‐fat diet‐fed mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13197?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Lead (Pb) is an ancient toxic metal and is still a major public health issue. Our previous study found that Pb exposure promotes metabolic disorders in obese mice, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study explored the effects of Pb exposure on glucose homeostasis in mice fed a normal diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD) from the perspective of gut microbiota.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Pb exposure had little effect on glucose metabolism in ND mice, but exacerbated hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance in HFD mice. Pb exposure impaired intestinal tight junctions and mucin expression in HFD mice, increasing intestinal permeability and inflammation. Moreover, Pb exposure altered the composition and structure of the gut microbiota and decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels in HFD mice. Correlation analysis revealed that the gut microbiota and SCFAs were significantly correlated with the gut barrier and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, the fecal microbiota transplantation from Pb-exposed HFD mice resulted in glucose homeostasis imbalance, intestinal mucosal structural damage and inflammation in recipient mice. However, Pb did not exacerbate the metabolic toxicity in HFD mice under depleted gut microbiota.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The findings of the present study suggest that Pb induces impairment of glucose metabolism in HFD mice by perturbing the gut microbiota. Our study offers new perspectives on the mechanisms of metabolic toxicity of heavy metals and demonstrates that the gut microbiota may be a target of action for heavy metal exposure. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Nana Wang, \nXue Gao, \nYuan Huo, \nYuting Li, \nFangru Cheng, \nZengli Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1121cf4188347716a0965155041e28588824f4ba14e19b26bf9ed58852d1baa3","category":"Environment"}
