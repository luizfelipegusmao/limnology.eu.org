{"title":"Urinary Tract Infections in Kidney Transplant Patients Admitted to Hospital: A Real-Life Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1400/v1","date":1716458691000,"content":"Urinary tract infections in kidney transplant patients are a real challenge. We conducted a retrospective observational study, enrolling all kidney transplant patients hospitalized for urinary tract infection (UTI), with the objective to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical sta-tus, therapeutic management, and clinical outcome of kidney transplant patients hospi-talized for urinary tract infection in a university hospital. From our real-life experience, infection with multidrug-resistant germs was confirmed as a risk factor for the severe evolution of the infection and at the same time the re-evaluation of immunosuppressive therapy could be an important therapeutic strategy in the course of infection. Prompt ini-tiation of empiric antibiotic therapy upon initiation of microbiological investigations could potentially reduce the risk of severe infection progression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3eabf09257b50897c17eb17abf4cdbefedd6107818d8a7e4f1795eb529005bd8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
