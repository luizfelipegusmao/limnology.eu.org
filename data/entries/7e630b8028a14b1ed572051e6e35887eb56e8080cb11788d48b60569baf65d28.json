{"title":"From Bioink to Tissue: Exploring Chitosan-Agarose Composite in the Context of Printability and Cellular Behaviour","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1701/v1","date":1724394210000,"content":"This study presents an innovative method for producing thermosensitive bio-ink from chitosan hydrogels saturated with carbon dioxide and agarose. It focuses on a detailed characterization of their physicochemical properties and potential applications in biomedicine and tissue engineering. The ORO test approved rapid regeneration of the three-dimensional structure of chitosan-agarose composites in the unidirectional bench press simulation test. The diffusion of dyes through chitosan-agarose hydrogel membranes strongly depended on the share of both polymers in the composite and the molecular weight of the dyes. Glucose, as a nutrient marker, also diffused through all membranes regardless of composition. Biocompatibility assessment using MTT tests on 46BR.1N fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes confirmed the safety of the bioink. The regenerative potential of the bioink was confirmed by efficient cell migration, especially HaCaT. Long-term viability studies showed that chitosan-agarose scaffolds, unlike the agarose ones, support cell proliferation and survival, especially 14 days after bioink extrusion. Experiments in a skin wound model in mice confirmed the biocompatibility of tested dressing and the beneficial action of chitosan on healing. Studies on vessel formation in chicken embryos highlight the potential of the chitosan-agarose composition for enhancing proangiogenic effects. This composition meets all entry criteria and possesses excellent biological properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e630b8028a14b1ed572051e6e35887eb56e8080cb11788d48b60569baf65d28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
