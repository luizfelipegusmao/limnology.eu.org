{"title":"Mitigating Co-Activity Conflicts and Resource Overallocation in Construction Projects: A Modular Heuristic Scheduling Approach with Primavera P6 EPPM Integration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0178/v1","date":1714721360000,"content":"This paper proposes a heuristic approach for managing complex construction projects. The tool incorporates with Primavera P6 EPPM and Synchro 4D, enabling proactively clash detection and resolution of spatial conflicts during concurrent tasks. Additionally, it performs resource verification for sufficient allocation before task initiation. This integrated approach facilitates the generation of conflict-free and feasible construction schedules. By adhering to project constraints and seamlessly integrating with existing industry tools, the proposed solution offers a comprehensive and robust approach for construction project management. This constitutes to our knowledge the first dynamic digital twin for the delivery of a complex project.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0623343e2c02ebf7867343fbaa631acc6561bfad00cb87f7a3056fa6d9670653","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
