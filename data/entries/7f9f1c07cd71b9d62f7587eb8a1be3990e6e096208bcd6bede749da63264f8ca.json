{"title":"System, Life and Modernity: Study on the Design of the Collective Residential Buildings of the People&rsquo;s Commune in the Early Stage of P.R.C","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1538/v1","date":1726757243000,"content":"To promote of the rural revitalization strategy in China, this study attempts to summarize the gains and losses by the review of the design practice of rural buildings of the People's Commune in the late 1950s. Firstly, from the macro perspective, this paper gleans the relevant commune housing design cases in the Architectural Journal from 1958 to 1960 and summarizes the overall common design policies. Secondly, from the micro perspective, the paper analyzes the process of the investigation and creation through a concrete case. The paper concludes that the actual production and living needs of farmers must be taken into consideration in the process of the implementation of rural modernization, instead of simply putting the focus on standardized construction. Finally, the article points out the two characteristics of \"rural modernity\" reflected in the process of promoting rural modernization during the early stage of modern China: 1) collective wisdom and efforts; 2) combining local and foreign cultures. This article aims to provide a historical reference for current architects to carry out effective design practices in combination with rural development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f9f1c07cd71b9d62f7587eb8a1be3990e6e096208bcd6bede749da63264f8ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
