{"title":"Interactions between Forest Cover and Watershed Hydrology: A State-of-the-Art Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0165/v1","date":1725343508000,"content":"The role of trees in watershed hydrology is governed by many environmental factors along with their inherent characteristics and not surprisingly has generated into diverse debates in the literature. Herein, this state-of-the-art review provides an opportunity to propose a conceptual model for understanding the role of trees in watershed hydrology and examine the conditions under which they can be an element that increases or decreases water supply in a watershed hydrology. To achieve this goal, this review addressed the interaction of forest cover with climatic conditions, soil types, infiltration, siltation and erosion, water availability, and the diversity of their ecological features. The novelty of the proposed conceptual model highlights that tree species and densities, climate, precipitation, type of aquifer, and topography are important factors affecting the relationships between trees and water availability. This suggests that forests can be used as a nature-based solution for conserving and managing natural resources, including water, soil and air. To sum up, forests can reduce peopleâ€™s imprint, thanks to their role in improving water and air quality, conserving soil, and other ecosystem services. The outcomes of this study should be valuable for decision-makers when investing in reforestation in a watershed hydrology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6d71c1ef11f814cb3acb163d9b1f43074812e96bb4e7e1b75260cec3273dfcc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
