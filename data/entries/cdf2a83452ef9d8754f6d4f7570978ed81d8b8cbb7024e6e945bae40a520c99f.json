{"title":"Factors influencing the maternal choice of packaged snacks for 6–10 years old children: A cross-sectional study from Sri Lanka","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003574","date":1725458400000,"content":"<p>by Dulshani Pujitha Gunawardhana, Ishanka Ayeshwari Talagala</p>\r\n\r\nChildhood overweight and obesity due to unhealthy diet result in several adverse effects. Mothers play a major role in selecting snacks for younger children. This study assessed the factors associated with the choice of packaged food/beverage snacks among mothers of 6- to 10-year-old children in the Medical Officer of Health area Balangoda. A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study with an analytical component was conducted in 2022 among 450 mothers with 6- to 10-year-old children through two-stage, stratified (year of birth considered as a stratum), simple random sampling technique in ten randomly selected Public Health Midwife areas in the medical officer of health area Balangoda. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to assess participants’ sociodemographic, usual practices, attitudes, and knowledge toward packaged snacks. Factors associated with maternal practices related to packaged snack selection were assessed through the chi-square test at the p&lt;0.05 significance level. The response rate was 99.3% (N = 447). Children were commonly provided with biscuits (94.4%) and flavoured milk (44.7%) daily (66.4%) at home (93.5%). The majority of mothers reported poor practices in selecting packaged snacks (88.8%), but good knowledge (62.9%) and favorable attitudes (93.5%) toward packaged snacks. The majority (75.5%) were aware that snacks are important for overcoming the hunger gap among children. Childs’ preference (77.6%) was the leading influencing factor while, the nutritional value of the packaged snacks minimally influenced the maternal (2.7%) choice. Only 49.9% mothers knew that packaged fruits could be consumed as snacks. Maternal Sinhalese ethnicity (p&lt;0.001), secondary or higher education (p&lt;0.001), having one child (p = 0.003), residing in a rural or urban area (p = 0.011) and having favourable attitudes (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with poor maternal practices in packaged snack selection. Although mothers’ knowledge toward packaged snacks were good, their practices in selecting packaged snacks were poor. Maternal ethnicity, educational level, number of children, area of residence and attitudes were significantly associated with mothers’ selection of packaged snacks. The results of the study highlighted the need to plan, develop and implement focused health promotion programmes to empower mothers to select healthier packaged snack options for their 6- to 10-year-old children.","author":"Dulshani Pujitha Gunawardhana","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"cdf2a83452ef9d8754f6d4f7570978ed81d8b8cbb7024e6e945bae40a520c99f","category":"Environment"}
