Annular Dark Field (ADF) STEM, frequently employed for determining atomic structures, primarily detects thermal diffuse scattering, which depends on atomic displacements, particularly due to atomic vibrations [<a href=\"#ozae044.938-B1\">1</a>]. However, conventional annular detectors have not been able to obtain detailed distributions of thermal diffuse scattering, and thus could not consider the anisotropy of atomic displacements. On the other hand, the recently developed multi-dimensional detectors, such as segmented and pixelated detectors, can detect the changes in scattering distribution due to the atomic vibrations. Consequently, quantitative imaging of atomic vibration properties may be possible by analyzing detailed distributions of thermal diffuse scattering.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7aebbf83635704fe3fedbe9ea3eecd144f64d4016d28314994f3b29e28db3d2b","category":"Environment"}
