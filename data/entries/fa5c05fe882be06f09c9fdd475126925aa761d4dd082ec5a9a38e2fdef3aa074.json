This study aimed to produce and characterize a plant-based dairy alternative dessert based on araticum pulp and chickpea extract without added sugar and fat. Three formulations were prepared: Formulation 1 (F1): 20% araticum pulp + 80% chickpea extract; Formulation 2 (F2): 30% araticum pulp + 70% chickpea extract; and Formulation 3 (F3): 40% araticum pulp + 60% chickpea extract. All formulations’ chemical composition, sensorial characteristics, viscosity, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and microbiological stability were analyzed during 28 days of storage at 4°C and a relative humidity of 23%. Energetic value ranged from 64 to 71 kcal/100g, and carbohydrate content from 9.68 to 11.06, protein from 3.38 to 3.04, lipids from 1.41 to 1.60, ashes from 0.53 to 0.59 and crude fiber from 0.86 to 1.34 g/100g among the formulations. The increase in the proportion of araticum pulp in the formulations reduced moisture content by 1.2 to 2.1% (F1: 84.2, F2: 83.2, and F3: 82.4), protein content by 3 to 9% (F1: 3.3, F2: 3.2, and F3: 3.0), and pH value by 5.8 to 10.7% (F1: 5.50, F2: 5.18, and F3: 4.91), and increased the TSS by 1.1 to 1.3-fold (F1: 8.36, F2: 8.98, and F3: 10.63 º Brix), total phenolics content by 1.5 to 2.0-fold (F1: 4,677, F2: 6,943, and F3: 10,112 gallic acid μmol/L) and antioxidant activity by 1.8 to 2.8-fold (F1: 1,974, F2: 3,664, and F3: 5.523). During the 28 days of storage at 4°C, the formulations F1 and F2 showed better stability of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity; however, the formulation F3 showed acceptable microbiological quality up to 28 days of storage, higher viscosity, 8 to 16-fold higher than the formulations F1 and F2, respectively (F1: 238.90, F2: 474.30, and F3:3,959.77 mPa.s), antioxidant capacity and better scores in sensory analysis. The present study showed that the plant-based dessert elaborated with araticum pulp and chickpea extract might be considered a potential dairy alternative product with high antioxidant activity, protein content, and a viscosity similar to yogurt; however, its sensory aspects need improvement.","author":"Maria Carolina Mesquita","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fa5c05fe882be06f09c9fdd475126925aa761d4dd082ec5a9a38e2fdef3aa074","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
