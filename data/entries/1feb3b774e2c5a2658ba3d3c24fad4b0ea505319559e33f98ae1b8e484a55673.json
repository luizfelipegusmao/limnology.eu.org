It was elevated to species status based on the results of an extensive molecular genetics analysis of the <span>O. palustris</span> complex. The poorly defined eastern boundary of <span>O. texensis</span> includes Mississippi, Arkansas, southern Missouri, and southern Illinois, with populations extending westward to southeastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, eastern and coastal Texas, into northeastern Tamaulipas, Mexico. Present in tidal marshes and other habitats near water, <span>O. texensis</span> is omnivorous, with some populations being highly carnivorous.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mammalian Species Current Issue","siteHash":"d5742e1796b88cd2c879adb4f8e6fc1ef2b0693f3b0522d026145c332f7c4e5c","entryHash":"1feb3b774e2c5a2658ba3d3c24fad4b0ea505319559e33f98ae1b8e484a55673","category":"Environment"}
