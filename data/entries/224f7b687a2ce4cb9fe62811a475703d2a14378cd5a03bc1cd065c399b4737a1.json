The dynamics of these magnetic textures have been investigated by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM), where magnetic imaging before and after impulsive stimuli are performed and directly compared (so called stop-motion measurements) [<a href=\"#ozae044.506-B2\">2-4</a>]. However, time-resolved measurements on ns × nm spatiotemporal scale are still challenging although it is crucial for further understanding the response of nanoscale magnetic textures to external excitations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"224f7b687a2ce4cb9fe62811a475703d2a14378cd5a03bc1cd065c399b4737a1","category":"Environment"}
