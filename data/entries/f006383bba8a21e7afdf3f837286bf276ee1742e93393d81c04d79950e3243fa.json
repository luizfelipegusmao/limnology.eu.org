{"title":"Key Proteins in Rat Cerebral Cortex: Application of Cornu aspersum Extract as Neuroprotective Agent in Alzheimer&rsquo;s Type Dementia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0749/v1","date":1728548769000,"content":"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most widespread neurodegenerative disorder. Recently, it was found that mucus extract from Cornu aspersum have beneficial effects on memory and cognitive processes in a rat scopolamine model of AD. The present study elucidated mechanisms of action of standardized mucus snail extract (SE) enriched with fraction above 20 kDa on Alzheimer-type dementia in rats. Using proteomic analysis on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D–PAGE) on rat cortex extracts we compared protein expression in both groups: the first group treated intraperitoneally with scopolamine (Sco, 2 mg/kg, 11 days) and the second (Sco + SE) group treated intraperitoneally with Sco (Sco, 2 mg/kg) and protected by SE (0.5 ml/100 g bw) applied daily orally for 11 days. Brain cortex was separated and the expression of various proteins related to memory and cognitive functions were identified. We found that the expression of Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, Calbindin, Vacuolar ATP synthase catalytic subunit A, Tropomyosin beta chain, 14-3-3 zeta/delta, Kinesin-1 heavy chain and Stathmin-4 significantly differs in SE-protected rats as compared to non-treated dement animals, and these brain proteins might be potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s type dementia treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f006383bba8a21e7afdf3f837286bf276ee1742e93393d81c04d79950e3243fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
