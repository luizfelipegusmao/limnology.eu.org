{"title":"Rhodiola and Salidroside Attenuate Oxidative Stress‐Triggered H9c2 Cardiomyoblast Apoptosis Through IGF1R‐Induced ERK1/2 Activation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24372?af=R","date":1723030828000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Oxidative stress is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. <i>Rhodiola</i>, a traditional Chinese medicine, is recognized for its potent antioxidant properties. Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside derived from <i>Rhodiola rosea</i>, has shown remarkable antioxidant capabilities. This study aimed to elucidate the potential protective mechanisms of <i>Rhodiola</i> and salidroside against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cardiac apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. H9c2 cells were exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 4 h, and subsequently treated with <i>Rhodiola</i> or salidroside for 24 h. Cell viability and apoptotic pathways were assessed. The involvement of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and the activation of extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were investigated. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 μM) exposure significantly induced cardiac apoptosis in H9c2 cells. However, treatment with <i>Rhodiola</i> (12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL) and salidroside (0.1, 1, and 10 nM) effectively attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. This protective effect was associated with IGF1R-activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to the inhibition of Fas-dependent proteins, HIF-1α, Bax, and Bak expression in H9c2 cells. The images from hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunofluorescence assays also revealed the protective effects of <i>Rhodiola</i> and salidroside in H9c2 cells against oxidative damage. Our findings suggest that <i>Rhodiola</i> and salidroside possess antioxidative properties that mitigate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. The protective mechanisms involve the activation of IGF1R and subsequent phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These results propose <i>Rhodiola</i> and salidroside as potential therapeutic agents for cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in heart diseases. Future studies may explore their clinical applications in cardiac health.</p>","author":"I‐Ju Ju, \nBruce Chi‐Kang Tsai, \nWei‐Wen Kuo, \nChia‐Hua Kuo, \nYueh‐Min Lin, \nDennis Jine‐Yuan Hsieh, \nPei‐Ying Pai, \nShang‐En Huang, \nShang‐Yeh Lu, \nShin‐Da Lee, \nChih‐Yang Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"7539fd876bbbea7e83628e06e9ab63f28c0fb1e68568ab49f339830598072756","category":"Environment"}
