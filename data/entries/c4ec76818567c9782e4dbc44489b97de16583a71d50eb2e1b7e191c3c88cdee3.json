Nanomagnetic phenomena can be imaged via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM), which turns off the objective lens to enable a magnetic-field-free sample plane. However, disabling the most powerful lens of the microscope comes at the cost of the subnanometer resolution possible in conventional TEMs. Without full microscope capability, we cannot simultaneously understand the interplay of nanomagnetic domains and atomic structure, hampering the advent of low energy spintronics devices. Novel approaches to move beyond this limitation in recent years include using ptychography [<a href=\"#ozae044.510-B1\">1</a>] and simulation-assisted analysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.510-B2\">2</a>]. We use STEMH to directly measure magnetic-induced phase shifts in Fe/Gd multilayer thin films.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c4ec76818567c9782e4dbc44489b97de16583a71d50eb2e1b7e191c3c88cdee3","category":"Environment"}
