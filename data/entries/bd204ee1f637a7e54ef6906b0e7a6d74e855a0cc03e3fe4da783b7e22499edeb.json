DOWNY MILDEW RESISTANT 6 (DMR6) from Arabidopsis is a negative regulator of plant immunity and its loss of function confers resistance to downy mildew. In grapevine, <span>DMR6</span> is present in two copies, named <span>VvDMR6-1</span> and <span>VvDMR6-2</span>. Here, we describe the editing of <span>VvDMR6-1</span> in embryogenic calli using CRISPR/Cas9 and the regeneration of the edited plants. All edited plants were found to be biallelic and chimeric, and whilst they all showed reduced growth compared with non-transformed control plants, they also had reduced susceptibility to <span>P. viticola</span>. Comparison between mock-inoculated genotypes showed that all edited lines presented higher levels of salicylic acid than controls, and lines subjected to transformation presented higher levels of cis-resveratrol than controls. Our results identify <span>VvDMR6-1</span> as a promising target for breeding grapevine cultivars with improved resistance to downy mildew.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bd204ee1f637a7e54ef6906b0e7a6d74e855a0cc03e3fe4da783b7e22499edeb","category":"Environment"}
