{"title":"The Role of Genetic Factors in the Determinism of Malignant Lymphomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0628/v1","date":1725866475000,"content":"Introduction: Situated within the broad spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases, Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are neoplasms renowned for their complexity and heterogeneity, insidious   onset,   and   frequent  detectability  at   advanced,   even   terminal, stages worldwide.Objectives: The study aimed to compile conclusive statistics, identify genetic factors, and establish correlations with environmental carcinogens, while simultaneously highlighting the importance of developing preventive informational programs for the population.Materials and Methods: The retrospective study encompassed individuals admitted to the Hematology Clinic of \"Sfântul Spiridon\" Hospital in Iași between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. Out of 1916 patients hospitalized with hematologic neoplasms, 392 were diagnosed with lymphoma. Eighty-four cases exhibiting genetic predisposition (21.42%) were selected, among which 20 displayed a heightened genetic burden (5.1%). These cases were thoroughly analyzed based on medical records.Results and discussion: The study underscores/highlights/emphasizes the significant position of malignant lymphomas among hematologic neoplasms (20.45%). Although the majority do not present malignant heredocolateral antecedents(78.58%), with an estimated empirical recurrence risk(2-4%), predisposing diseases, along with exposure to environmental carcinogens, as well as the region of residence,  play   fundamental   roles   in   the   determinism.   It   is   observed   that   older   individuals   from   urban agglomerations, especially males (54-70%), have a higher probability of developing these conditions and are therefore recommended to undergo regular check-ups.Conclusion: Unequivocally characterized by a vast etiology, multifactorial diseases result from the bilateral interaction between environmental and hereditary factors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ddf2a89d3c24d6af27bfdd5fbffb23bc7c8958d2a6cd7697eebe5acaf8de607","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
