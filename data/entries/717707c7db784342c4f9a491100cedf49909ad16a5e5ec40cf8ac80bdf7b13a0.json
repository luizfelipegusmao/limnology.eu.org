The role of IRE in the treatment of colorectal hepatic metastases is unestablished.  This study is an international ques-tionnaire survey of the use of IRE for colorectal hepatic metastases. Methods: A questionnaire addressing views on the use of IRE for colorectal liver metastases was circulated to clinicians with an interest and/or expertise in this technique.  Results: 64 clinicians from 17 different countries replied to the questionnaire.  Thirty-six (56%) had experience of treating patients with colorectal liver metastases with IRE. The preferred mode of delivery of IRE was percutaneous treatment under CT guidance. Thirty-three (70% respondents) used IRE exclusively for lesions in proximity to inflow or outflow structures. Twenty (43% respondents) used IRE as their sole ablative treat-ment whilst 19 (40% respondents) used IRE in combination with thermal ablation. The maximum number of lesions that could be treated by IRE was two and preferred size of lesion was","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"717707c7db784342c4f9a491100cedf49909ad16a5e5ec40cf8ac80bdf7b13a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
