{"title":"Aggregate Exposure Pathways for 6PPD Quinone: A Quantitative Source-to-Target Site Case Study Integrating Exposure and Human","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2301/v1","date":1722251691000,"content":"Research interest in the occurrence, distribution, fate, and toxicity of N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-Nâ€™-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) quinone, a derivative of the tire amino antioxidant 6PPD in urban environments, has surged. While several studies have found that 6PPD quinone exhibits acute, reproductive, and behavioral toxicity as well as mutagenicity and hepatotoxicity in aquatic and terrestrial animals, its environmental exposure data are fragmented and lack coherence across the source-to-exposure continuum, making it difficult to use for risk assessment and regulatory purposes. The present work developed an aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) framework to integrate the exposure data. An AEP network was developed for the atmospheric deposition of 6PPD quinone from tire wear in the Pearl River Delta, which led to human exposure. The 6PPD quinone research was organized, visualized, and evaluated with pertinent knowledge gaps identified using the weight of evidence assessment. Eight key exposure states were identified, with only two having high confidence levels and three having low confidence levels. Empirical support for the key transitional relationships decreased from High to Low from the source to the target site, indicating an urgent need for downstream mechanistic data. The proposed AEP framework integrated diverse 6PPD quinone research, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of the source-to-outcome continuum, as well as the development of quantitative predictive models for future research and environmental regulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6152b8738a6f49a705bdbed148b03da377edd98ca85ef41ce281b60f3573a4c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
