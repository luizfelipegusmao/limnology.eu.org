{"title":"Lipid Droplets: Packing Hydrophobic Molecules Within the Aqueous Cytoplasm","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070122-021752?TRACK=RSS","date":1684713600000,"content":"<div><p>Lipid droplets, also known as oil bodies or lipid bodies, are plant organelles that compartmentalize neutral lipids as a hydrophobic matrix covered by proteins embedded in a phospholipid monolayer. Some of these proteins have been known for decades, such as oleosins, caleosins, and steroleosins, whereas a host of others have been discovered more recently with various levels of abundance on lipid droplets, depending on the tissue and developmental stage. In addition to a growing inventory of lipid droplet proteins, the subcellular machinery that contributes to the biogenesis and degradation of lipid droplets is being identified and attention is turning to more mechanistic questions regarding lipid droplet dynamics. While lipid droplets are mostly regarded as storage deposits for carbon and energy in lipid-rich plant tissues such as seeds, these organelles are present in essentially all plant cells, where they display additional functions in signaling, membrane remodeling, and the compartmentalization of a variety of hydrophobic components. Remarkable metabolic engineering efforts have demonstrated the plasticity of vegetative tissues such as leaves to synthesize and package large amounts of storage lipids, which enable future applications in bioenergy and the engineering of high-value lipophilic compounds. Here, we review the growing body of knowledge about lipid droplets in plant cells, describe the evolutionary similarity and divergence in their associated subcellular machinery, and point to gaps that deserve future attention.</p></div>","author":"Athanas Guzha, Payton Whitehead, Till Ischebeck and Kent D.
