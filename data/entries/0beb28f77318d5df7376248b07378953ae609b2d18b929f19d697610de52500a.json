{"title":"Exogenous γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) improves the cadmium phytoremediation capacity of Solanum nigrum var. humile under cadmium stress","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14364?af=R","date":1704707355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has shown promise in enhancing crop tolerance to heavy metal stress. To improve the cadmium (Cd) phytoremediation capacity of hyperaccumulator <i>Solanum nigrum</i> var. <i>humile</i>, the effects of exogenous GABA on the growth and Cd accumulation of <i>S. nigrum</i> var. <i>humile</i> were studied. When exposed to Cd stress (0.1 mg/L) through irrigation, <i>S. nigrum</i> var. <i>humile</i> exhibited inhibited growth, characterized by decreased biomass and contents of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll <i>a</i>, chlorophyll <i>b</i>, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid). However, the application of exogenous GABA at 1 and 2 g/L increased various organs biomass and photosynthetic pigment content of <i>S. nigrum</i> var. <i>humile</i> to certain degree under Cd stress. Compared with the Cd treatment, the concentrations of 1 and 2 g/L GABA increased the shoot biomass by 8.24% and 16.62%, respectively. GABA also increased the Cd contents, bioconcentration factors, and Cd extractions in various organs of <i>S. nigrum</i> var. <i>humile</i>. Compared with the Cd treatment, the concentrations of 1 and 2 g/L GABA increased the shoot Cd extraction by 17.66% and 24.47%, respectively. Moreover, correlation and gray relational analyses showed that the shoot biomass, chlorophyll <i>b</i> content, and total chlorophyll content were the top three parameters closely related to shoot Cd extraction. These findings suggest that GABA can alleviate Cd-induced stress in <i>S. nigrum</i> var. <i>humile</i>, thus enhancing its phytoremediation capacity for Cd-contaminated soils.</p>","author":"Wanzhi Li, \nXiufen Li, \nKexuan Zhou, \nXin Jin, \nChengyi Huang, \nRongping Hu, \nLijin Lin, \nJin Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"0beb28f77318d5df7376248b07378953ae609b2d18b929f19d697610de52500a","category":"Environment"}
