{"title":"The Function and Evolution of Cranial Crests in Dilophosaurus wetherilli: An Analysis of Their Morphological and Behavioral Significance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0339/v1","date":1722940400000,"content":"This literature review examines the function and evolution of cranial crests in Dilophosaurus wetherilli, a notable theropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic period. The review synthesizes morphological data and behavioral theories to provide a comprehensive analysis of the crests' roles in the dinosaur's life. Cranial crests, characterized by their distinctive, elongated structures extending from the skull, have intrigued paleontologists due to their unique appearance and apparent function. This review utilizes findings from recent fossil discoveries, comparative anatomy, and biomechanical studies to explore hypotheses regarding the crests' primary functions. Key theories suggest these structures may have served for display purposes, thermoregulation, or defensive mechanisms. Evidence from cranial and postcranial anatomy, as well as comparisons with extant analogs, provides insights into the possible evolutionary pressures influencing the development of crests in Dilophosaurus wetherilli. Additionally, the review considers the role of sexual dimorphism and social behavior in shaping these features. By integrating these diverse lines of evidence, the review aims to offer a nuanced understanding of how cranial crests might have contributed to the survival and social interactions of Dilophosaurus. This analysis not only advances our knowledge of Dilophosaurus wetherilli but also contributes to broader discussions on the evolution and functional morphology of early theropods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36eb16f4165f96a5e1491f5e0a184169e4822b7259038089b4aab57a18fc634a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
