{"title":"From Lipid Signatures to Cellular Responses: Unraveling the Complexity of Melanoma and Furthering Its Diagnosis and Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0309/v1","date":1719983504000,"content":"Recent advancements in mass spectrometry have significantly enhanced our understanding of complex lipid profiles, opening new avenues for oncological diagnostics. This review highlights the importance of lipidomics in the comprehension of certain metabolic pathways and its potential for the detection and characterization of various cancers, in particular melanoma. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how lipidomic analysis has led to significant breakthroughs in the identification and understanding of cancer types and its potential for detecting unique biomarkers that are instrumental in its diagnosis. Additionally, the review addresses the technical challenges and future perspectives of these methodologies, including their potential expansion and refinement for clinical applications. The discussion underscores the critical role of lipidomic profiling in advancing cancer diagnostics, proposing a new paradigm in how we approach this devastating disease, with particular emphasis on its application in comparative oncology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e64e83f446933fc4ff29520e2b1fcbfc40be89a9d9da1c7462cb298fbc17c7a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
