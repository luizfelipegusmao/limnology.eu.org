{"title":"Grape cultivars adapted to hotter, drier growing regions exhibit greater photosynthesis in hot conditions despite less drought-resistant leaves","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/2/205/7627847?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Many agricultural areas are expected to face hotter, drier conditions from climate change. Understanding the mechanisms that crops use to mitigate these stresses can guide breeding for more tolerant plant material. We tested relationships between traits, physiological function in hot conditions and historical climate associations to evaluate these mechanisms for winegrapes. We expected a more negative leaf osmotic potential at full hydration (<span>π</span><sub>o</sub>), which reduces leaf turgor loss during drought, and either a metabolically cheaper or more osmoprotectant leaf chemical composition, to allow cultivars associated with hot, dry regions to maintain greater gas exchange in hot growing conditions.<div>Methods</div>We measured <span>π</span><sub>o</sub>, gas exchange and leaf chemistry for seven commercially important winegrape cultivars that vary widely in historical climate associations. Vines were grown in common-garden field conditions in a hot wine-growing region (Davis, CA, USA) and measured over the hottest period of the growing season (July–September).<div>Key Results</div>The value of <span>π</span><sub>o</sub> varied significantly between cultivars, and all cultivars significantly reduced <span>π</span><sub>o</sub> (osmotically adjusted) over the study period, although osmotic adjustment did not vary across cultivars. The value of <span>π</span><sub>o</sub> was correlated with gas exchange and climate associations, but in the direction opposite to expected. Photosynthesis and <span>π</span><sub>o</sub> were higher in the cultivars associated with hotter, less humid regions. Leaf chemical composition varied between cultivars but was not related to climate associations.<div>Conclusions</div>These findings suggest that maintenance of leaf turgor is not a primary limitation on grapevine adaptation to hot or atmospherically dry growing conditions. Thus, selecting for a more negative <span>π</span><sub>o</sub> or greater osmotic adjustment is not a promising strategy to develop more climate-resilient grape varieties, contrary to findings for other crops. Future work is needed to identify the mechanisms increasing photosynthesis in the cultivars associated with hot, dry regions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"737a9348ca1064cf048fd3c84ce98576ca0d3c6665df32a59c0a6cd31a92e61f","category":"Environment"}
