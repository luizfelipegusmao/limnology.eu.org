{"title":"InfraRed Thermographic Measurements in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Subjects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1861/v1","date":1721750848000,"content":"The study was conducted on a cohort of 16 subjects, who were monitored with infrared images captured from their hands, following a specific protocol established by a preliminary analysis. Experimental results revealed that thermography can detect focal points and regions exhibiting either hyper- or hypo-thermia across the skin surface and muscular regions. This capability allows for extracting and categorizing precise medical data, difficult to determine during the early stages of the disease, thus facilitating ongoing monitoring efforts and early diagnosis in Parkinson research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8492cd1546184bff1b2864f24994961d9efe287f0c15e4b2e2705752d5540e40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
