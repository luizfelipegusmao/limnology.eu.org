In the new era of ‘omics’ technology, the ability to optimize nutrition across the lifespan of companion animals is within reach. We have been using ‘omics’ technologies to understand how changes in diet composition impact metabolism using a neonatal piglet model. By measuring the composition of sow milk over the first week of lactation, we created an optimized pig milk replacer, and studied the impact of varying the whey protein composition of the milk replacer using a combination of metabolomics on blood, urine, liver, and brain tissue, as well as transcriptomics of intestinal, liver and brain tissue. Our results revealed a substantial impact of the type of whey protein on piglet metabolism that included differences in cortisol, blood and tissue amino acid profiles, and immunity. This work paves the way for additional studies to optimize animal nutrition in the neonatal period and beyond.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"34d9cc0f7c1268addbbe8d13c83a5ec19f170819e96f425a3265ef8fa6529a1a","category":"Environment"}
