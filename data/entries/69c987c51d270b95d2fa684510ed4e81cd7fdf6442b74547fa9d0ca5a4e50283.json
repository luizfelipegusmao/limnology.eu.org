{"title":"Evaluating the Perceived Health-Related Effectiveness of ‘The Daily Mile’ Initiative in Irish Primary Schools","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0377/v1","date":1717721006000,"content":"Seventy-seven percent of Irish primary school children do not meet recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines [1]. The Daily Mile (TDM) is a primary school initiative designed to increase children’s PA output. This study evaluates TDM’s perceived effect on Irish primary school children’s health-related metrics. A mixed-methods study, comprising two data collection phases, used the RE-AIM framework to evaluate TDM [2]. Phase one involved teachers, principals and classroom assistants (n = 191) from TDM-registered schools completing a questionnaire. Two TDM-registered schools participated in phase two where, (i) interviews were conducted with each principal, (ii) a teacher sub-sample (n = 4) participated in a focus group and (iii) a child sub-sample (n = 14) participated in separate focus groups. TDM was perceived to positively impact markers of children’s health, including their PA behaviour, physical fitness and social wellbeing. Inclement weather (66.5%) and a lack of time (56.5%) were reported as the top-ranked implementation barriers. Moreover, TDM’s repetitive nature often left children feeling disinterested and resulted in some teachers modifying the initiative to maintain engagement levels. Maintaining the long-term implementation of TDM and its health benefits in primary schools may require bespoke amendments to the original format to preserve children’s engagement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69c987c51d270b95d2fa684510ed4e81cd7fdf6442b74547fa9d0ca5a4e50283","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
