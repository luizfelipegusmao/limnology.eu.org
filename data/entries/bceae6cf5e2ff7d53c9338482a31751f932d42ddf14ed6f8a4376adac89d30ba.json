It compromises the quality, safety, and nutritional value of food, posing significant risks to public health. Novel techniques are required to control it.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A graphene-based T-shaped monopole antenna sensor was tested for its ability to detect adulteration in liquid foods. Mustard oil was the pure reference sample used for product quality analysis. Olive oil and rice bran oil were adulterants added to the pure sample. It was found that the sensor could be immersed easily in the liquid sample and provided precise results.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The graphene-based T-shaped monopole antenna sensor can be used for the quality assessment of liquid food products and is suitable for real-time monitoring. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Nitika, \nJaswinder Kaur, \nRajesh Khanna","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"bceae6cf5e2ff7d53c9338482a31751f932d42ddf14ed6f8a4376adac89d30ba","category":"Environment"}
