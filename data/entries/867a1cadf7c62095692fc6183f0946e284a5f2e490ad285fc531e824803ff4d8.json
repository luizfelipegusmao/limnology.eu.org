{"title":"Experimental and Parametric Analysis of Pull-out Resistance of Notched T-Perfobond Connector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0730/v1","date":1720577304000,"content":"To enhance the uplift capacity and facilitate the installation of multi-row perfobond connectors at shallow burial depths, this study puts forward a novel notched T-perfobond connector. The design incorporates an integrated flange at the bottom of the connector and a notch at the edge of the hole. Through pull-out model tests on four notched T-perfobond connectors, this research investigates their failure mechanisms and pull-out capacities. Utilizing the explicit dynamics method in Abaqus, a finite element model of the pull-out resistance test for the notched T-perfobond connector is established and verified against experimental data. Furthermore, a detailed parametric analysis involving 54 models is conducted, examining crucial parameters such as rib dimensions, hole geometry, flange size, notch width, bar diameter, and material properties. Based on the combined experimental and numerical results, the paper assesses the suitability of current formulas for calculating the pull-out capacity of perfobond connectors and proposes a refined calculation method specifically for notched T-perfobond connectors. All the findings in this paper can serve as a reference in the design and construction of composite structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"867a1cadf7c62095692fc6183f0946e284a5f2e490ad285fc531e824803ff4d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
