{"title":"miRNAs Involvement in Modulating Signalling Pathways Involved in Ros-Mediated Oxidative Stress in Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1819/v1","date":1724657589000,"content":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are intermediates in oxidation-reduction reactions with the capacity to modify biomolecules and temporarily or permanently alter cell behaviour through signalling pathways under physiological and pathophysiological conditions where there is an imbalance between oxidative factors and the antioxidant response of the organism, a phenomenon known as oxidative stress. Evidence suggests that differential modulation of ROS-mediated oxidative stress occurs in the pathogenesis and progression of melanoma, and that this imbalance in redox homeostasis appears to be functionally linked to microRNA-mediated non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming involving genes and transcription factors. The relationship between ROS-mediated stress control, tumour microenvironment and microRNAs expression in melanoma is not fully understood. The aim of this review is to analyze the involvement of miRNAs in the modulation of signalling pathways involved in ROS-mediated oxidative stress in melanoma. It is hoped that these considerations will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms associated with a potential epigenetic network regulation, where the modulation of oxidative stress is consolidated as a common factor in melanoma and therefore a potential footprint poorly documented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8bab1f7b8c928afc7ab9f46b5c6e92f2a21cb3fddcd4d6be9de888ee674917b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
