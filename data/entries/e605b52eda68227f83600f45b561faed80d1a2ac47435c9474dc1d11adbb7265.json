{"title":"Boosting impacts of Acacia nilotica against hepatic toxicity induced by gentamicin: biochemical, anti-inflammatory and immunohistochemical study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae141/7747850?rss=1","date":1725235200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>It seems that gentamicin's toxicity to the liver is caused by reactive oxygen species production. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of <span>Acacia nilotica</span> extract (AN) have been demonstrated in recent studies. This research focused on how AN's extract affected gentamicin-induced liver damage in rats. Twenty-four Wister rats of male type were divided into four groups: first group received saline as a control, second group received AN (5%) for fifteen days, group three received daily intraperitoneal injections of gentamicin (100 mg/kg) for fifteen days, and group four, as mentioned in groups 2 and 3, also received gentamicin injections and AN extraction (5%) for fifteen days. In order to conduct biochemical analysis, serum was extracted. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry analyses for hepatic toxicity were all performed on the collected tissue samples. Serum levels of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and GGT were all elevated after using gentamicin. The inflammatory cytokines)IL-1, TNF-α and IL-6(, all were increased in gentamycin-injected group. There were showing deformity of bile duct, hepatocellular necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells congestion of portal vein, and hepatic sinusoids besides fibrosis of portal area (white arrows), hypertrophy in gentamycin-injected group compared to AN plus gentamycin administered rats. There were upregulation in the immunoreactivity of COX-2, IFN<sub>k</sub>B and TGF-beta1 (TGF-β1) in gentamycin intoxicated rats. When gentamicin and AN were administered together, hepatic biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, histological, and immunohistochemical markers were all ameliorated by AN administration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"e605b52eda68227f83600f45b561faed80d1a2ac47435c9474dc1d11adbb7265","category":"Environment"}
