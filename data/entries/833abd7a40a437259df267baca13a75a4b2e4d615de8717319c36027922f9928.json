{"title":"Impact of aggregate‐colonizing copepods on the biological carbon pump in a high‐latitude fjord","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12641?af=R","date":1722318023000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Zooplankton consumption of sinking aggregates affects the quality and quantity of organic carbon exported to the deep ocean. Increasing laboratory evidence shows that small particle-associated copepods impact the flux attenuation by feeding on sinking particles, but this has not been quantified in situ. We investigated the impact of an abundant particle-colonizing copepod, <i>Microsetella norvegica</i>, on the attenuation of the vertical carbon flux in a sub-Arctic fjord. This study combines field measurements of vertical carbon flux, abundance, and size-distribution of marine snow and degradation rates of fecal pellets and algal aggregates. Female <i>M. norvegica</i> altered their feeding behavior when exposed to aggregates, and ingestion rates were 0.20 <i>μ</i>g C ind.<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> on marine snow and 0.11 <i>μ</i>g C ind.<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> on intact krill fecal pellets, corresponding to 48% and 26% of the females' body carbon mass. Due to high sea surface abundance of up to ~ 50 ind. L<sup>−1</sup>, the population of <i>M. norvegica</i> had the potential to account for almost all the carbon removal in the upper 50 m of the water column, depending on the type of the aggregate. Our observations highlight the potential importance of abundant small-sized copepods for biogeochemical cycles through their impact on export flux and its attenuation in the twilight zone.</p>","author":"Camilla Svensen, \nMorten Iversen, \nFredrika Norrbin, \nKlas Ove Möller, \nIngrid Wiedmann, \nJofrid Skarðhamar, \nCoralie Barth‐Jensen, \nSlawomir Kwasniewski, \nMateusz Ormanczyk, \nAnna Maria Dąbrowska, \nMarja Koski","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"833abd7a40a437259df267baca13a75a4b2e4d615de8717319c36027922f9928","category":"Environment"}
