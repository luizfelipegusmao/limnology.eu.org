The retraction has been agreed upon following concerns raised about the validity of the quantitative data reported. J.N. Pruitt, the corresponding author, did not respond following repeated requests to provide the primary data. During the investigation, coauthors S.E. Riechert and G.M. Burghardt requested retraction because they would have no way to validate the article's conclusions without those data. The coauthors have lost confidence in the conclusions of the article, as have the editors and Wiley, hence our decision to retract. Corresponding author J.N. Pruitt was informed of the decision but has remained unresponsive.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"bc3dd5ee7c587b4b4ecf4f3dd04294ba83e417bc0f68f0cd07219ff9dac96881","category":"Environment"}
