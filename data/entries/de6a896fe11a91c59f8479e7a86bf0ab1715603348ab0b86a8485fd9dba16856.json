{"title":"226 Oral and rumen microbiome characterization to predict host phenotypes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/23/7664756?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Studies have utilized rumen microbiome composition and function to predict animal phenotypes. Yet, sample collection for rumen microbial community analysis can be difficult and invasive and hinders the possibility of sampling large animal populations. In this study, we investigated the development of the bovine rumen microbiome over time, to identify the potential of the oral microbiome as a proxy for the rumen microbiome, and to test the applicability of using the oral microbiome for predicting phenotypes in beef cattle. We employed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the rumen and oral bacterial community structure over time and collected both birth and weaning weights in a population of 220 animals. Our findings show that both the oral and rumen microbiomes are established early, and a significant portion of the taxa persists even after weaning. We identified a group of core successional species shared between the oral and rumen bacterial communities, which are established early and persist over time. The oral bacterial community was dominated by phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteria, while the rumen bacterial community was dominated by phyla Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Fibrobacteria, and Spirochaetota. Furthermore, we observed that 38% of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were shared between the oral and rumen microbiomes at 50 to 120 d of age. At 170 to 240 d of age, 37% of ASVs were shared, and at 295 to 365 d, 33% of ASVs were shared. Finally, at 400 to 468 d, 21% of ASVs were shared. Based on weighted Unifrac analysis, notable differences and distinct clustering was observed between oral and rumen microbiome communities at different sampling ages (<span>P</span> = 0.001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.50969, 50 to 120; <span>P</span> = 0.001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66247, 170 to 240; <span>P</span> = 0.001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62036, 295 to 365; and <span>P</span> = 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66559, 400 to 468). Microbiability estimates varied across different stages and microbial environments. For the oral bacterial community at 50 to 120, the estimates were 0.029%, 0.032%, 0.029%, and 0.028% for birth weight, weaning weight, intramuscular fat (IMF), and ribeye area (REA), respectively. In contrast, the rumen microbiome exhibited microbiability values of 0.034%, 0.058, 0.059, and 0.069% for birth weight, weaning weight, IMF, and REA respectively during the same period. As the animal aged the microbiability increased. At 170 to 240, oral microbiomes showed microbiability estimates of 0.051%, 0.060%, 0.069%, and 0.21% for birth weight, weaning weight, IMF, and REA respectively. In comparison, the rumen microbiome displayed greater microbiability estimates of 0.12%, 0.124%, 0.20%, and 0.26% for birth weight, weaning weight, IMF, and REA respectively. In conclusion, the oral microbiome is not a good proxy for the rumen microbiome composition; however, there is potential to use the oral microbiome for phenotype prediction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"de6a896fe11a91c59f8479e7a86bf0ab1715603348ab0b86a8485fd9dba16856","category":"Environment"}
