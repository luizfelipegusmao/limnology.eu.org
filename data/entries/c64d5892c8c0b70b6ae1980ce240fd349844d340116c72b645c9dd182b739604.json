{"title":"Assessing Contents of Sugars, Vitamins, and Nutrients in Baby Leaf Lettuce from Hyperspectral Data with Machine Learning Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1969/v1","date":1714458692000,"content":"Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is a leafy vegetable that provides a valuable source of phytonutrients for a healthy human diet. Assessment of plant growth and composition is vital for determining crop yield and overall quality, however, classical laboratory analyses are slow and costly. Therefore, new, less expensive, more rapid, and non-destructive approaches are being developed, including those based on (hyper)spectral reflectance. Additionally, it is also important to determine how plant phenotypes respond to fertilizer treatments and whether these differences in response can be detected from analyses of hyperspectral image data. In the current study, we demonstrate the suitability of hyperspectral imaging in combination with machine learning models to estimate the content of chlorophyll (SPAD), anthocyanins (ACI), glucose, fructose, sucrose, vitamin C, β-carotene, N, P, K, dry matter content, and plant fresh weight. The implemented five classification and regression machine learning models showed high accuracy in classifying the lettuces by the applied fertilizers treatments and estimating nutrient concentrations. To reduce the input (predictor data, i.e., hyperspectral data) dimension, 13 principal components were found and applied in models. The implemented artificial neural network models of the machine learning algorithm demonstrated high accuracy (r = 0.85 ... 0.99) in estimating fresh leaf weight, and contents of chlorophyll, anthocyanins, N, P, K, and β-carotene. The four applied classification models of machine learning demonstrated 100% accuracy in classifying the studied baby leaf lettuces by phenotype when certain fertilizer treatments were applied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c64d5892c8c0b70b6ae1980ce240fd349844d340116c72b645c9dd182b739604","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
