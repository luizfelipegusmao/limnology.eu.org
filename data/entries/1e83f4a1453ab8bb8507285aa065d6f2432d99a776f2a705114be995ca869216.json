{"title":"More than meets the eye: knowns and unknowns of the trafficking of small secreted proteins in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/12/3713/7661015?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Small proteins represent a significant portion of the cargo transported through plant secretory pathways, playing crucial roles in developmental processes, fertilization, and responses to environmental stresses. Despite the importance of small secreted proteins, substantial knowledge gaps persist regarding the regulatory mechanisms governing their trafficking along the secretory pathway, and their ultimate localization or destination. To address these gaps, we conducted a comprehensive literature review, focusing particularly on trafficking and localization of Arabidopsis small secreted proteins with potential biochemical and/or signaling roles in the extracellular space, typically those within the size range of 101â€“200 amino acids. Our investigation reveals that while at least six members of the 21 mentioned families have a confirmed extracellular localization, eight exhibit intracellular localization, including cytoplasmic, nuclear, and chloroplastic locations, despite the presence of N-terminal signal peptides. Further investigation into the trafficking and secretion mechanisms of small protein cargo could not only deepen our understanding of plant cell biology and physiology but also provide a foundation for genetic manipulation strategies leading to more efficient plant cultivation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"1e83f4a1453ab8bb8507285aa065d6f2432d99a776f2a705114be995ca869216","category":"Environment"}
