{"title":"How polymer structure affects secondary cell wall patterns: A look at transdifferentiating protoplasts","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4272/7738214?rss=1","date":1724198400000,"content":"<span>Plant cells are enveloped by cell walls, which regulate cell growth and provide structural support to the plant's form, ultimately dictating the physical characteristics and organization of plants. Plant cell walls are subdivided into 2 main types: primary cell walls and secondary cell walls (SCWs). The primary cell wall permits cell growth and is relatively pliable, but the SCW, which is thicker, gives the cell more strength and stiffness. Xylem tracheary elements (TEs), which move water and minerals from roots to shoots, are characterized by thickened SCWs that are enriched in cellulose, hemicelluloses like glucuronoxylan (in eudicots), and lignin.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"436122b09d9644f70482ad94cd288e27912cfebb9a58fe37cd6ed7ddc2c655a0","category":"Environment"}
