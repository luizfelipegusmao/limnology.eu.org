{"title":"Elevated levels of branched chain fatty acids in low‐salt fish sauce by co‐fermentation: flavor improvement and metabolism analysis","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13829?af=R","date":1724240596000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Traditional fish sauce products rely on relatively long fermentation time and high salt concentration, resulting in inconsistent quality and health risks. Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are associated with nutritional benefits and health-care effects, mainly derived from food fermentation. This study aimed to screen BCFAs-producing bacteria with high protease and aminotransferase activity as starter cultures for fish sauce fermentation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The low-salt fish sauce products were obtained by co-fermentation with three chosen strains. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble peptides and amino acid nitrogen concentrations were higher in the co-fermentation group (FH group). The organoleptic evaluation showed co-fermentation optimized flavor composition and endured with rich taste. The levels of BCFAs and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) significantly increased by co-fermentation. Volatile metabolomics analysis indicated that BCFAs, branched-chain esters, and pyrazines were the key flavor compounds in the co-fermented group.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The co-fermentation system with selected strains to ferment low-salt fish sauce has the potential to increase BCFA content and improve flavor and nutrition. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yue Zhou, \nJunxiao Wu, \nAbdul Razak Monto, \nLi Yuan, \nRuichang Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a6d900f35a527ce5b3b8d0dab0624f25b1495b9eababba41a1b9f0ec7e74f1cc","category":"Environment"}
