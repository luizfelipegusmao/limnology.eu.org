{"title":"Dynamic Calibration of Self-Efficacy to Cognitive Load: The Longitudinal Mediation Effect of State Anxiety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1978/v1","date":1721823659000,"content":"The primary aim of this study was to investigate the variations in cognitive load as self-efficacy gradually increases and examine the potential within-mediating effect of state anxiety between self-efficacy and cognitive load. The experiment manipulated the self-efficacy of 49 adult participants through the false feedback paradigm, employing a within-subject experimental design and using facial expression recognition as the experimental task. The data were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. The results revealed that self-efficacy negatively predicted state anxiety and cognitive load, while state anxiety positively predicted cognitive load. Moreover, state anxiety played a complete mediating role at multiple levels in this process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6edf81a3d51feb27305d6aab30d60bcd56e11661a497adca60f5f2c429f7938b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
