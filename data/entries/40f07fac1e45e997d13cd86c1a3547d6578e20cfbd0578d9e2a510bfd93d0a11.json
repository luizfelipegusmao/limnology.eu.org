{"title":"Modelling Livestock Weights in a Marketplace Using Computer Vision Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2571/v1","date":1722421407000,"content":"Livestock marketplaces consist of infrastructure and rules through which information is exchanged and transactions are completed. Livestock trading incurs significant transaction costs, beyond just commission fees paid to marketplace owners (e.g., se-lecting, loading and transporting animals). In addition, animals being transported, held and transacted in a market setting increases the likelihood of injury or disease. The Covid-19 pandemic contributed to large-scale changes across typically physical marketplaces as stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions were invoked. Livestock marketplaces pivoted online rapidly, facilitated by the deployment of video feeds, al-lowing buyers to view/purchase animals via mobile phone. This shift offered the promise of mitigating many of the transaction costs associated with a fully physical marketplace. This study evaluated how computer vision (CV) approaches can con-tribute to the evolution of livestock marketplaces. It used livestock video data for 240 cattle (bulls) weighing 320-740 Kg from 16 different breeds to elicit additional trade-relevant data (livestock weight) and can be considered as an intermediary step to better understand how video data can be used to further digitalize livestock trade, price formation and transaction completion via technology solutions. The dataset comes from three sales held on different dates in a single mart location, which allows a consistent camera setup throughout. CV technologies were employed to solve the problem of cattle weight estimation and a distinctive achievement lies in curating a dataset cap-turing cattle in motion within the context of a cattle auction thereby injecting realism and complexity into the CV weight estimation task. Employing advanced object detection algorithms, the study created an intricate data pipeline to generate an appropriate modelling dataset and devised new multi-channel architectures for deeper analysis of diverse image inputs. The significance of sizable datasets and the challenge of man-aging inherent input variability for accurate CV regression is highlighted. Top-down view predictions demonstrate comparatively better performance, although failing to achieve benchmark precision. Challenges arise from camera angle variations, roaming behaviors, and breed diversity. Likewise, side-view predictions face challenges due to increased variability and lack of standardization. Despite this, these predictions offer insights into the value of incorporating Region of Interest (ROI) coordinates and data augmentation for enhanced performance. The study concludes with a multi-input ar-chitecture combining top-down and side-view predictions, demonstrating moderate success highlighting potential synergy between both perspectives. The central con-clusion resonates strongly â€“ using standardized and multi-view images encompassing controlled movement and consistent poses could bolster accurate CV weight estima-tion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40f07fac1e45e997d13cd86c1a3547d6578e20cfbd0578d9e2a510bfd93d0a11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
