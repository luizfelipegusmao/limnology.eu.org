The research employs the electrooxidation/flotation process, known for its effectiveness in organic matter removal. Key parameters, such as initial pH, current density and flow rate, were investigated for their impact on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and oil-grease (OG) from bilge water. Initial pH showed minimal effects on COD and OG removal, while current density significantly enhanced removal efficiency by influencing anodic electrochemical reactions. Conversely, higher flow rates reduced residence time and lowered removal efficiency. Optimal conditions, with a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, pH 7.5 and a flow rate of 20 ml/min, achieved impressive results, removing approximately 80% of COD and 99% of OG from bilge water. These findings highlight the potential of this method for effective bilge water purification.</p>","author":"Donya Akbarzadeh Yazdi, \nAlper Erdem Yilmaz, \nSümeyye Güler, \nOkan Tarık Komesli","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"65498b4b6bd369a86fd6ac84064d7ed6cea8301bdc5253e423ce68d177f65290","category":"Environment"}
