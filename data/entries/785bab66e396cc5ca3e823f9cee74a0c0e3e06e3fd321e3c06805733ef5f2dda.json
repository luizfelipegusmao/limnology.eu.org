{"title":"Partitioning seasonal stem carbon dioxide efflux into stem respiration, bark photosynthesis, and transport-related flux in Scots pine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4944/7680161?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux is an important component of the carbon balance in forests. The efflux is considered to principally reflect the net result of two dominating and opposing processes: stem respiration and stem photosynthesis. In addition, transport of CO<sub>2</sub> in xylem sap is thought to play an appreciable role in affecting the net flux. This work presents an approach to partition stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux among these processes using sap-flux data and CO<sub>2</sub>-exchange measurements from dark and transparent chambers placed on mature Scots pine (<span>Pinus sylvestris</span>) trees. Seasonal changes and monthly parameters describing the studied processes were determined. Respiration contributed most to stem net CO<sub>2</sub> flux, reaching up to 79% (considering the sum of the absolute values of stem respiration, stem photosynthesis, and flux from CO<sub>2</sub> transported in xylem sap to be 100%) in June, when stem growth was greatest. The contribution of photosynthesis accounted for up to 13% of the stem net CO<sub>2</sub> flux, increasing over the monitoring period. CO<sub>2</sub> transported axially with sap flow decreased towards the end of the growing season. At a reference temperature, respiration decreased starting around midsummer, while its temperature sensitivity increased during the summer. A decline was observed for photosynthetic quantum yield around midsummer together with a decrease in light-saturation point. The proposed approach facilitates modeling net stem CO<sub>2</sub> flux at a range of time scales.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"785bab66e396cc5ca3e823f9cee74a0c0e3e06e3fd321e3c06805733ef5f2dda","category":"Environment"}
