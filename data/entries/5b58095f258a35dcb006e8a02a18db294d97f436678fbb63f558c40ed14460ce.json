{"title":"Destination Therapy Strategies of Advanced Heart Failure in Elderly Non-Heart Transplant Candidates: A Propensity Matching Analysis from the LEVO-D and REGALAD Registries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1516/v1","date":1721381478000,"content":"Heart transplantation (HT) is the gold standard therapy for advanced heart failure (AHF) and LVAD as destination therapy are an option in non-HT candidates. Most patients with AHF never receive a HT or a LVAD, so alternative strategies are needed. Intermittent levosimendan can reduce HF hospitalizations in AHF patients in the short term. It is uncertain whether the results of the comparison of inotropes with older generation LVAD would have the same outcomes in the current era of less sick but older, AHF treated with levosimendan patients. In this paper we compare the use of two therapeutic strategies for end-stage HF in patients not candidates for HT: Repetitive intermittent Levosimendan vs. LVAD as destination therapy. To do so we compare two multicentre cohorts of real-life patients from Spain: the LEVO-D Registry and the REGALAD registry. 715 patients coming from the 2 registries where found, 403 from the LEVO-D and 312 from the REGALAD. Non-adjusted median survival was shorter for LEVO-D patients; with the benefit for the LVAD seen only after the first year of therapy. The survival advantage for the LVAD cohort was also true after analysis of the matched cohort but, as in the non-matched analysis, the survival benefit was mainly shown after one year of follow up. We conclude that in elderly AHF non-HT-candidates, LVAD therapy offers significantly better long-term outcomes when compared to intermittent levosimendan; thus, it should be considered in carefully selected candidates. On the other hand, in poor LVAD candidates or highly comorbid patients, intermit-tent inotropic support with levosimendan could be a reasonable alternative to LVAD as 1-year outcomes are similar.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b58095f258a35dcb006e8a02a18db294d97f436678fbb63f558c40ed14460ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
