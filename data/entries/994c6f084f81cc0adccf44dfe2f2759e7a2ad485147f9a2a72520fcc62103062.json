{"title":"Permanent Stress Adaptation and Unexpected High Light Tolerance in the Shade-Adapted Chlamydomonas Priscuii","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1708/v1","date":1721641834000,"content":"The Antarctic photopsychrophile, Chlamydomonas priscuii UWO241 is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including permanent low temperatures, high salt and shade. During long-term exposure to this extreme habitat, UWO241 appears to have lost several short-term mechanisms in favor of constitutive protection against environmental stress. This study investigated physiological and growth responses of UWO241 to high light conditions, evaluating the impacts of long-term acclimation to high light, low temperature, and high salinity on its ability to manage short-term photoinhibition. We found that UWO241 significantly increased its growth rate and photosynthetic activity at growth irradiances far exceeding native light conditions. Furthermore, UWO241 exhibited robust protection against short-term photoinhibition, particularly in photosystem I. Last, pre-acclimation to high light or low temperatures, but not high salinity, enhanced photoinhibition tolerance. These findings extend our understanding for stress tolerance in extremophilic algae. In the past 2 decades climate change-related increasing glacial stream flow has perturbed long-term stable conditions: in the form of has been associated with lake level rise, thinning of ice covers, and expansion of ice-free perimeters. Our findings have implications on phytoplankton survival and response to change scenarios in the light-limited environment of Antarctic ice-covered lakes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"994c6f084f81cc0adccf44dfe2f2759e7a2ad485147f9a2a72520fcc62103062","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
