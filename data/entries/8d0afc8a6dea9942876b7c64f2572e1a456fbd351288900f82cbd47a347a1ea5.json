{"title":"Land use to agriculture and planted forests strongly affect the genetic diversity of Baccharis crispa Spreng., a native herb of South America","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae050/7756822?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Human population growth constantly requires an increase in the production of food and products from the timber industry. To meet this demand, agriculture and planted forests are advancing over natural areas. In view of this, it is necessary to know the effects of land use for different purposes (grain production, pastures, planted forests, fruit production and among other uses) on the genetic diversity of populations of native species. This knowledge can assist in land use planning as well as in the development of conservation strategies for native species. In this study, we evaluated the effect of land use for agriculture (mainly for cereal production) and planted forests on the genetic diversity of <span>Baccharis crispa</span> Spreng., a herb native to South America. To achieve our goals, we compared population genetic data obtained with three molecular markers (microsatellites, inter-simple sequence repeat and isoenzymes) with data on land use for agriculture and planted forests from 15 different locations. Our results showed that regardless of the molecular marker used, the greater the use of land for agriculture and planted forests, the lower was the genetic diversity of <span>B. crispa</span> populations. <span>Baccharis crispa</span> is a semi-perennial species that needs at least one year to reach its reproductive period, which is prevented in agricultural areas due to the land being turned over or dissected with herbicides every 6 months. In the studied regions, the planted forests are of eucalypt and/or pine, which besides being species with a high production of allelopathic substances, produce strong shading and <span>B. crispa</span> is a species that inhabits open grassland that needs a high incidence of sunlight for development. The data obtained in our study can assist in the decision-making to use land in order to reconcile the production of supplies for humanity and for the conservation of nature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"8d0afc8a6dea9942876b7c64f2572e1a456fbd351288900f82cbd47a347a1ea5","category":"Environment"}
