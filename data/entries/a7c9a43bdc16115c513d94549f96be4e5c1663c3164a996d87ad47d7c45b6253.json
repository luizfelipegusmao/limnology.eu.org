{"title":"Effect of Immunostimulatory RNA on the Fibrosis Development in Bleomycin- or LPS-Induced Mouse Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1228/v1","date":1713424433000,"content":"Previously, we described a 19-base pair double-stranded RNA with 3'-trinucleotide overhangs, acting as immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA). This molecule demonstrated notable antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, inhibited tumor growth, and elicited immunostimulatory and antiviral responses by inducing cytokine and interferon production. Within this study, we compared the efficiency of lung fibrosis development, initiated in mice by BLM or LPS using different schemes of induction. Then we compared the effect of isRNA used in a preventive or therapeutic regimen on the development of fibrosis in selected BLM- and LPS-induced mouse models and showed that isRNA can be used in pathological conditions accompanied by the development of inflammation and the risk of fibrosis formation, without adverse side effects. Prophylactic regimen of isRNA application is beneficial for prevention of the development of pulmonary fibrosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7c9a43bdc16115c513d94549f96be4e5c1663c3164a996d87ad47d7c45b6253","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
