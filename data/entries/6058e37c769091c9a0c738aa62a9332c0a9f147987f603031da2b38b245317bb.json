{"title":"AI-powered Biodiversity Assessment: Species Classification via DNA Barcoding and Deep Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1953/v1","date":1727252534000,"content":"As sequencing technologies advance, short DNA sequence fragments increasingly serve as DNA barcodes for species identification. Rapid acquisition of DNA sequences from diverse organisms is now possible, highlighting the increasing significance of DNA sequence analysis tools in species identification. This study introduces a new approach for species classification with DNA barcodes based on an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNN). Several techniques are proposed and empirically evaluated for converting raw DNA sequence data into images fed into the DNNs. The best-performing approach is obtained by representing each pair of DNA bases with the value of a related physicochemical property. By utilizing different physicochemical properties, we can create an ensemble of networks. Our proposed ensemble obtains state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real data sets. The code of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/LorisNanni/AI-powered-Biodiversity-Assessment-Species-Classification-via-DNA-Barcoding-and-Deep-Learning .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6058e37c769091c9a0c738aa62a9332c0a9f147987f603031da2b38b245317bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
