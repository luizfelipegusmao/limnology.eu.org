Most age studies focus on male reproductive capacity; however, we lack information on how the interaction between the ages of both sexes can determine post-mating processes. Here, we studied sex and age effects on (i) female fecundity and fertility, (ii) failure to leave viable offspring (reproductive failure), and (iii) female remating behavior. We found that young pairs of both species had higher fecundity, but young <i>C. capitata</i> males mated with old females had the lowest fecundity. This suggests that overwintering flies in this species will not substantially contribute to the next generation. We also found in <i>C. capitata</i> more prevalent reproductive failure in hetero-age combinations, which could be due to age recognition between mates, resulting perhaps in differential ejaculate allocation. Copula duration was positively associated with female age, yet it was longer for older <i>A. fraterculus</i> females and shorter for <i>C. capitata</i> females. Female remating was lower when young females mated with old males in <i>C. capitata</i>. This would imply that males perceive young females of “good quality” and thus invest and transfer all the ejaculate possible to ensure the delay of renewal of female receptivity. Aging does not always cause a decline in reproductive potential, which may be important in species that overwinter as adults. Complex interactions between female physiology and male ejaculate senescence can impact postcopulatory behaviors that affect reproductive success for both sexes.</p>","author":"Viviana Díaz, \nAntonella Giudice, \nAlfonsina Palladini, \nAndrea Moyano, \nGisela Castillo, \nDiana Pérez‐Staples, \nSolana Abraham","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"1d0018995f5ad10146b6e60826d2cbf566c69de25e7476ee2fd1da28dcd05bd0","category":"Environment"}
