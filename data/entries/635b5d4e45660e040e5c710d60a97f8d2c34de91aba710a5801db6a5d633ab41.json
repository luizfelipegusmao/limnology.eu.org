{"title":"Characterization and Experimental Use of Multiple Myeloma Bone Marrow Endothelial Cells and Progenitors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0645/v1","date":1728477288000,"content":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that resides within the bone marrow microenvironment, relying heavily on interactions with its cellular components. Among these, endothelial cells (ECs) play a pivotal role in MM progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. In this study, we analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to identify unique pathway activations distinguishing ECs from MM patients and healthy donors. We developed a novel protocol to isolate and culture endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and ECs directly from MM patient bone marrow, demonstrating their ability to promote myeloma cell proliferation. Validation studies confirmed that these MM-derived ECs exhibit angiogenic potential as well as expression of characteristic endothelial lineage markers. These findings underscore the critical role of bone marrow ECs in the MM tumor microenvironment and highlight potential new therapeutic targets to disrupt MM progression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"635b5d4e45660e040e5c710d60a97f8d2c34de91aba710a5801db6a5d633ab41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
