{"title":"Use of olive and sunflower protein hydrolysates for the physical and oxidative stabilization of fish oil‐in‐water emulsions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13384?af=R","date":1709036967000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Olive and sunflower seeds are by-products generated in large amounts by the plant oil industry. The technological and biological properties of plant-based substrates, especially protein hydrolysates, have increased their use as functional ingredients for food matrices. The present study evaluates the physical and oxidative stabilities of 50 g kg<sup>−1</sup> fish oil-in-water emulsions where protein hydrolysates from olive and sunflower seeds were incorporated at 20 g kg<sup>−1</sup> protein as natural emulsifiers. The goal was to investigate the effect of protein source (i.e. olive and sunflower seeds), enzyme (i.e. subtilisin and trypsin) and degree of hydrolysis (5%, 8% and 11%) on the ability of the hydrolysate to stabilize the emulsion and retard lipid oxidation over a 7-day storage period.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The plant protein hydrolysates displayed different emulsifying and antioxidant capacities when incorporated into the fish oil-in-water emulsions. The hydrolysates with degrees of hydrolysis (DH) of 5%, especially those from sunflower seed meal, provided higher physical stability, regardless of the enzymatic treatment. For example, the average <i>D</i> [2, 3] values for the emulsions containing sunflower subtilisin hydrolysates at DH 5% only slightly increased from 1.21 ± 0.02 μm (day 0) to 2.01 ± 0.04 μm (day 7). Moreover, the emulsions stabilized with sunflower or olive seed hydrolysates at DH 5% were stable against lipid oxidation throughout the storage experiment, with no significant variation in the oxidation indices between days 0 and 4.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results of the present study support the use of sunflower seed hydrolysates at DH 5% as natural emulsifiers for fish oil-in-water emulsions, providing both physical and chemical stability against lipid oxidation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jeimmy Lizeth Ospina‐Quiroga, \nCristina Coronas‐Lozano, \nPedro Jesús García‐Moreno, \nEmilia María Guadix, \nMaría del Carmen Almécija‐Rodríguez, \nRaúl Pérez‐Gálvez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4b51a83e16630b297964b5f40f07f56eac7e8583110a6a7f09b8d70c08e76644","category":"Environment"}
