{"title":"Assessing fall risk and equilibrium function in patients with age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma: An observational study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301377","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Takahiro Tokunaga, Rinako Takegawa, Yoshiki Ueta, Yasuhiro Manabe, Hiroaki Fushiki</p>\r\nBackground <p>Falls in older adults are a significant public health concern, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma have been identified as potential visual risk factors. This study was designed to assess equilibrium function, fall risk, and fall-related self-efficacy (an individual’s belief in their capacity to act in ways necessary to reach specific goals) in patients with AMD and glaucoma.</p> Methods <p>This observational study was performed at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of Shinseikai Toyama Hospital. The cohort comprised 60 participants (AMD; n = 30; median age, 76.0 years; and glaucoma; n = 30; median age, 64.5 years). Visual acuity and visual fields were assessed using the decimal best-corrected visual acuity and Humphrey visual field tests, respectively. The evaluation metrics included pathological eye movement analysis, bedside head impulse test, single-leg upright test, eye-tracking test, optokinetic nystagmus, and posturography. Furthermore, we administered questionnaires for fall risk determinants including the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Falls Efficacy Scale-International, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and Spearman’s correlation analysis was employed to examine the interrelations among the equilibrium function, fall risk, and other pertinent variables.</p> Results <p>Most participants exhibited standard outcomes in equilibrium function evaluations. Visual acuity and field deficits had a minimal impact on subjective dizziness manifestations, degree of disability, and fall-related self-efficacy. Both groups predominantly showed high self-efficacy. No significant correlation was observed between visual acuity or field deficits and body equilibrium function or fall risk. However, greater peripheral visual field impairment was associated with a tendency for sensory reweighting from visual to somatosensory.</p> Conclusion <p>Self-efficacy was higher and fall risk was relatively lower among patients with mild-to-moderate visual impairment, with a tendency for sensory reweighting from visual to somatosensory in those with greater peripheral visual field impairment. Further studies are required to validate these findings.</p>","author":"Takahiro Tokunaga","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ffa4587115eacc14dc3eb586c56aec5d0067f9100970b22bd005ba67f1d4ce9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
