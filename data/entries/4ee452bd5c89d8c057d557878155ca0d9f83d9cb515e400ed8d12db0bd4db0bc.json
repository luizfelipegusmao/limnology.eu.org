{"title":"A Customized 3D Printed Bolus for High‐Risk Breast Cancer with Skin Infiltration: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1253/v1","date":1723821119000,"content":"Background: In high-risk breast cancer patients with skin infiltration the administration of a uniform dose to superficial tissues is fundamental in order to reduce local skin relapse. A personalized bolus may prevent the potential standard bolus’ inadequate dose distribution due to air gaps between the bolus and the skin. In this pilot study, we introduced in clinical practice the use of a personalized 3D printed bolus filled with ultrasound transmission gel. Methods: Seven patients undergoing radiotherapy after mastectomy were selected. 3D printed bolus dosimetric assessment was performed with MOSFET dosimeters on an anthropomorphic phantom and subsequently on three selected cases with increasing bolus shape irregularity. Acute/late toxicity and local control was assessed. Results: Overall, for the clinical cases the percentage median difference between measured and calculated doses was -2.7% (-7.0%÷4.9%). Median follow-up was 21 months. After two years, one patient showed G2 pain, one patient manifested G1 telangiectasia, one patient showed G1 hyperpigmentation, and two patients had no relevant toxicity. Conclusions: Personalized 3D-printed bolus filled with ultrasound gel may easily reproduce the standard bolus’ consistency providing an accurate coverage of the target area with tolerable acute/late toxicity grades. This is a pilot study and further investigations are needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ee452bd5c89d8c057d557878155ca0d9f83d9cb515e400ed8d12db0bd4db0bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
