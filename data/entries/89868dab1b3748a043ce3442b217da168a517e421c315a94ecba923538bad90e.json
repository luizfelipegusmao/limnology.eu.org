However, there are few reports on using plant extracts to self-assemble nanostructures. Plant extracts must contain many stabilizing and reducing agents capable of reducing and stabilizing the nanostructures. Still, when the concentration of ions is exceeded, the growth of different nanoparticle structures increases. Recent reports show that the shape and density of defects in silver nanostructures greatly influence their electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, electrochemical evaluation of silver self-assemblies is beneficial to explore many electrochemical applications, such as sensors and biosensors, to determine specific drugs or organic molecules [<a href=\"#ozae044.990-B1\">1-3</a>]. This study uses <span>Hamelia patens</span> plant extract as a natural reducing agent to obtain silver nanostructured self-assemblies. In addition, to study the electrochemical properties of the Ag spheres by cyclic voltammetry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"89868dab1b3748a043ce3442b217da168a517e421c315a94ecba923538bad90e","category":"Environment"}
