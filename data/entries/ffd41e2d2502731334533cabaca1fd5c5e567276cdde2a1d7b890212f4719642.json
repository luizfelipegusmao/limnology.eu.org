{"title":"Microbiome Transplantation as a Therapeutic Approach for Treating Bacterial Vaginosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0264/v1","date":1728263287000,"content":"A major cause of genital discomfort in women around the world is bacterial vaginosis, which results from excessive growth of pathogenic bacteria in the vaginal ecosystem. Current treatment consists of antibiotics and/or probiotics, which show favourable therapeutic effects, but also cause problems such as drug resistance and recurrence. Considering faecal transplantation's success, transplantation of vaginal fluid from healthy donors could provide the most effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis. However, experimental treatments have shown that vaginal microbiome transplantation may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. The present article examines the limitations of current standardized therapy, the advantages of vaginal microbiome transplantation, and presents future novel strategies for treating bacterial vaginosis based on current research findings and clinical trials development worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffd41e2d2502731334533cabaca1fd5c5e567276cdde2a1d7b890212f4719642","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
