{"title":"Combination of Polygonatum Rhizoma and Scutellaria baicalensis triggers apoptosis through downregulation of PON3‐induced mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress in A549 cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24148?af=R","date":1713272355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p><i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i> (SB) and <i>Polygonatum Rhizoma</i> (PR), two traditional Chinese medicines, are both known to suppress cancer. However, the mechanism and effect of combined treatment of them for lung cancer are rarely known. Investigating the combined effect of SB and PR (hereafter referred to as SP) in potential mechanism of lung cancer is required. This study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of SP on A549 cell growth and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>According to the theory of Chinese medicine and network pharmacology, in the in vivo experiment, a mouse model of carcinoma in situ was constructed, and lung carcinoma in situ tissues were collected for proteomics analysis, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and CK19 immunohistochemistry. In the in vitro experiment, lung cancer A549 cells at logarithmic growth stage were taken, and the inhibitory effect of SP on the proliferation of A549 cells was detected by CCK8 method. The expression of PON<sub>3</sub> was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot. In addition, the effect of SP on the induction of apoptosis in A549 cells and the changes of membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content were detected by flow cytometry. The changes of PON<sub>3</sub> content in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are observed by laser confocal microscopy, whereas the effects of SP on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and ER stress-related proteins in A549 cells were examined by western blot.</p>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>By searching the Traditional Chinese Medicines of Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tcmspe.com/index.php\">https://www.tcmspe.com/index.php</a>) database and SymMap database, the respective target genes of PR and SB were mapped into protein network interactions, and using Venn diagrams to show 38 genes in common between PR and SB and lung cancer, SP was found to play a role in the treatment of lung cancer. In vivo experiments showed that in a lung carcinoma in situ model, lung tumor tissue was significantly lower in the SP group compared with the control group, and PON<sub>3</sub> was shown to be downregulated by lung tissue proteomics analysis. The combination of SP was able to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<i>p</i> &lt; .0001). The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and ER stress proteins were significantly increased and the expression levels of PON<sub>3</sub> and anti-apoptosis-related proteins were decreased in A549 cells. At the same time, knockdown of PON<sub>3</sub> could inhibit tumor cell proliferation (<i>p</i> &lt; .0001). The combination of different concentrations of SP significantly induced apoptosis in A549 cells (<i>p</i> &lt; .05; <i>p</i> &lt; .0001), increased ROS content (<i>p</i> &lt; .01), and damaged mitochondrial membrane potential of A549 cells (<i>p</i> &lt; .05; <i>p</i> &lt; .0001), and significantly increased the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and ER stress proteins in lung cancer A549 cells.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>SP inhibits proliferation of lung cancer A549 cells by downregulating PON<sub>3</sub>-induced apoptosis in the mitochondrial and ER pathways.</p>","author":"Haitao Liu, \nLiduo Yue, \nYubin Li, \nTiansheng Zheng, \nWenjia Zhang, \nChaoqun Li, \nWenbin Zhuang, \nLihong Fan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"38a84a804b306c1f5df55422c992ad65f77f19ac1a4019b4cbcec9de12309083","category":"Environment"}
