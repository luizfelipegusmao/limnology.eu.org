The proximity of these phases suggests that phase transitions must be understood to establish the microscopic origin for these correlated phases and to use them for applications. These phase transitions have mostly been studied using ensemble-average measurement techniques, lacking real space information of nucleation and growth of these often-competing electronic phases. Nevertheless, such real-space information is essential for applications of quantum materials, which will be at the nanoscale where reduced dimensionality, confinement, local heterogeneities, interfaces, and defects will greatly modify the phase transitions and electronic properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3389ee09e89e6a8af6e1942d0a18f764580e7829c8c5051351caa2b42261339b","category":"Environment"}
