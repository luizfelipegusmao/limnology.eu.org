{"title":"Water Management as a Social Field: A Method for Engineering Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0417/v1","date":1725517373000,"content":"This paper proposes Pierre Bourdieu's sociological concepts of social field, capital, and habitus to analyze water management in Colombia. By mapping the social dynamics of water management, this study examines the interactions and power relationships among agents, including government agencies, private companies, academic institutions, non-profits, and local communities. The analysis reveals how various forms of capital, such as economic, cultural, social, and symbolic, influence water management practices, policies, and the distribution of power. Integrating agent-based modeling with hydrological simulations provides a more nuanced understanding of how social dynamics influence water management. This interdisciplinary approach helps develop more adaptive and equitable strategies by capturing the complex interactions between human behavior and environmental factors. The research demonstrates that agent-based modeling, informed by Bourdieu's sociological framework, offers valuable insights for policy development in regions facing socio-economic and environmental challenges. The study highlights the need to localize the analysis of the social field to capture regional customs and specific social dynamics. This localized approach ensures that water management strategies are more relevant, context-sensitive, and sustainable. This paper advocates for the wider adoption of agent-based modeling in water management, proposing a methodology that combines the engineering principles of practical problem-solving and adaptive design with an understanding of the social complexities in water management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26050578fc3b392829cbd7becae8100be1c1c3629e7b60ba534d214573b9e3fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
