{"title":"Geometric Tiling in Spinal Fusion Cages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0812/v1","date":1720588228000,"content":"The increasing prevalence of spinal disorders and the subsequent rise in spinal fusion surgeries stress the necessity for optimizing spinal fusion cages, crucial for stabilizing the spine and supporting osseointegration. Despite the widespread attempts at material modifications and surface enhancements to improve these devices, failure rates and complications remain significant. This research explores an imaginitive approach to enhancing spinal fusion cages through the application of geometric tiling designs, a method scarcely employed . The study systematically investigates the potential of triangular, diamond, and hexagonal tiling patterns to improve the structural integrity and capability for osseointegration of spinal fusion cages. Through a finite element analysis simulation, each design's ability to withstand multi-directional loads and effectively distribute stress was tested under simulated conditions that mimic the complexities of spinal motion. Preliminary findings in fields of engineering indicate that geometric tiling can significantly enhance the load-bearing capabilities and stress distribution of spinal fusion cages, potentially reducing the likelihood of implant subsidence and failure. The triangular and hexagonal designs, in particular, demonstrate superior performance in maintaining structural stability under axial and anterior compressive forces compared to traditional cage designs. This research opens a new pathway for the development of more durable and efficient spinal fusion cages. By leveraging the structural advantages of geometric tiling, future spinal implants could achieve better clinical outcomes, leading to improved patient recovery and reduced rates of complications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31e0a9d2910a4dcfc892dfc1b0262bd9f46c035e1d0f646b45e69c41f54f136f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
