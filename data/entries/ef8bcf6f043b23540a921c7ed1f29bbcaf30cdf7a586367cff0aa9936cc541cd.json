While nickelates share a 3d<sup>9</sup> electron configuration and crystal structure with the cuprates, there are significant differences in critical temperature and competing ground states [<a href=\"#ozae044.743-B3\">3</a>]. In the cuprates, superconductivity competes with symmetry-breaking charge density wave phases at low temperatures, but in the nickelates whether such symmetry-breaking electronic order exists remains unclear. Experimental signatures of charge order in infinite-layer nickelates presumed to arise from an intrinsic electron correlation-driven charge density wave [<a href=\"#ozae044.743-B4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.743-B5\">5</a>] have recently been attributed in some samples to ordering of excess oxygen present in the materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.743-B6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.743-B7\">7</a>]. Because of the substantial interplay between superconductivity and charge order found in other high-temperature superconductors, clarifying the nature of charge order in the nickelates is critical to understanding superconductivity in this system.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ef8bcf6f043b23540a921c7ed1f29bbcaf30cdf7a586367cff0aa9936cc541cd","category":"Environment"}
