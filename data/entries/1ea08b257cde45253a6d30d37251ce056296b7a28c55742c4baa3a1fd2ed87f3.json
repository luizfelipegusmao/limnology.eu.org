{"title":"Diagnosis of Plant Viruses Using NGS to Support Virus Management and Tomato Breeding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1813/v1","date":1714284008000,"content":"Viral diseases pose a significant threat to tomato crops (Solanum lycopersicum L.), one of the world's most economically important vegetable crops. The limited genetic diversity of cultivated tomatoes contributes to their high susceptibility to viral infections. To address this challenge, tomato breeding programs must harness the genetic resources found in native populations and wild relatives. Breeding efforts may aim to develop broad-spectrum resistance against the virome. To identify the viruses naturally infecting 19 advanced lines, derived from native tomatoes, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of small RNAs and validation by PCR and RT-PCR were used. Single and mixed infections with Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Tomato golden mosaic virus (ToGMoV), and Pepper huasteco yellow vein virus (PHYVV) were detected. The complete consensus genomes of three variants of Mexican ToMV isolates were reconstructed, potentially forming a new ToMV clade with a distinct 3' UTR. The absence of reported mutations associated with resistance-breaking to ToMV suggests that the Tm-1, Tm-2, and Tm-22 genes could theoretically be used to confer resistance. However, the high mutation rates and a 63 nucleotide insertion in the 3' UTR of Mexican ToMV isolates suggest the need to evaluate known resistance genes against these viral variants. The precise identification and characterization of viruses that naturally infect tomato germplasm could be used as a strategy for selecting the appropriate disease management and guiding breeding efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ea08b257cde45253a6d30d37251ce056296b7a28c55742c4baa3a1fd2ed87f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
