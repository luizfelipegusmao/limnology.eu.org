{"title":"Exploring the Potential of Community Health Workers in Type-2 Diabetes and Hypertension Management in Cambodia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1056/v1","date":1710768566000,"content":"To assess the community health workersâ€™ (CHWs) knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) in type-2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension (HTN) management. We thus also sought to assess the potential health system barriers for incorporating CHWs in T2D and HTN management. Mixed-method study comprised (1) a survey among 153 active CHWs to assess their KAP of T2D and HTN, and (2) semi-structured interviews with key informants to understand challenges of the health system and proposed solutions in incorporating CHWs in T2D and HTN management. The majority of CHWs correctly answered general knowledge questions on NCDs, risk factors, and prevention; however, only one-quarter correctly answered questions on smoking, family history, or tobacco use as risk factors. Most respondents appeared to have positive attitudes and have been practicing some activities related to T2D and HTN. Both financial and non-financial resource constraints were cited as challenges of the health system; therefore, re-structuring the role definition of CHWs and task of responsibilities, and assessment the need and workload have been proposed as ways forwards to effectively incorporate CHWs in T2D and HTN care. CHWs in Cambodia have shown their potential in T2D and HTN management; however, a well-designed strategy including technical training, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and strong supporting structure are important to maximize their potential in the health system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d73d542e9fd0e99266adf84ed078efafc80e798b9a6f1a0ee7e7d98a2475f7a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
