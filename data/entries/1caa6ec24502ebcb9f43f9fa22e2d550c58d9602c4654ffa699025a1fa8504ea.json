{"title":"Quantitative Assessment of Drone Pilot Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1957/v1","date":1721836109000,"content":"This paper introduces a quantitative methodology for assessing drone pilot performance, aiming to reduce drone-related incidents by understanding the human factors influencing performance. The challenge lies in balancing evaluations in operationally relevant environments with those in a standardized test environment for statistical relevance. The proposed methodology employs a novel virtual test environment that records not only basic flight metrics but also complex mission performance metrics, such as the video quality from a target. A group of Belgian Defence drone pilots were trained using this simulator system, yielding several practical results. These include a human performance model linking human factors to pilot performance, an AI co-pilot providing real-time flight performance guidance, a tool for generating optimal flight trajectories, a mission planning tool for ideal pilot assignment, and a method for iterative training improvement based on quantitative input. The training results with real pilots demonstrate the methodologyâ€™s effectiveness in evaluating pilot performance for complex military missions, suggesting its potential as a valuable addition to new pilot training programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1caa6ec24502ebcb9f43f9fa22e2d550c58d9602c4654ffa699025a1fa8504ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
