{"title":"A Review of Studies on HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis in Community Pharmacies in States with Restrictive Pharmacist Prescription Authority in the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0034/v1","date":1722519462000,"content":"Background: Community pharmacies have unparalleled potential to increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis medications (PrEP) for HIV prevention; however, only 17 out of 50 states in the United States have statewide authority for pharmacists to provide PrEP at community pharmacies. Few studies have reported on how pharmacists overcome the legislative barrier and provide PrEP services in restrictive pharmacy prescription states. The objective of this article is to identify the existing primary literature describing pharmacist PrEP service in the community in states with restrictive prescription authority. Methods: A systemic literature review was conducted to identify primary literature that involved community pharmacy service and PrEP conducted in states that do not have expanded pharmacist prescriptive authority between 2000 and 2024. Results: Ten publications were identified describing nine studies, including four interview and survey studies, three intervention reports, and two ongoing clinical trials. None of these studies have a control group. Most pharmacists provide PrEP service in the community through a collaborative practice agreement with a primary care provider. Conclusions: Future clinical studies with randomized controlled designs are required to test novel strategies in the education and implementation of pharmacy-led PrEP services in a community pharmacy setting to increase PrEP access.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be31f783184ef70f448b477dc0a68bcc7df5efbe5b14ecf23685f818e5dedfc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
