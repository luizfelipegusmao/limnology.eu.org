(x-an). A proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra is given where the surjectivity of this function is obtained from a Recurrent Coefficient Equation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07527a3d989d64ddccf1819573448709171f4f5ef2f796770356491c2be47765","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
