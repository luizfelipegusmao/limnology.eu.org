Greases are typically composed of an oil, a thickener, and other performance enhancers. Li-based greases are some of the most widely used, but high demand for lithium for battery applications has increased interest in alternative thickeners. Polyurea-based thickeners are gaining market share due to their high thermal and mechanical stability, especially in electric motor applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a54cbb5736596ab0a86f28fdece8fdff1ff81c0281169950069c6dc5f6fa0b92","category":"Environment"}
