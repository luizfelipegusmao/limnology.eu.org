{"title":"The Interplay between Vitamin D Deficiency, Iron Status, and Anemia Risk in Moroccan Women of Reproductive Age: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0229/v1","date":1725367032000,"content":"Vitamin D and iron deficiencies are the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies among women of reproductive age (WRA) in Morocco. Recent studies suggest that Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) may reduce iron bioavailability necessary for erythropoiesis, potentially leading to iron deficiency (ID) and anemia. This study investigates the association between vitamin D status, iron levels, and anemia risk among Moroccan WRA aged 18-49 years. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 463 participants. Serum levels of 25(OH)D, blood count parameters, iron, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and creatinine were measured. Lifestyle factors, including dietary intake, sun exposure, and physical activity, were evaluated using validated questionnaires, and anthropometric data were collected. Linear and logistic regression models assessed the relationships between variables, while Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy of VDD for ID and anemia. VDD (25(OH)D &amp;lt; 20 ng/ml) was significantly associated with lower levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, and ferritin (all p &amp;lt; 0.01), suggesting a role of vitamin D in erythropoiesis and iron storage. Multivariate logistic regression showed that VDD increased the risk of anemia (OR: 7.17, 95% CI: 3.19-19.28, p &amp;lt; 0.001), ID (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.32-3.77, p = 0.007), and IDA (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 1.73-12.08, p = 0.004). Dietary iron intake was inadequate among all participants, with minimal protective effect against anemia and ID (β(SE): -0.08(0.03), p = 0.030 and β(SE): -0.05(0.02), p=0.037 respectively). ROC analysis demonstrated moderate discriminative power for VDD in diagnosing IDA and anemia (AUC: 0.643 and 0.603) but reduced accuracy for ID (AUC: 0.575). This study identifies VDD as a significant risk factor for impaired iron status and anemia among Moroccan WRA, underscoring the need for targeted nutritional interventions and further research to explore effective prevention strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f77bc2665e67155fc8167aa5f065faa0fb0fccff7732d23e7b3d372cd3c0d199","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
