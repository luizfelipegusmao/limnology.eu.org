{"title":"Enhancement of nutrient use efficiency with biochar and wood vinegar: A promising strategy for improving soil productivity","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13844?af=R","date":1724994239000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The co-application of biochar and wood vinegar has demonstrated the potential to enhance premium crop production. The present study reveals the effects of co-applying rice husk biochar and wood vinegar (both foliar and soil application) on soil properties and the growth of Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica chinensis</i> L.) in a two-season pot experiment.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The soil pH, electrical conductivity and dissolved organic carbon contents in combination treatments of wood vinegar and biochar were increased more when wood vinegar was applied to soils rather than to leaves, and the parameters were observed to surpass those for chemical fertilizer treatments. The biomass of Chinese cabbage shoots was significantly increased by 60.8- and 27.3-fold in the combined treatments compared to the control when 1% wood vinegar was sprayed to the leaves (WF1) in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Higher contents of vitamin C, soluble protein and soluble sugar were also observed in the combined wood vinegar and biochar treatments compared to chemical fertilizer treatments and the control; for example, the vitamin C content of plant shoot in WF1 was 21.3 times that of the control. The yield and quality of plants were decreased across all treatments in 2023 compared to 2022 but the combination treatments still displayed superiority.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The co-application of wood vinegar and biochar enhances the growth and improve the quality of Chinese cabbage through improving the soil properties and plant photosynthesis. Moreover, the foliage application of wood vinegar is more preferable compared to soil application. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lizhi He, \nKun Geng, \nBoling Li, \nSong Li, \nWilliamson Gustave, \nJie Wang, \nParamsothy Jeyakumar, \nXiaokai Zhang, \nHailong Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d0e437459b8aa4472339becf7684d7006d3f2b4bcf4ebd16e463c52e7609d082","category":"Environment"}
