Levin, Janet Leath Alexander</p>\r\nObjective <p>To investigate the relationship between corneal diameter and internal corneal span determined from angle-to-angle distance using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in an observational cross-sectional patient population comprised of 54 eyes (28 healthy control eyes, ages 0.1 to 11.3 years; 26 eyes with primary congenital glaucoma, ages 0.1 to 3.5 years) from 41 pediatric participants ages 0.1 to 11.3 years (mean age: 3Â±3 years, median age: 2 years).</p> Methods <p>Forty cornea photographs with reference ruler and 110 UBM images were obtained. Three observers measured horizontal and vertical corneal diameter and angle-to-angle distance in each cornea photo and UBM image using ImageJ and the average values were used. Main outcome measures were Pearson correlation coefficient, linear regression, mean difference between corneal diameter and angle-to-angle distance, and intra-class correlation coefficients among measurements from all three observers for each parameter.</p> Results <p>Corneal diameter and angle-to-angle distance had a strong positive correlation horizontally (Pearson r = 0.89, p&lt;0.001) and vertically (r = 0.93, p&lt;0.001). Correlation was consistent regardless of presence of primary congenital glaucoma and participant age. Regression analysis demonstrated a linear relationship between the parameters for horizontal (CD = 0.99*AA+0.28, R2 = 0.81, p&lt;0.001) and vertical (CD = 0.91 *AA+1.32, R2 = 0.85, p&lt;0.001) dimensions. Overall, reliability was good-excellent, ranging from an ICC of 0.76 for vertical corneal diameter to 0.90 for horizontal angle-to-angle distance.</p> Conclusions <p>Based on the strong positive correlation found between corneal diameter and angle-to-angle distance in our study population, UBM image analysis can be used to accurately estimate corneal diameter from angle-to-angle distance in children with healthy eyes and primary congenital glaucoma. UBM may provide a useful intraocular alternative for estimating corneal diameter and monitoring diseases that affect the cornea in infants and children, such as congenital glaucoma.</p>","author":"Taylor D.
