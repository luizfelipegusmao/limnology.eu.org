{"title":"Effect of the Height of the 3D Printed Model on the Force Transmission and Thickness of Thermoformed Orthodontic Aligners","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1077/v1","date":1715846018000,"content":"The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of model height employed in the deep drawing of orthodontic aligner sheets on force transmission and aligner thickness. Forty sheets (Zendura FLX) were thermoformed over four models of varying heights (15, 20, 25, and 30 mm). Normal contact force generated on the facial surface of the upper right central incisor (Tooth 11) was measured using pressure-sensitive films. Aligner thickness around Tooth 11 was measured at five points. A digital caliper and a micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) were employed for thickness measurements. The normal contact force exhibited an uneven distribution across the facial surface of Tooth 11. Model 15 displayed the highest force (88.9±23.2 N), while Model 30 exhibited the lowest (45.7±15.8 N). The force distribution was more favorable for bodily movement with Model 15. Thickness measurements, conducted using a digital caliper and µ-CT, revealed substantial thinning of the aligner after thermoforming. This thinning was most pronounced at the incisal edge (50% of the original thickness) and least at the gingivo-facial part (85%). Additionally, there was a progressive reduction in aligner thickness with increasing model height, which was most significant on the facial tooth surfaces. We conclude that the thermoplastic aligner sheets undergo substantial thinning during the thermoforming process, which becomes more pronounced as the height of the model increases. As a result, there is a decrease in both overall and localized force transmission, which could lead to increased tipping by the aligner and a diminished ability to achieve bodily movement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd5da40aae7111c2d603ba1c9053c9f3fb0e8bf50ae5e40c792d215fb2465e0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
