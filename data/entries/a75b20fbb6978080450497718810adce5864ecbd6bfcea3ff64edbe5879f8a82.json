{"title":"The battle against the introduced pathogenic monogenean Gyrodactylus salaris in Norwegian Atlantic salmon rivers and fish farms","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13981?af=R","date":1723123610000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The introduced salmonid ectoparasite <i>Gyrodactylus salaris</i> has been detected on Atlantic salmon in 53 Norwegian rivers and in 39 Norwegian fish farms. In affected rivers, the mortality of Atlantic salmon juveniles is very high, estimated to a mean of 86%. <i>G. salaris</i> has been considered one of the biggest threats to wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon stocks. With various measures, the authorities have reduced the potential for further spread of the parasite to new rivers and fish farms, and <i>G. salaris</i> has been eradicated from 43 rivers and all fish farms. Furthermore, the eradication process is almost completed in five affected rivers located at the Norwegian west coast, while preparations for the eradication in the remaining five rivers in the southeastern part of Norway have begun. The goal of Norwegian management is to eradicate the introduced pathogenic <i>G. salaris</i> strains from all occurrences in Norway. In fish farms, the parasite has been removed by mandatory slaughter of infected fish. In rivers, <i>G. salaris</i> has mostly been removed by killing all the fish hosts with rotenone. The indigenous genetic Atlantic salmon stocks are re-established after eradication of the parasite. New methods are developed using chemicals that kill the parasite without killing fish in the rivers. Norwegian authorities have so far used more than NOK 1.5 billion on research, monitoring and combating <i>G. salaris</i>. However, the benefits are considered many times greater than the spending. Without control measures, <i>G. salaris</i> would likely have spread to new Atlantic salmon rivers where the same catastrophic outcome had to be expected. The Norwegian authorities seem to meet the goal in their long-term work to halt the spread of <i>G. salaris</i> and to eradicate the parasite in affected rivers.</p>","author":"Tor Atle Mo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"a75b20fbb6978080450497718810adce5864ecbd6bfcea3ff64edbe5879f8a82","category":"Environment"}
