{"title":"Exploring the Immune-Related Senescence biomarkers in Predicting Gestational Diabetes Mellitus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0967/v1","date":1713180196000,"content":"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is related with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the offspring. Immune and senescence play a crucial role in GDM progression. This study aims to explore the diagnostic significance of immune-related senescence (IRS) genes in GDM. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to compute the immune score and aging score in control and GDM samples. Machine learning identified core IRS genes. Then we performed unsupervised cluster analysis in GDM patients to explore immune infiltration. Finally, we validated the core genes in clinical samples. We used the intersection of MEblack module from WGCNA and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to obtain the potential genes. Next, a univariate logistic regression model including 23 potential genes were constructed, and these genes were filtered by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. There were 5 potential genes (COX17, RRAS2, RRAGC, CECR1, and TACC2), which defined as biomarkers, remained eventually, and the efficacy of these biomarkers was evaluated by nomogram. Finally, the results from both qRT-PCR and western blot analyses demonstrated CECR1 was down-regulated, while TACC2 was up-regulated in GDM placental tissue. Our study identified CECR1 and TACC2 as diagnostic biomarkers for GDM associating with immune and senescence, providing a new perspective on GDM progression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37ae8f5998d1287211133ecc525147ead6245300b8418de3bcd901177b980dc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
