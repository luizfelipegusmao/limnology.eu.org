{"title":"mRNA cleavage by 21-nucleotide phasiRNAs determines temperature-sensitive male sterility in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2354/7462149?rss=1","date":1701907200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Temperature-sensitive male sterility is one of the core components for hybrid rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) breeding based on the 2-line system. We previously found that knockout of <span>ARGONAUTE 1d</span> (<span>AGO1d</span>) causes temperature-sensitive male sterility in rice by influencing phased small interfering RNA (phasiRNA) biogenesis and function. However, the specific phasiRNAs and their targets underlying the temperature-sensitive male sterility in the <span>ago1d</span> mutant remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the <span>ago1d</span> mutant displays normal female fertility but complete male sterility at low temperature. Through a multiomics analysis of small RNA (sRNA), degradome, and transcriptome, we found that 21-nt phasiRNAs account for the greatest proportion of the 21-nt sRNA species in rice anthers and are sensitive to low temperature and markedly downregulated in the <span>ago1d</span> mutant. Moreover, we found that 21-nt phasiRNAs are essential for the mRNA cleavage of a set of fertility- and cold toleranceâ€“associated genes, such as <span>Earlier Degraded Tapetum 1</span> (<span>EDT1</span>), <span>Tapetum Degeneration Retardation</span> (<span>TDR</span>), <span>OsPCF5</span>, and <span>OsTCP21</span>, directly or indirectly determined by AGO1d-mediated gene silencing. The loss of function of 21-nt phasiRNAs can result in upregulation of their targets and causes varying degrees of defects in male fertility and grain setting. Our results highlight the essential functions of 21-nt phasiRNAs in temperature-sensitive male sterility in rice and suggest their promising application in 2-line hybrid rice breeding in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1370db2e049403bc8873b8cf2a42e0f40e3e93ac01901a76f1ce68205939887d","category":"Environment"}
