{"title":"Flowing Liquid Crystal Torons Around Obstacles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1092/v1","date":1728933629000,"content":"Liquid crystal torons, localized topological structures, are known for their stability and dynamic behaviour in response to external stimuli, making them attractive for advanced material applications. In this study, we investigate the flow of torons in chiral nematic liquid crystals around obstacles. We simulate the fluid flow and director field interactions using a hybrid numerical method combining lattice Boltzmann and finite difference techniques. Our results reveal that the toron dynamical behaviour depends strongly on the impact parameter from the obstacle. At impact parameters smaller than half cholesteric pitch, the flowing toron is destabilized by the interaction with the obstacle; otherwise, the flowing toron follows a trajectory with a deflection which decays exponentially with the impact parameter. Additionally, we explore the scattering of torons by multiple obstacles, providing insights into how the dynamics of these structures respond to complex environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84ff249cbe2d98685b449d14292c9ebc358f3c2957c2ce37b3d16ddbde896196","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
