The IMT is associated with a structural phase transition from the insulating monoclinic crystal structure to the metallic corundum one. The IMT can also be triggered electrically (resistive switching) and can be used for cryogenic neuromorphic application as spiking neurons. It is well known that mechanical stress impacts the IMT by changing the temperature of the transition and the threshold voltage [<a href=\"#ozae044.744-B1\">1</a>]. By engineering the strain in the V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> material it is therefore possible to alter the behavior of the material to design specific devices. Various methods exist to mechanically stress the V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> material, such as chemical doping, heteroepitaxy or lateral stressors with different strain profiles in the material.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a94ffef59116026c729f4e5f47d5c7143f8a13e4926fcfadcc8be9a3b845060d","category":"Environment"}
