The technique is based upon defocusing the electron probe such that there is a large overlap between adjacent scan positions. This encodes redundant information into the acquired dataset that allows the object function of the sample to be reconstructed. There are many methods for performing this reconstruction, and iterative algorithms are popular because they enable the simultaneous reconstruction of both the sample object and incoming electron probe, which allows probe aberrations to be corrected and which enables super-resolution imaging [<a href=\"#ozae044.940-B2\">2</a>]. The downside of iterative reconstruction methods is that they can be very computationally expensive, and they often require powerful computing resources and long reconstruction times.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2291e59d764520de62e348dca455449321d54883e3ca4ab5cd3b90cb8438fcec","category":"Environment"}
