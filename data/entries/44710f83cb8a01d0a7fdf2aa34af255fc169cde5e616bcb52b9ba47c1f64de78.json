{"title":"Detection of Tert-Butylhydroquinone in Edible Oils Using Electrochemical Sensor Based on Nickel-Aluminium Layered Double Hydroxide@carbon Spheres Derived Carbon Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1968/v1","date":1729786253000,"content":"Phenolic antioxidants such as tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) are widely used by manufacturers to prevent deterioration and more stable preservation of cooking oils. Cooking oil is a necessary substance that everyone needs to consume every day, but the overuse of TBHQ will harm the quality of food and public health, and many countries have set up limited standards for the use of TBHQ, therefore, it is very necessary to research and design an efficient detection technology for TBHQ. In this work, we grew NiAl-LDH, a nickel-aluminium double hydroxide, on glucose carbon spheres (GC), and formed porous carbon nanomaterials (named NiAl-LDH@GC-800) after the pyrolysis process. The NiAl-LDH@GC-800 material was fabricated on GCEs for sensors with remarkable sensitivity to TBHQ, with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 8.2 nM and possessed excellent detection linear range (20 nM ~ 300 ÂµM). The prepared electrochemical sensor successfully detected TBHQ detection in edible oils in life, including chilli oil, peanut oil, and canola oil.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44710f83cb8a01d0a7fdf2aa34af255fc169cde5e616bcb52b9ba47c1f64de78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
