The Sea of Marmara (SoM) stands out as a critical refuge for these endangered species.\nThis study harnesses data derived from comprehensive trawl surveys, representing the first area-based evaluation of the elasmobranchs inhabiting the SoM. Sampling protocols were carried out at 10 separate stations along the 980-km coastline of the SoM, each bounded by different ecological characteristics and anthropogenic influences.\nA total of eight shark species and six ray species were caught in the towed area of the entire the SoM. Notably, <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> and near-threatened <i>Raja clavata</i> constitute more than 50% of the total abundance. Additionally, rare, and critically endangered species, including the <i>Oxynotus centrina</i>, <i>Squatina squatina</i>, <i>Dipturus batis</i>, and <i>Myliobatis aquila</i>, were documented, expanding our knowledge of their presence in the region.\nSpatial distribution heterogeneity was pronounced within species.\nSize distributions were species-specific, and the presence of both juvenile and adult individuals suggested successful reproduction and growth.\nRecords expand the known size range in the SoM for six shark and three ray species. It also provides first-size information based on the total length of the <i>S. stellaris</i> and <i>D. batis</i>.\nAdditionally, the urgent need for field-based conservation efforts is highlighted, citing a previously unidentified important sensitive areas located in the southern part of the SoM.\n</p>","author":"Uğur Karadurmuş, \nMustafa Sarı","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"a266fd3a7eb608792325f17916647b36ed6a172f9ecdf2d9354ad08eba6e386b","category":"Environment"}
