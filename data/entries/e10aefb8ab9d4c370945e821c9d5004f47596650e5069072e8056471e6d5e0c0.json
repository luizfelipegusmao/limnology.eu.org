{"title":"A Novel Approach for Testing Fractional Cointegration in Panel Data Models with Fixed Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1680/v1","date":1721635106000,"content":"Fractional cointegration in time series data has been explored by several authors, but panel data applications have been largely neglected. A previous study of ours discovered that the Chen and Hurvich fractional cointegration test for time series was fairly robust to a moderate degree of heterogeneity across sections, out of the six tests considered. Therefore, this paper advances a customized version of the Chen and Hurvich methodology to detect cointegrating connections in panels with unobserved fixed effects. Specifically, we develop a test statistic that accommodates variation in the long-term cointegrating vectors and fractional cointegration parameters across observational units. The behaviour of our proposed test is examined through extensive Monte Carlo experiments under various data generating processes and circumstances. The findings reveal that our modified test performs quite well comparatively and can successfully identify fractional cointegrating relationships in panels even in the presence of idiosyncratic disturbances unique to each cross-sectional unit. Furthermore, the proposed modified test procedure established the presence of long-run equilibrium between the exchange rate and labour wage of 36 countries agricultural markets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e10aefb8ab9d4c370945e821c9d5004f47596650e5069072e8056471e6d5e0c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
