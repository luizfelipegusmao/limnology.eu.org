The proposed algorithm was applied to both the Single-Machine Infinite-Bus (SMIB) Power System and the 9-Bus Multi-Machine Power System. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method is efficient and guarantees an improvement in the dynamic stability and convergence rate of the simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a2bc534833ec91a4b7bbb0795d000da2d93476895da974b99b18d18673ded32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
