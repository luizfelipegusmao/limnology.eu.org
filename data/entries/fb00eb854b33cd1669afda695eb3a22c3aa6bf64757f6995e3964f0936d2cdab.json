Temperatures at the bottom of the ice remained constant at −1.7°C, near the freezing point, while they varied between −6 and −1°C with diel fluctuations at the surface layer. Carefully collected algal samples showed high photosynthetic quantum yield and acclimation to the light intensities of individual ice layers; this indicates that the algal photosynthetic activity responds to dynamic changes in the ice environment, such as variations in temperature, salinity, and brine space. The algal communities consisted of more than 95% diatoms. Smaller algal cells were distributed in the upper layer of the sea ice compared to the lower layers. <i>Chaetoceros</i> sp., the dominant small-cell species, was evenly distributed throughout the layers. In contrast, <i>Detonula confervacea</i>, the dominant large-cell species, was unevenly distributed in the lower layer, with smaller colony size and cell volume in the upper layer. The shape differences observed in this species were thought to be a response to the changing environment within the first-year sea ice.</p>","author":"Kyoko Kawanobe, \nSakae Kudoh, \nYoshihiro Suzuki","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"fb00eb854b33cd1669afda695eb3a22c3aa6bf64757f6995e3964f0936d2cdab","category":"Environment"}
