{"title":"Galectin-13 and Laeverin Levels Interfere with the Fetoplacental Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1482/v1","date":1713871096000,"content":"Introduction: Galectin-13 (Gal-13) is predominantly produced by the syncytiotrophoblast, while laeverin is expressed on the outgrowing extravillous trophoblast, and both are thought to be biomarkers of preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between concentrations of Gal-13 and laeverin measured in maternal serum and amniotic fluid at 16-22 weeks of gestation and the sonographic assessment of the fetoplacental measurements.\nMaterials and methods: Fetal biometric data, and placental volume and perfusion indices were measured in 62 singleton pregnancies. Serum and amniotic levels of Gal-13 and laeverin levels were measured using a sandwich ELISA.\nResults: Both amniotic fluid and serum Gal-13 levels expressed a negative correlation to the plasma laeverin level in mid-pregnancy. Serum laeverin level correlated positively with the gestational length at delivery (Î²=0.39, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2790c8c9b7766dd44e8b7c4b31c2f0ed3fa218423342784b0d0858b50886639f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
