{"title":"Tri‐frequency simultaneous ultrasound pickling for the acceleration of the NaCl content and quality improvement of pork (longissimus dorsi)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13448?af=R","date":1709907285000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The pickling process with NaCl is an essential step for pork preservation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different ultrasonic intensities of tri-frequency simultaneous ultrasound (TSIU) pickling on the NaCl content and quality of pork (<i>Longissimus dorsi</i>). After 30 min pickling, the NaCl content, moisture content, pickling yield, cooking loss, textural properties, color, pH, moisture migration and distribution as well as microstructure of pork were assessed.</p>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Results showed that among all the ultrasonic treatment intensities (85–150 W/L), the NaCl content of the sample pickled by an intensity of 101.3 W/L was higher than that of other intensities. TSIU 101.3 W/L showed 59.95% higher NaCl content than the control sample. In addition, the sample treated by TSIU of 101.3 W/L had more pickling yield and moisture content, better textural properties of pork (including hardness and chewiness), and less cooking loss. The results of the low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) presented that compared with the control group, the relaxation time of T<sub>21</sub> of the ultrasound-assisted pickling samples increased, while the proportion of T<sub>22</sub> (A<sub>22</sub>) reduction ranged from 175.0% to 379.9%. The microstructure designated that the ultrasonic treatment could facilitate changes in meat texture.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Ultrasound marination of different intensities promoted the diffusion of NaCl and affected the quality of pork tenderloins. The TSIU at 101.3 W/L could better accelerate NaCl transport and homogenous distribution on meat, thereby improving the sample quality.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
