Their favorite celebrities are seen using them, they see their parents using them, and some of their friends have them. But which iPhone is best for <em>your</em> kid? There are lots of factors to consider, not the least of which is the age of the child in question. When should a child be given their own iPhone? We’ll discuss that in a section below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever iPhone you get, you should consider using <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233792/two-screen-time-tips-to-keep-kids-from-working-around-limits.html\">Screen Time</a> to manage their use. Built into iOS, Screen Time lets you set limits on how long your kid can use their phone, what apps they can download and use, and when they need to put it down for the night. It’s a great way for busy parents to keep tabs on what their kids are doing when they’re not within eyeshot, and ought to be the first thing you set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now onto the iPhone itself. For toddlers who need a simple device for watching parent-approved videos and playing some games or educational apps, we recommend avoiding iPhones altogether and getting a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/357617/ipad-ninth-generation-design-display-specs-price.html\">basic iPad</a>. It’s affordable, you don’t have to worry about cellular connectivity, and the large size is easy for toddlers still working on their fine motor skills. You can check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668916/kids-want-an-ipad-make-sure-you-pick-the-right-one.html\">best iPad for kids</a> guide to see if this would be a better fit for your child, and we recommend a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672807/best-ipad-deals.html\">best iPad deals</a> roundup so you can get the best prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, once a child gets old enough for phone connectivity to be useful (for mobile internet, texting friends, tracking and being contactable by you), it’s time to step up to a proper iPhone. Here are our recommendations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has just updated the iPhone for 2023, introducing the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a> series and reducing the prices of the current handsets. How does that change the landscape for the best iPhone for kids? Read on to find out. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best iPhone for kids</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you will find our top choices for iPhones for children. We aren’t recommending the ultimate iPhones because we think that unless you have a money tree in the garden you won’t want to be spending a whole lot of money on a phone for a child who is just as likely to leave it on a bus or drop it. But if you’d like a wider range of iPhones to choose from read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670458/iphone-buying-guide.html\">iPhone buying guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">iPhone comparison</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 13 – Best iPhone for older kids\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Apple iPhone 13 - Best iPhone for older kids\" src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/reviews/3809620/iphone_13_review_16.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPrice\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDisplay size\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood battery life \t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDecent camera\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOlder processor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow $599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.straighttalk.com/all-phones/apple-iphone-13-128-gb.white&amp;xcust=1-1-334296-6-664594-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$629 at  Straight Talk</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9F5RH5?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$629.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-334296-6-664594-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MLMU3\" target=\"_blank\">$729 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Older kids—young teens and high school students—have demanding standards. An iPhone SE may serve them well, but that smaller screen is a little archaic and they’re going to want to look cool in front of their friends. More importantly, photo-taking and social media start to become an important part of their social life. So if you’re willing to spend more on an iPhone with a more capable camera, Face ID, and a full-screen display, we recommend looking no further than the iPhone 13. </p>\n\n<p>With a 6.1-inch display, it’s considerably bigger than the iPhone SE, which older kids will appreciate, and it has a more modern design and features. The iPhone 13 will deliver, with battery life that will easily last a full day.</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering why we picked the iPhone 13 over the iPhones 14 and 15. One reason is it’s cheaper, which is a good enough reason really. But we also think that the iPhone 13 compares very favorably with the iPhone 14. Sure, you’re giving up some of the newest features, such as improvements to the camera (Action Mode, for on-the-move video making) and the iPhone 14’s Crash Detection feature, but there isn’t a huge amount of difference between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 13, with both sharing the same processor (the A15). We think that the iPhone 13 is enough like the iPhone 14 that an older kid would be happy to have one. </p>\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 starts at $599/£599 for 128GB, you pay another $100/£100 for the iPhone 14 and yet another $100/£100 for the iPhone 15. Since your 9th grader is probably going to fill up the memory quickly making TikTok videos and taking selfies and pics for social media and texting with friends, we’d suggest that if you do have a bigger budget that the extra money is spent on increasing the storage in the iPhone 13 rather than the bells and whistles of the newer models. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668154/iphone-13-review-great-not-groundbreaking.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 13 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone SE (2022) – Best iPhone for younger kids\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Apple iPhone SE (2022) - Best iPhone for younger kids\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iphone_se_2020_review_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPrice\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSmall size\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDurability\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo Face ID\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOlder, less modern, design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$429 (64GB) | $479 (128GB) | $579 (256GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V4651JX?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$424.71 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-334296-6-665030-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MMX63\" target=\"_blank\">$429 at  Apple</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-334296-6-665030-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MMX63\" target=\"_blank\">$429 at  Apple United States</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If you have a kid at grade school/elementary/primary school who’s mature enough to handle their own phone, you should look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234116/iphone-se-2020-review-everything-you-need-and-nothing-else.html\">iPhone SE</a>. It’s got the same A15 processor used in the iPhone 13 range, so you know it’s going to perform well and get software updates for years. With a 4.7-inch screen, it’s also pretty small, which is good for younger kids’ hands and pockets. It’s a more than serviceable iPhone, and there’s really nothing your kid may want to do that they won’t be able to, outside of using features like Memoji or Animoji, which require the TrueDepth camera found in the Face ID-equipped higher-end iPhones.</p>\n\n<p>The best part is that it’s inexpensive (for an iPhone) at $429/£449, although that is for the 64GB version, which could fill up quickly if the child in question wants to download plenty of games and content to watch. Stepping up to the 128GB version ($479/£499) can alleviate this, but the price does start to creep up. Still, cutting back on features like the all-screen Liquid Retina display and dual cameras, and sporting Touch ID instead of Face ID saves a lot of cost, so the SE will still be cheaper than all the other iPhones. And since young kids tend to be rough on stuff, even with a good case and screen protector (which are highly recommended), you’re not going to want to risk putting a $700 phone in their hands.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, we don’t really recommend the iPhone SE (2022) for adults (although it can be ideal for the elderly), as in modern terms it seems a bit dated and limited, but for a kid’s first step into the Apple world it would be a great choice. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668196/iphone-se-3-2022-vs-iphone-se-2-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone SE (2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 15 (128GB) – For kids who want everything\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 15 (128GB) - For kids who want everything\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-yellow-in-hnad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLatest iPhone\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDynamic Island makes it clear that this is the new model \t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDoesn't offer a lot that the iPhone 14 and 13 didn't\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $799\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6417990&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6417990%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-334296-6-2067338-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$829.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>There is of course a certain status that you can only get from having the latest iPhone, and kids certainly aren’t immune to that. There are a lot more reasons to buy the iPhone  15 than there were for the iPhone 14 in 2022, including a much better camera that goes up to 48MP (although we’d advise that photos aren’t shot at that resolution if you don’t want the camera’s memory to fill up too quickly). The aperture on that camera is now ƒ/1.6 rather than ƒ/1.5. And it will be clear from the front that this is a new iPhone thanks to the Dynamic Island (the evolution of the notch, that appeared on the iPhone 14 Pro).</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest change for 2023 though, is that the port at the bottom of the iPhone 15-series is USB-C. This might make a number of Lightning cables lying around your house redundant, but there is at least a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box. If you already have USB-C plugs this won’t be a problem, and if you don’t charging using USB-C is faster than Lightning (but that was also the case for Lightning to USB-C).</p>\n\n<p>None of these are really big reasons to choose an iPhone 15 over a 14 or 13, and since we have already established that the iPhone 13 is practically identical to the iPhone 14 we recommend saving your money. </p>\n\n<p>We also recommend getting a case, see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064242/best-iphone-15-cases.html\">Best iPhone 15 cases.</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiPhone 14 – Best iPhone for kids who want to record on the move\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" alt=\"iPhone 14 - Best iPhone for kids who want to record on the move\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAction Mode for video\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tIt's not that different to the iPhone 13\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow $699 (128GB) | $799 (256GB) | $999 (512GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6505110/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-334296-6-1061977-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$729.99 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-334296-6-1061977-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14\" target=\"_blank\">$799 at  Apple</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.visible.com/shop/smartphones/iphone-14/?sku=MPVR3LL/A&amp;xcust=1-1-334296-6-1061977-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$829 at  Visible</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>As we said above, the iPhone 14 is practically identical to the iPhone 13 in specs and in appearance.

Somehow the engineers at Apple still managed to fit a 5.4-inch display into a device that’s smaller than the iPhone SE. </p>\n\n<p>One thing to bear in mind is that the smaller nature of the mini means that battery life can be a little lacking. So, if you’re expecting your kid to be on it all the time, especially when out and about, we’d suggest maybe picking up a portable power bank to top up the battery if things get low. As the iPhone 13 mini supports MagSage, you can choose one from our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\">best MagSafe portable battery packs and power banks</a>.   </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668144/iphone-13-mini-review-last-of-a-dying-breed.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 13 mini review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Buy a refurbished iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you buy one of the phones mentioned above our advice is to explore the second-hand and refurbished market.

Of course, investing in older tech is also better for the environment, as it stops the iPhones from being thrown into landfills even though they are capable of providing years more service to a happy kid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, they come with guarantees, save you money, and protect the planet. What’s not to love?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pass on an old iPhone to them</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another route to explore is handing over your current iPhone and buying yourself a new one! If you’ve had yours for a while, then it may be out of its contract period, but if you bought it outright then all you need to do is get a new SIM card for your youngster, give them your handset, then head off to the Apple store to give yourself a present for being such a magnanimous parent. If you’re unsure what to treat yourself to, our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">best iPhone</a> roundup should prove a helpful guide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you hand over your old iPhone make sure you set it up correctly for your child. Have a look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230138/how-to-set-up-a-kid-friendly-iphone-or-ipad.html\">5 things to do before giving an old iPhone or iPad to your kid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230803/iphone-sell-trade-carrier-store-online.html\">how to prepare an iPhone for sale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671481/how-to-reset-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">how to reset an iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670623/how-to-set-up-parental-controls-on-ipad-iphone.html\">how to set up parental controls on iPad &amp; iPhone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should kids have iPhones?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge question and a topic fraught with pros and cons. Everyone is different. There are still parents who don’t allow their kids to watch TV, let alone play computer games. Other parents don’t see any harm in letting their kids be familiar with technology. And others just need a few minutes of peace while they push a toddler around a supermarket, or something to stop the tweens fighting in the back of the car on a long journey. Surely allowing the kids a few minutes here and there with a mobile phone won’t damage their development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could give them your own iPhone of course, but that depends on how prepared you are for the risk of them sending their favorite YouTube video to your manager at work. A better solution may be to give them an old iPhone or iPad: it can still be linked to your account so there is no need to pay for the apps you’ve already downloaded for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older kids will no doubt want a handset with a bit of credibility. It’s also at this age that the risks associated with mobile phone ownership become more prominent as concerns about their use of, and influence of, social media become apparent. You will want to familiarise yourself with Parental Controls and ensure that they are really mature enough to handle all that comes with this connection with the world and that they are able to avoid becoming addicted to their handsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple founder Steve Jobs famously limited his kid’s use of technology, so maybe we should take a leaf out of his book. Or maybe we should accept that our kids are growing up in a world so immersed in technology that it is going to be a part of their lives whether we like it or not. We just need to control their access to it, rather than stop it altogether. </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c0f3fe0a710f1ca9851bcb78916e745c65d0acbd2c201012db3cdfe940435b86","category":"Apple"}
