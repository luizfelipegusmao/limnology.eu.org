{"title":"Fossil Fuel Prospects in Energy 5.0: a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0536/v1","date":1728378918000,"content":"Achieving the energy and climate goals of sustainable development, declared by the UN as an imperative and relevant for the upcoming Society 5.0 with its human-centricity of technological development, requires ensuring a “seamless” Fourth Energy Transition, preserving, but at the same time modifying the role of fossil fuels in economic development. In this regard, the pur-pose of this Review is to analyze the structure of publications in the field of technological plat-form for the energy of the future (Energy 5.0), with digital human-centric modernization and investment of the fossil fuel extraction in the context of the Fourth Energy Transition. To achieve this goal, this Review presents a comprehensive overview of research in the field of determining the prospects of fossil fuels within the Energy 5.0, characterized not only by the dominance of renewable energy sources and the imperative of zero CO2 emissions, but also by the introduc-tion of human-centric technologies of Industry 5.0 (Industrial Internet of Everything, collabora-tive artificial intelligence, digital triples, etc.). It was concluded that further research in such are-as of Energy 5.0 development as the human-centric vector of modernization of fossil fuel extrac-tion and investment, achieving energy and climate goals of sustainable development, reducing CO2 emissions in the minerals extractive sector itself, and developing CO2 capture and utiliza-tion technologies are important and promising for “seamless” Fourth Energy Transition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73d0334ec62953d01068f8b9199dfb0460a9e04013b1c83925ed0be303a7f154","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
