{"title":"Comparison of Mango (Mangifera indica) Dehydration Technologies: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1516/v1","date":1718963138000,"content":"The convective hot air drying technology can cause physicochemical, nutritional, and organoleptic losses in mango (Mangifera indica). Therefore, mango dehydration technologies were compared through a Systematic Literature Review to identify the effects on mangoâ€™s physicochemical, nutritional, and organoleptic properties. The bibliographic and theoretical results were analyzed. Of the 76 resulting articles, it was found that the countries with authors who participated most in the scientific production were those related to mango production or importation. Furthermore, the freeze-drying technology allows operating at lower temperatures than convective hot air drying, contributing to the preservation of ascorbic acid, among other compounds. The refractance window has the shortest operation time to obtain moisture values between 10 and 20%. The dehydrated samples using the refractance window are smooth, homogeneous, non-porous, and comparable to the color obtained with freeze-drying, which is acceptable for industrial applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e4866fd81a599d92dafff02b1884aee78293972abffcaf884dd642b0f15c127","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
