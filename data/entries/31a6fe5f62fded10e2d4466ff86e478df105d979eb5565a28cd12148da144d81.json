{"title":"Exploring the therapeutic potential of Caralluma fimbriata for antioxidant and diabetes management: a 28-day rat model study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae094/7701761?rss=1","date":1719792000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic potential of <span>Caralluma fimbriata</span> (CF) in 28-days rat modelling trial. Diabetes is a chronic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance and cause microvascular and macrovascular issues. <span>Caralluma fimbriata</span> was evaluated for its nutritional composition along with anti-oxidant potential of CF powder (CFP) and CF extract (CFE) using total phenolic contents (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Furthermore, anti-diabetic potential was computed by dividing rats into four groups of 5 individuals each. Rats of Group I was non-diabetic and no supplementation was given while rats of group II were diabetic and no supplementation was given. While group III and group IV rats were diabetic and received CFP and CFE supplementation respectively. CF powder’s TPC, and DPPH and FRAP activity were observed maximum at 44.17 ± 0.006 (μg<sub>Fe</sub>/g) in water, 68.75 ± 0.49 (μg<sub>Fe</sub>/g) in acetone and 800.81 ± 0.99 (μg<sub>Fe</sub>/g) in hexane. Supplementation of CFP and CFE reduced blood glucose effectively i.e. (125.00 ± 4.04 and 121.00 ± 4.49 mg/dL, respectively). Moreover, the consumption of <span>C. fimbriata</span> can be helpful in the management of <span>diabetes mellitus</span> due to its glucose lowering potential, anorexic effects, anti-oxidant potential and α-amylase inhibition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"31a6fe5f62fded10e2d4466ff86e478df105d979eb5565a28cd12148da144d81","category":"Environment"}
