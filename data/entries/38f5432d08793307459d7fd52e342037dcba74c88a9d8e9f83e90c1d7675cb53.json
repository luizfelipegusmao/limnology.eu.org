{"title":"Cryogenic FIB Lift-Out Reveals Atomic-Scale Photoactive Homojunctions in Cadmium Yellow Paint from Matisse’s “Flower Piece”","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.057/7719447?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Cadmium-sulfide-based yellows, which can be found in works by Edvard Munch, Vincent Van Gogh, Henri Matisse, and their contemporaries, are known to suffer from severe degradation issues, including discoloration, flaking, and whitening [<a href=\"#ozae044.057-B1\">1–3</a>]. The major preservation challenges with this color are linked to the cadmium sulfide pigment itself, which is a photocatalyst for visible light. These particles may react with their surroundings, including moisture, air, and paint binder through photodegradation. Crucially, the structure of these CdS particles may play an important role in the speed of degradation, as previous studies have shown that stacking faults in similar photocatalysts can greatly impact their photocatalytic efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.057-B4\">4</a>]. In addition, previous work has also shown evidence of such disorder within similar paint samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.057-B5\">5</a>]. This emphasizes the need for thorough, direct characterization of these paints in order to better understand what it is about cadmium yellow paints from the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20th centuries that cause such rapid degradation. Here in this work, we present high resolution cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) structural analysis of cadmium yellow paint from the 1906 version of Henri Matisse’s “Flower Piece” (Figure 1a), enabled through the use of advanced cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) sample preparation methods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"38f5432d08793307459d7fd52e342037dcba74c88a9d8e9f83e90c1d7675cb53","category":"Environment"}
