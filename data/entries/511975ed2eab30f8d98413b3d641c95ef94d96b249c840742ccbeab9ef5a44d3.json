{"title":"Effects of Hydrogen Dissociation during Gas Flooding on Formation of Metal Hydride Cluster Secondary Ions in SIMS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2028/v1","date":1727424104000,"content":"The application of hydrogen flooding was recently shown to be a simple and effective approach towards improved layer differentiation and interface determination during SIMS depth profiling of thin films as well as an approach with a potential in the field of quantitative SIMS analyses. To further study the effects of hydrogen, the flooding of H2 molecules was compared to the reactions of the atomic H on the samples of pure metals and their alloys. H2 was introduced into the analytical chamber via a capillary which was, to achieve the dissociation, heated to approximately 2200 K. Dissociation of H2 up to 30% resulted in a significant increase in the intensity of the metal hydride cluster secondary ions originating from the metallic samples. Comparison of time scales of possible processes provided an insight into the mechanism of the hydride cluster secondary ion formation. Cluster ions presumably form during the recombination of the atoms and molecules from the sample and adsorbed atoms and molecules from the gas. This process occurs on the surface or just above it during the sputtering process. These findings coincide with the previous mechanistic and computational studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"511975ed2eab30f8d98413b3d641c95ef94d96b249c840742ccbeab9ef5a44d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
