{"title":"Removal of Hazardous Organic Dyes from Liquid Wastes Using Advanced Nanomaterials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1122/v1","date":1715899131000,"content":"The presence of organic dyes in aqueous environments is of extreme hazardousness against life due to the toxicity of these compounds. Thus, its removal from these various aquatic media is of the utmost importance and several technologies are constantly proven to match this goal. Among these technologies, various types of degradation and adsorption are the most widely used, and of the various types of materials used within these technologies, nanomaterials are constantly developed and investigated, probably due to the various properties that these nanomaterials presented. This work reviewed recent developments (2023 year) about the use of these nanomaterials on the treatment of solutions contaminated with these toxic organic dyes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d05b394689ca9c80c922e070170be0e632fc12642451897eeefb2b9a4479844c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
