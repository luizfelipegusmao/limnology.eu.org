{"title":"Human Resource Management in Complex Environments: A Viable Model Based on Systems Thinking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0807/v1","date":1728609772000,"content":"The study addresses the challenges companies face in increasingly complex environments, which traditional Human Resource Management (HRM) models struggle to address. It proposes a Viable Model of HRM (MV-HRM) based on systems thinking and complex adaptive systems to enhance flexibility and adaptability. This model integrates five interconnected systems: operational processes, information systems, operational control, strategic planning, and governance. The methodology used includes a qualitative literature review to identify existing research gaps and the subsequent design of the MV-HRM using Beer's Viable System Model (VSM). The results show that MV-HRM enhances organizational resilience by promoting self-organization and interaction between systems, which supports agile decision-making in response to external changes. The model highlights the importance of aligning HRM with dynamic environments through effective communication, feedback, and a systemic approach to human capital management. The findings emphasize the need for HR leaders to adopt holistic strategies that integrate internal processes with environmental demands, ensuring long-term sustainability and competitive advantage. The study concludes that understanding HRM as a viable system is essential for addressing the complexity of modern organizational environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36e240005e1f532f16dfb9e369516fe81b5854166d2f564a28088e2889cea418","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
