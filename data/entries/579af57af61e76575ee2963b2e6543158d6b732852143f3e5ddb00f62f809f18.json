The dynamic model of a wind turbine system based on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is exposed to external disturbances, uncertainties, and nonlinear dynamics. In this paper to ensure the system robustness against external disturbance and uncertainty in system parameters, a novel optimized fractional order robust adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed by utilizing a disturbance observer. The controller's main goal is to track the maximum power point of the wind turbine. In order to show the superiority of the proposed method, the results under normal conditions and in the presence of disturbance and uncertainty have been compared with the classical sliding mode control (SMC) and adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC). The parameters of all three controllers have been optimized by ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed method does not need the knowledge of the upper bounds of model uncertainty and disturbance. Also by using the fractional order operators in the control signal of the proposed method, its robustness against model uncertainty and disturbance is increased and it can extract the maximum power than the other compared methods.</p>","author":"Amir Veisi, \nHadi Delavari","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"579af57af61e76575ee2963b2e6543158d6b732852143f3e5ddb00f62f809f18","category":"Environment"}
