{"title":"The LysM Receptor-Like Kinase SlLYK10 Controls Lipochitooligosaccharide Signaling in Inner Cell Layers of Tomato Roots","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/7/1149/7641819?rss=1","date":1712361600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Establishment of arbuscular mycorrhiza relies on a plant signaling pathway that can be activated by fungal chitinic signals such as short-chain chitooligosaccharides and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs). The tomato LysM receptor-like kinase SlLYK10 has high affinity for LCOs and is involved in root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); however, its role in LCO responses has not yet been studied. Here, we show that SlLYK10 proteins produced by the <span>Sllyk10-1</span> and <span>Sllyk10-2</span> mutant alleles, which both cause decreases in AMF colonization and carry mutations in LysM1 and 2, respectively, have similar LCO-binding affinities compared to the WT SlLYK10. However, the mutant forms were no longer able to induce cell death in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> when co-expressed with MtLYK3, a <span>Medicago truncatula</span> LCO co-receptor, while they physically interacted with MtLYK3 in co-purification experiments. This suggests that the LysM mutations affect the ability of SlLYK10 to trigger signaling through a potential co-receptor rather than its ability to bind LCOs. Interestingly, tomato lines that contain a calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentration reporter [genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECO)], showed Ca<sup>2+</sup> spiking in response to LCO applications, but this occurred only in inner cell layers of the roots, while short-chain chitooligosaccharides also induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spiking in the epidermis. Moreover, LCO-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spiking was decreased in <span>Sllyk10-1</span>*<span>GECO</span> plants, suggesting that the decrease in AMF colonization in <span>Sllyk10-1</span> is due to abnormal LCO signaling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"bebfb4509c2c09099a80a0e457f87332407b3c1221bd462e73cae09cb4c511df","category":"Environment"}
