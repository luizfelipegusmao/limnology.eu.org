Rigaku manufactured the crystal, and the first two prototypes are installed in electron microprobes at Advanced Microbeam and Concord University. The initial Ge crystal design uses a 111 orientation and covers a spectral range similar to PET but offset toward shorter X-ray wavelengths. A Ge 220 orientation is also possible and would cover a spectral range similar to LIF.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fda3c35d1c842b79a49aefaa9d7cd2d334382006ffd5521a49f2a2ebf74d3278","category":"Environment"}
