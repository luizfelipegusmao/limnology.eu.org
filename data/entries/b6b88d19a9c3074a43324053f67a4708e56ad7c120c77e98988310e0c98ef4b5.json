{"title":"Trajectory Planning and Performance Atlases of a New Omnidirectional Conveyor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2166/v1","date":1727416294000,"content":"This paper proposes an omnidirectional conveyor as a novel alternative to existing omnidirectional conveyors. With symmetric and compact layout, this new structure ensures consistent kinematics and enhanced flexibility in trajectory planning. The kinematic model of the proposed omnidirectional conveyor is developed and verified through simulation in CoppeliaSim. Four typical classes of trajectories are generated and verified in the simulation environment. Using PID control, the actual trajectories of a package on the conveyor closely match the desired trajectories. In addition, this paper outlines the workspace and corresponding wheel patterns for the conveyor, demonstrating how different supported wheel patterns emerge when packages move across various areas of the conveyor. The discussion extends to fault tolerance and obstacle avoidance, examining the workspace and wheel patterns with one or two omni wheels failed. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis on the feasible desired movements for the packages on the conveyor under the constrained wheel speed. This provides insights and guidance on trajectory planning and design of the conveyor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6b88d19a9c3074a43324053f67a4708e56ad7c120c77e98988310e0c98ef4b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
