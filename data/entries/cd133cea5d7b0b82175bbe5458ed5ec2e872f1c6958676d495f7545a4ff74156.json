{"title":"Investigation of the Interaction between Poly(trimethylene Carbonate) and Various Alcohols","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1521/v1","date":1724222424000,"content":"The interaction of poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) with alcohols were investigated as a model for polymer blending with polysaccharides. While 1-butanol, 2-butanol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-cyclohexanediol showed almost no detectable interaction with PTMC at both of solution state with 1H NMR and solid states of FT-IR, glucose and cellobiose suggests slight change of spectral pattern in FT-IR analysis. The thermal properties of the blending samples of PTMC and these alcohols were also investigated. Although the blend of PTMC with 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and ethylene glycol did not influence on thermal degradation behaviors due to the low boiling points to maintain the structure at blend sample preparation, however, the blend with PTMC and glucose or cellobiose tend to increase thermal resistances and increase glass transition temperature, hence, showed an existence of interaction through hydrogen bonding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd133cea5d7b0b82175bbe5458ed5ec2e872f1c6958676d495f7545a4ff74156","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
