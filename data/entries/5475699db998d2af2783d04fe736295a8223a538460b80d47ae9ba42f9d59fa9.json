Some <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains have developed mechanisms to resist serum killing, though the extent of variation in serum killing among bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates and the clinical impact of this variation is not well understood. To address this issue, we developed a novel assay that uses flow cytometry to perform high throughput serum bactericidal assays (SBAs) with <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> BSI isolates (n = 183) to define the proportion of surviving bacteria after exposure to serum. We further determined whether <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> resistance to serum killing is associated with clinical outcomes (e.g., in-hospital attributable mortality, in-hospital total mortality, septic shock) and bacterial genotype in the corresponding patients with <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> BSI. Our novel flow cytometry-based SBA performed similarly to a traditional SBA, though with significantly decreased hands-on bench work. Among <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> BSI isolates, the mean proportion that survived exposure to 25% serum was 0.68 (Standard deviation 0.02, range 0.57–0.93). We did not identify associations between <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> resistance to serum killing and clinical outcomes in our adjusted models. Together, this study describes a novel flow cytometry-based approach to the bacterial SBA that allowed for high-throughput testing of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> BSI isolates and identified high variability in resistance to serum killing among a large set of BSI isolates.","author":"Orianna Poteete","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5475699db998d2af2783d04fe736295a8223a538460b80d47ae9ba42f9d59fa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
