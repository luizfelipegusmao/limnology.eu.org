{"title":"Investigating possibilities for surveillance of long term chlamydia complications in the Netherlands: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305279","date":1718114400000,"content":"<p>by Elisabeth Maria den Boogert, Fleur van Aar, Janneke C. M. Heijne</p>\r\nObjectives <p><i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (chlamydia) is one of the most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) worldwide. Chlamydia can cause long term complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy (EP) and tubal factor infertility (TFI). Changing testing strategies, for example reduced asymptomatic testing, influence chlamydia surveillance, highlighting the need for exploring alternative ways of monitoring chlamydia. We investigated the possibility of introducing routine surveillance of chlamydia related long term complications.</p> Methods <p>A qualitative study including 15 in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of gynaecologists, general practitioners (GP), sexual health and emergency doctors was conducted in the Netherlands in 2021â€“2022. A semi-structured interview guide focused on experiences with diagnosis and registration of PID, EP and TFI and how a change in asymptomatic chlamydia testing strategy might influence this. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a thematic approach.</p> Results <p>Analysis showed that gynaecologists most frequently reported diagnosing PID, EP and TFI. Other professions rarely diagnose these complications, with emergency doctors only diagnosing EP. Most respondents reported unique registration codes for PID and EP, but the coding for TFI is more ambiguous. They reflected that diagnosis and registration of PID, EP and TFI are handled differently within their professions. Most respondents acknowledged registration in diagnostic codes as a useful surveillance tool. They expressed concerns in representativeness (e.g. differences in interpretation of diagnosis criteria) and data quality for surveillance.</p> Conclusions <p>Patient files of gynaecologists are likely to be most complete for monitoring trends of diagnosed chlamydia related long term complications in the Netherlands. However, when establishing a chlamydia complication surveillance system, professionals should be engaged in further standardizing diagnosis and registration practices. This will improve the quality and interpretability of complication surveillance and facilitate comparison between countries.</p>","author":"Elisabeth Maria den Boogert","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bad87f2c6c7a74f1896de35f1852feb11aea961ef25cf482609cd7f140c45bac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
