{"title":"Length‐Weight Relationships for 32 Species of Cryptobenthic Reef Fishes from the Red Sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/1454131?af=R","date":1710572400000,"content":"<p>Cryptobenthic reef fishes (CRFs) are often neglected in reef biodiversity assessments, trophodynamic studies, and biomass models. This oversight is due to the challenges associated with recording them in traditional underwater visual surveys and the scarcity of literature detailing their life history, ecology, and body growth parameters. Given their pivotal role in the functioning and maintenance of coral reef ecosystems, addressing these information gaps for CRF species is of great importance. In this study, we have computed the length-weight relationships (LWRs) for 32 CRF species spanning seven families in the Red Sea. This marks the first comprehensive report of LWR parameters for CRFs from this region, and for 31 of these species, it serves as their first LWR data report. The coefficient of determination (<i>r</i>\n<sup>\n   <i>2</i>\n</sup>) ranged from 0.82 to 0.99, indicating a good fit for the LWRs. Half of the presented species belong to the Gobiidae family, including three undescribed species. In addition, we present LWRs for species from the families Blenniidae (5 spp.), Tripterygiidae (2 spp.), Apogonidae (4 spp.), Pseudochromidae (3 spp.), Plesiopidae (1 spp.), and Scorpaenidae (1 spp.). This research contributes invaluable insights into the growth patterns of CRFs not only in a global context but also beyond, as 50% of the recorded species are endemic to the region. The data generated holds great significance for conducting functional diversity analyses, ecosystem assessments, and coral reef health monitoring. By capturing this critical information, this work provides foundational metrics to take significant strides toward the conservation of these essential coral reef fishes.</p>","author":"Lucía Pombo-Ayora, \nViktor Nunes Peinemann, \nDarren J.
