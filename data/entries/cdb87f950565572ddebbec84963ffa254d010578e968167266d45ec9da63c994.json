{"title":"Soil Organic Nitrogen Mineralization and N2O Production Driven by Changes in Coastal Wetlands","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GB008154?af=R","date":1717052400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Plant invasion and land reclamation have drastically transformed the landscape of coastal wetlands globally, but their resulting effects on soil organic nitrogen (SON) mineralization and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) production remain unclear. In this study, we examined 21 coastal wetlands across southern China that have undergone habitat transformation from native mudflats (MFs) to <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> marshes (SAs), and subsequently to earthen aquaculture ponds (APs). We determined the SON net mineralization rate and the presence of pertinent enzyme-encoding genes, namely <i>chiA</i>, <i>pepA</i>, and <i>pepN</i>. The SON net mineralization rate increased by 46.7% following the conversion of MFs to SAs but decreased by 33.1% in response to the transformation of SAs to APs. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the estimated mineralization efficiency of soil microbes among the habitat types. The results of structural equation modeling showed that N-mineralization gene abundance played a major role in regulating SON mineralization. Although less than 20% of the SON was estimated to be labile/semi-labile, SON mineralization was important in sustaining soil N<sub>2</sub>O production, with 5.8% of the mineralized N being fed into N<sub>2</sub>O production. Overall, our findings showed that the presence of <i>S. alterniflora</i> increased both SON content and mineralization rate, which would in turn promote further proliferation of this exotic plant along the coast. The conversion of <i>S. alterniflora</i> marshes to APs partially mitigated the positive effects of exotic plant invasion on SON turnover.</p>","author":"Ping Yang, \nHong Yang, \nYan Hong, \nXiao Lin, \nLinhai Zhang, \nChuan Tong, \nDerrick Y.
