{"title":"A Study on the Application Performance of High-Aspect-Ratio Nano-Ettringite in Photocurable Resin Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1163/v1","date":1713359250000,"content":"In this study, the impact of the addition of high-aspect-ratio nano-ettringite to photocurable epoxy acrylate resin was explored, with a specific focus on the changes observed in viscosity, shrinkage, tensile strength, and elongation at the break of composites formed. Herein, the nano-ettringite samples were modified using KH-570. The 3 wt% or 6 wt% KH-570-modified and unmodified nano-ettringite were dispersed into the resin by ultrasonic treatment in conjunction with mechanical stirring. The grafting effects of nano-ettringite onto KH-570 were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results demonstrate that increased dosages of unmodified and modified nano-ettringite led to increased viscosity of the composite while reducing shrinkage. At the same dosage, the photocurable resin with modified nano-ettringite demonstrated a lower shrinkage and a higher tensile strength. Notably, when the amount of modified nano-ettringite was 3 wt%, the highest tensile strength of the composite was 64.61 MPa, presenting a 72.57% increase compared to the blank sample. Furthermore, the incorporation of modified nano-ettringite as a filler provides a new perspective for improving the performance of photocurable epoxy acrylate resin composites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1a361dde7dc5672acbdcd4fe06bca96e33f4e61368a6f5b6ae817d71647b7de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
