{"title":"Evaluation of the Use of Methylation as a New Tool for the Diagnostics and Progression of Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1499/v1","date":1726736185000,"content":"Vaccination against HPV significantly reduced the incidence of HPV-related le-sions worldwide. Considering the increasingly younger age of patients in the gynaecological office and the resulting earlier sexual initiation and potentially contact with the HPV virus, doctors need to have tools to verify the diagnosis. Nowadays, women plan motherhood later, so it is necessary to consider whether sexual treatment in the form of, among others, LEEP-conization may increase the risk of premature birth or difficulty dilating the cervix during labour.For this reason, to avoid overtreatment of LSIL changes, methylation testing may be considered. In patients with histopathologically confirmed HSIL during biopsy and ultimately a lower diagnosis - i.e., LSIL or no signs of atypia - methylation turned out to be a useful tool. We performed Pap-smear, HPV genotyping, punch biopsy, LEEP-conization (if needed) and methylation test in 108 women admitted to the District Public Hospital in Poland. Women with a negative methylation test result were significantly more likely to be ultimately diagnosed with LSIL (p=0.013). This means that in 85.7% of patients with HSIL, major cervical surgery could have been avoided if methylation was negative. Methylation testing, as well as dual-staining and diagnostics detecting mRNA transcripts of highly oncogenic types of HPV, might be used in future in the diagnosis of pre-cancerous conditions, mainly of the cervix, and in HPV-dependent cervical cancer screening. The methylation test may also be used in the diagnosis and identification of lesions within the cervical canal, including those located deep within the frontal crypts, not visible even during a professional colposcopic evaluation of the cervix, as well as within the crypts of the palatine tonsils - in diagnostics of head and neck diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b55d180f560887e481c1e22690dc8f92534e8c0df552763f806f251aeb085021","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
