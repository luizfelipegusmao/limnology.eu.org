{"title":"Mass Spectrometry in Clinical Chemistry: Advancing Biomarker Discovery and Personalized Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0726/v1","date":1723427423000,"content":"Mass spectrometry (MS) has revolutionized clinical chemistry, offering unparalleled capabilities for biomolecule analysis. This review explores the growing significance of MS, particularly when coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS), in identifying disease biomarkers and quantifying biomolecules for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The unique advantages of MS in accurately identifying and quantifying diverse molecules have positioned it as a cornerstone in personalized medicine advancement. MS-based technologies have transformed precision medicine, enabling comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and patient-specific treatment responses. LC-MS has shown exceptional utility in analyzing complex biological matrices, while high-resolution MS has expanded analytical capabilities, allowing detection of low-abundance molecules and elucidation of complex biological pathways. The integration of MS with other techniques, such as ion mobility spectrometry, has opened new avenues for biomarker discovery and validation. As we progress towards precision medicine, MS-based technologies will be crucial in addressing the challenges of individualized patient care, driving innovations in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad373c18625c78f3059db09c845a1e2bd2739d4e9d0c3a4bd99adcaa8d089b4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
