{"title":"Experiences of transgender persons in accessing routine healthcare services in India: Findings from a participatory qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002933","date":1709215200000,"content":"<p>by Harikeerthan Raghuram, Sana Parakh, Deepak Tugnawat, Satendra Singh, Aqsa Shaikh, Anant Bhan</p>\r\n\r\nDespite having a higher burden of health problems, transgender persons face challenges in accessing healthcare in India. Most studies on healthcare access of transgender persons in India focus only on HIV related care, mental healthcare, gender affirmative services or on the ethno-cultural communities or transgender women. This study fills this gap by focusing on diverse gender identities within the transgender community with a specific focus on experiences in accessing general or routine healthcare services. A qualitative descriptive approach was used in this study. 23 in-depth interviews and 6 focus group discussions were conducted virtually and in-person with a total of 63 transgender persons in different regions of India between May and September 2021. The study used a community-based participatory research approach and was informed by the intersectionality approach. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Four key themes emerged: (i) intersectional challenges in accessing healthcare start outside of the health system, continue through cisgender-binary-normative health systems that exclude transgender persons; and at the interface with individuals such as health professionals, support staff and bystanders; (ii) the experiences negatively impact transgender persons at an individual level; (iii) in response, transgender persons navigate these challenges across each of the levels: individual, health system level and from outside of the health system. This is a first of its kind qualitative participatory study focusing on routine healthcare services of transgender persons in India. The findings indicate the need to move conversations on trans-inclusion in healthcare from HIV and gender affirmative services to routine comprehensive healthcare services considering the higher burden of health problems in the community and the impact of poor access on their lives and well-being.","author":"Harikeerthan Raghuram","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"4b8cdf5efedbf9748f22594692c771a1f9d0e9985cac7ef61be5c18805e7b9b7","category":"Environment"}
