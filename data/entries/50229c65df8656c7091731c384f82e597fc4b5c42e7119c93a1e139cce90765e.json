{"title":"A novel antioxidant iron‐chelating peptide from yak skin: analysis of the chelating mechanism and digestion stability in vitro","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13621?af=R","date":1717398000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The global prevalence of iron deficiency has posed significant public health risks. Animal-derived collagen peptides have been recognized for their potent metal ion-chelating capabilities, which can greatly enhance the bioavailability of iron. Yak skins, typically discarded during production and processing, serve as a valuable resource. Based on yak skin collagen peptide (YSP), we have developed a novel iron-chelating peptide: yak skin collagen iron-chelating peptide (YSP-Fe).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The maximum level of iron chelation of YSP-Fe achieved was 42.72 ± 0.65 mg g<sup>−1</sup>. Structural analysis indicated that YSP-Fe was primarily formed from amino, carboxyl and carbonyl groups combined with ferrous ions. Through examination of the amino acid composition, molecular docking and peptide sequence identification, it was determined that Gly, Asp and Arg played crucial roles in the chelation of ferrous ions by YSP. Furthermore, YSP-Fe was more stable in simulated gastrointestinal digestion compared to FeSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>YSP-Fe demonstrated dual benefits of iron supplementation and antioxidant effects. These significant findings provide a foundation for the development of novel iron supplements and the effective utilization of yak skin as a valuable resource. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiaoman Ci, \nRan Liu, \nYuting Sun, \nMohamed Rifky, \nRui Liu, \nYan Jin, \nQiaomei Zhu, \nMin Zhang, \nTao Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"50229c65df8656c7091731c384f82e597fc4b5c42e7119c93a1e139cce90765e","category":"Environment"}
