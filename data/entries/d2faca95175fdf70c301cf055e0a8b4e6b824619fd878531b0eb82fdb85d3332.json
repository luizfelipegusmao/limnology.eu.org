{"title":"Cooperation of an external carbonic anhydrase and HCO3– transporter supports underwater photosynthesis in submerged leaves of the amphibious plant Hygrophila difformis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/2/287/7313512?rss=1","date":1697155200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> can be a major carbon resource for photosynthesis in underwater environments. Here we investigate the underlying mechanism of uptake and membrane transport of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> in submerged leaves of <span>Hygrophila difformis</span>, a heterophyllous amphibious plant. To characterize these mechanisms, we evaluated the sensitivity of underwater photosynthesis to an external carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor and an anion exchanger protein inhibitor, and we attempted to identify components of the mechanism of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> utilization.<div>Methods</div>We evaluated the effects of the external CA inhibitor and anion exchanger protein inhibitor on the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> response of photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution in submerged leaves of <span>H. difformis</span>. Furthermore, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis between terrestrial and submerged leaves.<div>Key Results</div>Photosynthesis in the submerged leaves was decreased by both the external CA inhibitor and anion exchanger protein inhibitor, but no additive effect was observed. Among upregulated genes in submerged leaves, two α-CAs, <span>Hd</span>α<span>-CA1</span> and <span>Hd</span>α<span>-CA2</span>, and one β-carbonic anhydrase, <span>Hd</span>β<span>-CA1</span>, were detected. Based on their putative amino acid sequences, the α-CAs are predicted to be localized in the apoplastic region. Recombinant Hdα-CA1 and Hdβ-CA1 showed dominant CO<sub>2</sub> hydration activity over HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> dehydration activity.<div>Conclusions</div>We propose that the use of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> for photosynthesis in submerged leaves of <span>H. difformis</span> is driven by the cooperation between an external CA, Hdα-CA1, and an unidentified HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> transporter.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"d2faca95175fdf70c301cf055e0a8b4e6b824619fd878531b0eb82fdb85d3332","category":"Environment"}
