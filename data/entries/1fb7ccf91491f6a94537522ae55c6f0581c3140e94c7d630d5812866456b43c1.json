Despite challenging marine conditions, these eggs retain their integrity for extended periods and remain unaffected by pathogens. The antibacterial activity was measured using minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration analysis. The eggs of <i>S. stellaris</i> exhibited a slight inhibitory effect against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, whereas both species' eggs showed no activity against gram-negative microorganisms.</p>","author":"Elena Martinengo, \nPrimo Micarelli, \nFrancesca Romana Reinero, \nFabrizio Bertelloni, \nFilippo Fratini","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"1fb7ccf91491f6a94537522ae55c6f0581c3140e94c7d630d5812866456b43c1","category":"Environment"}
