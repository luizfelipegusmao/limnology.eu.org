{"title":"Comprehensive Analysis of Microsatellite Instability in Canine Cancers: Implications for Comparative Oncology and Personalized Veterinary Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0300/v1","date":1720015916000,"content":"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a crucial feature in cancer biology, yet its prevalence and significance in canine cancers remain largely unexplored. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of MSI across 10 distinct canine cancer histotypes using whole-exome sequencing data from 692 tumor-normal sample pairs. MSI was detected in 64% of tumors, with prevalence varying significantly among cancer types. B-cell lymphomas exhibited the highest MSI burden, contrasting with human studies. A novel \"MSI-burden\" score was developed, correlating significantly with tumor mutational burden. MSI-high (MSI-H) tumors showed elevated somatic mutation counts compared to MSI-low and microsatellite stable tumors. The study identified 3,632 recurrent MSI-affected genomic regions across cancer types. Notably, seven of the ten cancer types exhibited MSI-H tumors, with prevalence ranging from 1.5% in melanomas to 37% in B-cell lymphomas. These findings highlight the potential importance of MSI in canine cancer biology and suggest opportunities for targeted therapies, particularly immunotherapies. The high prevalence of MSI in canine cancers, especially in B-cell lymphomas, warrants further investigation into its mechanistic role and potential as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"856650f34ef4b34f7672a7badef6f0635b654080ed3469d5b376ca9c5dbb0d93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
