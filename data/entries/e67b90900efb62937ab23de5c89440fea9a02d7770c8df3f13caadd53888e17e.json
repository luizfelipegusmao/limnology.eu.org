{"title":"Male nurses’ adaptation experiences after turnover to community institutions in Korea: A grounded theory methodology","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302819","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Ja-Sook Kim, Suhyun Kim, Hyang-In Cho Chung</p>\r\n\r\nWe aimed to develop a substantive theory according to the associations between adaptation experience-related factors identified in male nurses after turnover to community institutions. From April through August 2019, data were collected through direct observations and in-depth interviews of 22 male nurse participants who were recruited purposively and analyzed simultaneously with the method proposed by Strauss and Corbin. Furthermore, 29 subcategories were derived from 11 categories, including: (1) leaving the clinical sector and changing jobs, (2) shaking while settling, (3) characteristics of the new job, (4) personal disposition, (5) support system, (6) finding my place, (7) solidifying my place, (8) demonstrating my professional competence, (9) stable settlement in my place, (10) preparing for a better future, and (11) still confused. The core category was identified as “putting down roots in another place for myself.” The verification of this theory in this study’s results indicates a need for research into the evaluation and development of professional development programs and related policies to provide support to male nurses who are pursuing opportunities in community institutions to maintain their nursing identity and further their efforts for developing a nursing specialty.","author":"Ja-Sook Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e67b90900efb62937ab23de5c89440fea9a02d7770c8df3f13caadd53888e17e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
