{"title":"Retrieval of contextual memory can be predicted by CA3 remapping and is differentially influenced by NMDAR activity in rat hippocampus subregions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002706","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Magdalena Miranda, Azul Silva, Juan Facundo Morici, Marcos Antonio Coletti, Mariano Belluscio, Pedro Bekinschtein</p>\r\n\r\nEpisodic memory is essential to navigate in a changing environment by recalling past events, creating new memories, and updating stored information from experience. Although the mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation have been profoundly studied, much less is known about memory retrieval. Hippocampal spatial representations are key for retrieval of contextually guided episodic memories. Indeed, hippocampal place cells exhibit stable location-specific activity which is thought to support contextual memory, but can also undergo remapping in response to environmental changes. It is unclear if remapping is directly related to the expression of different episodic memories. Here, using an incidental memory recognition task in rats, we showed that retrieval of a contextually guided memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear link between external cues, hippocampal remapping, and episodic memory retrieval that guides behavior. Furthermore, we describe NMDARs as key players in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes by controlling the reactivation of specific memory traces. While an increase in CA3 NMDAR activity boosts memory retrieval, dentate gyrus NMDAR activity enhances memory differentiation. Our results contribute to understanding how the hippocampal circuit sustains a flexible balance between memory formation and retrieval depending on the environmental cues and the internal representations of the individual. They also provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of hippocampal subregions to generate this balance.","author":"Magdalena Miranda","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"1e6f865469bc8db15cc6d4a532b3d5bacecaa2f5a3f297f9f95f69a5602eb9f7","category":"Environment"}
