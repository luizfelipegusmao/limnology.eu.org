{"title":"Development of High-Temperature Structural Materials for Gas Turbines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2465/v1","date":1722332397000,"content":"The advancement of high-temperature structural materials is crucial for the efficiency and performance of modern gas turbines, which are widely used in aviation and power generation. This paper explores the development and optimization of materials capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, mechanical stresses, and corrosive environments within turbine engines. The focus is on nickel-based superalloys, ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), and emerging materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs) and refractory metals. Nickel-based superalloys are the current standard due to their excellent high-temperature strength and creep resistance, while CMCs offer potential for weight reduction and improved thermal efficiency. High entropy alloys, characterized by their unique multi-component systems, present promising properties including high strength and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Additionally, advances in coating technologies and additive manufacturing are enhancing the durability and performance of these materials. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with material development, including the trade-off between strength and ductility, manufacturing complexities, and the need for long-term performance data. Future research directions are identified, focusing on the integration of computational materials science and advanced characterization techniques to accelerate the discovery and implementation of next-generation high-temperature materials. The successful development of these materials is essential for improving the efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of gas turbines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c211dfdc9ce5b02906c9528ddb12ab0d48df220b2eb5f2700abf78b2099c4b1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
