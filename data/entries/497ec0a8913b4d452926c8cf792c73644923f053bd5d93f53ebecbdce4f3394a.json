{"title":"Exploring the Development Trend and Key Influencing Factors of Tianjin&#039;s Industrial Heritage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2019/v1","date":1724834759000,"content":"Tianjin is currently in the phase of urban stock renewal, yet its industrial heritage encounters significant challenges, including constrained spatial development, a misalignment between industrial progress and the reuse of industrial heritage, and an understated cultural representation. This study applies geospatial analysis to delineate the distribution characteristics of Tianjin's industrial heritage across time, space, and typology. Moreover, the geographic detector is employed to assess the impact of various factors on the development of Tianjin's industrial heritage, ultimately elucidating the correlations between existing challenges and objective patterns. The conclusion of this paper presents three strategic approaches for the renewal of industrial heritage, emphasizing historical culture, environmental space, and sustainable development. These strategies are designed to provide a solid research foundation for protecting and revitalizing Tianjin's industrial heritage resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"497ec0a8913b4d452926c8cf792c73644923f053bd5d93f53ebecbdce4f3394a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
