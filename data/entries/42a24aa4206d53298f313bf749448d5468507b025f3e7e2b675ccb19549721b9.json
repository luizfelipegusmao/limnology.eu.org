{"title":"An Extensive Review of Leaching Models for Forecasting and Integrated Management of Surface and Groundwater Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0722/v1","date":1728536973000,"content":"The present study is reviewing leachate models useful for proactive and rehab actions to safeguard surface and subsurface soft water which become even more scarce. Integrated management plans of water basins are of crucial importance since intensively cultivated areas are adding huge quantities of fertilizers affecting surface water basins and groundwater. Aquifers progressively are being nitrified on account of the nitrogen-based fertilizers’ surplus, rendering water for human consumption not potable. Well-tested solute leaching models standalone or part of a model package provide rapid site-specific estimates of the leaching potential of chemical agents, mostly nitrates, below root zone of crops and the impact of leaching towards groundwater. Most of the models examined were process-based or conceptual approach. Nonetheless, empirical prediction models, though rather simplistic and therefore not preferrable, demonstrate certain advantages such as extensive calibration database information requirements, which in many cases is unavailable not to mention stochastic approach and the involving of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Models were categorized according to the porous medium and agents to be monitored. Integrated packages of nutrients’ models are irreplaceable element for extensive catchment to monitor the terrestrial nitrogen balanced cycle and to contribute to the policy making as regards the soft water management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42a24aa4206d53298f313bf749448d5468507b025f3e7e2b675ccb19549721b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
