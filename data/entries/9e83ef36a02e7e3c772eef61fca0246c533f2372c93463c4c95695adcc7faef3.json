{"title":"Pro-environmental behavior: the relationship with information literacy self-efficacy, climate knowledge and climate anxiety among students in Ghana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/doi/10.1093/oxfclm/kgae015/7727680?rss=1","date":1722816000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As environmental concerns escalate globally, understanding pro-environmental behavior is important. Using a cross-sectional survey of 265 university students from Accra, Ghana, the study hypothesized that pro-environmental behavior is related to climate change knowledge, information literacy self-efficacy and climate change anxiety. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and simple linear regression were used to test the hypothesis. Findings suggest that climate change knowledge was positively related to information literacy self-efficacy and climate change anxiety. Climate change knowledge and information literacy self-efficacy also positively predicted pro-environmental behavior. Findings imply that students should be trained to improve their climate change knowledge and acquire information literacy skills. Training these skills can contribute to the development of responsible environmental behavior in society.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Oxford Open Climate Change Current Issue","siteHash":"00d34e28b1e6fdd64576c95b4b9bf33bcd15bb32fadd247b4a29ecaac9c1ad73","entryHash":"9e83ef36a02e7e3c772eef61fca0246c533f2372c93463c4c95695adcc7faef3","category":"Environment"}
