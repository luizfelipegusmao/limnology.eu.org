{"title":"Development of web‚Äêbased hydrograph analysis tool considering seasonality and flow condition","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13178?af=R","date":1712164485000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Baseflow was proven to be the most unpredictable component of streamflow through various research. However, the recent method for estimating baseflow is due to the development of theoretical and computational techniques. This paper attempted to develop a fully automated baseflow separation system based on a recursive digital filter with an optimization algorithm for the single separation. Most of the previous baseflow separation methods use a single set of <i>a</i> parameter and BFI<sub>max</sub> (the maximum value of baseflow index), which can underestimate or overestimate the baseflow; however, the system developed in this study estimates multiple optimized <i>a</i> parameters using seasonality and flow conditions and uses them for BFI<sub>max</sub> calculation and baseflow separation. This system derived baseflow results in better understanding of watershed and streamflow tendency characteristics. This study developed a Web-based Hydrograph Analysis Tool 2020 with a user-friendly interface and new separation method regarding the seasonality and flow conditions with a fully automated python module to optimize <i>a</i> parameters and BFI<sub>max</sub>. The application to the two area show diverse parameter sets and different baseflow according to seasonality and flow conditions representing the flow characteristics. This study could be a fundamental tool for detailed watershed management decisions regarding water security in the dry season or environmental water for aquatic ecosystems.</p>","author":"Dongseok Yang, \nSeoro Lee, \nJonggun Kim, \nSeongjoon Kim, \nBernard Engel, \nKyoungjae Lim","siteTitle":"Wiley: JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b7070794a350c180e68e2251d6fc4f4ad5be669c5d24d82d3d55b25b0dce7a23","entryHash":"4f6b3187ec53b209cce491e810d4b43087dcde82cbffea6c223f66caa3dd14e3","category":"Environment"}
