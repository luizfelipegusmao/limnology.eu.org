{"title":"Compassionate Care with Autonomous Humanoid Robots in Future Healthcare Delivery: A Multisensory Simulation of Next-Generation Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0068/v1","date":1725266739000,"content":"This paper investigates the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in healthcare, highlighting the potential of autonomous humanoid robots to replicate compassionate care while centering on ethical and safety concerns related to reliability, quality, and empathy. It reviews the benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations of deploying humanoid robots in care settings, including user acceptance and technological limitations, and questions their ability to genuinely simulate compassion. Through multisensory simulations of human-robot interactions (HRIs) using agent-based modeling, the study reveals complex dynamics among patients, robots, and healthcare systems, suggesting that advanced robot designs can enhance personalized sensing with quantum and neuromorphic information processing. Additionally, it analyzes the philosophical implications of robotic nursing care, advocating for a posthumanist perspective that recognizes nonhuman caring agencies, and concludes with recommendations for future research to improve communication and humanize the capabilities of robots in caregiving.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86c7ad38c38a33a6c39c9671944dcb1c70205e952808aaa6d4305f4828436047","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
