{"title":"Association between human blood metabolome and the risk of gastrointestinal tumors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304574","date":1717077600000,"content":"<p>by Jiamin Lu, Yuqian Feng, Kaibo Guo, Leitao Sun, Shanming Ruan, Kai Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>The prevalence of gastrointestinal tumors continues to be significant. To uncover promising therapeutic targets for these tumors, we rigorously executed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to comprehensively screen the blood metabolomes for potential causal mediators of five frequently encountered gastrointestinal tumors (Liver Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Esophageal Cancer, Gastric Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer).</p> Methods <p>We selected a comprehensive set of 137 distinct blood metabolites derived from three large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) involving a total of 147827 participants of European ancestry. The gastrointestinal tumors-related data were obtained from a GWAS conducted within the Finnish study. Through meticulous MR analyses, we thoroughly assessed the associations between blood metabolites and gastrointestinal tumors. Additionally, a phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis was employed to investigate the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions.</p> Results <p>We have identified 1 blood metabolites, namely isovalerylcarnitine (OR<sub>log10</sub>: 1.01; 95%CI, 1.01–1.02; P = 1.81×10<sup>−7</sup>), as the potential causal mediators for liver cancer. However, no potential pathogenic mediators were detected for the other four tumors.</p> Conclusions <p>The current systematic MR analysis elucidated the potential role of isovalerylcarnitine as a causal mediator in the development of liver cancer. Leveraging the power of Phe-MR study facilitated the identification of potential adverse effects associated with drug targets for liver cancer prevention. Considering the weighing of pros and cons, isovalerylcarnitine emerges as a promising candidate for targeted drug interventions in the realm of liver cancer prevention.</p>","author":"Jiamin Lu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"90526573a9376556b817ceef55e83801ee593411c1c4a51ae4a174103de8ae73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
