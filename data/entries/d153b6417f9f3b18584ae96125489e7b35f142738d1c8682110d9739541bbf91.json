{"title":"Management of Urinary Incontinence in the Neurogenic Bladder and Its Relationship with Satisfaction and Lifestyle of People with SCI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1268/v1","date":1716192714000,"content":"One of the most common complications of neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal cord injury (SCI) is urinary incontinence, possibly related to bladder-emptying methods and changes in quality of life. This study aimed to identify the occurrence of this complication in adults with SCI and analyze its relationship with bladder-emptying methods, satisfaction, and lifestyle. This is a quantitative, exploratory, cross-sectional study. The variables were collected using the Bowel and Bladder Treatment Index during a telephone interview with 290 participants from February to November 2021. According to the results, 70% of the participants were male and 74.1% performed clean intermediate catheterization (CIC) as the main bladder-emptying method. Moreover, 55.6% were considered incontinent in the last year. Emptying by normal urination and bladder reflex triggering had a statistically significant relationship with urinary incontinence. A statistical association was observed between all the variables of satisfaction and lifestyle with urinary incontinence. Although CIC reduced urine leakage, a considerable number of participants still presented with frequent urine leakage. Urinary incontinence negatively altered satisfaction with the bladder-emptying method, effectiveness of bladder management, quality of life, and personal and social relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d153b6417f9f3b18584ae96125489e7b35f142738d1c8682110d9739541bbf91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
