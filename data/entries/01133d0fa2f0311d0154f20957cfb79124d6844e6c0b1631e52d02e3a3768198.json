{"title":"Exploring the Modifying Role of GDP and Greenness on the Short Effect of Air Pollutants on Respiratory Hospitalization in Beijing","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GH000930?af=R","date":1710831600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>It is unclear whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and greenness have additional modifying effects on the association between air pollution and respiratory system disease. Utilizing a time-stratified case-crossover design with a distributed lag linear model, we analyzed the association between six pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2,</sub> SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO) and 555,498 respiratory hospital admissions in Beijing from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2019. We employed conditional logistic regression, adjusting for meteorological conditions, holidays and influenza, to calculate percent change of hospitalization risk. Subsequently, we performed subgroup analysis to investigate potential effect modifications using a two-sample <i>z</i> test. Every 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> led to increases of 0.26% (95%CI: 0.17%, 0.35%), 0.15% (95%CI: 0.09%, 0.22%), 0.61% (95%CI: 0.44%, 0.77%), 1.72% (95%CI: 1.24%, 2.21%), and 0.32% (95%CI: 0.20%, 0.43%) in admissions, respectively. Also, a 1 mg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in CO levels resulted in a 2.50% (95%CI: 1.96%, 3.04%) rise in admissions. The links with NO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), SO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), O<sub>3</sub> (during the warm season, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and CO (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly weaker among patients residing in areas with higher levels of greenness. No significant modifying role of GDP was observed. Greenness can help mitigate the effects of air pollutants, while the role of GDP needs further investigation.</p>","author":"Jiawei Zhang, \nZhihu Xu, \nPeien Han, \nYaqun Fu, \nQuan Wang, \nXia Wei, \nQingbo Wang, \nLi Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: GeoHealth: Table of Contents","siteHash":"018a2f8ee482f9683e9bc368088d60586256b9cdf0b21bf2031822bf8cde1d3a","entryHash":"01133d0fa2f0311d0154f20957cfb79124d6844e6c0b1631e52d02e3a3768198","category":"Environment"}
