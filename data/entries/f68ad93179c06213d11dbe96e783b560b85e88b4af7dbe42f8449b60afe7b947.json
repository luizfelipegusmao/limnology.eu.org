{"title":"The Clique Width of Two Classes of Series-Parallel Digraphs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1498/v1","date":1711419415000,"content":"The concept of graphs with clique-width at most  was first introduced by Courcelle et al.to be the graphs that can be characterized using -expressions derived from graph operations that use  labels of vertices. If the clique-width for some graph is bounded then a grand number of algorithmic problems, in general NP-hard, can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to this graph. This important fact motivated the researchers to prove that the clique-width of certain graphs is bounded. Following this research direction, we prove in this paper that the clique-width of series-parallel digraphs is at most 6 and we present an  time algorithm to construct a 6-expression for this class of digraphs. In another part, we present a linear time recognition algorithm for a similar class of series-parallel digraphs and prove that the clique-width of this class is at most 3.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f68ad93179c06213d11dbe96e783b560b85e88b4af7dbe42f8449b60afe7b947","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
