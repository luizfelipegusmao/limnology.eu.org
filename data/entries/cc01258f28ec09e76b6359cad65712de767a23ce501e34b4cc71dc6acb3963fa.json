It can have a deleterious effect on all types of microscopes and should always be considered when installing a microscope in a facility. Some microscope manufacturers, particularly those who make charged electron or particle beam microscopes, have detailed vibration specifications; others do not. In this article we discuss sources of vibration, techniques for mitigating vibration, and some general rules about which types of vibration control to use based on the type of microscope being used.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"cc01258f28ec09e76b6359cad65712de767a23ce501e34b4cc71dc6acb3963fa","category":"Environment"}
