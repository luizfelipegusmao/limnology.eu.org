{"title":"A Cold‐Inducible RNA Binding Protein Gene from Acanthopagrus schlegelii: Molecular Characterization, Expression, and Association with Apoptosis to Low‐Temperature Stress","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/1697400?af=R","date":1687244400000,"content":"<p>In this study, the complete cDNA sequence (1552 bp) of the cold-inducible RNA binding protein gene (<i>cirbp</i> gene) was successfully cloned from the liver in <i>Acanthopagrus schlegelii</i> (initial weight: 15.0 ± 2.3 g). Results showed that <i>Ascirbp</i> (<i>cirbp</i> gene from <i>A. schlegelii</i>) gene has 24 phosphorylation sites, no signal peptide, and no transmembrane helix structure. AsCIRBP, with a molecular weight of 18.84 ku and an isoelectric point of 9.04 was a stable protein that encodes 182 amino acids. Subcellular localization analysis of this protein showed that it was located in the nucleus. Sequence alignment results showed that the AsCIRBP amino acid sequences of various fishes including black porgy were highly conserved, especially the RNA recognition motif (RRM). Those results of real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that <i>Ascirbp</i> gene was specifically expressed in the liver tissue of black porgy and its expression was significantly increased under cold stress or cold acclimation. The RNA interference experiment results showed that <i>Ascirbp</i>-dsRNA could suppress the expression of <i>Ascirbp</i> gene in the liver of black porgy through intraperitoneal injection. After silencing the expression of <i>Ascirbp</i> gene, RNAi groups were more severely damaged in the structure of the liver tissue and more prone to apoptosis under cold stress than control groups. The results of the study on the linkage between <i>Ascirbp</i> gene expression and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways showed that changes in the expression of the <i>Ascirbp</i> gene had a significant effect on the expression of key genes of apoptosis. The most striking result from silencing the expression of the <i>Ascirbp</i> gene was that expressions of the <i>bcl</i>-2 and <i>apaf</i>-1 gene in the liver of black porgy decreased significantly, which can block the normal apoptotic process. After the disruption of the normal apoptotic process, the expressions of <i>p</i>53, <i>bax</i>, <i>cyto-c</i>, <i>caspase</i>-9, <i>caspase</i>-3, <i>diablo</i>, and <i>caspase</i>-1 gene were significantly affected. These results suggest that <i>Ascirbp</i> gene can inhibit apoptosis and protect tissue structure in the liver tissue of black porgy at low temperatures.</p>","author":"Wei Mingliang, \nShen Mingjun, \nWang Yue, \nGao Bo, \nSun Ruijian, \nQin Yali, \nJiang Jianbin, \nZhou Jianlou, \nShen Jing, \nTang Xiaojian, \nZhang Zhiyong, \nZhang Zhiwei, \nPravesh Kumar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"08dbf8e233c4aad437ca5b530cec53d0e969b39954852912324735afa608221b","category":"Environment"}
