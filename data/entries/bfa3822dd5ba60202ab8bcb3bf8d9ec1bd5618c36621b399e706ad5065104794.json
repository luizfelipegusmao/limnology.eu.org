{"title":"The Future of Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP): Spotlight on Key Researchers and Emerging Global Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1120/v1","date":1726302071000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to analyze the collaborative networks and identify key players in autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) research from 2000 to 2023. Using data from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, I assess the structure and evolution of co-authorship networks to understand collaboration trends and influential researchers in the field.Method: I conducted a network analysis of co-authorship patterns in AIP research using Python (Version 3.10.5) in the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3). The analysis included macro-level indicators: network density, clustering coefficient, components, and average distance, as well as micro-level indicators: degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. These metrics were used to evaluate the connectivity, clustering, and key nodes within the network across three distinct periods: 2000-2009, 2010-2019, and 2020-2023.Result: The analysis revealed that the co-authorship network in AIP research evolved from a fragmented structure with limited collaboration in the early 2000s to a more interconnected but still dispersed network in recent years. Despite an increase in network density and a decrease in the number of disconnected components over time, the overall structure remains highly clustered, with many researchers operating within isolated groups. Key figures, such as Kazuichi Okazaki, Terumi Kamisawa, and Shigeyuki Kawa from Japan, consistently ranked high in centrality measures, highlighting their significant influence and leadership in the field. The findings suggest that while local collaborations are strong, broader international connections are still developing.Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive overview of the collaborative landscape in AIP research, identifying central researchers and highlighting persistent fragmentation within the network. The prominent role of Japanese researchers in shaping the field underscores the importance of fostering greater international collaboration to bridge gaps between research clusters. Enhancing global partnerships could lead to more integrated and impactful research outcomes, ultimately advancing the understanding and management of autoimmune pancreatitis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bfa3822dd5ba60202ab8bcb3bf8d9ec1bd5618c36621b399e706ad5065104794","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
