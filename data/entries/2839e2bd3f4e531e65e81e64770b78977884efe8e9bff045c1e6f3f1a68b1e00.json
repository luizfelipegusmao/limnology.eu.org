{"title":"Exploring the Evolutionary Basis and Population Genetics of ADHD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0251/v1","date":1717568690000,"content":"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exhibits a notable prevalence across diverse populations, with estimates ranging from 4% to 6%. This wide range prompts an investigation into the evolutionary and genetic underpinnings of ADHD, especially considering the markedly different environments faced by ancestral human populations compared to today's structured societies. This study examines the potential adaptive advantages of ADHD-associated traits in hunter-gatherer contexts, where hyperactivity, impulsivity, and novelty-seeking behaviors may have conferred survival benefits. We employ the principles of population genetics, including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, selection coefficients, and genetic drift, to model the dynamics of ADHD allele frequencies over time. Additionally, we discuss balancing selection as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity and how gene-environment interactions (GxE) contribute to the expression of ADHD in contemporary settings. Our analysis suggests that traits associated with ADHD, while potentially maladaptive in modern structured environments, could have been preserved through evolutionary processes due to their adaptive value in ancestral contexts. Understanding these dynamics provides a comprehensive view of ADHD's prevalence and highlights the significance of genetic and environmental interplay in shaping human behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2839e2bd3f4e531e65e81e64770b78977884efe8e9bff045c1e6f3f1a68b1e00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
