{"title":"A Soft Exoskeleton System Based-On Segmented Composite Proprioceptive Bending Actuators for Hand Rehabilitation ADL Tasks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1199/v1","date":1726474534000,"content":"Soft pneumatic actuators/robotics have received significant interest in the medical and health fields, due to their intrinsic elasticity and simple control strategies enabling desired interaction. However, current soft hand pneumatic exoskeletons often exhibit uniform deformation, mismatch the profile of the interacted objects, and seldom quantify the assistive effects during activities of daily life (ADL), such as extension angle and joint stiffness predicted. The lack of quantification poses challenges to the effective and sustainable advancement of rehabilitation technology. This paper introduces the design, modeling, and testing of pneumatic bioinspired Segmented Composite Proprioceptive Bending Actuators (SCPBAs) for hand rehabilitation in ADL tasks. The actuatorâ€™s soft-joint/rigid-bone segmented structure, inspired by the human finger anatomy, provides a superior fit compared to traditional continuous structures. A quasi-static model is established to predict the bending angles based on geometrical parameters. The SCPBAs also include a quantitative evaluation of joint stiffness and extension angle utilizing proprioceptive bending information. Additionally, a soft under-actuated hand exoskeleton equipped with SCPBAs demonstrates its potential in ADL rehabilitation scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e2584b2c5badbcfa98970301eabed9eaf488abdbd95e07062ca08ac3f0792f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
