{"title":"Multiple Attack Detection Using SHAP and Heterogeneous Ensemble Model in the UAV&rsquo;s Controller Area Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2018/v1","date":1714484173000,"content":"Recently, methods to detect DoS and spoofing attacks that occur on in-vehicle networks using CAN Protocol are being studied through deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, and LSTM. These studies have produced significant results in the field of In-Vehicle Network attack detection using deep learning models. In addition, significant results are being achieved through research on applying time series-based deep learning models such as LSTM to detect DoS attacks and replay attacks occurring in in-drone networks by expanding them to drones using the UAVCAN protocol. In this paper, we conducted an experiment to detect in-drone network attacks through non-time series analysis using machine learning models and deep learning models, and through appropriate learning for each attack type, it can also be analyzed through non-time series analysis. The results showed that it was possible to detect attacks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"345ea53ee54ffc2e9afa63c43bb3cf49ce7e4a92ab8623df50c1f77aaab56569","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
