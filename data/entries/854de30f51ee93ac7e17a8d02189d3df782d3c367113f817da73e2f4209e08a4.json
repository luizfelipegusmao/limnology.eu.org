As such, the technique is capable of forming images of light elements and makes efficient use of the transmitted electrons, allowing relatively low doses for beam-sensitive materials. These attributes have been used for atomic-resolution imaging of carbon nanostructures [<a href=\"#ozae044.908-B1\">1</a>], Li-ion battery materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.908-B2\">2</a>] and polymer crystallinity [<a href=\"#ozae044.908-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"854de30f51ee93ac7e17a8d02189d3df782d3c367113f817da73e2f4209e08a4","category":"Environment"}
