{"title":"Drag in Vegetation Canopy: Considering Sheltering and Blockage Effects","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036521?af=R","date":1719385200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Vegetation plays a crucial role in river hydrodynamic processes, and the accurate prediction of canopy drag force is essential for effective river management and ecosystem protection. The interactions within the vegetation canopies must be quantified to understand their impact on drag force. Through a series of flume experiments, we conducted an investigation into the canopy interaction mechanism of rigid emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly focusing on the blockage and sheltering effects. Our experimental design includes various combinations of lateral and longitudinal spacing, as well as special single-row and single-column arrangements. This allowed us to provide a more precise understanding of how lateral and longitudinal spacing affect the blockage and sheltering effects. Furthermore, we introduced a unified reference velocity that combines two effects, based on which we have established a widely applicable drag model that can predict drag under various density conditions. Lastly, we proposed a critical characteristic value for quantifying drag. This value is instrumental in revealing the ultimate performance of drag under different spacing arrangements. The findings provide a reliable approach for predicting drag in rigid emergent vegetation canopies, significantly enhancing our understanding of vegetation's influence on hydrodynamic processes and offering a practical tool for river management and ecosystem protection.</p>","author":"Yuyan Liu, \nPing Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"b08b692e657e49c38601913bcf2e518544e54df92e5f2c55dc682e6139000e6b","category":"Environment"}
