{"title":"Small Intestinal Fistula Secondary to Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid Ingestion: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0726/v1","date":1725946304000,"content":"Ingestion of corrosive agents is a well-known cause of extensive and severe gastrointestinal tract injury. Acids can result in significant acute complications throughout the gastrointestinal system. Herein, we present a case of total gastrointestinal necrosis after a patient ingested a large amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Of note, the patient developed an intestinal fistula six days following ingestion, requiring surgical intervention. This case underscores the potential for delayed gastrointestinal necrosis with high-volume and concentrated hydrochloric acid ingestion. Early CT evaluationto and multi-organ protectionis are crucial for such patients. For patients with no signs of perforation, multidisciplinary physicians should comprehensively evaluate the necessity of surgical exploration. In such cases, comprehensive treatment strategies can significantly improve outcomes. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the complexities and challenges in managing severe hydrochloric acid ingestion, to discuss the multidisciplinary approach required for such cases, and to contribute to the existing literature by providing detailed insights into the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of a rare and severe instance of concentrated HCl ingestion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"027606d5986eacd12bef953ad62770c2460c0bb497a3ec0918b2ef8c40436244","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
