{"title":"LRRK2 G2019S Mutation Affects Human iPSC-Derived Endothelial Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0519/v1","date":1728365132000,"content":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as an interface between the bloodstream and central nervous system. It limits the movement of molecules and immune cells, regulates the entry of nutrients, and removes waste products from the brain. The dysfunction of the BBB has been identified in Parkinson´s disease (PD) but the role of the BBB and endothelial cells (ECs) has not been well studied. LRRK2 G2019S mutation is the most common PD causing mutation with similar pathophysiology than in sporadic cases. How the mutation affects EC function has not been investigated previously in patient’s cells. In the study, we used iPSC-derived ECs from PD patients with the LRRK2 mutation as well as cells from healthy individuals. We report that PD ECs have higher levels of α-synuclein, altered mitochondrial respiration and response to inflammatory exposure, especially to TNFα. In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of fatty acid synthesis related pathways in PD ECs and downregulation of lncRNA MEG3, both of which have been associated with PD. Altogether, PD ECs manifest some of the PD related hallmarks and are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ab068713248a70ffc9ae77ce38e2a6ef2561e80b0dbd8fff73ad30f0b66045f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
