{"title":"High-Resolution Land Use Land Cover Dataset for Meteorological Modelling &ndash; Part 1: ECOCLIMAP-SG+ an Agreement-Based Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0953/v1","date":1726139645000,"content":"ECOCLIMAP-SG+ is a new 60~m land use land cover dataset, which covers a continental domain, and represents the 33 labels of the original ECOCLIMAP-SG dataset. ECOCLIMAP-SG is used in HARMONIE-AROME, the numerical weather prediction model used operationally by Met Ã‰ireann and other national meteorological services.  ECOCLIMAP-SG+ was created using an agreement-based method to combine information from many maps to overcome variations in semantic and geographical coverage, resolutions, formats, accuracies, and representative periods. In addition to ECOCLIMAP-SG+, the process generates an agreement score map, which estimates the uncertainty of the land cover labels in ECOCLIMAP-SG+ at each location in the domain. This work presents the first evaluation of ECOCLIMAP-SG and ECOCLIMAP-SG+ against the following trusted land cover maps: LUCAS 2022, the Irish National Land Cover 2018 dataset, and an Icelandic version of ECOCLIMAP-SG. Using a set of primary labels, ECOCLIMAP-SG+ outperforms ECOCLIMAP-SG regarding the F1-score against LUCAS 2022 over Europe and the Irish national land cover 2018 dataset. Similarly, it outperforms ECOCLIMAP-SG against the Icelandic version of ECOCLIMAP-SG for most of the represented secondary labels.  The score map shows that the quality ECOCLIMAP-SG+ is hetereogeneous. It could be improved once new maps once they become available but we do not control when they will be available. Therefore, the second-part of this publication series aims at improving the map using machine learning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd829a52d483d59bf8a5fea7a3e0a3a668b01dc6ab3b11ba9d53c8e84efad031","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
