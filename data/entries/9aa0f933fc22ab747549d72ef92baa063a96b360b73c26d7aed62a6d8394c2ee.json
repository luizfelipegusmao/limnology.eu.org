{"title":"A group VIIIa ethylene-responsive factor, CmERF4, negatively regulates waterlogging tolerance in chrysanthemum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1479/7408696?rss=1","date":1699660800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ethylene-responsive factors (ERF) play an important role in plant responses to waterlogging stress. However, the function and mechanism of action of ERFVIII in response to waterlogging stress remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that expression of the ERF VIIIa gene <span>CmERF4</span> in chrysanthemum was induced by waterlogging stress. CmERF4 localized to the nucleus when expressed in tobacco leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and luciferase assays showed that CmERF4 is a transcriptional inhibitor. <span>CmERF4</span> overexpression in chrysanthemum reduced plant waterlogging tolerance, whereas overexpression of the chimeric activator <span>CmERF4</span>-VP64 reversed its transcriptional activity, promoting higher waterlogging tolerance than that observed in wild-type plants, indicating that CmERF4 negatively regulates waterlogging tolerance. Transcriptome profiling showed that energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway-associated genes were differentially expressed between <span>CmERF4</span>-VP64 and wild-type plants. RTâ€“qPCR analysis of selected energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species-related genes showed that the gene expression patterns were consistent with the expression levels obtained from RNA-seq analysis. Overall, we identified new functions of CmERF4 in negatively regulating chrysanthemum waterlogging tolerance by modulating energy metabolism and ROS pathway genes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"9aa0f933fc22ab747549d72ef92baa063a96b360b73c26d7aed62a6d8394c2ee","category":"Environment"}
