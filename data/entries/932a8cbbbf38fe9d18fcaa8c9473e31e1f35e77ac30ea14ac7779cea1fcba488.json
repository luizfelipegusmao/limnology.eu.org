{"title":"364 Genetics: How long does it take for genetics to improve carcass characteristics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/94/7757302?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Beginning with a large push from consumers to improve meat and carcass quality in the 1990s, through selection, the beef industry has successfully made significant genetic gains towards achieving these improvements. For producers looking to increase the genetic potential of their own herds for carcass quality there are multiple considerations that will inform the time it takes to see improvement. Some of the primary factors influencing the rate of genetic gain for carcass quality phenotypes include: 1) available selection candidates, 2) trait heritability, 3) selection accuracy, and 4) selection intensity. Using the Germplasm Evaluation beef herd at the US Meat Animal Research Center, many of the possible factors influencing this timeline have been evaluated. Collection of carcass quality phenotypes has been an ongoing, long-term objective of the project and has allowed for the estimation of trait heritabilities, breed differences, heterosis effects, and genetic trends over time for this trait complex. Additionally, this herd facilitated the development of decision support tools for creating selection indices and breeding programs, representing the culmination of many of these research outcomes. There are multiple ways to achieve genetic improvement for carcass quality, and our primary objective is to equip producers and other stakeholders with the necessary information to make informed selection decisions.
