{"title":"A Way to Internet Collect Data, &lsquo;Related to a Specific Subject&rsquo;. The Special Case: For Albanian Agritourism Users Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1470/v1","date":1713864410000,"content":"The flourishing landscape of agritourism in Albania has witnessed a steady increase in destinations over the years. Recognizing their pivotal role in driving economic development in rural areas, considerable attention is directed towards the promotion and expansion of these agricultural tourism spots. To enhance interactivity with visitors, these agritourism destinations actively leverage social networks and various digital platforms. However, the wealth of information pertaining to these destinations is currently scattered across different platforms, posing a challenge to accessibility. To address this issue, these points are strategically placed on Google Maps, along with essential details collected from users, such as websites, contact numbers, visitor ratings, and comments. Nevertheless, other valuable data remains dispersed on various social networks. In response to this fragmentation, this study proposes the development of algorithms and scripts to systematically collect and analyze this dispersed information. By doing so, the goal is to centralize and streamline the data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the agritourism landscape in Albania. This approach not only facilitates efficient access to information for potential visitors but also provides valuable insights for stakeholders involved in the development and management of these agritourism destinations. The study aims to contribute to the sustainable growth of agritourism in Albania by harnessing the power of digital platforms to create a unified and organized database. Through this integration, the research seeks to unveil patterns, trends, and opportunities that can further guide policy-making, marketing strategies, and overall decision-making processes in the realm of agritourism development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7882581d23a7b79d204fc312c973f183cb058139d9cee61b1f79dd2e3c7fed27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
