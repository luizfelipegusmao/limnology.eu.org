{"title":"From Opium to Opioids: A Comparative Historical Analysis of Drug Crises in Qing Dynasty China and Contemporary United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2168/v1","date":1727416124000,"content":"Background: This study conducts a comparative historical analysis of two significant drug crises: the opium epidemic in 19th-century Qing Dynasty China and the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States, aiming to extract applicable lessons for current global drug policies. Methodology: A historical case study approach was employed, integrating examinations of historical records, policy documents, and contemporary data to compare the development, impact, and responses to these crises within their respective contexts. Results: The analysis reveals significant parallels in socioeconomic impacts and governmental challenges. Key differences include the evolution from predominantly prohibitionist approaches in Qing China to more comprehensive public health-oriented strategies in the U.S. The study highlights the critical role of national power, particularly military capability, in effectively addressing drug crises. Conclusions: The findings underscore four key lessons: (1) Purely prohibitionist approaches often lead to unintended consequences such as black markets and increased criminal activity; (2) Addressing underlying socioeconomic factors contributing to drug abuse is crucial; (3) Aggressive anti-drug policies can escalate into severe diplomatic tensions, necessitating careful consideration of international relations in policy formulation; (4) A nation's military and economic strength significantly influences its ability to implement effective drug policies and resist external pressures that may exacerbate the crisis. These insights suggest that effective management of drug crises requires a balance of strong domestic policies, international cooperation, and maintenance of national power to ensure policy autonomy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17b9953aec3d8b36a1cb2318fda274f41c4a7e21380a424725424b921cf8ec41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
