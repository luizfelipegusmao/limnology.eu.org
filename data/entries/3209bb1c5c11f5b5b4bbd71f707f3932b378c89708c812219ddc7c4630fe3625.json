{"title":"Feasibility Study on Modified Edge-Free Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) on Metal Powder â€“ Al7075 Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0196/v1","date":1717560087000,"content":"A modification to the conventional spark plasma sintering (SPS) process was undertaken to allow edge-free deformation of grains longitudinally to the loading axis in a process termed spark plasma texturing (SPT). The resulting Al7075 SPT compact was compared to SPSed Al7075 in terms of densification behaviour, microstructural evolution, and mechanical properties. The result reported herein highlights the unique benefits of the SPT technique and potential application in the manufacturing of advanced materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3209bb1c5c11f5b5b4bbd71f707f3932b378c89708c812219ddc7c4630fe3625","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
