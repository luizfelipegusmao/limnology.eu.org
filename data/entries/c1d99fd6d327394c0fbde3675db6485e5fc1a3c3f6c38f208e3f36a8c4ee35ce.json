{"title":"The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter,Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1918/v1","date":1724752236000,"content":"In  the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting  them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on  the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of  ({\\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of  such {\\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\\bf qgcs} in inflationary  cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1d99fd6d327394c0fbde3675db6485e5fc1a3c3f6c38f208e3f36a8c4ee35ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
