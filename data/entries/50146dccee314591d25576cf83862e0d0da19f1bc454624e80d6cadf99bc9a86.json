{"title":"Improving the Decision-Making for Sustainable Demolition Waste Management by Combining a BIM-Based Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment Framework and Hybrid MCDA Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0843/v1","date":1723528167000,"content":"Increasing efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainable demolition waste management (DWM) from a life cycle-thinking perspective. To this end, facilitating sustainability-oriented de-cision-making for DWM planning requires a sustainability assessment framework for assessing multifaceted criteria. This study develops a BIM-based DWM sustainability assessment ap-proach to facilitate the life cycle assessment (LCA) and decision-making by coupling the enriched IFC model with hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Aiding (MCDA) methods using Dynamo visual scripting. To streamline the data-intensive LCA process, this study enriched the BIM properties and accommodated them into the LCA data template to enhance data interoperability, thus achieving seamless data transfer. Moreover, hybrid MCDA methods are integrated into the deci-sion-making workflow for DWM scenario ranking. A pilot study is employed to verify the ap-plicability of the decision-aiding framework. The results unveil that the sustainability score ascended with the recycling rate. The optimal DWM alternative with the highest recycling rate yields the highest sustainability score at 91.63. Conversely, a DWM alternative reflecting the ‘status quo’ in China’s recycling industry has the lowest score at 8.37, significantly lower than the baseline scenario with a 50% recycling rate. It is worth noting that the ‘growth curve’ of the sustainability score continuously flattens as the target recycling rate escalates. The increment in recycling rate from the “Australian standard” scenario to the optimal scenario is 18.4%, while the sustainability score merely increases by 2.3%, signal-ling that the former scenario arrived at an optimum point for maximising the cost-efficiency of DWM under the predefined framework and contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50146dccee314591d25576cf83862e0d0da19f1bc454624e80d6cadf99bc9a86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
