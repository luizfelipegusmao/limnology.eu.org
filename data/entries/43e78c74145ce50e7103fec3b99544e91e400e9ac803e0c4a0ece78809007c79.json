{"title":"Entropy Generation Analysis for Combustible Third Grade Fluid Flow through a Slant Channel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0854/v1","date":1718195716000,"content":"This paper addresses the mixed convective flow and heat transfer in combustible third grade fluid through a slant channel that is filled with a permeable materials. The fluid layer in contact with the lower plate is exposed to convective heating with the ambient while at the upper plate, a constant heat flux is experienced. We employ the spectral quasilinearisation method (SQLM) to the coupled nonlinear flow governing equations. Fluid velocity and temperature profiles, local entropy generation and irreversibility ratio are computed and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. A residual error analysis demonstrated high accuracy and convergence of the numerical method. The results on flow and thermal effects, entropy generation rate and Bejan number revealed fascinating manifestations that have profound implications in design of thermo-mechanical systems. In particular, the results of the thermal analysis are pertinent to optimal designs of systems that achieve efficient energy utilization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43e78c74145ce50e7103fec3b99544e91e400e9ac803e0c4a0ece78809007c79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
