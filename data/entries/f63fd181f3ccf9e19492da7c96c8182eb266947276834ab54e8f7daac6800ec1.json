{"title":"Copula-Based Risk Aggregation and the Significance of Reinsurance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0743/v1","date":1728548363000,"content":"Insurance companies need to calculate solvency capital requirements in order to ensure that they can meet their future obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries. The solvency capital requirement is a risk management tool essential for, when extreme catastrophic events occur, resulting in a high number of possibly interdependent claims. This paper studies the problem of aggregating the risks coming from several insurance business lines and analyses the effect of reinsurance in the level of risk. Our starting point is to use a Hierarchical Risk Aggregation method, which was initially based on 2-dimensional elliptical copulas. We then propose the use of copulas from the Archimedean family and a mixture of different copulas. Our results show that a mixture of copulas can provide a better fit to the data than an individual copula and consequently avoid over or underestimating of the capital requirement of an insurance company. We also investigate the significance of reinsurance in reducing the insurance companyâ€™s business risk and its effect on diversification. The results show that reinsurance does not always reduce the level of risk, but can also reduce the effect of diversification for insurance companies with multiple business lines","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f63fd181f3ccf9e19492da7c96c8182eb266947276834ab54e8f7daac6800ec1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
