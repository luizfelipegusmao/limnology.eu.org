{"title":"Adaptive-CAPTCHA: A Text CAPTCHA Solver based on CRNN and Configurable Filter Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1050/v1","date":1713258103000,"content":"Text-based CAPTCHA remains the most widely adopted security scheme, which is the first barrier to securing websites. Deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the mainstream approach for text-CAPTCHA recognition, which are widely used in CAPTCHA vulnerability assessment and data collection. However, verification code recognizers are mostly deployed on the CPU platform as part of a web crawler and security assessment, they are required to have both low complexity and high recognition accuracy. Due to the specifically designed anti-attack mechanisms like noise, interference, geometric deformation, twisting, rotation, and character adhesion in text CAPTCHAs, some characters are difficult to efficiently identify with high accuracy in these complex CAPTCHA images. This paper proposed a recognition model named Adaptive-CAPTCHA with a CRNN module and trainable and configurable filtering networks, which effectively handle the interference and learn the correlation between characters in CAPTCHAs to enhance recognition accuracy. Experimental results on two datasets of different complexity show that compared with the baseline model Deep-CAPTCHA, the number of parameters of our proposed model is reduced by about 70% and the recognition accuracy is improved by more than 10 percentage points in the two datasets. In addition, the proposed model has a faster training convergence speed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bd5e72f9445b668efcfaabec1c8b3a1f1428837306ff9fe78468b4826f518cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
