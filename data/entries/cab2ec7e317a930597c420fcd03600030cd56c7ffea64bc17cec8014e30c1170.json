{"title":"Bacterial Diversity, Metabolic Profiling and Application Potential of Antarctic Soil Metagenomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1550/v1","date":1721378251000,"content":"Antarctica has attracted increasing interest in understanding its microbial communities, metabolic potential, and as a source of microbial hydrolytic enzymes with industrial applications, for which advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have greatly facilitated the study of unculturable microorganisms. In this work, soils from seven sub-Antarctic islands and Union Glacier were studied using a whole-genome shotgun metagenomic approach. The main findings were that the microbial community at all sites was predominantly composed of the bacterial phyla Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and the families Streptomycetaceae and Pseudonocardiaceae. Regarding the xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism pathway, genes associated with benzoate, chloroalkane, chloroalkene, and styrene degradation were predominant. In addition, putative genes encoding industrial enzymes with predicted structural properties associated with improved activity at low temperatures were found, with catalases and malto-oligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase being the most abundant. Overall, our results show similarities between soils from different Antarctic sites with respect to more abundant bacteria and metabolic pathways, especially at higher classification levels, regardless of their geographic location. Furthermore, our results strengthen the potential of Antarctic soils as a source of industrially relevant enzymes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cab2ec7e317a930597c420fcd03600030cd56c7ffea64bc17cec8014e30c1170","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
