{"title":"City-scale Air Quality Network of Low-cost Sensors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0654/v1","date":1715333965000,"content":"In this paper we present a city-scale (possibly global) air pollution network made of low-cost sensors for particulate matter concentration in the air. The components of presented system are based on our research and experience from previous studies focused on air quality instruments and sensors for addressing urban air pollution. Sensor nodes are produced locally and distributed over a city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The system collects, calibrates and displays particulate metal concentrations in real-time. In comparison to the available measurements from governmental institutions, our system demonstrated good agreement of measured parameters, with several advantages including: higher resolution in space and time, lower costs, both horizontal and vertical measurements and many more. One of the capabilities of the system is the real-time air pollution city map with animations. By installing multiple sensor nodes over a slope (cable car), we receive vertical measurements of temperature, humidity and particulate matter concentration in real time, which gives a valuable insight into the dynamics of temperature inversion episodes and air pollution below the inversion layer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4aba2c6a777b6598fe8c4aec2a556f742d7f9a69215e5bbed9315f2fa8145fea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
