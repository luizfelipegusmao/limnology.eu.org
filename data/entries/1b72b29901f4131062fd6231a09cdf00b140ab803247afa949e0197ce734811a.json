In particular, we show why the HTC model is a strong competitor to the Λ-CDM model. For example, HTC appears to resolve the Hubble tension by making use of newly-discovered fundamental relationships between the CMB temperature, the Hubble parameter, and cosmological redshift. Moreover, HTC appears to better explain certain early universe telescopic observations than the Λ-CDM model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b72b29901f4131062fd6231a09cdf00b140ab803247afa949e0197ce734811a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
