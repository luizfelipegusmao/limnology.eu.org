There has been a consistent effort to promote the household biogas system by the Government of India. Despite such need and effort, the growth of household biogas system in India is not encouraging. Further, the need for appropriate management services for hassle-free operation and maintenance of household biogas system is also analyzed based on field survey conducted in three villages. Cow dung is the primary feedstock and its abundant availability results in a higher level of adoption of household biogas plants in one of the villages. Alternative feedstocks can adequately supplement cow dung to support the household biogas system in the remaining two villages. Though the higher capital cost of the biogas system is a distracting factor, biogas as a cooking fuel is cheaper than both LPG and fuelwood while considering long-term analysis. Thus, the continuation of subsidy on household biogas plant is justified considering the issue of affordability to bear capital cost even though for long-term use non-subsidized option is also profitable. The non-availability of own feedstock is a critical issue which influences the economy of biogas users and hence the motivation. Analysis also revealed that the undesirable performance of household biogas system is mostly linked with the absence of proper diagnosis. Chronical poor performance is attributed to one or more factors related to feedstock, microbial activities, and climatic parameters which remain unknown to the users and lead to their diminishing interest. Technology-integrated management support is expected to revive the interest in household biogas system in rural India.</p>","author":"Trinakshee Sarmah, \nDebendra Chandra Baruah","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"fb2b81f22893100741f0e643e94b894dfd3d382646f63f89dfeb86ba365e697c","category":"Environment"}
