{"title":"Physicochemical Characterization of Broiler Poultry Litter from Commercial Broiler Poultry Operation in Semiarid Tropics of India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1343/v1","date":1724066544000,"content":"This study aimed to characterize the physicochemical properties of broiler poultry litter (BPL) produced from intensively reared commercial broiler farming areas in tropical zone of Tamil Nadu, India. The BPL samples were collected from 110 commercial poultry farms at the end of the production cycle (6th week), further 20 samples were collected from the point of utility.  The dry matter (DM), moisture, ash, organic matter (OM), and organic carbon (OC) from the manure samples were  83.04 ± 0.77, 16.96 ± 0.77, 27.08 ± 1.18, 72.92 ± 1.18 and 42.39 ± 0.69 per cent respectively. The pH, Electrical conductivity (EC) (ds m-1), and Kjeldahl Nitrogen (N) were 8.43 ± 0.06, 5.74 ± 0.13, and 24.2 ± 0.84 g kg-1 respectively.  The BPL from the cement floor had higher levels of P and K (12.74  and 13.28 ) than the mud floor (10.88  and 10.96). According to the findings of this study, BPL as such at the end of the production cycle is rich in OM, nitrogen, macro and micro minerals at the same time at the point of utility there was a loss of OM, N, and concentration of minerals was noticed, which advocate proper storage and composting process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5495eb42a69a419376bdc2f1562b4e5fe066b71d43dbe96da3e226f06bd17b02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
