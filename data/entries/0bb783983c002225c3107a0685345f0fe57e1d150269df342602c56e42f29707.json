{"title":"Biochar Filtration Systems for Improvement in Wastewater Quality for Irrigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2429/v1","date":1727702894000,"content":"Re-purposing wastewater is necessary to circumvent water shortage for vegetable farmers in urban areas and to reduce public health hazards associated with using contaminated water for irrigation. In this study, the efficiency of biochar filtration systems in removing contaminants from wastewater was investigated. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the cleaning mechanism of coconut biochar filtration systems were examined. The filtration systems were designed with biowastes, specifically coconut biochar, as an adsorbent to remove pollutants from wastewater. Two setups of bed, 40 cm and 30 cm thick, were examined under different HRTs. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging were used to ascertain the properties of the biochar that enhances the removal of pollutants in wastewater. For both setups, the removal of heavy metals (Lead, Pb and copper, Cu) as well as Total Coliform (TC) was judged satisfactory but appeared ineffective in removing E. coli.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0bb783983c002225c3107a0685345f0fe57e1d150269df342602c56e42f29707","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
