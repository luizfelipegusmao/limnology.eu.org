{"title":"Ethylene inhibits photosynthesis via temporally distinct responses in tomato plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/762/7499160?rss=1","date":1703548800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ethylene is a volatile plant hormone that regulates many developmental processes and responses toward (a)biotic stress. Studies have shown that high levels of ethylene repress vegetative growth in many important crops, including tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>), possibly by inhibiting photosynthesis. We investigated the temporal effects of ethylene on young tomato plants using an automated ethylene gassing system to monitor the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses through time course RNA-seq of a photosynthetically active source leaf. We found that ethylene evokes a dose-dependent inhibition of photosynthesis, which can be characterized by 3 temporally distinct phases. The earliest ethylene responses that marked the first phase and occurred a few hours after the start of the treatment were leaf epinasty and a decline in stomatal conductance, which led to lower light perception and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, respectively, resulting in a rapid decline of soluble sugar levels (glucose, fructose). The second phase of the ethylene effect was marked by low carbohydrate availability, which modulated plant energy metabolism to adapt by using alternative substrates (lipids and proteins) to fuel the TCA cycle. Long-term continuous exposure to ethylene led to the third phase, characterized by starch and chlorophyll breakdown, which further inhibited photosynthesis, leading to premature leaf senescence. To reveal early (3â€…h) ethylene-dependent regulators of photosynthesis, we performed a ChIP-seq experiment using anti-ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-like 1 (EIL1) antibodies and found several candidate transcriptional regulators. Collectively, our study revealed a temporal sequence of events that led to the inhibition of photosynthesis by ethylene and identified potential transcriptional regulators responsible for this regulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5e50a366296af6531150f3bf67af39d0986518ecdada83300fc648042c6cef94","category":"Environment"}
