{"title":"Evaluation of Patient Experience in a Private Hospital in Costa Rica: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0724/v1","date":1720591332000,"content":"Patient experience is key to patient-centered care and overall healthcare quality.  This focus aligns with the growing trend of collaborative care, where patients actively participate in deci-sions alongside providers, leading to better outcomes. Patient experience goes beyond clinical results; it encompasses how patients feel throughout the care journey. Integrating patient per-spectives is essential for high-quality care. The study employed a multicenter, cross-sectional survey design utilizing a questionnaire-based approach. The data collection spanned two loca-tions within the Hospital Clínica Bíblica: San José, and Santa Ana, Costa Rica. The survey target-ed patients receiving treatment across the emergency department, surgery service, and inpatient department. A standardized Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire-33 (PPE-33) was adminis-tered to assess patients' overall experience with received services. A total of 390 questionnaires were analyzed. The participant demographics were as follows: 61.79% female, 56.15% aged be-tween 18 and 44, and 55.67% with undergraduate education. The hospital delivered high-quality service, with strong communication and accessibility (93.7%, 92.6%, and 94.4% positive respec-tively). Improvements are needed in patient rights education (22.7% positive), information about the patient's condition (74.3% positive), discharge instructions (36.5% and 71.4% positive for side effects and warning signs respectively) and addressing patient concerns (26.3% to 44.0%). Patients appreciated their privacy (95.2%), effective pain management (96.2%), respectful com-munication (97.0% and 94.8%), and overall respectful treatment. Satisfaction was influenced by factors like patient needs prioritization, rights communication, sociodemographic, health status, and comfort. The ward of admission had no significant impact on the experience. Enhancing pa-tient experience could boost loyalty and healthcare quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ba7d0c83ab3a713a5b2520f3285b21a275366f5fe2ef65a8ec05dc94e265382","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
