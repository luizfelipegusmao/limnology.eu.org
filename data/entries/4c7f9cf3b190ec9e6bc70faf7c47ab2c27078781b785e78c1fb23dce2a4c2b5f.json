{"title":"Disordered Peptide-Based Design of Intrinsically Disordered Polymers for Biomedical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0414/v1","date":1728280300000,"content":"In biology and medicine, synthetic polymers that mimic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibiting remarkable structural and conformational flexibility due to their lack of stable three-dimensional structures are highly desirable. This conformational flexibility facilitates self-organization, making such polymers highly useful for various biomedical applications. Specifically, intrinsically disordered synthetic polymers show great potential in drug delivery systems, organ transplantation, artificial organ design, and ensuring immune compatibility. There is a pressing need for new synthesis and characterization techniques to develop these polymers which are modeled after intrinsically disordered proteins and can be used for various biomedical purposes. In this paper, we outline our strategies for designing intrinsically disordered synthetic polymers for biomedical applications. These design approaches are inspired by the properties of intrinsically disordered proteins and use of disorder promoting oligopeptides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c7f9cf3b190ec9e6bc70faf7c47ab2c27078781b785e78c1fb23dce2a4c2b5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
