{"title":"Living the Way: An Ethical Approach Towards Cross-Cultural Reading in Our Local and Global Contexts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0280/v1","date":1717585042000,"content":"The early Church had an incredible encounter with the resurrected Christ. Being living witnesses, Christ’s followers spread the Gospel in the world through the power of the Holy Spirit. This piece argued that the Bible contains methodologies used by the Apostles who laid down their lives for the sake of the message of the Cross. Furthermore, it has been contested in this study that the emphasis today has shifted to personal theological agendas of reading the Bible for intellectual preferences. As a result of Christianity’s current emphasis on dogmatic beliefs, various unbiblical approaches to reading the Bible have emerged that ignore the ethical reading of the Bible. This study has reinvestigated the reasons to apply this approach in our modern era to live the Bible rather than any other approach. And one among them is the Enlightenment era which distorted the relationship between ethics and theology (Perry 46). Apart from the above, this study also revealed that many Bible believers have twisted biblical truths because they focus on their convictions. As a result, many strategies fail to provide sound biblical teachings to understand any particular event in the light of the original message of the Bible to reflect upon our situation today. \n\tTherefore, in light of the above, on the one hand, the approach of the early Church Fathers is used to reimagine contemporary challenges from this perspective. On the other hand, even though thousands of books have been written on various methodologies to study the Bible, the core concern to critique these current approaches is not personal or denominational, religion-based but rather 'invitational and servational' to live with these biblical beliefs to reorient an ethical approach towards cross-cultural reading in our local and global contexts addressing the problems (injustice and marginalization) and responding to the contemporary challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b36b576743f252db454a6231113f1ed94c7553d31f7d8b6ccd150c8b61949f1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
