{"title":"Biosynthesis of vitamin B3 and NAD+: incubating HepG2 cells with the alkaloid myosmine","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13513?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In the kynurenine pathway, it is reported that the essential amino acid tryptophan forms nicotinic acid (NA, vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) in biological systems. This pathway is part of the <i>de novo</i> pathway to perform nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) biosynthesis. Additionally, biosynthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> via the Preiss–Handler pathway involves NA and its analogue nicotinamide, both designated as niacin. Previous attempts were successful in converting myosmine (MYO) by organic synthesis to NA, and the assumption was that the alkaloid MYO, which is taken in from food, can be converted into NA by biological oxidation.</p>\n<h2>RESULT</h2>\n<p>Incubation of HepG2 cells with MYO yielded NA. Moreover, a significant increase of NAD<sup>+</sup> compared with the control has been found.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Hence, MYO could be assumed to be the hitherto unknown origin of an alternative NA biosynthesis additionally influencing NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis positively. This novel MYO pathway may open new perspectives to improve knowledge and relevance of NA and NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis and bioactivation in cells and, moreover, in food staples, food, and diet. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wolfgang Zwickenpflug, \nFlorian Hornung, \nAlexandra Hollaus, \nMichaela S.
