{"title":"A Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm in Cloud-Based Additive Manufacturing; an Approach to Using Critical Chain Buffer Management Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1569/v1","date":1713928627000,"content":"In the past few years, cloud-based additive manufacturing has shown its application and potential in industries. For this reason, when the demand for cloud-based additive products increases, efficient scheduling of related tasks becomes more important to achieve optimized duration. This research proposes a Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm (HSA) for use in Cloud-Based Additive Manufacturing (CBAM) with an approach to Critical Chain Buffer Management (CC/BM). This research aims to schedule and optimize the time in cloud-based additive manufacturing, in addition to the parts production process, it also includes the steps of receiving online orders and informing the manufacturing unit and sending them to the customer. The HSA proposed in this research consists of three phases 1- Buffer sizing, 2- Additive manufacturing and logistics scheduling, and 3- Buffer controlling. To evaluate, the performance of the algorithm is simulated. The finding shows that the proposed HAS can effectively solve the CBAM scheduling problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b529c8eb040cd9a52d49d835434505049eb80505da346f5e8b74f833f96ac044","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
