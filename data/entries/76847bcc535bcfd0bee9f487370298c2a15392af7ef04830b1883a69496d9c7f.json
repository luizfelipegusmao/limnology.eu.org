{"title":"Complete plastid genome of <i>Iris orchioides</i> and comparative analysis with 19 <i>Iris</i> plastomes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301346","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Tae-Young Choi, Soo-Rang Lee</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Iris</i> is a cosmopolitan genus comprising approximately 280 species distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Although <i>Iris</i> is the most diverse group in the Iridaceae, the number of taxa is debatable owing to various taxonomic issues. Plastid genomes have been widely used for phylogenetic research in plants; however, only limited number of plastid DNA markers are available for phylogenetic study of the <i>Iris</i>. To understand the genomic features of plastids within the genus, including its structural and genetic variation, we newly sequenced and analyzed the complete plastid genome of <i>I</i>. <i>orchioides</i> and compared it with those of 19 other <i>Iris</i> taxa. Potential plastid markers for phylogenetic research were identified by computing the sequence divergence and phylogenetic informativeness. We then tested the utility of the markers with the phylogenies inferred from the markers and whole-plastome data. The average size of the plastid genome was 152,926 bp, and the overall genomic content and organization were nearly identical among the 20 <i>Iris</i> taxa, except for minor variations in the inverted repeats. We identified 10 highly informative regions (<i>matK</i>, <i>ndhF</i>, <i>rpoC2</i>, <i>ycf1</i>, <i>ycf2</i>, <i>rps15-ycf</i>, <i>rpoB-trnC</i>, <i>petA-psbJ</i>, <i>ndhG-ndhI</i> and <i>psbK-trnQ</i>) and inferred a phylogeny from each region individually, as well as from their concatenated data. Remarkably, the phylogeny reconstructed from the concatenated data comprising three selected regions (<i>rpoC2</i>, <i>ycf1</i> and <i>ycf2</i>) exhibited the highest congruence with the phylogeny derived from the entire plastome dataset. The result suggests that this subset of data could serve as a viable alternative to the complete plastome data, especially for molecular diagnoses among closely related <i>Iris</i> taxa, and at a lower cost.","author":"Tae-Young Choi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"76847bcc535bcfd0bee9f487370298c2a15392af7ef04830b1883a69496d9c7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
