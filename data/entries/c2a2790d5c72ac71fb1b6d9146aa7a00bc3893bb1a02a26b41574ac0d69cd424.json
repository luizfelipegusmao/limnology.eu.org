{"title":"Self-Organizing Systems: What, How, and Why?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0549/v1","date":1723112575000,"content":"I present a personal account of self-organizing systems. As such, it is necessarily biased and partial. Nevertheless, it should be useful to motivate useful discussions. The relevant contribution is not my attempts at answering questions (maybe all my answers are wrong), but the steps towards framing relevant questions to better understand self-organization, information, complexity, and emergence. With this aim, I start with a notion and examples of self-organizing systems (what?), continue with their properties and related concepts (how?), and close with applications (why?).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2a2790d5c72ac71fb1b6d9146aa7a00bc3893bb1a02a26b41574ac0d69cd424","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
