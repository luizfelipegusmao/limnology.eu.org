Although there is growing enthusiasm for these methods, there are barriers to starting. First, these methods require expensive equipment; second, there is a steep learning curve for newcomers to the field, especially since there are not experts available at every institution; third, there are only inadequate and dispersed learning materials for beginners. Access to equipment and expertise has been made available through the establishment of national cryo-EM and cryo-ET centers [<a href=\"#ozae044.441-B1\">1</a>], which accept trainees of all experience levels and has already boosted the use of the method. To address the gap in training and the remaining limitations, we have designed a media-rich and user-friendly approach in the form of a self-paced, interactive online course that emphasizes practical training for cryo-EM and cryo-ET novices [<a href=\"#ozae044.441-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cded95789d05b5841ba66eab12b5e045abdb9eccc38445f2109de3dbd8766cc8","category":"Environment"}
