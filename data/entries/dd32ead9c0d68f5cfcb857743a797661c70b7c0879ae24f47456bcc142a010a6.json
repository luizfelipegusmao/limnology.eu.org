The research methodology is a nature-oriented housing policy to promote renewable energy consumption in homes for cleaner environments. This study analyzes the structural elements of traditional homes in the eastern south of Iran. This study examines the UN SDGs in planning and designing the model to find the advantages of nature-oriented constructions compared to the current harmful development projects damaging nature, environments, ecosystems, and the earth. The building model presented in this paper is in harmony with the UN SDGs. The model provides an architectural and planning procedure to prevent the earth from damaging fossil consumption-built environments in the world. Calculations show that the housing pilot model saves USD 3600 in energy consumption per household on average. The outcomes of this study prove the hypothesis that the use of renewable energy in homes is beneficial economically and environmentally. This study implicates housing policies in shifting planning and design methods toward UN SDGs. Policies are applicable globally in the housing programs.</p>","author":"Abdol Aziz Shahraki, \nHossein Mollashahi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"dd32ead9c0d68f5cfcb857743a797661c70b7c0879ae24f47456bcc142a010a6","category":"Environment"}
