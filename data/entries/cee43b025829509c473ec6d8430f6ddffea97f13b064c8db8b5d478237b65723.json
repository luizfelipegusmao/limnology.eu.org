{"title":"Silybum marianum Extract: A Highly Effective Natural Alternative to Retinoids to Prevent Skin Ageing without Side Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1941/v1","date":1714459703000,"content":"Vitamin A, or retinol, is one of the most effective anti-ageing molecules, but it presents issues with photo-sensitivity and irritation. Retinol-like alternatives are emerging, but have so far been less effective. Here, we present a Silibum marianum extract (SME) as a retinol-like ingredient providing both safety and efficacy. SME was compared to the reference compound, retinol, and to the main alternative, bakuchiol. In ex vivo tests, skin explants from a 58-year-old donor were treated with pure retinol (0.1%), bakuchiol (0.2%) or SME (0.8%). After 5 days, collagen and hyaluronic acid levels were analysed. A placebo-controlled study involving 57 volunteers (ages 45-73 years) was also conducted, with products applied twice-daily for 56 days. Results were measured by AEVA-HE and VISA. Levels of collagen III were significantly increased by SME, by 23% and 16% compared to bakuchiol and retinol, respectively. Compared to bakuchiol, SME treatment increased hyaluronic acid production by 36%. In clinical tests, SME had a significantly stronger anti-wrinkle effect than bakuchiol – reducing the number of wrinkles on the forehead by 21%, and their circumference by 17% – producing effects similar to retinol, and better than bakuchiol. In the self-assessment, 43% of volunteers reported discomfort while using retinol, as compared to 0% for the SME formulation. By enhancing levels of collagen III – the youth collagen – and hyaluronic acid in the skin, SME paves the way for the maturation of collagen I fibrils and skin plumping. With its stronger efficacy compared to bakuchiol and enhanced safety profile compared to retinol, SME may be the next-generation of natural alternatives to retinoids.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cee43b025829509c473ec6d8430f6ddffea97f13b064c8db8b5d478237b65723","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
