{"title":"Association of smoking cessation with airflow obstruction in workers with silicosis: A cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303743","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Shuyuan Yang, Chi Kuen Chan, Maggie Haitian Wang, Chi Chiu Leung, Lai Bun Tai, Lap Ah Tse</p>\r\nBackground <p>Studies in general population reported a positive association between tobacco smoking and airflow obstruction (AFO), a hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, this attempt was less addressed in silica dust-exposed workers.</p> Methods <p>This retrospective cohort study consisted of 4481 silicotic workers attending the Pneumoconiosis Clinic during 1981–2019. The lifelong work history and smoking habits of these workers were extracted from medical records. Spirometry was carried out at the diagnosis of silicosis (n = 4177) and reperformed after an average of 9.4 years of follow-up (n = 2648). AFO was defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/force vital capacity (FVC) less than lower limit of normal (LLN). The association of AFO with smoking status was determined using multivariate logistics regression, and the effect of smoking cessation on the development of AFO was evaluated Cox regression.</p> Results <p>Smoking was significantly associated with AFO (current smokers: OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.51–2.44; former smokers: OR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.65–2.66). The risk of AFO significantly increased in the first 3 years of quitting smoking (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.02–1.47) but decreased afterwards with increasing years of cessation. Smoking cessation reduced the risk of developing AFO no matter before or after the confirmation of silicosis (pre-silicosis cessation: HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.74; post-silicosis cessation: HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.48–0.79).</p> Conclusions <p>Smoking cessation significantly reduced the risk of AFO in the workers with silicosis, although the health benefit was not observed until 3 years of abstinence. These findings highlight the importance of early and long-term smoking cessation among silicotic or silica dust-exposed workers.</p>","author":"Shuyuan Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"89d743558b608e7120d1e55655f9a653ad0eeee5955a61b5f1d7a9b63d31b904","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
