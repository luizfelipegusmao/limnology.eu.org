{"title":"Analyzing the Influence of Speed and Jumping Performance Metrics on Percentage Change of Direction Deficit in Adolescent Female Soccer Players","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1089/v1","date":1710828291000,"content":"Studies show that although female soccer players often have shorter change of direction (COD) deficits than males, indicating different biomechanical profiles, there is lack of research on the impact of physical metrics on COD performance in females. The aim of this study was to analyze whether performance metrics based on speed, and jumping could explain the variation in %CODD in young female soccer players. Thirty-three highly trained adolescent female soccer players (age: 16. ± 0.95 years; height: 160.4 ± 5.22 cm; body mass: 55.7 ± 7.22 kg) performed COD180 tests, 10-m and 30-m sprint test and single leg countermovement and horizontal jumps. Acceleration in the first 10 meters of a sprint was identified as a significant predictor of COD180 performance (R2 = 28%), (R2 = 50%), (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22acc2b9e2ff017ac3e7ea34d096951d76585455cc406b45b3b604b9cc23b991","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
