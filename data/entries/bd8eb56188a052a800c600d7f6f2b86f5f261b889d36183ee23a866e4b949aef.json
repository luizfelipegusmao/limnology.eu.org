{"title":"Chronosequence and Temporal Changes in Soil Traits, Vegetation Structure and Leaf Traits in a Tropical Dry Forest in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1237/v1","date":1723811468000,"content":"The structure and diversity of tropical vegetation are shaped by biotic and abiotic factors, which function as environmental filters affecting plant performance in different spatial and temporal scales. We compared soil traits, vegetation structure and leaf traits (i.e., specific leaf area, polyphenols and chlorophyll content a/b and total) in early, intermediate and late successional stages of a tropical dry forests in southeastern Brazil. For this purpose, we measured leaf traits of the most abundant species in the same 18 plots (50 x 20m/ six per successional stage) in 2009 and 2018.  We tested whether tree species growing in early forests have a greater investment in conservative traits related to chemical defenses and tolerance to desiccation compared to late-stage tree species. We observed contrasting results when comparing the chronosequence differences in leaf traits both in 2009 and 2018 and the temporal changes along this period. Specific leaf area was lower than expected for all successional stages while polyphenol content increased along time, contrary to other studies in tropical dry forests. These results suggest that contrasting environmental conditions such as soil water holding capacity and light availability are responsible of the observed pattern. Total chlorophyll content increase lightly, while the a/b chlorophyll ratio doubled in all successional stages, contrary to our hypothesis. Therefore, we suggest that the conservative-acquisitive spectrum in successional gradients of TDFs should be further investigated for a better understanding of plant community assemblages.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd8eb56188a052a800c600d7f6f2b86f5f261b889d36183ee23a866e4b949aef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
