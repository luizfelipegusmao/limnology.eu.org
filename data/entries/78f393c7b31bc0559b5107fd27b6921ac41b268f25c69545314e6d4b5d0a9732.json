{"title":"White stork Ciconia ciconia nests as an attractant to birds and bats","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10336-023-02143-y","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>White storks (<em>Ciconia ciconia</em>), an emblematic bird of high conservation interest, build massive nests which are also important breeding sites for other birds. However, their role as a potential source of food for foraging birds and bats is unexplored. In this study, we counted insectivorous aerially foraging birds (swallows, martins, and swifts), sparrows, and bats foraging around 51 pairs of white storksâ€™ nest and control sites in Poland. The number of birds was significantly higher near active white stork nests than control sites, but this effect was invisible for bats. White storks provide important benefits to the conservation of co-occurring species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"78f393c7b31bc0559b5107fd27b6921ac41b268f25c69545314e6d4b5d0a9732","category":"Environment"}
