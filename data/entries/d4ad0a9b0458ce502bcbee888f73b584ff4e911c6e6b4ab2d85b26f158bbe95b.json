{"title":"Progress in Transcriptomics and Metabolomics in Plant Responses to Abiotic Stresses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1340/v1","date":1718789326000,"content":"Abiotic stress is a significant factor restricting the normal growth and development of plants. Under abiotic stress, plants maintain their life and continuous growth by reconfiguring transcriptional regulation and metabolic networks. In recent years, with the development of sequencing technology and mass spectrometry technology, transcriptomics and metabolomics have emerged as new disciplines following genomics and proteomics, which are conducive to identifying metabolites and regulatory genes in plants under abiotic stress. In this review, we mainly analyzes the technical characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of transcriptomics and metabolomics, focusing on reviewing the research progress in the field of plant responses to abiotic stress (temperature stress, salt stress, water stress, and heavy metal stress) using transcriptomics and metabolomics both domestically and internationally in recent years. It also provides a prospective view on current issues, which helps accelerate the understanding of the mechanisms of plant responses to abiotic stress and provides new ideas for breeding stress-resistant varieties in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4ad0a9b0458ce502bcbee888f73b584ff4e911c6e6b4ab2d85b26f158bbe95b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
