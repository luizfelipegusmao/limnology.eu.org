{"title":"DETF-Net: Retinal Vessel Segmentation Network Based on Detail Feature Enhancement and Dynamic Temporal Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1222/v1","date":1729016985000,"content":"Fundus vascular images are essential for diagnosing various ophthalmic diseases. With deep learning and image processing development, fundus image segmentation methods based on computer vision have become more common. However, the UNet model faces challenges such as the loss of spatial resolution during downsampling and difficulties in simultaneously capturing global context and local details, especially for small objects and complex boundaries. We propose the Detail Enhanced Temporal Fusion Network (DETF-Net) to overcome these issues. This network incorporates a detail feature enhancement module (DFEM) to preserve boundary features and a dynamic temporal fusion module (DTFM) to improve robustness across different scales. The DFEM uses median pooling, spatial attention, and hybrid convolution to retain detail, while the DTFM extracts local and global features and adapts to dynamic changes in blood vessel structures. Evaluation on DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE datasets shows that DETF-Net achieves accuracy of 0.9865, 0.9877, and 0.9878, and specificity of 0.9865, 0.9870, and 0.9875, respectively, outperforming existing models. These results demonstrate DETF-Net's effectiveness in fundus image segmentation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4da2b4efc24cb75dc82644545e39a2d993b9b1acdad7f09899218c8010c5c84f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
