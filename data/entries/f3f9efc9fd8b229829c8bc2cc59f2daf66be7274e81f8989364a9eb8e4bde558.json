{"title":"Oxygen consumption rate during recovery from loss of equilibrium induced by warming, hypoxia, or exhaustive exercise in rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15756?af=R","date":1712797689000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Animals routinely encounter environmental (e.g., high temperatures and hypoxia) as well as physiological perturbations (e.g., exercise and digestion) that may threaten homeostasis. However, comparing the relative threat or “disruptiveness” imposed by different stressors is difficult, as stressors vary in their mechanisms, effects, and timescales. We exploited the fact that several acute stressors can induce the loss of equilibrium (LOE) in fish to (i) compare the metabolic recovery profiles of three environmentally relevant stressors and (ii) test the concept that LOE could be used as a physiological calibration for the intensity of different stressors. We focused on <i>Etheostoma caeruleum</i>, a species that routinely copes with environmental fluctuations in temperature and oxygen and that relies on burst swimming to relocate and avoid predators, as our model. Using stop-flow (intermittent) respirometry, we tracked the oxygen consumption rate (MO<sub>2</sub>) as <i>E. caeruleum</i> recovered from LOE induced by hypoxia (PO<sub>2</sub> at LOE), warming (critical thermal maximum, CT<sub>max</sub>), or exhaustive exercise. Regardless of the stressor used, <i>E. caeruleum</i> recovered rapidly, returning to routine MO<sub>2</sub> within ~3 h. Fish recovering from hypoxia and warming had similar maximum MO<sub>2</sub>, aerobic scopes, recovery time, and total excess post-hypoxia or post-warming oxygen consumption. Though exhaustive exercise induced a greater maximum MO<sub>2</sub> and corresponding higher aerobic scope than warming or hypoxia, its recovery profile was otherwise similar to the other stressors, suggesting that “calibration” to a physiological state such as LOE may be a viable conceptual approach for investigators interested in questions related to multiple stressors, cross tolerance, and how animals cope with challenges to homeostasis.</p>","author":"Brittney G.
