Additionally, the thickness range of cryostat sections (2-10 micrometers) is compatible with efficient antibody penetration for immunohistochemistry applications. However, few laboratories have succeeded in routinely preparing cryostat sections with a quality high enough to be useful for immunogold electron microscopy, which requires both antigen preservation and acceptable ultrastructure and membrane contrast over wide imaging fields. The published efforts have mainly focused on a small range of cells or tissues and on sample preparation for TEM, which narrows the unobstructed field of view [<a href=\"#ozae044.404-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.404-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"018ea67ab9f790a567012712d1ac6c40e3617d93c4554c0d8ded5ddd865fbf5d","category":"Environment"}
