{"title":"Physiological Functions ofÂ Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferases","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/863/7272844?rss=1","date":1694563200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Triacylglycerol (TAG) is among the most energy dense storage forms of reduced carbon in living systems. TAG metabolism plays critical roles in cellular energy balance, lipid homeostasis, cell growth and stress responses. In higher plants, microalgae and fungi, TAG is assembled by acyl-CoA-dependent and acyl-CoA-independent pathways catalyzed by diacylglycerol (DAG) acyltransferase and phospholipid:DAG acyltransferase (PDAT), respectively. This review contains a summary of the current understanding of the physiological functions of PDATs. Emphasis is placed on their role in lipid remodeling and lipid homeostasis in response to abiotic stress or perturbations in lipid metabolism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"25b3741f968fcb2a30073096aed4aeedf603b3e2a4c69764ee6474f8893d82c5","category":"Environment"}
