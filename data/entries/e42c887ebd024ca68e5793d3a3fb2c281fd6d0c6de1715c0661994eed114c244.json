{"title":"A Study on Possibility of Detrimental Effects of Soil-Structure Interaction in Seismic Design Due to a Shift of System Frequency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0248/v1","date":1717568705000,"content":"Soil-structure interaction (SSI) leads to a modification of dynamic properties of a structure, but due to the complexity on analysis, it is traditionally assumed in seismic designs that the structure is fixed-supported at the ground, which unavoidably gives potential dangers to seismic performances of the structure. This study focuses on the possibility of the detrimental effects of SSI by comparing the dynamic responses of SSI system to fixed-base structure. The SSI model consists of an oscillator, a three-dimensional foundation and a multilayered half-space. In indirect boundary element method is employed, combined with non-singular Greenâ€™s functions of distributed loads to calculate the foundation impedances for substructure method. Although the SSI mechanism dampens peak amplitude of structure response in frequency domain, case studies on four buildings to 42 earthquakes in time history show a possibility of 15%-20% that SSI amplifies the dynamic responses, depending on the frequency component of incident waves. Also, a neural network algorithm is proposed to provide a new idea of involving SSI analysis into the traditional seismic designs, to eliminate potential hazards of SSI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e42c887ebd024ca68e5793d3a3fb2c281fd6d0c6de1715c0661994eed114c244","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
