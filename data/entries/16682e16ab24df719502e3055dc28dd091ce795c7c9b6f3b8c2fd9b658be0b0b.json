{"title":"In Silico Generation of Structural and Intermolecular Binding Affinity Data with Reasonable Accuracy: Expanding Horizons in Drug Discovery and Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1739/v1","date":1716799780000,"content":"In the domain of drug discovery and design, the acquisition of precise structural and intermolecular Kd data for biological molecules is paramount. However, conventional methods for obtaining such data are often beset by challenges including high costs, time intensiveness, and inherent limitations in scalability and diversity. This article puts forward a high-throughput approach for in silico generation of structural and intermolecular binding affinity (Kd) data, which keeps exploring the uncharted territories of drug discovery &amp; design by harnessing computational methodologies to synthetically generate diverse datasets. Through a meticulously designed workflow encompassing molecular structural modeling, structural biophysics-based calculations of intermolecular binding affinity (Kd), this innovative methodology transcends the constraints of traditional experimentation, offering a cost-effective, scalable, and efficient alternative. By simulating molecular interactions and binding interfaces and predicting binding affinities with reasonable accuracy, this approach not only expedites the drug development process but also enables the exploration of vast molecular space, thereby facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutics beyond conventional drug modality as a form factor. Moreover, the versatility of synthetic data extends beyond virtual screening and lead optimization, encompassing applications such as dataset augmentation, model validation, and benchmarking against experimental data. This article elucidates the conceptual underpinnings, methodological intricacies, validation strategies, and potential ramifications of in silico generated data, heralding a paradigm shift in drug discovery paradigms. By fostering synergy between computational and experimental research domains, this innovative approach promises to accelerate the pace of drug discovery, enhance the robustness of predictive models, and pave the way for transformative advancements in the entire pharmaceutical industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16682e16ab24df719502e3055dc28dd091ce795c7c9b6f3b8c2fd9b658be0b0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
