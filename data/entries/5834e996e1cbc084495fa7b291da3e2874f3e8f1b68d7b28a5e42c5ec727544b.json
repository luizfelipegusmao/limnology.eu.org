{"title":"Essence dynamics: Essence interactions, applications and Reality. Part I","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2057/v1","date":1724843520000,"content":"This paper delves into the intricate nature of the different essence interactions that shape our perceived reality, leveraging a blend of existing empirical data and original experiments. Through a multidisciplinary approach encompassing quantum mechanics, general physics, metaphysics, philosophy, and spiritualism, it seeks to elucidate the fundamental interplays governing phenomena such as gravity, mass, electromagnetism, force, motion, and quantum mechanics. This exploration promises a reexamination and unification of these principles, offering novel perspectives on the extraordinary phenomena that underpin our reality.\n\nBy comprehending and manipulating these interactions, the potential arises to orchestrate reality towards desired ends. This study not only unveils compelling avenues for scientific advancement but also proposes transformative technologies and concepts, including light-speed transportation, remote viewing, communication with the deceased, alchemy, and the realization of what is commonly perceived as magic. These visionary notions not only push the boundaries of current understanding but also provide a captivating glimpse into the future possibilities that may await humanity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5834e996e1cbc084495fa7b291da3e2874f3e8f1b68d7b28a5e42c5ec727544b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
