{"title":"Economic evaluation on meningococcal vaccination strategies among children under nine years of age in Zhejiang province, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310274","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Jianyong Shen, Chai Ji, Xiaofu Luo, Yu Hu</p>\r\n\r\nMeningococcal vaccination in Chinese national immunization program (NIP) includes polysaccharide vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MPV-A) and polysaccharide vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A and C(MPV-AC). This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of an alternative strategy using polysaccharide conjugate vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A,C,W,Y(MCV-ACWY) and polysaccharide vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A,C,W,Y(MPV-ACWY). From a societal perspective, we constructed a decision tree-Markov model to simulate the economic and health consequences of meningococcal disease in a 2023 birth cohort with the current meningococcal vaccination strategy and the alternative. Parameters of epidemiology, vaccine efficacy, cost, and utility were extracted from database and previous literatures. The sensitivity analysis was implemented to evaluate the robustness of the model. Compared to the current practice, the alternative strategy could avoid 513 meningococcal disease cases, 53 sequelae and 47 deaths. The ICER was estimated at $16899.81 /QALY, under the threshold of one time of the GDP per capita of Zhejiang province in 2023. The incidence of meningococcemia, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis, the case fatality of meningococcemia, the vaccine efficacy of MCV-ACWY and the price of MCV-ACWY would influence the cost-effectiveness of the meningococcal vaccination strategies. At the threshold, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 14.76% for the current strategy and 55.98% for the alternative strategy, respectively. The current meningococcal vaccination strategy had effectively prevented meningococcal disease at a low cost, but with limited serogroup coverage. Strategy using MCV-ACWY and MPV-ACWY could increase health benefits at a substantial cost at a cost-effective manner.","author":"Jianyong Shen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fbe1b7b6659783ff7660754e1fcbf7154d2c921ebc5be73bd1bfc32c07e5bba2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
