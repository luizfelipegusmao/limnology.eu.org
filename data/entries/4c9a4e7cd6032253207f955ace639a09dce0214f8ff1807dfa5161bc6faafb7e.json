{"title":"Effects of Enzymatic Hydrolysis Combined with Pressured Heating on Tree Nut Allergenicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0693/v1","date":1712737370000,"content":"Hazelnut, pistachio and cashew are tree nuts with health benefits but also with allergenic properties being prevalent food allergens in Europe. The allergic characteristics of these tree nuts after processing combining heat, pressure and enzymatic digestion were analyzed through in vitro (Western blot and ELISA) and in vivo test (Prick-Prick). In the analyzed population, the patients sensitized to Cor a 8 (nsLTP) were predominant over those sensitized against hazelnut seed storage proteins (Sprot, Cor a 9 and 14), which displayed higher IgE reactivity. The protease E5 effectively hydrolyzed proteins from hazelnut and pistachio, while E7 was efficient for cashew protein hydrolysis. When combined with pressured heating (autoclave and Controlled Instantaneous Depressurization (DIC)), these proteases notably reduced the allergenic reactivity. The combination of DIC treatment before enzymatic digestion resulted in the most effective methodology to drastically reduce or indeed eliminate the allergenic capacity of tree nuts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c9a4e7cd6032253207f955ace639a09dce0214f8ff1807dfa5161bc6faafb7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
