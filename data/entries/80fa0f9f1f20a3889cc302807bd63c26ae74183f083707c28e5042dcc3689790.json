{"title":"Regulatory mechanism of methyl jasmonate and methyl dihydrojasmonate in enhancing aroma in ‘Cabernet Gernischt’ via the lipoxygenase pathway","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13871?af=R","date":1725973173000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The present study explored the effects of pre-harvest methyl jasmonates spraying on the volatiles of ‘Cabernet Gernischt’ grapes through the lipoxygenase pathway. Headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were utilized to analyze volatile metabolites and key enzyme activities following methyl jasmonates application. Total RNA extraction and cDNA library construction were followed by transcriptome sequencing.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The application of 0.1 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> methyl jasmonate and 5 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> methyl dihydrojasmonate significantly increased the levels of C6 compounds in ‘Cabernet Gernischt’ berries, and also enhanced the utilization of unsaturated fatty acids as precursors in the lipoxygenase-hydroperoxides lyase pathway. The up-regulated expression of <i>VvADH1</i>, <i>VvADH2</i>, <i>VvHPL</i> and <i>VvLOX2S</i> genes led to modulations in enzyme activity, thereby enhancing the berries's aromatic profile. There was a significant correlation between linoleic and linolenic acids (i.e. the precursors of the lipoxygenase pathway) and the activities and metabolites of key enzymes.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The optimal concentration of methyl jasmonates treatment favorably influences the accumulation of green leaf volatiles in ‘Cabernet Gernischt’ grape. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wei Li, \nNan Ye, \nPeng Xie, \nZhen Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"80fa0f9f1f20a3889cc302807bd63c26ae74183f083707c28e5042dcc3689790","category":"Environment"}
