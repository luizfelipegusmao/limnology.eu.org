{"title":"Improving Red Bag Waste Management in a Surgical ICU: Results of a Targeted Educational Intervention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1433/v1","date":1729233520000,"content":"Healthcare waste presents a global environmental and public health issue, with the U.S. generating over 5 million pounds annually. Hospitals have initiated programs to reduce waste and enhance recycling, with encouraging outcomes. At our tertiary medical center, disparities in municipal waste disposal across departments led to targeted research in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). We evaluated the effectiveness of an educational intervention aimed at improving red bag waste management. Pre-intervention audits assessed waste sorting, followed by one-minute staff presentations and infographics near disposal bins. Post-intervention audits revealed a significant reduction in inappropriate municipal waste in red bag bins, analyzed using Fisherâ€™s exact test. Interviews suggested staff lacked recollection of prior red bag waste training, underscoring the value of continuous education. While effective, limitations included sample size and generalizability. Future studies should explore additional strategies to further improve waste disposal practices and address training gaps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bf41f8516db2b20ca91c26cc36ab1203759ddf0a324892bf308181d00c7b8da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
