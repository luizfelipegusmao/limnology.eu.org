{"title":"Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis as Tools for Studying the Variability of Abrus precatorius Germplasm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0157/v1","date":1719901016000,"content":"Abrus precatorius is a medicinal herb originated from Southeast Asia and native to India. The Hindustani centre of origin was found to possess lot of variability especially with respect to seed color. However, no previous researchers have focused on studying the variability by including the entire variability of the region. A total of 99 accessions were analyzed for its biochemical components like moisture content, total phenols, antioxidants, ash content, protein content, total monomeric anthocyanin and flavonols. Principal component analysis (PCA) shown that first three components viz., seed color, phenols and antioxidants are major principal components that contribute to 80.86% of total variability in the germplasm. The dendrogram constructed based on the biochemical data and by using the software Darwin version 6.0. formed three main clusters i.e. cluster 1, cluster 2 and cluster 3 which contain 55 accessions, 40 accessions and 1 accession respectively. Seed color was found to be the main criteria based on which the Abrus accessions were grouped. Accessions from different clusters also differ for their mean phytochemical constituents. Germplasm curators / plant breeders can select such elite genotypes and utilize them in crop improvement programmes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e561400ffee8e89f766f5ffe64eb89869b9e657ed5672354bd57a436bfdae109","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
