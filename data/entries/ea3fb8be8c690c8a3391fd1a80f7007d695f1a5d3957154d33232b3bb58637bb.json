{"title":"Correlation analysis between Radix Pseudostelariae quality and rhizosphere soil factors of Pseudostellaria heterophylla in a cultivation region, China","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13893?af=R","date":1726226366000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i>, known for its significant bioactive ingredients, offers potential health benefits. Amounts of bioactive compounds of the tuberous root of cultivated <i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i> are sensitive to environmental conditions. We selected 22 sampling sites in Guizhou Province, China, a primary <i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i> planting area. We analyzed polysaccharides, water-soluble extractives, total ash and inorganic elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Mg and Ca) in Radix Pseudostellariae, and pH, organic carbon (OC), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and inorganic elements in the soil.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Our study revealed a substantial presence of polysaccharides (85.00–181.00 mg g<sup>−1</sup>), water-soluble extractives (47.52–57.63%) and total ash (1.87–3.39%) in Radix Pseudostellariae. Polysaccharides and total ash showed no sensitivity to soil pH. Radix Pseudostellariae collected from soil with pH &gt; 7 exhibited slightly higher levels of water-soluble extractives, Mg and Ca than that from soil with pH &lt; 5. Conversely, soil with a pH less than 5 had higher OC, AN, AP and AK contents. Water-soluble extractives in Radix Pseudostellariae were negatively correlated with soil pH but positively correlated with OC and AN.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results imply that the sequestration of soil nutrients over long-term <i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i> cultivation could negatively impact the accumulation of some bioactive ingredients in Radix Pseudostellariae. This study has a profound implication for enhancing the quality of Radix Pseudostellariae of artificially cultivated <i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jiao Zheng, \nXin Yang, \nNa An, \nDan Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ea3fb8be8c690c8a3391fd1a80f7007d695f1a5d3957154d33232b3bb58637bb","category":"Environment"}
