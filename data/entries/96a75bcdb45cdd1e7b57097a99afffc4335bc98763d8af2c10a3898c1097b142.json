{"title":"Quarks and Leptons Formation from the Spontaneous Fractionationof a Pair of Elementary Particles with Proton Charge Units","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1227/v1","date":1721119852000,"content":"It is shown that if there exists in nature a pair of heavy elementary particles each with a charge equal to that of the proton and with mass energy , then their direct interaction gives rise to a spontaneous fractionation of the two charges into three pairs of elementary particles according to two equiprobable channels, one hadronic and one leptonic. The leptons and quarks produced are in agreement with the first generation of the Standard Model of matter. Fractionation suggests the relative abundances of the elementary particles, introducing some questions about the possibility of the real existence of a currently unknown particle and its role in the formation of an apparent matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96a75bcdb45cdd1e7b57097a99afffc4335bc98763d8af2c10a3898c1097b142","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
