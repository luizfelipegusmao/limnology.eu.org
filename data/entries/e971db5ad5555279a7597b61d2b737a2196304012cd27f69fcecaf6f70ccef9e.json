{"title":"Forecasting Lakes' Chlorophyll Concentrations Using Satellite Images and Generative Adversarial Networks","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037138?af=R","date":1728979474000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Satellite data are extensively used for water quality monitoring purposes, offering a significantly reduced cost compared to in situ data sampling. Using past measurements to predict future conditions remains a challenging task, because of the complexity of the natural phenomena that are involved, with great potential in terms of water resources management. This paper proposes a model that can be used to forecast Chlorophyll-α $\\alpha $ (Chl-α $\\alpha $) values in water bodies, which are a common water quality indicator. The operation of the model lays on the fact that typically Chl-α $\\alpha $ increases and decreases periodically. First, we apply C2RCC, which is a common atmospheric correction algorithm, to Sentinel-2 images to get Chl-α $\\alpha $ maps for 15 lakes for 12 consecutive months around Europe. Then, we use this data set (∼ ${\\sim} $1,000 Sentinel-2 images) to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to recognize spatiotemporal patterns. To accomplish this task, pix2pix algorithm is employed, matching consecutive past and current Chl-α $\\alpha $ maps to future Chl-α $\\alpha $ maps. This model has been applied to 3 water bodies around Europe that are not included in the 15-lakes training data set and has been found to perform accurately, achieving high Pearson and Spearman correlations and low RMSE values. Overall, the model can be used to make Chl-α $\\alpha $ maps' predictions with low computational cost and without using any in situ data and without the requirement of training for every water body.</p>","author":"Nikolaos Nagkoulis, \nGiorgos Vasiloudis, \nAnastasia Moumtzidou, \nIlias Gialampoukidis, \nStefanos Vrochidis, \nIoannis Kompatsiaris","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"e971db5ad5555279a7597b61d2b737a2196304012cd27f69fcecaf6f70ccef9e","category":"Environment"}
