In this study, we evaluated the effect of a novel subunit targeted vaccine against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in feedlot cattle, a major viral agent of BRD. The core of this novel vaccine is the fusion of the BVDV structural glycoprotein, E2, to a single-chain antibody, APCH, together termed, APCH-E2. The APCH antibody targets the E2 antigen to the major histocompatibility type II molecule (MHC-II) present in antigen-presenting cells. To evaluate the vaccine, 2,992 animals were randomly allocated into two groups, control group (<span>N</span> = 1,491) and treatment group (<span>N</span> = 1,501). Animals of both groups received the routine sanitary plan: two doses of clostridial, respiratory, and rabies vaccines. Animals within the treatment group also received two doses of a targeted subunit vaccine against BVDV. Serum samples were taken on the day of the first inoculation (T0) and 90 d later (T90). Viral circulation was monitored using an anti-P80 ELISA (virus-specific) and immune response was evaluated by anti-E2 ELISA (detects virus and vaccine immune responses). Only animals treated for respiratory disease were considered positive cases of BRD. Results demonstrate that the control group had significantly more animals treated for BRD cases compared to the treatment group (5.9% vs. 3.7%, <span>P</span> = 0.02). The control group had a greater number of animals positive for anti-P80 antibodies and significantly fewer animals positive for anti-E2 antibodies compared to the treatment group (69% vs. 61% and 71% vs. 99%, respectively, <span>P</span> = 0.003), consistent with natural viral circulation within this group. The treatment group, conversely, had fewer animals positive for anti-P80 antibodies and a greater number of animals positive for anti-E2 antibodies, consistent with a robust vaccine-induced antibody response and a reduction of the BVDV circulation within this group. The data indicate the new subunit targeted vaccine induced greater anti-E2 antibodies and reduced the amount of BVD virus circulation within the treatment group leading to a fewer number of animals needing to be treated for BRD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"42b0b9df5dbb8c8ac320014efcb159f4db1adc787d3b24ca2881ef2f29e5c6ff","category":"Environment"}
