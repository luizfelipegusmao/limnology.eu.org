{"title":"Sulfide oxidation by members of the Sulfolobales","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae201/7680089?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The oxidation of sulfur compounds drives the acidification of geothermal waters. At high temperatures (&gt;80°C) and in acidic conditions (pH &lt;6.0), oxidation of sulfide has historically been considered an abiotic process that generates elemental sulfur (S<sup>0</sup>) that, in turn, is oxidized by thermoacidophiles of the model archaeal order Sulfolobales to generate sulfuric acid (i.e. sulfate and protons). Here, we describe five new aerobic and autotrophic strains of Sulfolobales comprising two species that were isolated from acidic hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and that can use sulfide as an electron donor. These strains significantly accelerated the rate and extent of sulfide oxidation to sulfate relative to abiotic controls, concomitant with production of cells. Yields of sulfide-grown cultures were ∼2-fold greater than those of S<sup>0</sup>-grown cultures, consistent with thermodynamic calculations indicating more available energy in the former condition than the latter. Homologs of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (Sqr) were identified in nearly all Sulfolobales genomes from YNP metagenomes as well as those from other reference Sulfolobales, suggesting a widespread ability to accelerate sulfide oxidation. These observations expand the role of Sulfolobales in the oxidative sulfur cycle, the geobiological feedbacks that drive the formation of acidic hot springs, and landscape evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"858cf35badd17fc50f7f86e32a4eff27c46509b1163f7ad838da14963432a6c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
