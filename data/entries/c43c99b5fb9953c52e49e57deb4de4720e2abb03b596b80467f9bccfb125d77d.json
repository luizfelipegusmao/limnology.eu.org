The WCO composite production process involves a series of reactions, including polymerisation, esterification, and transesterification, which lead to the hardening of composite materials. In light of the growing problem of bacterial and fungal diseases, materials with high strength properties and biocidal properties are being sought. Fungal infections of the skin are a widespread problem, and the number of cases is steadily increasing. This article presents a study of the antibacterial potential of WCO-based composites enriched with hops or sorrel root in the context of their application in the construction industry. The compressive and flexural strength of the oil composites, their absorbability and hydrophobicity, and their effects on Gram-positive (<i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and <i>S</i>. <i>epidermidis</i>) and Gram-negative (<i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>) bacteria and fungi (<i>A</i>. <i>niger</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>anomala</i>) were investigated. Maximum split tensile strength (4.3 MPa) and flexural strength (5.1 MPa) were recorded for oil-hop composites. Oil composites enriched with curly sorrel and hops showed antibacterial activity against <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> at 27% and 25%. High biocidal activity (up to 70%) was recorded against <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and against <i>S</i>. <i>epidermidis</i> (up to 99%) due to the action of composites with curly sorrel. The antifungal activities of composites with hops was 15% and 19% for <i>P</i>. <i>anomala</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>niger</i>, respectively, while with curly sorrel they were 42% and 30%.","author":"Anita Staroń","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c43c99b5fb9953c52e49e57deb4de4720e2abb03b596b80467f9bccfb125d77d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
