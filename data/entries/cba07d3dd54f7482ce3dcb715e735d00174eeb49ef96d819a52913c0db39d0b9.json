Catalysts utilized in this application are typically comprised of noble metal nanoparticles supported on a metal oxide, notably Pt/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. These three-way catalysts operate in a chemically complex, high temperature environment capable of degrading the catalystâ€™s performance through sintering processes. When studying the deactivation of these catalysts, this gas environment consisting of many reactive gases is simplified to a single reactive gas species for ease of interpretation. However, this can produce an incomplete understanding of the sintering mechanisms and ignore complex gas interactions that arise from the presence of multiple reactive gas species. In particular, water vapor and oxygen should be considered highly interactive in heterogeneous catalyst systems and warrant thorough co-present investigation through in situ study.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cba07d3dd54f7482ce3dcb715e735d00174eeb49ef96d819a52913c0db39d0b9","category":"Environment"}
