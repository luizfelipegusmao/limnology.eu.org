{"title":"Microbiological and Physicochemical Characterization in the Feeding of Superworm (Zophobas morio) with Petroleum-Derived Polymer Diets.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1058/v1","date":1726220178000,"content":"Plastics are very versatile materials that have contributed to the development of society since the 19th century, however, their mismanagement has led to an accumulation of waste in almost every ecosystem affecting the fauna of the planet. In this way recently, studies have shown that some insects might be able to adapt, consuming a wide range of hydrocarbon base polymers. In this work it was studied the adaptive capacity of Zophobas morio larvae when feeding on different synthetic polymers derived from petroleum. Four 30-day larval feeding treatments were carried out with synthetic polymers as expanded polystyrene (PS), low density polyethylene (PBD), polyisoprene (PI) and butyl rubber (BT), in addition a positive control of organic diet was included. Intestinal bacteria were isolated from the treatments and identified by Sanger sequencing. To analyze the chemical composition and physical form of the frass produced, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR) and images of the feces surface were taken with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. Zophobas morio larvae were able to consume 54% of PS in 30 days, equivalent to 3.2 mg/d/larva. Nine bacterial strains associated with the decomposition of synthetic polymers were identified in the intestine of the larvae. As for the physicochemical analysis of the feces, FTIR spectra showed the scission of bands corresponding to functional groups of the synthetic polymers in the comparison of the plastic diet treatments versus the feces of antibiotic-treated and plastic-fed larvae, while the comparison of spectra of the plastic and control treatments also identified differences in the absorption peaks. SEM imaging demonstrated that superworm feces differed in dependence on the substrate consumed. The findings demonstrate that Zophobas morio larvae possess a gut biological complex that allows them to feed and survive by consuming various petroleum-derived polymers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e66ecbe3684d0da05e9f33fed3ed8f6ed6d0371fba5aca465e002fa61c6f99fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
