{"title":"Developing a multimedia patient-reported outcomes measure for low literacy patients with a human-centered design approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304351","date":1717596000000,"content":"<p>by Chao Long Azad, Laura K. Beres, Albert W. Wu, Allan Fong, Aviram M. Giladi</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Almost all patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) are text-based, which impedes accurate completion by low and limited literacy patients. Few PROMs are designed or validated to be self-administered, either in clinical or research settings, by patients of all literacy levels. We aimed to adapt the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Upper Extremity Short Form (PROMIS-UE) to a multimedia version (mPROMIS-UE) that can be self-administered by hand and upper extremity patients of all literacy levels.</p> Methods <p>Our study in which we applied the Multimedia Adaptation Protocol included seven phases completed in a serial, iterative fashion: planning with our community advisory board; direct observation; discovery interviews with patients, caregivers, and clinic staff; ideation; prototyping; member-checking interviews; and feedback. Direct observations were documented in memos that underwent rapid thematic analysis. Interviews were audio-recorded and documented using analytic memos; a rapid, framework-guided thematic analysis with both inductive and deductive themes was performed. Themes were distilled into design challenges to guide ideation and prototyping that involved our multidisciplinary research team. To assess completeness, credibility, and acceptability we completed additional interviews with member-checking of initial findings and consulted our community advisory board.</p> Results <p>We conducted 12 hours of observations. We interviewed 17 adult English-speaking participants (12 patients, 3 caregivers, 2 staff) of mixed literacy. Our interviews revealed two distinct user personas and three distinct literacy personas; we developed the mPROMIS-UE with these personas in mind. Themes from interviews were distilled into four broad design challenges surrounding literacy, customizability, convenience, and shame. We identified features (audio, animations, icons, avatars, progress indicator, illustrated response scale) that addressed the design challenges. The last 6 interviews included member-checking; participants felt that the themes, design challenges, and corresponding features resonated with them. These features were synthesized into an mPROMIS-UE prototype that underwent rounds of iterative refinement, the last of which was guided by recommendations from our community advisory board.</p> Discussion <p>We successfully adapted the PROMIS-UE to an mPROMIS-UE that addresses the challenges identified by a mixed literacy hand and upper extremity patient cohort. This demonstrates the feasibility of adapting PROMs to multimedia versions. Future research will include back adaptation, usability testing via qualitative evaluation, and psychometric validation of the mPROMIS-UE. A validated mPROMIS-UE will expand clinicians’ and investigators’ ability to capture patient-reported outcomes in mixed literacy populations.</p>","author":"Chao Long Azad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"65ece5038925c81c1532d304621433d47e207c0ab77befaf3708335e03421cc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
