{"title":"Bacterial Cellulose in Food Packaging: A Bibliometric Analysis and Review of Sustainable Innovations and Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1111/v1","date":1723699720000,"content":"The scientific community has explored new packaging materials due to environmental challenges and pollution from plastic waste. Bacterial cellulose (BC), produced by bacteria like Gluconaceto-bacter xylinus, shows high potential for food preservation due to its exceptional mechanical strength, high crystallinity, and effective barrier properties against gases and moisture, making it a promising alternative to conventional plastics. This review highlights recent advances in BC production, particularly agro-industrial residues, which reduce costs and enhance environmental sustainability. Incorporating antimicrobial agents into BC matrices has also led to active packaging solutions that extend food shelf life and improve safety. A bibliometric analysis reveals a significant increase in research on BC over the last decade, reflecting growing global interest. Key research themes include the development of BC-based composites and the exploration of their antimicrobial properties. Critical areas for future research include improving BC production's scalability and economic via-bility and its integration with other biopolymers. These developments emphasize BC's potential as a sustainable packaging material and its role in the circular economy through waste valorization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb70fad03ee368e1602dffd13abbe4a44fd87c00428cd066f147a7553a094ce0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
