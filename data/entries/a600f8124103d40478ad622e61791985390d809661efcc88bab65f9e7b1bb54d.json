{"title":"Driving Reality vs Simulator: Data Distinctions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1490/v1","date":1713922437000,"content":"As the automotive industry undergoes a transformative phase driven by technological advancements, the integration of driving simulators stands out as an important tool for research and development. These simulators offer a controlled environment for studying driver behavior; however, the alignment of data remains a complex aspect that warrants thorough investigation. This research investigates driver state classification using a dataset obtained from real-road and simulated conditions, recorded through JINS MEME ES_R smart glasses. The data set encompasses electrooculography signals, with a focus on standardizing and processing the data for subsequent analysis. For this purpose, we used a recurrent neural network model, which yielded 95.21% accuracy on testing dataset. The findings of this study indicate the plausible use of proposed methodology in practical scenarios, providing possibility for developments in intelligent transportation systems and driver monitoring technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a600f8124103d40478ad622e61791985390d809661efcc88bab65f9e7b1bb54d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
