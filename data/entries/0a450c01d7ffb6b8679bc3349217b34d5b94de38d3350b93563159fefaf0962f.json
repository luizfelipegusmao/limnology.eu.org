{"title":"Quantitative Assessment and Impact Analysis of Land Surface Deformation in Wuxi Based on PS-InSAR and GARCH Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1742/v1","date":1711686491000,"content":"Persistent land subsidence or uplift can cause serious latent hazards to urban infrastructure. To thoroughly investigate the causes and impacts of land surface deformation, this study examines the case of Wuxi City, focusing on the land fluctuation patterns in the region following the enforcement of the groundwater abstraction prohibition policy in 2005. This research utilizes the PS-InSAR technique to quantify land surface deformations in the Wuxi region from November 2015 to June 2023 and analyzes 100 SAR images to obtain comprehensive spatiotemporal evolution data of the land surface. Furthermore, this study conducts an in-depth analysis of the effects of various factors, including groundwater, precipitation, and soil geology, on the characteristics of land surface deformation. It pioneers the application of the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to analyze the time-series displacement in the study area and innovatively introduces the \"amplitude factor\" index to assess land surface fluctuations. This study investigates the recent land surface deformation patterns and mechanisms in Wuxi City. By integrating the \"amplitude factor\", it provides a scientific foundation for future urban development and disaster mitigation strategies in Wuxi City, offering valuable insights for related research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a450c01d7ffb6b8679bc3349217b34d5b94de38d3350b93563159fefaf0962f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
