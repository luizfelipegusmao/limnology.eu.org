To overcome this worldwide phenomenon, antibiotic prophylaxis of implants and design of antimicrobial biomaterials are necessary to prevent post-surgical infections. This situation is exacerbated by the fast generated bacterial resistance against antibiotics by pathologic microorganisms of the hospital environment. A promising strategy against this relevant issue is the use of antimicrobial coatings, such as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a plausible choice since its effectiveness as a growth inhibitor has been widely studied [<a href=\"#ozae044.453-B2\">2-4</a>]. L-polylactic acid (PLLA) is a biopolymer that is very used in the orthopedic field [<a href=\"#ozae044.453-B5\">5-8</a>], and the functionalization of this compound with AgNPs is a promising choice in the design and manufacture of antimicrobial biomaterials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4aee743c474ff6f5baa8f0720a94ea56863d779d7ef539c9dc49520c5dee32a8","category":"Environment"}
