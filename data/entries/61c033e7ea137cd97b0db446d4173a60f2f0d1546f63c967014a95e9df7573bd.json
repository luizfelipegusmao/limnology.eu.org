The Hubble constant inferred from Pioneer 10/11 data is $\\sim 69$ km/s/Mpc. The anomalous acceleration of Pioneer 10/11 can be interpreted as an observational evidence for Mach's principle. The redshift is an apparent value. Its intrinsic value has a limit resulting to $v","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61c033e7ea137cd97b0db446d4173a60f2f0d1546f63c967014a95e9df7573bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
