{"title":"Dach1 is essential for maintaining normal mature podocytes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303910","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Keiko Tanaka, Haruko Hayasaka, Taiji Matsusaka</p>\r\n\r\nDach1 is highly expressed in normal podocytes, but this expression rapidly disappears after podocyte injury. To investigate the role of Dach1 in podocytes <i>in vivo</i>, we analyzed global, podocyte-specific, and inducible <i>Dach1</i> knockout mice. Global Dach1 knockout (<i>Dach1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice were assessed immediately after birth because they die within a day. The kidneys of <i>Dach1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were slightly smaller than those of control mice but maintained a normal structure and normal podocyte phenotypes, including ultrastructure. To study the role of Dach1 in mature podocytes, we generated <i>Dach1</i> knockout mice by mating <i>Dach1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with <i>Nphs1</i>-Cre or <i>ROSA</i>-CreERT2 mice. Due to inefficient Cre recombination, only a small number of podocytes lacked Dach1 staining in these mice. However, all eleven <i>Nphs1</i>-Cre/<i>Dach1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed abnormal albuminuria, and seven (63%) of them developed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Among 13 <i>ROSA</i>-CreERT2/<i>Dach1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, eight (61%) exhibited abnormal albuminuria after treatment with tamoxifen, and five (38%) developed early sclerotic lesions. These results indicate that while Dach1 does not determine the fate of differentiation into podocytes, it is indispensable for maintaining the normal integrity of mature podocytes.","author":"Keiko Tanaka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"29b107c3fb8c63667d4ec29145253692031f9b8cdb29e6c232852203ef1fc977","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
