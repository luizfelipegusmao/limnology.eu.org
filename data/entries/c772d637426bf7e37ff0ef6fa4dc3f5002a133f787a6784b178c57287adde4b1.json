When faced with situations when the session structure of comment sections is deliberately disrupted, traditional models do not handle them adequately. In order to do this, we provide a novel rumor detection architecture that combines dual comparison learning, adversarial training, and attention filters. We suggest the attention filter module to achieve the filtering of some dangerous comments as well as the filtering of some useless comments, allowing the nodes to enter the GAT graph neural network with greater structural information. The adversarial training module (ADV) simulates the occurrence of malicious comments through perturbation, giving the comments some defense against malicious comments. It also serves as a hard negative sample to aid double contrast learning (DCL), which aims to learn the differences between various comments, and incorporates the final loss in the form of a loss function to strengthen the model. According to experimental findings, our AGAD (Attention Graph Adversarial Dual Contrast Learning) model outperforms other cutting-edge algorithms on a number of rumor detection tasks.
