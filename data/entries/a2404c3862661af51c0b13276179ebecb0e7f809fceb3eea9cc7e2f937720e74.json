High nitrification processes were detected at lower salinity treatments, with the lowest ammonia and nitrite concentration in those. There were no significant differences on shrimp survival between treatments; however, the best final weights were observed in the S8IB2 (0.24 ± 0.01 g) and S4IB1 (2.80 ± 0.12 g) treatments for the nursery and grow-out stages, respectively. The most frequent histological lesions were the absence of lipid vacuoles in the hepatopancreas and abundant organic debris in the gill lamellae. The viability of rearing <i>L. vannamei</i> juveniles in biofloc at low salinity is still relatively weak because of their low growth and low efficiency to store fatty acids in the hepatopancreas; however, higher postlarvae productivity was found at 8 g L<sup>−1</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/Mg<sup>+2</sup>/Ca<sup>+2</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio of 40.6/4.7/1.98/1 in the nursery stage.</p>","author":"Mitsuaki Ueno Fukura, \nLuis Felipe Collazos Lasso, \nLuis Alejandro Vinatea Arana, \nBernardo Baldisserotto","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"a2404c3862661af51c0b13276179ebecb0e7f809fceb3eea9cc7e2f937720e74","category":"Environment"}
