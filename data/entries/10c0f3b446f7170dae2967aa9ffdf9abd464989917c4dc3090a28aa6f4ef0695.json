{"title":"Support Vector Machine-Based Formula for Detecting Suspected &alpha; Thalassemia Carriers: A Path Toward Universal Screening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0686/v1","date":1712735135000,"content":"The blood counts of α thalassemia carriers (α-thal) are similar to those of β thalassemia carriers, except for Hgb A2 that is not elevated. The objective of this study was to determine whether mathematical formulas are effective for detecting suspected α-thal. \nThe data were obtained from the database of the prevention program for detecting couples at risk for having a child with hemoglobinopathy. RBC indices were analyzed using mathematical formulas and the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) calculated.\nAmong 1334 blood counts suspected α-thal analyzed, only the Shine&amp;Lal and the Support Vector Machine formulas revealed high sensitivity and NPV. Sensitivity was 85.54 and 99.33% and NPV 98.93 and 99.93%, respectively. Molecular defects were found in 291, 81 had normal α genes. Molecular analysis was not performed in 962. \nBased on these results, mathematical formulas incorporating one of these reliable formulas for detecting suspected α or β thalassemia carriers in the program of the automatic analyzers can flag these results and increase the awareness of the primary physicians about the carrier risk and send an alert with a recommendation for further testing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10c0f3b446f7170dae2967aa9ffdf9abd464989917c4dc3090a28aa6f4ef0695","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
