{"title":"Receptors Involved in COVID-19-Related Anosmia: An Update on the Pathophysiology and the Mechanistic Aspects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1916/v1","date":1719478148000,"content":"Background Olfactory perception is an important physiological function for the human well-being and health. Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, caused by viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) received a considerable attention especially in the persistent cases that take long time to recover. Objectives This review discusses the integration of different components of the olfactory epithelium to serve as a structural and functional unit, and explores how they are affected during viral infections, leading to the development of olfactory dysfunction. Methods The review mainly focused on the role of receptors mediating the disruption of olfactory signal transduction pathways such as ACE2, TMPRSS2 protease, neuropilin 1 (NRP1), basigin (CD147), olfactory, TRPV1, purinergic, and interferon gamma receptors. Furthermore, the compromised function of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and its contribution in olfactory dysfunction is also discussed. Results Collectively, this review provides fundamental information about the many types of receptors that may modulate olfaction and participate in olfactory dysfunction. It will help to understand the underlying pathophysiology of virus-induced anosmia which may help in finding and designing effective therapies targeting molecules involved in viral invasion and in olfaction. Conclusion This wide and complex spectrum of receptors that mediates the pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction reflects the many ways by which anosmia can be therapeutically managed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5559f41a159d3923b036ca65a93e3bd31a51e24ff4d629d5ed7a304bcf6ed46f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
