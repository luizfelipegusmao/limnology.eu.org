{"title":"Evaluating the Presence of Interspecific Hybrids Among Piaractus mesopotamicus, Piaractus brachypomus and Colossoma macropomum in the Upper Paraná River Using Genetic Markers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4262?af=R","date":1728602407000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Fish hybridization is common in aquaculture worldwide, including in Brazil, with cross-breeding between species of the genera <i>Piaractus</i> and <i>Colossoma</i> taking the lead. However, little is known about the genetic damage caused by hybrids that escape into natural environments. In the upper Paraná River region, hybrid fishes are overproduced; therefore, the use of molecular techniques for their monitoring and identification is necessary. This study aimed to detect the presence of possible hybridization between <i>Piaractus</i> and <i>Colossoma</i> in the upper Paraná River using the molecular markers cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and α-tropomyosin (TROP). Fragments from 53 fish samples were analysed, and 41 samples were considered hybrids, with 12 confirmed pure, six as <i>Piaractus mesopotamicus</i> (pacu) and six as <i>Piaractus brachypomus</i> (pirapitinga). This is the first record of <i>P. brachypomus</i>, which is an invasive species in this basin, while <i>Colossoma macropomum</i> has not been observed. Molecular markers efficiently detected hybrids in the Ivinhema and Paraná rivers. The results showed a predominance of hybrid specimens from <i>P. mesopotamicus</i> × <i>P. brachypomus</i>. Our study suggests that more restrictions on hybridization and better supervision of fish farms are needed to prevent the escape of hybrids and the consequent ecological and genetic damage to native populations. We warn of the risk of a decline in the population of <i>P. mesopotamicus</i>, as this species is of great importance for fishing and maintaining the ecosystem.</p>","author":"Lidiany Doreto Cavalcanti, \nLara Darice Lima, \nJuliana Rosa Carrijo‐Mauad, \nMárcia Regina Russo, \nAlessandra Valéria de Oliveira, \nRicardo Massato Takemoto","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"ca8d062779321c5a57153f2677217e6b5765870de25df372e6f6e94d84383c6e","category":"Environment"}
