{"title":"Investigation of Removing Asphaltene-Resin-Paraffin Deposits by Chemical Method for Azerbaijan High-Paraffin Oil Production Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1242/v1","date":1721182490000,"content":"Asphaltene-resin-paraffin deposition (ARPD) is a complicated and prevalent issue in oil and gas industry, impacting the efficiency, integrity of petroleum extraction, production, transportation and processing systems. Considering all witnessed ARPD problems in Azerbaijan oil fields, this paper proposed a chemical method and optimized the type and the concentration of chemical inhibitors. And then the effect of selected chemical reagent on inhibiting the ARPD amount and thus en-hancing oil recovery was detected by reservoir simulation during both waterflooding and CO2 flooding production. Three new chemical compounds (namely, Chemical-A, Chemical-B and Chemical-C) were examined in laboratory conditions and their impact on rheological properties of high-paraffin oilfield samples of Azerbaijan (X, Y and Z) were investigated. Experimental results show that Chemical-C with concentration of 600 g/t has the best efficiency for alleviating the problems. After adding Chemical-C to the crude oil, the freezing point of oil is decreased from 12 °C to (-4) °C, ARPD amount is declined from 0.185 to 0.016 g and oil effective viscosity is reduced from 16.2 mPa·s to 3.1 mPa·s. It is determined that for water and CO2 flooding, higher injection pressure resulted in reduced asphaltene precipitation. Adding selected ARPD inhibitor, the oil recovery for waterflooding can increase from 52% to 62%, while it can rise from 55% to 68% for CO2 flooding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fa72d4d72655ffb59e2b186940b274696c54f2056db896ee74239dca5a66c16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
