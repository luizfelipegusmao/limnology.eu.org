{"title":"Analysis of Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) Impact \non cognitive workload using NASA TLX: A Study on \nthe Assembly of a Three Jaw Chuck","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2329/v1","date":1727682344000,"content":"HTA introduced by Annett and Duncan is widely recognized for breaking down \ncomplex tasks into manageable subtasks, data, and quantitative analysis confirming \nits effectiveness are limited. By combining the HTA with the NASA Workload Index \n(NASA-TLX), a subjective workload assessment tool, this study aims to provide a \ncomprehensive assessment of task performance and workload. The project involved \nassembling a three-jaw chuck with HTA for process definition and subtasks, while \nNASA-TLX was used for workload determination. Data were collected through \nquestionnaires and observation forms and analyzed to determine the impact of HTA \non task performance and workload distribution. The results show that HTA effectively \nidentifies task complexity and bottlenecks, which facilitates task optimization and \nimproves performance. The NASA-TLX integration provides critical insights into \nindividuals' subjective workload and targets areas where task performance and \nresource allocation can be improved. This study shows that combining HTA and \nNASA-TLX provides a holistic approach to understanding and improving task \nperformance, ultimately leading to better user experience and productivity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c543d328465744fe51fafec34b57f619d9e129e117c82a7f6aea3ad91dacf7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
