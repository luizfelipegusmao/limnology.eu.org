{"title":"61 Determining in vivo and in vitro predatory activity of Duddingtonia flagrans and interaction with dietary coccidiostat","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/91/7617996?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A nematode trapping fungus, Duddingtonia flagrans (Df), fed to sheep is useful for biocontrol of gastrointestinal nematodes on pasture. The objectives were: 1) validate methods to determine viability of a commercial source of Df before beginning research studies, and 2) examine the interaction between Df and dietary coccidiostat (as decoquinate). Methods: Study 1: In Jan 2023, weaned Katahdin lambs (97.3 ± 1.2 d of age; 19.5 ± 1.3 kg BW; packed cell volume of 26.5 ± 1.4 %), naturally infected with predominantly Haemonchus contortus (89%) and mean fecal egg count (FEC) of 6,860 ± 1,535 eggs/g, were randomly assigned to: 1) no Df (-g)/(FEC<sup>-g</sup>)×100]. Study 2: In Aug 2023, 7 mo old anthelmintic-treated ram lambs (FEC &lt; 50 egg/s; 51.6 ± 3.9 kg in BW) were fed grain supplement daily with decoquinate (Deccox; +C) or without (-C; n = 3/diet) on d -7 to 1, and, within diet, administered 3 g BioWorma/d in 6 gel capsules (+DF; n = 2/diet) or not (-DF; n = 1) on d -1 and -2. Fecal samples were collected on d 0 (2 g/plate + 300 L3 of H. contortus) and d 1 (6 g/plate + 1000 L3) and placed on water agar plates (n = 3/lamb) at 25°C. Trapping structures were visually assessed after 24, 48, and 144 h (6 d), and cultures Baermannized on d 7 for L3 recovery. Relative reduction was (x̅<sub>-DF-C</sub>-x̅<sub>+DF+C</sub>/ x̅<sub>-DF-C</sub>)×100%. Data for variables collected one time were analyzed by Proc GLM (SAS), and for those collected serially, a Proc Mixed with repeated measures. A 2×2 factorial was used in Study 2 and included treatments, day and interaction in model. Results: Study 1: As expected, L3 recovery was reduced (P = 0.005) in DF lambs by 67-78% relative to control. Study 2: DF formed loops and traps around L3 by d 6 and reduced L3 recovery on both days (P &lt; 0.001) without an interaction by decoquinate (P = 0.69). The L3 reduction relative to -DF-C was between 60.2-73.5%. The coccidiostat, decoquinate, can be added to the diet in the presence of BioWorma without antagonism. In conclusion, the in vitro studies allow detection of adverse issues with viability of Df and can reduce the number of animals needed for research studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d322f425fea05f5a802272b78b445de1f93151cea754bbab380fe0d491fbde7f","category":"Environment"}
