{"title":"A New Sustainable PPT Coating Based on Recycled PET to Improve the Durability of Hydraulic Concrete","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0661/v1","date":1712656877000,"content":"A new sustainable polypropylene terephthalate (PPT) coating was synthesized from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and applied on hydraulic concrete substrate to improve its durability. First step, PET bottles wastes were grinded and depolymerized by glycolysis using propylene glycol (PG), in a Vessel-type reactor (20–180 °C) to synthesize bis(2-hydroxypropyl)-terephthalate (BHPT), which was applied as coating to one-three layers on hydraulic concrete substrate, by brushing technique and polymerized (150 °C for 15 h) to obtain PPT. PET, BHPT and PPT were characterized by FT-IR, PET and PPT by TGA, and the PPT coatings by SEM (thickness), by ASTM-D3359-17 (adhesion) and by water contact angle (wettability). The durability of hydraulic concrete coated with PPT was studied by resist chloride ion penetration (ASTM-C1202-17), carbonation depth at 28 days (RILEM-CPC-18), and absorption water ratio (ASTM-C1585-20). The results demonstrated that the BHPT and PPT were synthetized (FT-IR), PPT had a similar thermal behaviour to PET (TGA); the PPT coatings had good adhesion to the substrate, with thicknesses of micrometric units; hydrophilic (similar to PET coatings), and the durability of hydraulic concrete coated with PPT (2-3 layers) improved (migration of chloride ions decreased, carbonation depth was negligible, and the absorption water ratio decreased).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b9c3ac466b0e5d5acf14c5afa0145d979af10d67b8fcec504212f96cc3ede2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
