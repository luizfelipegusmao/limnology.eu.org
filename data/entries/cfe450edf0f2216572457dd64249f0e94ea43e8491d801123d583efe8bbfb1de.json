{"title":"Transcription factors VviWRKY10 and VviWRKY30 co-regulate powdery mildew resistance in grapevine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/446/7608886?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Grapevine (<span>Vitis vinifera</span>) is an economically important fruit crop worldwide. The widely cultivated grapevine is susceptible to powdery mildew caused by <span>Erysiphe necator</span>. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to simultaneously knock out <span>VviWRKY10</span> and <span>VviWRKY30</span> encoding two transcription factors reported to be implicated in defense regulation. We generated 53 <span>wrky10</span> single mutant transgenic plants and 15 <span>wrky10 wrky30</span> double mutant transgenic plants. In a 2-yr field evaluation of powdery mildew resistance, the <span>wrky10</span> mutants showed strong resistance, while the <span>wrky10 wrky30</span> double mutants showed moderate resistance. Further analyses revealed that salicylic acid (SA) and reactive oxygen species contents in the leaves of <span>wrky10</span> and <span>wrky10 wrky30</span> were substantially increased, as was the ethylene (ET) content in the leaves of <span>wrky10</span>. The results from dual luciferase reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that VviWRKY10 could directly bind to the W-boxes in the promoter of SA-related defense genes and inhibit their transcription, supporting its role as a negative regulator of SA-dependent defense. By contrast, VviWRKY30 could directly bind to the W-boxes in the promoter of ET-related defense genes and promote their transcription, playing a positive role in ET production and ET-dependent defense. Moreover, VviWRKY10 and VviWRKY30 can bind to each other's promoters and mutually inhibit each other's transcription. Taken together, our results reveal a complex mechanism of regulation by VviWRKY10 and VviWRKY30 for activation of measured and balanced defense responses against powdery mildew in grapevine.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"cfe450edf0f2216572457dd64249f0e94ea43e8491d801123d583efe8bbfb1de","category":"Environment"}
