{"title":"A new era of synthetic biology—microbial community design","link":"https://academic.oup.com/synbio/article/doi/10.1093/synbio/ysae011/7713945?rss=1","date":1721088000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Synthetic biology conceptualizes biological complexity as a network of biological parts, devices, and systems with predetermined functionalities and has had a revolutionary impact on fundamental and applied research. With the unprecedented ability to synthesize and transfer any DNA and RNA across organisms, the scope of synthetic biology is expanding and being recreated in previously unimaginable ways. The field has matured to a level where highly complex networks, such as artificial communities of synthetic organisms, can be constructed. In parallel, computational biology became an integral part of biological studies, with computational models aiding the unravelling of the escalating complexity and emerging properties of biological phenomena. However, there is still a vast untapped potential for the complete integration of modelling into the synthetic design process, presenting exciting opportunities for scientific advancements. Here, we first highlight the most recent advances in computer-aided design of microbial communities. Next, we propose that such a design can benefit from an organism-free modular modelling approach that places its emphasis on modules of organismal function towards the design of multispecies communities. We argue for a shift in perspective from single organism–centred approaches to emphasizing the functional contributions of organisms within the community. By assembling synthetic biological systems using modular computational models with mathematical descriptions of parts and circuits, we can tailor organisms to fulfil specific functional roles within the community. This approach aligns with synthetic biology strategies and presents exciting possibilities for the design of artificial communities.<strong>Graphical Abstract</strong>  </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Synthetic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"41b19f195cf64174f01d8c36945485e6398e3496f8a7213d6905a0e36713ba3c","entryHash":"85d5d0436b5a76916773c75d6c2799eec8692fbac3f8efb24a310eb29b7beba7","category":"Environment"}
