{"title":"Connecting Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity: The Role of Electromagnetic Spacetime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2090/v2","date":1717478597000,"content":"We propose a novel framework for understanding quantum phenomena through the lens of a modified electromagnetic spacetime governed by Einstein field equations. By assuming the existence of an electromagnetic spacetime that adheres to these modified geodesic and Einstein field equations, provided the field equations satisfy the Coulomb force law in weak-field approximations, we explore the derivation of Maxwellâ€™s equations and highlight the necessity of incorporating spin to validate these equations. We derive the wave equation for the normalized transverse metric and establish its equivalence with the de Broglie wave proposition, suggesting a relationship between this metric and the particle's wavefunction. This approach offers a classical explanation for several quantum phenomena, including the double-slit experiment, entanglement, tunneling, non-locality, and wavefunction collapse. Additionally, it posits a method to visualize atomic orbital structures in line with quantum mechanical predictions. These findings suggest that the foundational principles of quantum mechanics can be interpreted as linearized approximations of general relativity applied to electromagnetic spacetime. While this theory does not yet extend to the correlations between general relativity, quantum electrodynamics (QED), and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it provides a valuable visualization tool for physicists and advances our understanding of the unresolved challenges linking quantum mechanics with general relativity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79aff72319b49a7cada3218347d5aed4c555317ede07b88a7b7af4c5d814f077","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
