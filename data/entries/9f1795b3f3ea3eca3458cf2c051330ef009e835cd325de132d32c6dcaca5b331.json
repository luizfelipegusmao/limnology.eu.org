{"title":"VIMPS: Physics-Based Spatiotemporal Indicator for Proactive Humping Detection in Metal Additive Manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1654/v1","date":1714032666000,"content":"Direct Energy Deposition (DED) is a versatile and efficient method in metal additive manufacturing. However, humping, caused by abnormal dynamics in the melt pool (MP), poses a significant threat to the geometric integrity of manufactured products. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods primarily detect humping by analyzing late-stage spatial abnormalities, such as MP detachment. This approach is fundamentally reactive, leading to a tendency to miss early humping spatiotemporal dynamics, like cyclic elongation of the MP. This study introduces a novel, proactive indicator named VIMPS (Variability of Instantaneous MP Solidification-Front Speed), a physics-based tool designed to quantify early abnormal fluctuations in MP solidification speed. The experiments demonstrate VIMPS correlation with humping-induced geometric inaccuracies. By capturing early spatiotemporal dynamics of the MP, VIMPS reduces detection latency by 30 seconds compared to existing SOTAs that focus solely on spatial abnormalities. This significant improvement transforms detection from reactive to proactive, providing the time needed for corrective actions to enhance the overall productivity and quality of the DED process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f1795b3f3ea3eca3458cf2c051330ef009e835cd325de132d32c6dcaca5b331","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
