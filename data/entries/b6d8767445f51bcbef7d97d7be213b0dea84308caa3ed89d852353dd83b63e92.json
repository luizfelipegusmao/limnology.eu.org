{"title":"Entrepreneurial Proficiency, Financial Knowledge and Sustainable Functioning &ndash; Examining the Mediating Role of Business Resilience among Indian Entrepreneurs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0264/v1","date":1719929400000,"content":"This study looked into how financial knowledge and entrepreneurial proficiency affected the performance of small, sustainable businesses. In parallel, we looked at how business resilience mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial proficiency and financial knowledge and long-term company success. Using an offline questionnaire, we employed a quantitative approach to gather data from 275 Indian small company owners. PLS-SEM was used to analyse the data that had been gathered. The findings show that resilience and entrepreneurial ability are very positively impacted by financial knowledge. The business resilience and sustainable performance of Indian SMEs are significantly enhanced by entrepreneurial competencies. Moreover, it was shown that business resilience moderated the influence of financial knowledge and proficiency on sustainable performance among Indian SMEs, while concurrently having a significant impact on sustainable performance. In keeping with India Vision of  Viksit Bharat@2047: Crystal  Gazing Through MSME Sector, which places a strong emphasis on entrepreneurship and the growth of a financially independent entrepreneurial community, this study helps to open up business options for regional business owners who oversee small businesses.  According to the most recent figures (2021–2022) from the Ministry of Statistics &amp; Programme Implementation, MSMEs make up a startling 29.15% of India’s GDP. This indicates their critical significance in the development of the country as it equates to a sizeable portion of the economic pie. In addition to adding to the corpus of knowledge, this research can help policymakers develop relevant plans to motivate SMEs that have been most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to operate sustainably. There are also several other ramifications for financial institutions and business owners.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6d8767445f51bcbef7d97d7be213b0dea84308caa3ed89d852353dd83b63e92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
