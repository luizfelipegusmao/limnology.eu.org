{"title":"Multiple factors influenced the aggregation behavior of adult Eucryptorrhynchus scrobicuatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/354/7666068?rss=1","date":1715040000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Eucryptorrhynchus scrobiculatus</span> (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a notorious pest of <span>Ailanthus altissima</span> (Mill.) Swingle (Sapindales: Simaroubaceae). <span>E. scrobiculatus</span> adults typically aggregate under leaves and in soil crevices at the base of <span>A. altissima</span> in the field. We hypothesize that the environmental factors and conspecific signals determine their aggregation behavior. To test this, we investigated adult numbers in light-exposed and shaded areas of the sample trees and conducted experiments in both field and lab settings. Results revealed that (i) greater adult distribution in shaded areas; (ii) significant influence of temperature and illumination on aggregation tendency in the field; (iii) no gender-based difference in aggregation degree and maximum aggregation between light and dark; (iv) the host plant triggering the aggregation tendency, negatively affected in the absence; (v) the aggregation tendency of <span>E. scrobiculatus</span> weakened with the temperature gradually changing to ordinary temperature; and (vi) mutual attraction and chemical attraction between males and females. Thus, the aggregation behavior was influenced by factors including temperature, light intensity, host plant, and conspecific signals, but lightâ€™s role was not obvious in the lab.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"d2644146b5d6565fbdf8254c07ff92af6db1e2af23719db5398509dbfd21ed49","category":"Environment"}
