{"title":"Record of a juvenile of Ahytherium aureum from the Late Pleistocene of the Brazilian Intertropical Region: radiocarbon dating, isotopic palaeoecology and evidence of predation by a Felidae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3556?af=R","date":1690461617000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Teeth and bone remains belonging to the juvenile Megalonychidae family were found in Engrunado cave (Nova Redenção, Bahia, Brazil). We propose an index between the mesiodistal/vestibulo-lingual measurements of caniniforms and molariforms (<i>I</i>\n<sub>md</sub>/<sub>vl</sub>) to differentiate isolated teeth of <i>Ahytherium aureum</i> and <i>Australonyx aquae</i>, and based on this index, we suggest that the fossil material belonged to <i>A. aureum</i>. The diaphysis of the right humerus of <i>A. aureum</i> presents biogenic marks assigned to the ichnospecies <i>Nihilichnus nihilicus</i>, suggesting dietary interactions and potential predation by a large felid. Radiocarbon dating and carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses suggest that this individual lived in the region between 36 181 and 41 094 Cal yr <span>bp</span>, feeding on C<sub>3</sub> plant resources (fruit and leaves) in a low-density forest. The revision of radiocarbon dating and carbon and oxygen isotopes for some species found in the Engrunado cave and in the nearby Marota cave enables a climate reconstruction and indicates the maintenance of a forested environment in the region between 15 and 40 kyr.</p>","author":"João Paulo da Costa, \nHermínio Ismael de Araújo‐Júnior, \nFernando Henrique de Souza Barbosa, \nMário André Trindade Dantas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"5b13e5963dceb972c57207f599e66d7e79fd6deb249e1661e60a6f32fb80e818","category":"Environment"}
