{"title":"PSVI-12 Clodronate does not impact bone optical density or lameness in juvenile, exercised Quarter Horses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/539/7757522?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The non-nitrogenous bisphosphonate clodronate disodium (CD) inhibits bone resorption and is approved for horses ≥ 4 yr of age. Extra-label use in juvenile exercising horses is a concern due to potential interference with normal bone growth and development. The objective was to determine the effects of single and repeated doses of CD on bone optical density (radiographic bone aluminum equivalence; RBAE) and lameness score (LS) in juvenile, exercising horses. Quarter Horses [n = 32 (16 geldings, 16 fillies); 500 ± 13 d of age; body weight (BW) = 336 ± 26 kg]) were used to test the hypothesis that horses receiving CD would have greater RBAE and reduced LS, and additional doses of CD would accentuate these effects. In a 168-d trial, horses were housed in individual stalls, and fed 1% BW/d concentrate and ad libitum Coastal bermudagrass hay. Horses were exercised 5 d/wk following a phase-based progressive workload using a free stall exerciser; Phase I (d 0 to 84) mimicked sales preparation whereas Phase II (d 85 to 168) simulated early training. Horses were stratified by age, BW, sex, and initial RBAE into control (CON; n = 8), single dose CD (1X; d 84; n = 8), 2-doses CD (2X; d 0 and d 84; n = 8), and four-doses CD (4X; d 0, d 42, d 84, d 126; n = 8). On injection d (0, 42, 84, and 126), horses were administered either 1.8 mg/kg BW CD (OSPHOS) or isovolumetric saline. On d 0, 84, and 168, dorsal-palmar and lateral-medial radiographs of the left third metacarpus and metatarsus were captured. An aluminum step wedge was included in each image and raw images were analyzed (Quantity One Basic, BioRad) to determine total bone RBAE at 1 cm distal to the nutrient foramen. On d 0 and d 168, horses were evaluated by a veterinarian unaware of treatment group and assigned a LS according to the American Association of Equine Practitioners Lameness Scale. The RBAE and LS data were analyzed via PROC MIXED and PROC GENMOD, respectively, in SAS. For each view, RBAE increased from d 0 to d 84 and remained increased to d 168 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.02), regardless of treatment, likely due to progressing exercise protocol. On d 0, 29 horses were LS 0, 1 horse was LS 1, and 2 horses were LS 2; LS did not differ among treatment groups (<span>P</span> = 0.61). On d 168, 5 horses were LS 0, 13 horses were LS 2, 11 horses were LS 3, and 1 horse was LS 4; LS did not differ among treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.16). Based on these results, the hypothesis that single or repeated CD administration would increase RBAE and decrease lameness in juvenile, exercised Quarter Horses was rejected.
