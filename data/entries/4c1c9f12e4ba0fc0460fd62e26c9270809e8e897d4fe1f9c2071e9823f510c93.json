{"title":"Discussion on the relationship between gut microbiota and glioma through Mendelian randomization test based on the brain gut axis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304403","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Chenzhi Cui, Tianke Yang, ShengYu Wang, Zhuqiang Jia, Lin Zhao, Xin Han, Xiaohong Sun, Junwei Zong, Shouyu Wang, Dong Chen</p>\r\nBackground <p>In the realm of Gut-Brain axis research, existing evidence points to a complex bidirectional regulatory mechanism between gut microbiota and the brain. However, the question of whether a causal relationship exists between gut microbiota and specific types of brain tumors, such as gliomas, remains unresolved. To address this gap, we employed publicly available Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and MIOBEN databases, conducting an in-depth analysis using Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR).</p> Method <p>We carried out two sets of MR analyses. The preliminary analysis included fewer instrumental variables due to a high genome-wide statistical significance threshold (5×10<sup>−8</sup>). To enable a more comprehensive and detailed analysis, we adjusted the significance threshold to 1×10<sup>−5</sup>. We performed linkage disequilibrium analysis (R<sup>2</sup> &lt;0.001, clumping distance = 10,000kb) and detailed screening of palindromic SNPs, followed by MR analysis and validation through sensitivity analysis.</p> Results <p>Our findings reveal a causal relationship between gut microbiota and gliomas. Further confirmation via Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW) identified eight specific microbial communities related to gliomas. Notably, the Peptostreptococcaceae and Olsenella communities appear to have a protective effect, reducing glioma risk.</p> Conclusion <p>This study not only confirms the causal link between gut microbiota and gliomas but also suggests a new avenue for future glioma treatment.</p>","author":"Chenzhi Cui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4c1c9f12e4ba0fc0460fd62e26c9270809e8e897d4fe1f9c2071e9823f510c93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
