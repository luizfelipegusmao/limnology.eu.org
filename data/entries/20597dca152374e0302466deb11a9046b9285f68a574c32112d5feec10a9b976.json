{"title":"The People You Can Count on in the Italian Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1652/v1","date":1719211467000,"content":"In the following article, we analyzed a variable present in the ISTAT-BES dataset, namely \"People You Can Count On\"-PYCC for the Italian regions. Following an analysis of the time series aimed at highlighting the trends of the regions, we created a clustering with a k-Means algorithm optimized with the Silhouette coefficient. The data shows the presence of two clusters. We then present an econometric model aimed at estimating the value of PYCC based on a set of socio-economic variables. The results are also discussed in light of the economic policy implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20597dca152374e0302466deb11a9046b9285f68a574c32112d5feec10a9b976","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
