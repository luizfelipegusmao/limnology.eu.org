{"title":"Laser Machining at High &sim;PW/cm2 Intensity and High Throughput","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0038/v1","date":1717397856000,"content":"Laser machining by ultra-short (sub-ps) pulses at high intensity offers high precision, high throughput in terms of area or volume per unit time, and flexibility to adapt processing protocols to different materials on the same workpiece. Here we consider the challenge of optimization for high throughput: how to use the maximum available laser power and larger focal spots for larger ablation volumes by implementing a fast scan. This implies the use of high-intensity pulses approaching âˆ¼PW/cm2 at the threshold where tunnelling ionization starts to contribute to overall ionization. A custom laser micromachining setup was developed and built to enable high speed, large area processing and easy system reconfiguration for different tasks. The main components include laser, stages, scanners, control system, and software. Machining of metals such as Cu, Al, or stainless steel, and fused silica surfaces at high-fluence and high-exposure doses at high scan speeds up to 3 m/s were tested for the fluence scaling of ablation volume, which was found to be linear. Modified surfaces are color-classified for their appearance, which is dependent on surface roughness and chemical modification. Such colour-coding can be used as a feedback parameter for industrial process control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f52b6031fefe6cee62ec564057aa3dd535f046113a24bef8502b035450aae744","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
