{"title":"Ionic Components of Particulate Matter 2.5 May Affect Daily Prevalence of Skin Symptoms in Patients With Allergies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0427/v1","date":1718087183000,"content":"(1)Background：To date, no studies have epidemiologically examined whether the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and its ionic components is related to the prevalence of skin symptoms. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify this association in patients with allergic diseases. (2)Methods: From February 1 to May 31, 2020, we evaluated the daily prevalence of skin symptoms in outpatients with allergic diseases being treated at Fukuoka Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan, and measured the concentration of PM2.5 and its ionic components. （3）Results: Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant association between skin symptoms and the concentration of PM2.5 and the ionic components SO42-, NH4+, K+, and Mg2+, and multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant association between the daily prevalence of skin symptoms and the concentration of the ionic components SO42- or Mg2+. (4)Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the concentration of some PM2.5 ionic components may affect skin symptoms in patients with allergic diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c99ec9ef661d6ce0dc8f7fa39ba6cbbc9e702a6f1a63ed69e08f2bedd451c70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
