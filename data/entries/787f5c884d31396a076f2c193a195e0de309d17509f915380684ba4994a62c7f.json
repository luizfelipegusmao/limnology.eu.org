{"title":"Investigation of Tunable Work Function, Electrostatic Force Microscopy and Band Structure of TiO2 Nanoparticles using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1889/v1","date":1727166035000,"content":"The tunable work function of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles of various sizes was measured using the Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) technique. The analysis of the contact potential difference (CPD) across TiO₂ nanoparticles of different sizes revealed a clear relationship between nanoparticle size, surface roughness, and work function. The study observed work function values ranging from 4.49 eV to 4.57 eV for particle sizes between 3 nm and 85 nm, which were higher than those of bulk TiO₂, likely due to quantum confinement effects. Additionally, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurements showed significant charge-trapping behavior within TiO₂ nanoparticles under different applied bias voltages. The optical analysis also revealed a quantum confinement-induced band gap of 3.35 eV, larger than that of bulk TiO₂, and distinct photoluminescence peaks at 383 nm and 403 nm, corresponding to near-band-edge excitonic emissions and defect-related states. By analyzing the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of TiO₂ nanoparticles using KPFM, the CB and VB positions were calculated based on work function data and bandgap. The results indicated that as particle size increases, both CB and VB energies shift slightly towards lower values, where smaller nanoparticles exhibit larger band gaps and higher work functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"787f5c884d31396a076f2c193a195e0de309d17509f915380684ba4994a62c7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
