{"title":"Advancements in Metabolomics: Illuminating Plant-Microbe Interactions for Enhanced Ecosystems and Agricultural Productivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0670/v1","date":1718096978000,"content":"Plant-microbe interactions are essential for ecosystem health and agricultural productivity. Metabolomics has revolutionized our understanding of these interactions by providing powerful methods to decipher the complex chemical signals involved. This review highlights the various metabolomics techniques used to study plant-microbe interactions, such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and advanced imaging technologies. We also discuss the role of contemporary bioinformatics tools, extensive databases, and the increasing influence of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the analysis of metabolomics data. Integrating metabolomics with other omics fields, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics, allows for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions. The review emphasizes the significance of fluxomics in elucidating the dynamic nature of metabolic networks. While there are challenges in data analysis, integration, and interpretation, metabolomics has profoundly expanded our knowledge of the role metabolites play in shaping plant-microbe interactions. As metabolomics technologies advance and integrate further with other omics approaches, we anticipate groundbreaking discoveries that will provide deeper insights into these complex interactions, ultimately leading to innovative strategies for sustainable agriculture and biotechnology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c35a34aa3cc4e909e664d9e677fd3fd8832167b62f586643ef9b37c39032d661","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
