{"title":"Nitrogen Assimilation, Biomass and Yield in Response to Application of Algal Extracts, Rhizobium sp. and Trichoderma asperellum, as Biofertilizers in Hybrid Maize","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1066/v1","date":1726209968000,"content":"Nitrogen is essential for plant growth, yield and crop quality, and its deficiency limits food production worldwide. In addition, excessive fertilization and inefficient use of N can increase production costs and cause environmental problems. A possible solution to this problem is the application of biofertilizers, which improve N assimilation and enhance biomass and yield. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of the application of the combination of green and red algal (Ulva lactuca, Solieria spp.), Rhizobium sp., Trichoderma asperel-lum and the combination of the above three biofertilizers on N assimilation. A completely ran-domized design was carried out with 10 plants per treatment and five treatments: T1=control; T2=algal extracts; T3=Rhizobium sp.; T4=T. asperellum; T5=T2+T3+T4. Analyses showed that the Rhi-zobium sp. treatment resulted in higher nitrate reductase enzyme activity quantified in maize leaves, which possibly favored more efficient phosphosynthetic activity, reflecting higher bio-mass accumulation and increased yield. The use of Rhizobium sp. showed increases in biomass (13.4%), yield (11.82%), SPAD values (12%), total chlorophyll (18.4%), carotenoids (13.6%), num-ber of leaves (11.4%) and plant height (11.27%) compared to the control. This results in nitrogen assimilation promises to be a key mechanism for sustainable agricultural practices in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae4ebe4913dce17b7845466b03ed48dfa15d0e6dada33fb201a5a0443a97e87c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
