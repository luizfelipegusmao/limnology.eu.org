{"title":"Integration Smart Grids, Distributed Generation, and Cybersecurity: Strategies for Securing and Optimizing Future Energy Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1225/v1","date":1729017091000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive review of the integration and optimization of smart grid (SG) technologies, distributed generation (DG), electric vehicles (EVs), and cybersecurity in the context of modern energy systems. As global energy systems transition towards decentralization and increase reliance on renewable energy, the interplay between these technologies offers significant opportunities to enhance grid flexibility, resilience, and sustainability. The integration of DG systems, supported by advanced battery and fuel cell (FC) technologies, plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the grid and facilitating the adoption of renewable energy. Through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies, EVsÂ provide dynamic solutions for energy storage and demand response (DR), contributing to efficient energy management and peak shaving. A critical focus of this paper is the growing importance of cybersecurity, as the digitization of energy infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. Novel strategies, including artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation, blockchain-based security for energy transactions, and quantum-resistant encryption, are explored to safeguard the future of energy systems. Drawing from global case studies, this review also addresses key challenges such as grid congestion, regulatory barriers, and interoperability, providing a roadmap for optimizing and securing the next generation of energy infrastructures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7766f5871eaccb4eae9c1e7e9d859b3c1719221ac01a6848fe2886bf16dc53b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
