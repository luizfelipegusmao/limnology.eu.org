{"title":"Integrated Scale Adaptive Adjustment Factor Enhanced BlendMask Method for Pineapple Processing System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0699/v1","date":1723196317000,"content":"The study addresses the challenge of efficiently peeling pineapples, which have a distinct elliptical form, thick skin, and small eyes that are difficult to detect with conventional automated methods. This results in significant flesh waste. To improve the process, the researchers developed an integrated system combining an enhanced BlendMask method, termed SAAF-BlendMask, and a PCP method. SAAF-BlendMask improves the detection of small pineapple eyes, while PCP ensures accurate posture adjustment for precise path planning. The system uses 3D vision and deep learning technologies, achieving an average precision (AP) of 73.04% and a small object precision (APs) of 62.54% in eye detection, with a path planning success rate reaching 99%. The fully automated electromechanical system was tested on 110 real pineapples, demonstrating a reduction in flesh waste by 11.7% compared to traditional methods. This study highlights the potential of advanced machine vision and robotics in enhancing the efficiency and precision of food processing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25766087d055969e8262970b53a17c6b6c04b0d15af923692871c839bf036dd8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
