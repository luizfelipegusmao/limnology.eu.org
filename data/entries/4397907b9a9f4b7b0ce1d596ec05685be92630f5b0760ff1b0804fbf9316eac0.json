{"title":"NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors for Antiepileptogenic Drug Discovery and Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0668/v2","date":1716969426000,"content":"Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent and serious brain disorders, affecting 70 million people worldwide. Antiseizure medications (ASMs) though relieve symptoms and prevent the occurrence of future seizures in epileptic patients have limited effect on epileptogenesis. Addressing the multifaceted nature of epileptogenesis and its association with Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms for development of targeted therapeutic strategies beyond conventional antiseizure treatments. Several types of NLRP3 inhibitors have been developed and their effect has been validated both in vitro and in vivo models of epileptogenesis. In this review, we discuss the advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of NLRP3 activation as well as progress made and challenges facing in the development of NLRP3 inhibitors for the treatment of epilepsy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4397907b9a9f4b7b0ce1d596ec05685be92630f5b0760ff1b0804fbf9316eac0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
