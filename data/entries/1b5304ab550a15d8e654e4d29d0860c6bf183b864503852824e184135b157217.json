This article aims to shed light on the experiences of loneliness and its relationship with mental health of adolescents in the Da Nang City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online in early 2023 after 18 months Da Nang lifted its lockdown. The Strength and Difficulties Questionaire, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and the Negative Experience Scale were used to investigate loneliness among adolescents and effects of protective social factors. A total of 1,262 grade 6 to 12 students responded to the surveys. Results indicated that (1) loneliness was a more prominent emotion experienced by these adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown; (2) factors contributing to loneliness were related to illness, social distancing, and a lack of care and attention from parents; (3) loneliness reported mostly was short in duration and mild at level, while there was a significant proportion of prolonged loneliness; and (4) Support from family and friends, however, could reduce the risk of mental health problems for the youngsters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b5304ab550a15d8e654e4d29d0860c6bf183b864503852824e184135b157217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
