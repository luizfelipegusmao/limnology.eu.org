{"title":"Experimental Evaluation of an Innovative Connection for the Reinforcement of Existing Infilled RC Buildings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2297/v1","date":1727586618000,"content":"The retrofitting of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings with Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels presents a promising approach for enhancing seismic performance and overall structural resilience. However, effective integration of CLT with existing RC structures poses significant challenges, particularly concerning the design of connections between CLT panels and the RC structure. This paper introduces a novel connection that addresses these challenges by focusing on both structural and architectural considerations. Structurally, the connection is engineered to provide optimal stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity, ensuring robust performance under seismic and dynamic loads. Architecturally, the design incorporates a pre-defined weak component that facilitates easy access and rapid replacement of damaged parts, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance efforts. The proposed connection was evaluated through a series of monotonic and cyclic loading tests, demonstrating its structural efficiency and reliability. The results indicate that the new connection system not only meets the necessary structural requirements but also offers practical benefits for maintenance and repair, contributing to the overall sustainability and resilience of retrofitted RC buildings. This innovative approach represents a significant advancement in the field of structural retrofitting, providing a viable solution for integrating CLT panels into existing RC frameworks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a88f56595198cbc5db236a01793e2cddd398aa1ce62102c62d06486a82f622a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
