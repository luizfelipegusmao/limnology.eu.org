Despite their importance in veterinary medicine, only little is known about <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. colonizing and infecting cats. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to isolate and identify <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. colonizing hospitalized and non-hospitalized domestic cats and analyze their antimicrobial resistance profiles, genetic diversity, and risk factors associated with MRS colonization. A total of 218 oral and axillary swabs were obtained from 109 cats, including 77 non-hospitalized and 32 hospitalized cats. After plating on selective media, the isolates were identified via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and <i>rpo</i>B and <i>16S rRNA</i> gene sequencing. Subsequently, antimicrobial sensitivity of the strains was assessed, and they were screened for <i>mec</i>A gene. Methicillin-resistant <i>S</i>. <i>haemolyticus</i> (MRSH) isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing, whereas methicillin-resistant <i>S</i>. <i>pseudintermedius</i> (MRSP) and <i>S</i>. <i>felis</i> isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing. <i>S</i>. <i>felis</i> was most commonly isolated from non-hospitalized cats (28.1%), whereas <i>S</i>. <i>pseudintermedius</i> and MRS were commonly isolated from hospitalized cats (25%). MRSH isolates from hospitalized animals were classified as ST3. The identified MRSP strains belonged to two well-known sequence types, ST551 and ST71. Moreover, antimicrobial use (<i>p</i> = 0.0001), hospitalization (<i>p</i> = 0.0141), and comorbidities (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were associated with increased MRS prevalence in cats.","author":"Thayanne Gabryelle Viana de Souza","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"07750f9b67ed79cee7f9100fa743a4471690a084117461a16d5f731039660ff6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
