{"title":"Examination of Vitreolenticular Interface in Relation to Different Parameters of Phacoemulsification in the Early and Late Postoperative Period","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1485/v1","date":1721290746000,"content":"Background: Surgical parameters of phacoemulsification can have a significant impact on behavior of anterior hyaloid membrane (AHM). Methods: In a prospective study using anterior segment optical coherence tomograph the attachment or detachment of AHM of 82 eyes were examined after uneventful phacoemulsification preoperatively and postoperatively over a 1-year period. The impact of capsulorhexis size, number of hydrodissections, difficulty of nucleus rotation, nuclear sclerosis grade, cumulative dissipated energy (CDE), ultrasonic time, total surgical time, difficulty of irrigation/aspiration, intensity of capsular polish, weakness of zonular fibers, presence of lens materials in Berger's space (LM-BS), and fluid usage were investigated related to the behavior of AHM. Results: In presence of zonular weakness and high CDE, a significant linear trend was observed regarding anterior vitreous detachment (AVD) at all postoperative times. Similarly, AVD is observed at 1-month, 3-month, and 1-year follow-up in cases of high nuclear sclerosis grade and high fluid usage. A significant linear trend was observed in the case of zonular weakness, hard nucleus and extensive capsular polish with LM-BS, while CDE, total surgical time, and fluid usage were significantly higher in these cases. Conclusions: Zonular weakness, high CDE, hard nucleus and high fluid usage are risk factors of postoperative AVD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d00fa2106401c999ec703de6ca8bc85666c58e14aceecba01f89fa68abba565e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
