{"title":"Exploring the natural efficacy of spirulina powder for combating obesity, diabetes, and inflammation","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13734?af=R","date":1720853097000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>An increasing incidence of metabolic disorders emphasizes the need to explore natural treatments. Spirulina, a microalga with a rich nutrient profile, offers a promising solution for obesity, diabetes, and inflammation. This study provides a meticulous analysis of spirulina powder, evaluating its physicochemical attributes and technofunctional properties through the use of advanced analytical techniques.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Spirulina powder demonstrated strong flowability, substantial water and oil absorption capacity, and moderate foaming characteristics. The ethanolic extract of spirulina was found to be a repository of phenolic (6.93 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (7.17 mg QE/g) compounds, manifesting considerable antioxidant activity with a 58.49 g kg<sup>−1</sup> inhibition of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. The extract also exhibited pronounced inhibitory effects on lipase and amylase enzymes, with inhibition percentages of 72.05 g kg<sup>−1</sup> and 70.28 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and displayed a glucose retention capacity of 1.28 mg dL<sup>−1</sup> (68.52 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) in a dialysis membrane assay. These results suggest its efficacy in modulating obesity and glycemic control. The powder also showed a potent anti-inflammatory response by mitigating protein denaturation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Spirulina powder is a potent natural agent with multiple health benefits, meriting its incorporation into functional foods. It could be suitable for application in the food industry, offering a natural strategy to combat metabolic diseases. This research adds to the scientific literature on spirulina, paving the way for future research into its utilization. © 2024 The Author(s).
