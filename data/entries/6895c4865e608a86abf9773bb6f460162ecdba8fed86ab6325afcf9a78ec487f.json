{"title":"Brassica rapa BrICE1 and BrICE2 Positively Regulate the Cold Tolerance via CBFs and ROS Pathways, Balancing Growth and Defense in Transgenic Arabidopsis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0615/v1","date":1725864145000,"content":"Winter rapeseed (Brassica rapa) has good chilling and freezing tolerance. INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE) plays a crucial role in cold signaling in plant; however, its role in B. rapa remains unclear. In this study, we identified 41 ICE1 homologous genes from 6 widely cultivated Brassica species. These genes exhibited high conservation, with evolutionary complexity between diploid and allotetraploid species. Cold stress induced ICE1 homolog expression, with differences between strong and weak cold-tolerant varieties. Two novel ICE1 paralogs, BrICE1 and BrICE2 were cloned from B. rapa Longyou 6. Subcellular localization assays showed that they localized to the nucleus, and low temperature did not affect their nuclear localization. Overexpression of BrICE1 and BrICE2 increased cold tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that overexpression of BrICE1 and BrICE2 inhibited root growth in Arabidopsis, and low temperatures could induce the degradation of BrICE1 and BrICE2 via the 26S-proteasome pathway. In summary, ICE1 ho-mologous genes exhibit complex evolutionary relationships in Brassica species, and are involved in the CBF pathway, and ROS scavenging mechanism in response to cold stress; these regulating mechanisms might be also responsible for balancing the development and cold defense of B. rapa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6895c4865e608a86abf9773bb6f460162ecdba8fed86ab6325afcf9a78ec487f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
