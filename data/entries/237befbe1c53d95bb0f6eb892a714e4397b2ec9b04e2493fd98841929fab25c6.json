{"title":"Quetiapine in the ICU: A Paradigm Shift from Sedation to Targeted Delirium Therapy &ndash; a Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2341/v1","date":1727691818000,"content":"Delirium and agitation are common and challenging issues in the intensive care unit (ICU), leading to longer hospital length of stay, prolonged need of mechanical ventilation, and higher costs. These conditions also increase the risk of complications and mortality. In the ICU setting it is common to observe an inappropriate use of sedatives and antipsychotics to manage agitation without an accurate diagnosis. Although the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) has improved the reliability, accuracy, and specificity of delirium diagnosis, it is important to consider that delirium may be a symptom caused by a variety of diseases and medical conditions like sepsis rather than just a neurological problem. Antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, are often used in the ICU to manage these symptoms effectively. Quetiapine is a particularly valuable therapeutic option because of its capability to reduce agitation and delirium without significantly affecting the respiratory function, making it a safer choice for critically ill patients. This review explores quetiapineâ€™s pharmacodynamics, side effects, efficacy, and recently described uses in the ICU. A comprehensive search was conducted across six major databases, and articles were assessed based on their relevance and quality. Our findings aim to provide a clear understanding of the application of quetiapine and its potential value in critical care settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"237befbe1c53d95bb0f6eb892a714e4397b2ec9b04e2493fd98841929fab25c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
