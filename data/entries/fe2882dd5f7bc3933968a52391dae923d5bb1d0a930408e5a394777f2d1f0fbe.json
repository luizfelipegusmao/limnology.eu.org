{"title":"Granulometry and Functional Properties of Yuca Flour (Yucca decipiens Trel.) for Agro-Industrial and Food Purposes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0224/v1","date":1727945846000,"content":"Mexican yuca (Yucca decipiens Trel.) is native to the semidesert region across north-central Mexico. Based on its empirical medicinal uses, the flour produced from leaves and stems of yuca was evaluated to determine its agro-industrial and medicinal uses (food, beer, and mezcal). The flour was characterized based on the granulometry, rheology, texture, and functional properties, which were analyzed with the RStudio software. The results indicate that the water absorption capacity of yuca flour (data here) is similar to wheat flour; however, it absorbs half the volume of oil than wheat flour. Therefore, it has a hydrophilic behavior similar to that of wheat and a lower oil requirement for formulas. The expansion capacity of yuca flour is like that of wheat flour, showing an ideal gluten content for agro-industrial purposes (food) that require this structural component. The flour had a remarkable foam formation, high stability, and low-fat content. These results are particularly important for foods that require foaming properties. Fermentation matched the parameters of the 56-60 Physicochemical Test Methods of the Cereal &amp;amp; Grains Association; consequently, their flours are classified as equal to flours produced from soft and weak wheat, supporting their use for fermentation processes. The internal friction values (0.85-0.92) suggest a limited flow; however, its high density shows a fine granulometry that facilitates the sacking, handling, and storing of the flour, complying with the Mexican standards, and allowing it to be added to combinations aimed to enrich food.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe2882dd5f7bc3933968a52391dae923d5bb1d0a930408e5a394777f2d1f0fbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
