{"title":"Advancements in Precision Oncology: AI and Machine Learning Applications in Digital Pathology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0378/v1","date":1717721258000,"content":"Over the past 10 years, developments in precision oncology have led to a rise in the demand for predictive tools that assist the screening and stratification of patients for treatment. The possibility digitizing tissue slide images has led to the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms in digital pathology, which could ultimately improve patient care. In this context, we assessed a variety of AI-based computational models for digital pathology. In this review, we described the latest AI applications in oncology, current challenges and future prospects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf4168cf0453113f061f3023a19eba3430ec7f83a8bbf674152f7950877ca802","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
