{"title":"Roles of three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in triterpene biosynthesis and their potential impact on growth and development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1407/7721083?rss=1","date":1721865600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pentacyclic triterpenoids, recognized for their natural bioactivity, display complex spatiotemporal accumulation patterns within the ecological model plant <span>Nicotiana attenuata</span>. Despite their ecological importance, the underlying biosynthetic enzymes and functional attributes of triterpenoid synthesis in <span>N. attenuata</span> remain unexplored. Here, we show that 3 cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (NaCYP716A419, NaCYP716C87, and NaCYP716E107) from <span>N. attenuata</span> oxidize the pentacyclic triterpene skeleton, as evidenced by heterologous expression in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span>. NaCYP716A419 catalyzed a consecutive 3-step oxidation reaction at the C28 position of β-amyrin/lupeol/lupanediol, yielding the corresponding alcohol, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid. NaCYP716C87 hydroxylated the C2α position of β-amyrin/lupeol/lupanediol/erythrodiol/oleanolic acid/betulinic acid, while NaCYP716E107 hydroxylated the C6β position of β-amyrin/oleanolic acid. The genes encoding these 3 CYP716 enzymes are highly expressed in flowers and respond to induction by ABA, MeJA, SA, GA<sub>3</sub>, and abiotic stress treatments. Using VIGS technology, we revealed that silencing of <span>NaCYP716A419</span> affects the growth and reproduction of <span>N. attenuata</span>, suggesting the ecological significance of these specialized metabolite biosynthetic steps.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d07e95eee5599037ee30706d4acded49a25e78e3a2018f65e6e12ce1ecb037b3","category":"Environment"}
