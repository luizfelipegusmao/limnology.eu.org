Part II: What the FLIP, FLAP, FRAP, FRET, and FLIM is Going On?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/5/53/7774346?rss=1","date":1727222400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The use of fluorescence in imaging has been a pivotal factor in advancing our scientific understanding. As microscopy continues to evolve, the terminology used to describe these techniques becomes increasingly complex, often resulting in a bewildering array of acronyms that resemble alphabet soup. Among the most prominent acronyms are those associated with advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques: Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP), Fluorescence Localization after Photobleaching (FLAP), Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP), Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). Each of these methods provides invaluable insights into molecular dynamics and interactions within living cells and tissues. This article, Part 2 of the <span>Alphabet Soup of Microscopy</span> series, aims to clarify these widely used fluorescence microscopy techniques and to illuminate their contributions to our understanding of cellular processes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"fc155a2fef5fd5fb163e1052f5dfcd1cb0e2b86db574b6e1ad63e0d6c61b9087","category":"Environment"}
