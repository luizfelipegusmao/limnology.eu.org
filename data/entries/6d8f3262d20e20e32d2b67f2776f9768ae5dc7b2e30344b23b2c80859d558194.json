{"title":"Validity and Reliability of the GAITWell&reg;: A Low-Cost Modular System for Gait Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1386/v1","date":1718865070000,"content":"Background: Gait analysis systems offer invaluable insights for rehabilitation, yet their expense limits clinician access. We developed GAITWell®, a low-cost modular system for capturing spatiotemporal gait variables, and evaluated its measurement properties. Methods: The GAITWell® uses discreet binary sensors on interconnected boards to collect gait data, which is then analyzed using the DBSCAN algorithm on the Cartesian points from sensor outputs. Reliability was assessed using ICC2,1, standard error of the mean (SEM) and Bland-Altman plots. Validity was determined by comparing GAITWell® with the Qualisys Pro-Reflex system. Results: Participated 38 healthy adults, with an average age of 33.2 years (SD 13.0). Correlations between GAITWell® and the Qualisys system ranged from moderate to very high for most gait variables, with the exception of stride length, which demonstrated a low but significant correlation (r = .360, p &amp;lt; .05). The ICC2,1 indicated moderate to good agreement for most gait variables. Stance and double support times, cadence, and base of support exhibited poor reliability, characterized by larger SEM and limits of agreement. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the GAITWell® system is a promising tool for gait analysis. Future research will enhance sensor accuracy and refine algorithms to improve reliability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d8f3262d20e20e32d2b67f2776f9768ae5dc7b2e30344b23b2c80859d558194","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
