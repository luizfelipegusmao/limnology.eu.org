{"title":"The Influence of Corporate Social Responsibility on Supplier Relationship Management in E-Commerce","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1079/v1","date":1720927894000,"content":"This qualitative research investigates the influence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) within the e-commerce sector. Through semi-structured interviews and secondary data analysis, the study explores motivations, challenges, impacts, and strategic outcomes of integrating CSR practices into supplier relationships. Motivations for adopting CSR include ethical considerations, regulatory compliance, and meeting stakeholder expectations, reflecting a strategic alignment with corporate values and societal demands. Challenges such as resource constraints, regulatory complexities, and cultural differences highlight operational hurdles and strategic considerations e-commerce firms face in implementing CSR initiatives effectively. The study reveals that CSR enhances trust, collaboration, and risk mitigation within e-commerce supply chains through transparent communication, shared values, and ethical practices. Strategically, CSR contributes to enhanced brand equity, competitive advantage, and long-term value creation by differentiating firms in competitive markets and attracting socially conscious consumers and investors. However, economic trade-offs, stakeholder divergence, and operational complexities require firms to adopt adaptive strategies that balance short-term financial goals with long-term sustainability objectives. The findings suggest avenues for future research exploring longitudinal impacts of CSR on supplier relationships, cross-sectoral comparisons, and technological advancements in CSR-driven SRM practices. Practically, e-commerce firms should prioritize strategic alignment of CSR initiatives with core business objectives, engage stakeholders in CSR strategy development, and embrace continuous improvement to foster ethical conduct, stakeholder trust, and sustainable business practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2eca6ea43e1600980e34aa636631dd1eb032469f3648d13ef688ab3347e424ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
