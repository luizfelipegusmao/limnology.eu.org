{"title":"Emergency Surgical Management of Acute Bowel Obstruction Due to Colonic Malignancy at a District General Hospital in Greece. A 10-Year Retrospective Study (2012 &ndash; 2022)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1085/v1","date":1721041396000,"content":"In this 10-year retrospective study we used the data from patients who were operated upon due to acute bowel obstruction, at the Surgical Department of General Hospital of Katerini in Greece, from 2012 to 2022. Patients were classified based on the date of operation, their sex, their age group (ranging from 26 to 92 years) and the etiology of the bowel obstruction. A sample of 197 patients was studied. Out of these, it was found that in 73 (37%) the cause of the obstruction was colorectal cancer. In 46 of those patients (63%) the tumor was resected, while in the remaining  27 (37%), some kind of diverting stoma was installed. In 17(43,5%) of the 39 total patients, who suffered from some kind of rectosigmoid cancer, Hartmann's operation was chosen. Our results showcase that, at district hospitals, the surgeon is sometimes obligated to a damage control approach regarding obstructive colon cancer and thus the majority of the patients will eventually end up with a stoma.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5620ba44d3e3e78a2204e2dbbeedb38b4d04dd14a5daf1c7e0da78005ccd88e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
