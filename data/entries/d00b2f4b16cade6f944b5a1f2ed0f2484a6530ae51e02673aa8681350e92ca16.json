The effect of configuration mixing in chiral quark model (ChQM) is studied by \ncalculating the effective potential between two nonstrange baryons in the channels I J = 01, 10 and \n03. For comparison the results of color screening model (CSM) are also presented. Generally the \nconfiguration mixing will lower the potential when the separation between two baryons is small, and \nits effect will be ignorable when the separation becomes large. Due to the screened color confinement, \nthe configuration mixing is rather large, which leads to stronger intermediate-range attraction in \nCSM. while the effect of configuration mixing is small in ChQM due to the quadratic","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d00b2f4b16cade6f944b5a1f2ed0f2484a6530ae51e02673aa8681350e92ca16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
