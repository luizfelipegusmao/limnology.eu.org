{"title":"Mesophyll conductance limits photosynthesis in fluctuating light under combined drought and heat stresses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1498/7416768?rss=1","date":1699833600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought and heat stresses usually occur concomitantly in nature, with increasing frequency and intensity of both stresses expected due to climate change. The synergistic agricultural impacts of these compound climate extremes are much greater than those of the individual stresses. However, the mechanisms by which drought and heat stresses separately and concomitantly affect dynamic photosynthesis have not been thoroughly assessed. To elucidate this, we used tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) seedlings to measure dynamic photosynthesis under individual and compound stresses of drought and heat. Individual drought and heat stresses limited dynamic photosynthesis at the stages of diffusional conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> and biochemistry, respectively. However, the primary limiting factor for photosynthesis shifted to mesophyll conductance under the compound stresses. Compared with the control, photosynthetic carbon gain in fluctuating light decreased by 38%, 73%, and 114% under the individual drought, heat, and compound stresses, respectively. Therefore, compound stresses caused a greater reduction in photosynthetic carbon gain in fluctuating light conditions than individual stress. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating the effects of compound climate extremes on crop productivity by targeting mesophyll conductance and improving dynamic photosynthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"495fa1b73f68cd1470f559083efd525bd97a4de8716a221e3779fc156f8b936e","category":"Environment"}
