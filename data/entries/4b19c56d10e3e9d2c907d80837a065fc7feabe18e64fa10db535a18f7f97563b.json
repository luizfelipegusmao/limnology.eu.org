{"title":"Cofiring of renewable biodiesel fuels inside natural gas flame for enhancement of thermal properties of flame and NOx reduction","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14388?af=R","date":1710219489000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigates the co-combustion of palm oil biodiesel fuel, as a renewable alternative for diesel fuel, inside natural gas flame to enhance the flame thermal specifications and NOx reduction. A power natural gas burner with a maximum heat capacity of 418,400 kJ/h was installed at the inlet of a laboratory furnace and biodiesel fuel was injected inside natural gas burner with a 100 <b>\n   <i>μ</i>\n</b>m in diameter solid cone nozzle. Flame temperature, thermal radiation, Infrared radiation, and CO, CO<sub>2</sub> and NOx emission were measured. The results revealed that biodiesel injection increases the flame size and turns the non-luminous blue flame into yellow-colored flame. Furthermore, higher flash point and Sauter Mean Diameter of biodiesel promote the thermal decomposition of fuel droplets and increase the concentrations of Intermediate Soot Particles in the flame which in turn increases the flame emissivity coefficient and consequently flame thermal radiation. Also, the oxygen content of biodiesel fuel has an important role in the complete combustion of Intermediate Soot Particles to CO<sub>2</sub> which increases the heat release of biodiesel combustion and raises the flame temperature. The average enhancement in thermal radiation and flame temperature were 5.6% and 43.38%, respectively. Finally, although biodiesel injection increases the flame temperature, it also increases the flame surface reaction and eliminates the hot spot region in the flame. Therefore, the rate of heat generation per unit volume of flame decreases and this decreases the rate of NOx emission as much as 10.84%.</p>","author":"S.H. Pourhoseini, \nZ.
