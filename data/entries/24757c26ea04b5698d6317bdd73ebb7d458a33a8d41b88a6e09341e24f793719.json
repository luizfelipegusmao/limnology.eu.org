{"title":"Study on the effect of enzymolysis combined fermentation on reducing the off‐flavor of egg white powder","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13616?af=R","date":1725860041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The application of egg white powder (EWP) was subject to its off-flavor. In the present study, flavourzyme and lactic acid bacteria were used to treat egg white powder (EWP) and the mechanism effects of enzymolysis–fermentation were explored.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Compared with the control group, enzymolysis combined with fermentation treatment group (EW-EF) reduced the four-representative off-flavor compounds (geranyl acetone, 1-octen-3-ol, octanal and nonanal) by more than 62.66%. Fermentation produced esters with good flavor, and enzymolysis produced fresh amino acids. Characterization of protein structure indicated that fermentation decreased both fluorescence intensity and surface negative charges, accelerating the aggregation of proteins; enzymolysis promoted aggregation and degradation, improving the stability of the egg white proteins. Meanwhile, enzymolysis broke down the hydrophobic cavities bound to off-flavor compounds, releasing protein-bound off-flavor compounds and removing them through fermentation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>EW-EF had the best effect of off-flavor removal on EWP. The results of the present study could provide a green and effective method for improving the flavor of EWP. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yujie Chen, \nLulu Ma, \nYing Liu, \nJiaying Huo, \nYing Gao, \nShijian Dong, \nShugang Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"24757c26ea04b5698d6317bdd73ebb7d458a33a8d41b88a6e09341e24f793719","category":"Environment"}
