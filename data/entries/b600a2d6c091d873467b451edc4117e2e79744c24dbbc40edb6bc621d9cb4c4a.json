{"title":"Molecular Docking, Dynamic Simulation, and ADMET Analysis of the Crystal Structure of Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 2 (DYRK2) in Complex with Hypericin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0123/v1","date":1725355868000,"content":"or the first time, this communication is intended to perform the possible biological role of natural compound Hypericin, in the Crystal Structure of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), by Molecular and Dynamic Simulation. From Docking analysis by Autodock Vina and Autodock 4, Hypericin shows a significant ability to binds to DYRK2 protein, an important receptor for cell growth and development. Indeed, from docking studies Hypericin reports a binding energy value of about -13 kcal/mol and Estimated Inhibition Constant (Ki)of ca  1nM . Regarding MD simulation.From our results, this theoretical research it could has excellent future implications in the fight against cancer disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b600a2d6c091d873467b451edc4117e2e79744c24dbbc40edb6bc621d9cb4c4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
