{"title":"Spatial variations in the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network density and analysis of the connectomic parameters","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303515","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Junning Chen, Marta Aido, Andreas Roschger, Alexander van Tol, Sara Checa, Bettina M. Willie, Richard Weinkamer</p>\r\n\r\nOsteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) is comprised of micrometre-sized pores and submicrometric wide channels in bone. Accumulating evidence suggests multiple functions of this network in material transportation, mechanobiological signalling, mineral homeostasis and bone remodelling. Combining rhodamine staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the longitudinal cross-sections of six mouse tibiae were imaged, and the connectome of the network was quantified with a focus on the spatial heterogeneities of network density, connectivity and length of canaliculi. <i>In-vivo</i> loading and double calcein labelling on these tibiae allowed differentiating the newly formed bone from the pre-existing regions. The canalicular density of the murine cortical bone varied between 0.174 and 0.243 μm/μm<sup>3</sup>, and therefore is three times larger than the corresponding value for human femoral midshaft osteons. The spatial heterogeneity of the network was found distinctly more pronounced across the cortex than along the cortex. We found that in regions with a dense network, the LCN conserves its largely tree-like character, but increases the density by including shorter canaliculi. The current study on healthy mice should serve as a motivating starting point to study the connectome of genetically modified mice, including models of bone diseases and of reduced mechanoresponse.","author":"Junning Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9e7f71567732b0dc041cb89b6e1795394688438080528da63ebb1a510741ae2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
