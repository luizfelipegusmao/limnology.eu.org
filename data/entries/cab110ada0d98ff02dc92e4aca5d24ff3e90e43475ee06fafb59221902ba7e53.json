To enhance patients’ self-awareness of their health status, encouraging active participation in care process, and to support nurses in delivering patient-centered care, we have developed an innovative platform with a highly customized app. This platform was designed using a multi-disciplinary bottom-up approach. Patient data collection and processing facilitate the automation of care timeline planning, based on real time patients’ needs and the available resources. To achieve this goal different components have been considered: real-time health data collection and processing, patient care planning, decision support for nurses, secure communication for data transmission, and user-friendly interfaces to ensure easy access to platform functionalities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cab110ada0d98ff02dc92e4aca5d24ff3e90e43475ee06fafb59221902ba7e53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
