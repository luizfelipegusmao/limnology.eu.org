{"title":"Non-dispersive Extraction of Chromium(VI) by Cyphos IL102/Solvesso 100 Using the Pseudo-Emulsion Based Strip Dispersion Membrane Operation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1463/v1","date":1713870598000,"content":"The removal of chromium(VI) from acidic (HCl) medium through non-dispersive extraction with strip dispersion (NDXSD) was investigated using a microporous PVDF membrane support in a permeation cell. The ionic liquid Cyphos IL102 (phosphonium salt) in Solvesso 100 was used as organic phase. In NDXSD the stripping phase (NaOH) is dispersed in the organic phase in the cell side with an impeller stirrer adequate to form a strip dispersion. This pseudo-emulsion phase (organic + strip solutions) provides a constant supply of the Cyphos IL102/Solvesso 100 to the membrane phase. Various hydrodynamic and chemical parameters, such as variation in the feed and pseudo-emulsion stirring speeds, HCl and Cr(VI) concentrations in the feed phase, and carrier concentration, were investigated. From the experimental data, several mass transfer coefficients were estimated, as well as it was investigated the performance of the present system against other ionic liquids and the presence of base metals in the feed phase.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"408d8aa13b6b5bf07762464e6241d2f37f0cbc5f7de3fbc161f8ae0891bee680","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
