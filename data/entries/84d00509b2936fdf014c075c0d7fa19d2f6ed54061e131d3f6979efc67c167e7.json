{"title":"Genetic, Inflammatory and Immunological Biomarkers for the Early Assessment of Allergic Asthma: A Current Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1989/v1","date":1721887404000,"content":"Asthma is a complex syndrome with multiple phenotypes and endotypes, and current diagnostic tools often fail to address this, therefore there is an increasing need for new predicting biomarkers for asthma which can enable personalized treatment strategies. Biomarkers can facilitate earlier diagnosis of asthma, potentially identifying the disease before clinical symptoms appear. This allows for early intervention, which can prevent asthma progression and complications and improve long-term outcomes. Reliable biomarkers can help in monitoring disease activity and treatment efficacy in real-time and can also lead to better disease management, reducing hospitalizations, emergency visits, and overall healthcare costs associated with poorly controlled asthma. Severe asthma patients often do not respond well to standard treatments. New biomarkers can help identify these patients and guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches specifically for severe asthma. In this review we summarize different candidate biomarkers on several levels of investigation: Genetic, subclinical inflammatory, allergen-specific immune response, and trained immunity, which could be promising for the early detection of asthma and better management of exacerbation and severity of symptoms in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84d00509b2936fdf014c075c0d7fa19d2f6ed54061e131d3f6979efc67c167e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
