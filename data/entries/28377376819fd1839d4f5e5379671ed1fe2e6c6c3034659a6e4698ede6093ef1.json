{"title":"Citrulline facilitates the glycolysis, proliferation, and metastasis of lung cancer cells by regulating RAB3C","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24326?af=R","date":1716289183000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lung cancer (LC) is one of the major malignant diseases threatening human health. The study aimed to identify the effect of citrulline on the malignant phenotype of LC cells and to further disclose the potential molecular mechanism of citrulline in regulating the development of LC, providing a novel molecular biological basis for the clinical treatment of LC. The effects of citrulline on the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of LC cells (A549, H1299) were validated by CCK-8, colony formation, EdU, and transwell assays. The cell glycolysis was assessed via determining the glucose uptake, lactate production, ATP levels, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). RNA-seq and molecular docking were performed to screen for citrulline-binding target proteins. Western blotting experiments were conducted to examine the expression of related signaling pathway molecules. In addition, the impacts of citrulline on LC growth in vivo were investigated by constructing mouse models. Citrulline augmented the viability of LC cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The proliferation, migration, invasion, glycolysis, and EMT processes of LC cells were substantially enhanced after citrulline treatment. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that citrulline could bind to RAB3C protein. Western blotting results indicated that citrulline activated the IL-6/STAT3 pathway by binding to RAB3C. In addition, animal experiments disclosed that citrulline promoted tumor growth in mice. Citrulline accelerated the glycolysis and activated the IL6/STAT3 pathway through the RAB3C protein, consequently facilitating the development of LC.</p>","author":"Qingjun Meng, \nYanguang Li, \nZhen Sun, \nJunfeng Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"28377376819fd1839d4f5e5379671ed1fe2e6c6c3034659a6e4698ede6093ef1","category":"Environment"}
