{"title":"Job Stress, Burnout, and Turnover Intention of Clinical Research Associates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1978/v1","date":1727240895000,"content":"Objective: This study aimed to analyze the general characteristics, job stress, burnout, and turnover intentions of Clinical Research Associates (CRAs). Our objective was to provide a reference point for devising strategies to reduce CRA turnover and burnout rates. Methods: A descriptive, quantitative, and correlative research design was used. A total of 126 CRAs completed a questionnaire that consisted of 115 items, with 21 items on general characteristics, 60 items on occupation-al role, and 10 items on personal strain in job stress. The Burnout Inventory scale was used to investigate 22 items of burnout, and turnover intentions was measured using a 5-item scale. Results: Of the 126 participants, 63 (50%) answered that they intended to leave their job within 1 year &amp; the most of participants were nurse (n = 56, 44.4%). Job stress related to the occupational role of CRAâ€™s vocational stress (r = 0.518), burnout (r = 0.406), and turnover intention (r = 0.181) of personal strain were correlated with each other. Job stress due to personal strain had an explanatory power of 18.7% as a factor influencing turnover intention. Conclusions: To reduce the turnover intention of CRAs, who play an important role in clinical research, it is necessary to find ways to re-duce job stress and burnout.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84a3216cc2dd166751b3b69276b948d16ff937a9592562bc38e7ca919d3762ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
