{"title":"The association between physical activity intensity and frailty risk among older adults across different age groups and genders: Evidence from four waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305346","date":1718114400000,"content":"<p>by Di Ma, Yulin Sun, Guoyang Chen, Siwei Hao, Zhenping Jiang, Rui Wang, Shuaipeng Hao</p>\r\n\r\n\"Exercise is the best medicine\" is well known, but the optimal dose of physical activity (PA) for males and females across different age groups is still unknown. This study, using data from the four waves of CHARLS, aimed to determine the optimal PA dose that reduces frailty risks among older adults across various age groups and both sexes. We created a frailty index score using 63 health-related variables and used 0.21 as the frailty cut point. Binary logistic regression was used to compare the effect of vigorous, moderate, and light intensity PA under IPAQ criteria on frailty risk. The study found that regardless of whether males or females, the optimal effect of vigorous-intensity PA in reducing the risk of frailty is consistently observed throughout the entire old age career. Moreover, the age groups at which moderate-intensity PA reduces the risk of frailty were from age 70 for males and from age 80 for females. And light-intensity PA had no effect on reducing the risk of frailty. Moderate and vigorous intensity of PA in older adults should be promoted, but guidelines and recommendations must account for optimal associations with PA dose across genders and age groups.","author":"Di Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1da38c8509766a365997e06e24f43db46a7ad099cc8ec04d27119bdb6ac0550c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
