While converging behavioral evidence supports the IPH, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the neurophysiological markers of sensitivity to speech rhythm cues during silent word reading. Methods: EEG was recorded while participants silently read four-word sequences, each composed of either trochaic words (stressed on the first syllable) or iambic words (stressed on the second syllable). Each sequence was followed by a target word that was either metrically congruent or incongruent with the preceding rhythmic pattern. Results: Single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency representations (TFRs) triggered by the target words were examined using a hierarchical mass univariate general linear modeling approach to investigate the effects of metrical expectancy and stress type. ERP findings revealed significant differences based on expectancy, with words carrying unexpected stress eliciting larger negativities between 240-628 ms after word onset. TFRs further revealed that different frequency bands were sensitive to distinct aspects of rhythmic structure in language. Alpha activity, linked to attention, reflected expectations about the rhythmic pattern. Theta and beta activity, associated with processing rhythm and timing, were sensitive to both the expected rhythm and the specific location of stressed syllables within words. Conclusions: These findings highlight comparable neurophysiological responses to both implicit and explicit speech rhythm, further supporting the IPH and emphasizing the role of prosody in silent reading.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b96a2d05f52e16a4652119dbfa23f538098e889876fe965cebd7f374267b8db5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
