{"title":"Developmental stages and episode-specific regulatory genes in andromonoecious melon flower development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/2/305/7457935?rss=1","date":1701475200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Given the lack of specific studies on floral development in melon (<span>Cucumis melo</span> L.), we carried out an extensive study involving morphological and transcriptomic analyses to characterize floral development in this species.<div>Methods</div>Using an andromonoecious line, we analysed the development of floral buds in male and hermaphrodite flowers with both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Based on flower lengths, we established a correlation between the developmental stages and four main episodes of floral development and conducted an extensive RNA sequencing analysis of these episodes.<div>Key Results</div>We identified 12 stages of floral development, from the appearance of the floral meristems to anthesis. The main structural differences between male and hermaphrodite flowers appeared between stages 6 and 7; later stages of development leading to the formation of organs and structures in both types of flowers were also described. We analysed the gene expression patterns of the four episodes in flower development to find the genes that were specific to each given episode. Among others, we identified genes that defined the passage from one episode to the next according to the ABCDE model of floral development.<div>Conclusions</div>This work combines a detailed morphological analysis and a comprehensive transcriptomic study to enable characterization of the structural and molecular mechanisms that determine the floral development of an andromonoecious genotype in melon. Taken together, our results provide a first insight into gene regulation networks in melon floral development that are crucial for flowering and pollen formation, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve crop yield of melon in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"16e7d33176175c282a41e92428d8490b1a18f3888df3c1ce29604ab49a772d23","category":"Environment"}
