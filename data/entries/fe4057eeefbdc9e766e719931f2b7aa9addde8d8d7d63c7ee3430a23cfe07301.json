{"title":"Protection of Biocultural Heritage in the Anthropocene: Towards Reconciling Natural, Cultural, Tangible and Intangible Heritage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jel/article/35/3/353/7209749?rss=1","date":1687910400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This article examines the effectiveness, legitimacy, and fairness of heritage conservation outcomes under the 1972 World Heritage Convention (1972 WHC), with a focus on recognising and respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples in heritage nomination, protection, and management. Examining conflicts surrounding World Heritage sites in Kenya and Sweden, this article argues that recognition of biocultural heritage and biocultural rights can promote environmental justice and help meet global environmental challenges. To promote the conservation of both built and natural landscapes, the article recommends expanding protection for the relationship between humans and their environment. Recognising biocultural heritage under UNESCO conventions could promote Indigenous sovereignty, protect cultural and natural heritage, and contribute to global efforts to address climate change. The article calls for further research mapping biocultural heritage in natural and mixed heritage sites and advocates for fuller engagement with Indigenous Peoples to increase the ability of the 1972 WHC to promote sustainability as it enters its second half-century.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Environmental Law Current Issue","siteHash":"d0caeee440a105ac55789e8609e0b01f5d84cefdaed670832b152a3f460f0e91","entryHash":"fe4057eeefbdc9e766e719931f2b7aa9addde8d8d7d63c7ee3430a23cfe07301","category":"Environment"}
