In practice, aberration in projective lens (or equivalent) can result in significant distortion of the measured diffraction patterns, especially when complex post-specimen optics are involved, such as doing 4D-STEM using the EELS camera. The projector lens aberration (PLA) causes issues when the entire Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) pattern is utilized for ptychographic reconstruction including the extended ptychographical iterative engine (ePIE) method.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"94ade470849b9773df438e61ed9f25c26179d67ddacf23020a575e6d0d41fb4e","category":"Environment"}
