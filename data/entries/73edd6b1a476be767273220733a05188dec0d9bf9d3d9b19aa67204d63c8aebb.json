{"title":"An integrative approach to the study of <i>Kempnyia</i> Klapálek, 1914 (Plecoptera: Perlidae) from Brazil: Support for the description of four new species and a basis for future studies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305824","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Lucas Henrique de Almeida, Maísa de Carvalho Gonçalves, Pitágoras da Conceição Bispo</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Kempnyia</i> (Plecoptera: Perlidae) is an endemic genus of Brazilian stoneflies that has 36 valid species and is distributed primarily in the Atlantic Forest and the mountainous areas of Central Brazil, particularly in Goiás and Tocantins states. Despite being the Brazilian genus with the most DNA sequences available on GenBank, integrative studies on the genus began only recently, in 2014. In this context, herein we studied the morphology and molecular data of <i>Kempnyia</i> specimens deposited in the Aquatic Biology Laboratory (UNESP, Assis) and the Entomology Museum of the Federal University of Viçosa (UFVB, Viçosa) collections. For the integrative approach adopted, in addition to studying the specimens morphologically, we used sequences of the COI mitochondrial gene combined with the following species delimitation methods: Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), both primary (ABGD<sub>p</sub>) and recursive (ABGD<sub>r</sub>) partitions; Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning (ASAP); Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) and the Bayesian implementation of the Poisson Tree Processes (bPTP). As a result, we provided 28 new COI sequences of 21 species and support the description of four new species, namely, <i>K</i>. <i>guarani</i> sp. nov., <i>K</i>. <i>tupiniquim</i> sp. nov., <i>K</i>. <i>una</i> sp. nov., and <i>K</i>. <i>zwickii</i> sp. nov., consequently increasing the known diversity of the genus to 40 species. We also discuss the morphological variations observed in other species of the genus and provide several new geographic records. Therefore, our study brings new insights into the values of intra- and interspecific molecular divergence within <i>Kempnyia</i>, serving as a basis for new studies.","author":"Lucas Henrique de Almeida","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"73edd6b1a476be767273220733a05188dec0d9bf9d3d9b19aa67204d63c8aebb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
