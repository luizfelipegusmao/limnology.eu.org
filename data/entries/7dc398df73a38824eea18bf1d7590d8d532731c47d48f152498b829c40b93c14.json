{"title":"Advances in the Treatment of Cognitive Impairment in Schizophrenia: Targeting NMDA Receptor Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1626/v1","date":1724308694000,"content":"Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia, playing a pivotal role in understanding the causes, processes, and outcomes of the disorder. Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia encompass a wide range of domains, including processing speed, episodic memory, working memory, and executive function. These deficits persist throughout the course of the illness and significantly impact functional outcome and quality of life. Therefore, identifying the biological basis of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and developing effective treatments are imperative. The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in synaptic transmission and plasticity has long been recognized, making them potential targets for schizophrenia treatment. This review will focus on emerging pharmacology targeting NMDA receptor, offering strategies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7dc398df73a38824eea18bf1d7590d8d532731c47d48f152498b829c40b93c14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
