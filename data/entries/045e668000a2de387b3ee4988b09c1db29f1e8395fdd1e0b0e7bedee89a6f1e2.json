{"title":"Improving Antimicrobial Stewardship in Acute Sore Throat: Comparison of FeverPAIN and McIsaac Scores with Molecular Point of Care Testing Using Abbott ID NOW","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0487/v1","date":1728301144000,"content":"The diagnosis of streptococcal throat infection is an area where current practice results in significant over diagnosis of bacterial infection with resulting implications for antimicrobial use and resistance. The use of molecular point of care (POC) testing has been shown previously to alter antibiotic prescribing decisions when compared to Centor scoring. In this study POC testing was shown to perform significantly better than FeverPAIN and McIsaac scores in the diagnosis of streptococcal throat infection providing further support for the use of Abbott ID NOW point of care testing to reduce antibiotic prescribing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"045e668000a2de387b3ee4988b09c1db29f1e8395fdd1e0b0e7bedee89a6f1e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
