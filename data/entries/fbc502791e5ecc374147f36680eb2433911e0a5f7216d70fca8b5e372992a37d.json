However, doubts often arise regarding their competence in this domain. This study aims to validate the Nurse Health Education Competence Instrument (NHECI) linguis-tically and culturally for the Italian context.\nMethods: Following Beaton et al.â€™s (2000) guidelines, we conducted cross-cultural adaptation to develop the Italian version of the questionnaire.\nResults: The Italian version demonstrates good internal consistency and stability, making it suita-ble for assessing nursing students during clinical internships and practicing nurses. Availability of Italian tools promotes research in healthcare, ensuring patient-centric care.\nConclusions: The validity and reliability of the Italian version of the instrument for assessing health education competencies, essential for self-assessment among health education nurses, are established.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbc502791e5ecc374147f36680eb2433911e0a5f7216d70fca8b5e372992a37d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
