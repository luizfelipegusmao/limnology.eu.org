{"title":"Molecular phylogenetics of Oxalis subg. Thamnoxys (Oxalidaceae) reveals artificial arrangements of traditional sections","link":"https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/204/2/174/7317614?rss=1","date":1697241600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Oxalis</span> subg. <span>Thamnoxys</span> is a mostly South American group of <span>Oxalis</span> encompassing almost 80 species from tropical habitats that are currently separated into nine sections based on morphology and geographic distributions. In this study, we investigated whether <span>Oxalis</span> subg. <span>Thamnoxys</span> and its sections are monophyletic. DNA sequences of the nrITS, <span>trnL-trnL-trnF</span>, and <span>petA-psbJ</span> from 92 specimens of <span>Oxalis</span> (55 from <span>O.</span> subg. <span>Thamnoxys</span>, 37 from <span>O.</span> subg. <span>Oxalis</span>, and five outgroup taxa) were used to investigate phylogenetic relationships among its nine sections. Nuclear and plastid molecular markers were subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses individually and in a combined data matrix. Our phylogenetic trees recovered <span>O.</span> subg. <span>Thamnoxys</span> as monophyletic only if <span>O. praetexta</span>, previously included in <span>O.</span> sect. <span>Robustae</span>, is transferred to <span>O.</span> subg. <span>Oxalis</span>. The remaining samples of the subgenus emerged in a clade with full bootstrap and posterior probability support. Within it, <span>O.</span> sect. <span>Holophyllum</span> was the only section that was recovered as monophyletic, whereas the remaining sections were not, either because of sampling a single species of each (<span>O.</span> sect. <span>Foliosae</span>, <span>Hedysaroideae</span>, and <span>Phyllodoxys</span>), to the unexpected placement of <span>O. goyazensis</span> (<span>O.</span> sect. <span>Robustae</span>) in <span>O.</span> sect. <span>Psoraleoideae</span>, or to the sister relationship between <span>O. densifolia</span> (<span>O.</span> sect. <span>Foliosae</span>) with <span>O. pyrenea</span> var. <span>macrochaeta</span> (<span>O.</span> sect. <span>Thamnoxys</span>), suggesting the need of revaluating some specific affinities and updating sectional circumscriptions. This phylogenetic study with an improved sampling of <span>O.</span> subg. <span>Thamnoxys</span> is the first step towards an updated classification of the subgenus and for interpreting both its morphological diversification and biogeographic history in South America.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"84b5fa2619594e061395c38d918de42c13a5b0cd8ac0441f237084e35d0e4410","entryHash":"ada88643d22ae1d3fb9927c13cdc97a5459981128966afc65afdd796ef8ca538","category":"Environment"}
