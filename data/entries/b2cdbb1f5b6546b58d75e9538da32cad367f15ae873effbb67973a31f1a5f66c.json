{"title":"Performance of Colilert-18 and qPCR for Monitoring E. coli Contamination at Freshwater Beaches in Michigan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1649/v1","date":1729524205000,"content":"Fecal contamination is a common cause of impairment of surface waters. In monitoring studies, it usually is assessed by measuring concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common monitoring target in freshwater systems. In this study, we assess the advantages and disadvantages of two common methods for monitoring E. coli concentrations at freshwater beaches: Colilert-18®, with a turnaround time of ca. 18 h, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), with a turnaround time of ca. 3–4 h. Based on data comprising 3081 pairs of Colilert-18 and qPCR estimates of E. coli concentrations in split samples from Michigan’s annual beach monitoring program in 2019 and 2020, we found that qPCR monitoring detected a high percentage of exceedances of the state’s water quality standard for E. coli contamination that went undetected on the day of sampling with Colilert-18 monitoring, because qPCR concentration estimates were available on the day of sampling but Colilert-18 estimates were not. However, Colilert-18 data were more useful than qPCR data for statistical comparison of contamination levels at different beaches, probably in part because Colilert-18 data showed a much lower percentage of censored concentration estimates (estimates outside the range of quantification).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2cdbb1f5b6546b58d75e9538da32cad367f15ae873effbb67973a31f1a5f66c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
