{"title":"Rice kinase OsMRLK63 contributes to drought tolerance by regulating reactive oxygen species production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2679/7499159?rss=1","date":1703548800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought is a major adverse environmental factor that plants face in nature but the molecular mechanism by which plants transduce stress signals and further endow themselves with tolerance remains unclear. Malectin/malectin-like domains containing receptor-like kinases (MRLKs) have been proposed to act as receptors in multiple biological signaling pathways, but limited studies show their roles in drought-stress signaling and tolerance. In this study, we demonstrate OsMRLK63 in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span> L.) functions in drought tolerance by acting as the receptor of 2 rapid alkalization factors, OsRALF45 and OsRALF46. We show OsMRLK63 is a typical receptor-like kinase that positively regulates drought tolerance and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. OsMRLK63 interacts with and phosphorylates several nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases with the primarily phosphorylated site at Ser26 in the N-terminal of RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGUE A (OsRbohA). The application of the 2 small signal peptides (OsRALF45/46) on rice can greatly alleviate the dehydration of plants induced by mimic drought. This function depends on the existence of OsMRLK63 and the NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production. The 2 RALFs interact with OsMRLK63 by binding to its extracellular domain, suggesting they may act as drought/dehydration signal sensors for the OsMRLK63-mediated process. Our study reveals a OsRALF45/46-OsMRLK63-OsRbohs module which contributes to drought-stress signaling and tolerance in rice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a7d1fd1a6ff983b74c43c7df85fdc5739012e4d821d9239a680c1a05d0f8a56d","category":"Environment"}
