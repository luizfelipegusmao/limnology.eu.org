Previous studies have suggested that variations in coral-reef bioerosion can influence spatial and temporal variations of sedimentary assemblages: elevated erosion rates of dead coral skeletons can trigger a pulse of coral-derived sediments and cause a shift in the dominance of sedimentary grains from coralline algae, such as <i>Halimeda</i>, to coral. We assessed the variability of the sedimentary composition and bioerosion rates of reefs at different spatial scales to determine the association between these two variables. We surveyed the benthic assemblages on reefs exhibiting different ecological states and collected samples of the associated sediments. We calculated the carbonate budget for each site and compared their variability at different hierarchical levels to the variability of their respective sedimentary assemblages. At the scale of sites (1â€“10 km), <i>Halimeda</i> cover was a significant predictor of the relative abundance of <i>Halimeda</i> grains. Both the relative abundance of coral grains and reef bioerosion rates varied significantly at the scale of locality (tens to hundreds of km), with high abundances of coral grains in the sediments coinciding with high rates of bioerosion. The main drivers of bioerosion at our localities were parrotfish assemblages dominated by large size classes of excavating species such as <i>Sparisoma viride</i>. Reef sediments may reflect the gross degree of bioerosion pressure that reefs experience, and historical changes in bioerosion rates could potentially be assessed by examining the sediments across temporal scales.","author":"Victor Rodriguez-Ruano","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e3f1a18d5846151ef97d21350263a72684c23d9f1f572620d307bedda51b3b86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
