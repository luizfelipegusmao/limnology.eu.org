{"title":"Are Markets Naturally Random? Machine Learning Approach to Quantifying Randomness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2017/v1","date":1727260135000,"content":"From some perspective, every natural phenomenon is just a combination of many elementary random events clustering and forming a pattern. Nonetheless, the nature of random events differs from one field of study to another. This research is an attempt to determine whether volatile stock price movement, considered random, accords to the randomness of real world phenomena. To accomplish the task, a deep learning model was built, trained on preprocessed data and evaluated to calculate it's accuracy. The acquired results were then compared, and it turned out that stock prices are very similar in randomness to natural phenomena as the model trained on large amounts of stock data was increasing the accuracy of predictions of all real world parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8f483709ad3ab43b536d057e06129b43786816be719648f6313bd935aa9dacf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
