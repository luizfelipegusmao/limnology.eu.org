{"title":"Association between multiple sclerosis and cancer risk: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298271","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Zeyu Liu, Teng Fan, Xiaoyan Mo, Jun Kan, Bei Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-related disease and the relationship between MS and cancer has raised attention. Previous studies of the relationship between MS and cancer have reached conflicting conclusions. In this study, the two-sample MR method is used to investigate whether MS has a causal correlation with cancers and offer scientific evidence for cancer prevention. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to MS were obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) and SNPs related to 15 types of cancers were obtained from the GWASs based on UK Biobank. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was mainly used to assess causal effects. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with Cochran’s <i>Q</i>-test, MR Egger intercept, leave-one-out test, and MR Steiger method. IVW analysis showed that MS was only associated with a marginal increased risk of cervical cancer (OR 1.0004, 95% CI 1.0002–1.0007, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of MR analysis were robust and found no heterogeneity, no pleiotropy, and no reverse causation. In conclusion, this study finds no causal relationship between MS and 15 types of cancers except cervical cancer.","author":"Zeyu Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5c286c4e176c52b86067ca4daa1cdccdf128639fe7d7dfba13faa659808c5af2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
