{"title":"Current Status of Cardiac Regenerative Therapy Using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1796/v1","date":1714284541000,"content":"Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening disorder and is treated by drug therapies and surgical interventions such as heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device (LVAD). However, these treatments can lack effectiveness in the long term and are associated with issues such as donor shortage in heart transplantation, and infection, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding in LVADs. Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies are still needed. In this respect, stem cell therapy has been introduced for the treatment of HF and numerous preclinical and clinical studies using various types of stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been shown to improve cardiac function and attenuate left ventricular remodeling. IPSCs, which have a capacity of unlimited proliferation and differentiation to cardiomyocytes, are a promising cell source for myocardial regeneration therapy. This review discusses the current status of cardiac regenerative therapy using iPSCs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4453fb0bd4aa1535bb723d24e54e8297f61fe3ce1d675488eabd260969924b24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
