{"title":"Two-Dimensional Thin-Layer Chromatography as an Accessible, Low-Cost Tool for Lipid-Class Profile Screening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0219/v1","date":1714982190000,"content":"The interest in lipid composition profiling is significantly increasing as research reveals the immense importance of lipids in medicine, plant science, food and agriculture. However, lipidomic analysis requires high-end specialty equipment. We used two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D TLC) as a readily available, low-cost tool for basic lipidomic profiling of lipid classes in algal samples as model: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Auxenochlorella protothecoides, and Euglena gracilis. Algal lipid extracts were separated on a 2D-TLC plate, and TLC analysis was followed by scraping individual TLC spots off the plate, and a subsequent liquid chromatography separation and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. For comparison, crude lipid extracts were also injected directly to the LC-MS/MS system. Lipid class annotation was achieved by a combination of accurate mass, retention time information, neutral loss and fragment ion analysis by MS2Analyzer, and by matching spectra to LipidBlast MS/MS library. Overall, we were able to identify 15 lipid classes, and to adequately profile the lipid classes in all three organisms. This TLC method is thus suggested as an accessible tool for lipid class profiling of algal, plant, and food lipids, alike, when a rapid and simple analysis is required, e.g., for screening purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"194006ab38ceffc728018de00b7aae54e9b5f0ac0eabf78bcf791abe58d7d52b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
