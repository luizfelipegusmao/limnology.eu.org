{"title":"Biomarkers: The Key To Enhancing Dbs Treatment For Psychiatric Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1975/v1","date":1727261216000,"content":"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently a promising technique for psychiatric patients with severe and treatment-resistant symptoms. However, the results to date have been quite heterogeneous, and the indications for psychosurgery with DBS remain in an experimental phase. One of the major challenges limiting the advancement of DBS in psychiatric disorders is the lack of objective criteria for diagnosing certain conditions, which are often based more on clinical scales rather than measurable biological markers. Additionally, there is a limited capacity to objectively assess treatment outcomes.\nThis overview examines the literature on the available biomarkers in psychosurgery in relation to DBS, as well as other relevant biomarkers in psychiatry with potential applicability for this treatment modality.\nThere are five types of biomarkers: clinical/behavioral, omic, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neurobiochemical. The information provided by each biomarker within these categories is highly variable and may be relevant for diagnosis, response prediction, target selection, program adjustment, etc.\nA better understanding of biomarkers and their applications would allow DBS in psychosurgery to advance on a more objective basis, guided by the information provided by them and within the context of precision psychiatry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b798afd0e8830d36f491fd7b346b6946788c189a98f2c7d7c6d55eac020faf3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
