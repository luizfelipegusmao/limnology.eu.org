{"title":"On Fuzzy Soft Beta-Continuity and Beta-Irresoluteness: Properties and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1551/v2","date":1710329968000,"content":"In the present study. At first, some properties of r-fuzzy soft β-closed sets are introduced on fuzzy soft topological spaces based on the paper Aygunoglu et al. (Hacet. J. Math. Stat. 2014, 43, 193-208). Also, we define the closure and interior operators with respect to the classes of r-fuzzy soft β-closed and r-fuzzy soft β-open sets, and investigate some of their properties. In addition, the concept of r-fuzzy soft β-connected sets is introduced and characterized with help of fuzzy soft β-closure operators. Thereafter, some properties of a fuzzy soft β-continuity are studied. Furthermore, we introduce and study the concepts of fuzzy soft almost (weakly) β-continuous functions, which are weaker forms of a fuzzy soft β-continuity. Also, the relationships between these classes of functions are specified with the help of some illustrative examples. Finally, we explore new types of fuzzy soft functions called, fuzzy soft β-irresolute (strongly β-irresolute, β-irresolute open, β-irresolute closed and β-irresolute homeomorphism) functions, and discuss some properties of them. Also, we show that fuzzy soft strongly β-irresolute → fuzzy soft β-irresolute → fuzzy soft β-continuity, but the converse may not be true.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0d69eeea0cc50764ae89bb3829e967999dfccb5e451b55b4b88b279db909032","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
