Various stimuli such as heating or biasing in liquid environments have been employed to study materials nucleation and growth [<a href=\"#ozae044.868-B1\">1</a>], ion batteries [<a href=\"#ozae044.868-B2\">2</a>], electrocatalysts [<a href=\"#ozae044.868-B3\">3</a>], and more. The majority of commercial in situ (S)TEM sample holders utilize only four electrical contacts, limiting the combination of stimuli that users can simultaneously apply. However, to mimic real-world operational conditions in applications like proton exchange membranes, Zn-ion batteries, etc., requires the simultaneous combination of thermal and electrical stimuli, thus demanding a higher number of electrical signals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c6a9ce6b5fbcfc2e3abe00e7f1219bbe08af70f8eb289f2eabb2011677f2ee89","category":"Environment"}
