{"title":"An Initial Approach of Multiple Linear Regression in CO2-water Relative Permeability Prediction for Carbon Storage Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1849/v1","date":1719394526000,"content":"This work discusses the feasibility of multiple linear regression in predicting water/CO2 relative permeability using training and testing datasets from two nearby wells, separately, of the Lower Cretaceous Lakota Sandstone, Jurassic Hulett Sandstone, and Pennsylvanian Minnelusa Formation at the Dry Fork Station site. The outcome is promising as the predicted and measured relative permeability data are decently comparable. Yet, whether this approach could be generally applicable needs more delicate models and larger training datasets to be determined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"540dbc8a0f2d02a5fd867c38df9ba8e10a0fe817b42f1feb4ca1a4f7d5a63e80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
