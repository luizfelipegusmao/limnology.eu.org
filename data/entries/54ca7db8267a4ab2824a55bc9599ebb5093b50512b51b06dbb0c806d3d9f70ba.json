{"title":"The transcription factor MdBPC2 alters apple growth and promotes dwarfing by regulating auxin biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/585/7455220?rss=1","date":1701216000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Auxin plays important roles throughout plant growth and development. However, the mechanisms of auxin regulation of plant structure are poorly understood. In this study, we identified a transcription factor (TF) of the BARLEY B RECOMBINANT/BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BBR/BPC) family in apple (<span>Malus</span> Ã— <span>domestica</span>), MdBPC2. It was highly expressed in dwarfing rootstocks, and it negatively regulated auxin biosynthesis. Overexpression of <span>MdBPC2</span> in apple decreased plant height, altered leaf morphology, and inhibited root system development. These phenotypes were due to reduced auxin levels and were restored reversed after exogenous indole acetic acid (IAA) treatment. Silencing of <span>MdBPC2</span> alone had no obvious phenotypic effect, while silencing both Class I and Class II BPCs in apple significantly increased auxin content in plants. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that MdBPC2 directly bound to the GAGA-rich element in the promoters of the auxin synthesis genes <span>MdYUC2a</span> and <span>MdYUC6b</span>, inhibiting their transcription and reducing auxin accumulation in <span>MdBPC2</span> overexpression lines. Further studies established that MdBPC2 interacted with the polycomb group (PcG) protein LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) to inhibit <span>MdYUC2a</span> and <span>MdYUC6b</span> expression via methylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Silencing <span>MdLHP1</span> reversed the negative effect of <span>MdBPC2</span> on auxin accumulation. Our results reveal a dwarfing mechanism in perennial woody plants involving control of auxin biosynthesis by a BPC transcription factor, suggesting its use for genetic improvement of apple rootstock.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"54ca7db8267a4ab2824a55bc9599ebb5093b50512b51b06dbb0c806d3d9f70ba","category":"Environment"}
