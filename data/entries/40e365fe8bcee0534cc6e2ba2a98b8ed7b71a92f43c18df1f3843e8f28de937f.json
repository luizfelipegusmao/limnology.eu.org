{"title":"Sustainable development in a carbon‐conscious world: Quantile regression insights into CO2 emission drivers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12449?af=R","date":1710232404000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In the face of mounting global concerns over climate change and its far-reaching consequences, this research paper examines the effect of economic growth, natural resources, energy sources, trade, environment-related technologies, energy intensity, and environmental tax on carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. This study employs the Method of Moments Quantile Regression approach with data from 108 countries between 1990 and 2020. The empirical outcomes revealed a positive relationship between economic growth and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, following an inverted U-shaped pattern known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Energy intensity and the use of fossil fuels both raise CO₂ emissions, whereas environmental taxes and the generation of renewable energy significantly reduce carbon emissions, especially at higher quantiles. Hence, implementing higher environmental tax levels and promoting cleaner energy sources mitigate pollution. Trade and the development of environment-related technologies appear to contribute to mitigating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, yet their statistical significance remains inconclusive. The findings emphasize the importance of sustainable development strategies that balance economic growth with environmental protection. Policymakers should prioritize promoting renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and reassessing environmental tax levels to align with climate change goals.</p>","author":"Muhammad Shahbaz, \nNikunj Patel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"40e365fe8bcee0534cc6e2ba2a98b8ed7b71a92f43c18df1f3843e8f28de937f","category":"Environment"}
