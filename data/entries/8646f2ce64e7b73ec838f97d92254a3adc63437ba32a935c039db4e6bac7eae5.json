{"title":"Tailored Viral-Like Particles as Drivers of Medical Breakthroughs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0840/v1","date":1712909029000,"content":"Despite the recognized potential of nanoparticles, only a few formulations have progressed to clinical trials, and an even smaller number have been approved by the regulatory authorities and marketed. Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as promising alternatives to most explored nanoparticles because of the absence of viral genetic material, their incapacity to replicate, mimicry of viral structure, and tropism conservation. Furthermore, VLPs can be surface functionalized with small molecules to improve circulation half-life and target specificity. Through the functionalization and coating of VLPs, it is possible to optimize the response properties to a given stimulus, such as heat, pH, an alternating magnetic field, or even enzymes. Surface functionalization can also modulate other properties, such as biocompatibility, stability, and specificity, deeming VLPs as potential vaccine candidates or delivery systems. In this review, we address the different types of functionalization of VLPs, their importance, and their consequent biomedical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8646f2ce64e7b73ec838f97d92254a3adc63437ba32a935c039db4e6bac7eae5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
