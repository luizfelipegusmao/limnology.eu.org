{"title":"PSIX-1 Evaluation of canola meal inclusion in adult dog diets and the impact on digestibility, stool quality, and palatability","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/572/7757663?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Canola meal is a commonly used ingredient in livestock, fish, and poultry feed and is also AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) approved for use in pet food. This study’s objectives were to evaluate the impact of canola meal inclusion on nutrient digestibility, stool quality, and palatability in adult dogs. Canola meal was included at 5% or 10%, substituting pea protein, in a high-protein, chicken-based adult maintenance canine diet to maintain similar protein, fat, and crude fiber. The study was approved and followed by the facility’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A standard 2-bowl palatability test over a 2-d period was executed (n = 30 each) to determine intake ratio (IR) between test diets (5% and 10% canola meal), and versus control. Total tract nutrient digestibility was evaluated (n = 8 per diet) with 5 d of diet acclimation followed by 5 d of total fecal collection. Stool quality was evaluated on a 1 to 5 scale, where 1= nonformed/ diarrhea and 5 = hard formed. Digestibility data were analyzed by ANOVA with Treatment (% Canola Meal) as fixed effect, and stool quality, by linear mixed effects model with Day and Treatment (% Canola Meal) as fixed effects and Dog as random effect (R version 4.2.2). With <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant, no differences were observed between diets for protein digestibility (all &gt; 84% avg), fat digestibility (all &gt;92% avg), or stool scores (all averages between 3.4 to 3.5). Canola-containing diets were equally palatable as the control (IR = 58:42, 5% canola meal vs. control; 57:43, 10% canola meal vs. control), but 10% was preferred vs. 5% (75:25; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Overall, digestibility, stool quality, and palatability were not impacted by canola meal up to 10% inclusion, suggesting that it is an acceptable ingredient for dog diets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"855c57a320f18a6bee7ce384fa1faa8a45eb11302bbae887df26eccae43b5bd5","category":"Environment"}
