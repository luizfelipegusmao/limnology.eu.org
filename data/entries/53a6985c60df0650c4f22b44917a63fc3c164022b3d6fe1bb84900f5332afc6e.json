{"title":"Challenges and Solutions for Leave-One-Out Biosensor Design in the Context of a Rugged Fitness Landscape","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1923/v1","date":1727179445000,"content":"The Leave-One-Out (LOO) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) approach to biosensor design com-bines computational protein design with split protein reconstitution. LOO-GFPs reversibly fold and gain fluorescence upon encountering its target peptide, which can be redefined by computa-tional design of the LOO site. Such an approach can be used to create reusable biosensors for the early detection of emerging biological threats. Enlightening biophysical inferences for nine LOO-GFP biosensor libraries are presented, with target sequences from dengue, influenza, or HIV, replacing beta strands 7, 8 or 11. An initially low hit rate was traced to components of the energy function, manifesting in the over-rewarding of over-tight side chain packing.  Also, screening by colony picking required a low library complexity, but designing a biosensor against a peptide of at least 12 residues requires a high complexity library. This double-bind was solved using a \"piecemeal\" iterative design strategy. Also, designed LOO-GFPs fluoresced in the unbound state due to unwanted dimerization, but this was solved by fusing a fully functional prototype LOO-GFP to a fiber-forming protein, Drosophila ultrabithorax, creating a biosensor fiber. One in-fluenza hemagglutinin biosensor is characterized here in detail, showing a shifted excita-tion/emission spectrum, a micromolar affinity for the target peptide, and an unexpected pho-to-switching ability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53a6985c60df0650c4f22b44917a63fc3c164022b3d6fe1bb84900f5332afc6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
