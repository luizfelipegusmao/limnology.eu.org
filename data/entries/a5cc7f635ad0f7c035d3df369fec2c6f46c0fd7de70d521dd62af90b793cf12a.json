{"title":"Comparative Study on Fatty Acids Composition of Lemna minor (Duckweed) Cultured in Indoor Plastic Tanks and Outdoor Earthen Ponds","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5563513?af=R","date":1709539200000,"content":"<p>Global interest in using duckweed (<i>Lemna minor</i>) as a substitute for fish, livestock, and human diets has spurred research on the mass culture of the species. There is a scarcity of information on the <i>L. minor</i> fatty acid composition in different aquaculture settings. A comparative study was carried out to investigate the fatty acid composition of <i>L. minor</i> cultured in indoor plastic tanks and outdoor earthen ponds for 30 days. During the culture period, culture facilities were fertilized using livestock manure. Fatty acid characterization was done using gas chromatography method. Fifteen fatty acids: five saturated (SAFAs), five monounsaturated (MUFAS), and five polyunsaturated (PUFAs) were identified. Fatty acid compositions varied between indoor and outdoor settings. Percentage composition of <i>L. minor</i> PUFAs cultured outdoor (37.13) was higher than that of indoor (21.96) settings. <i>L. minor</i> SAFAs percentage composition was higher in the indoor culture at 41.63% while that of outdoor was 33.75%. The composition of <i>L. minor</i> MUFAs in indoor tanks was higher (36.32%) than in outdoor earthen ponds (29.10%). This study indicated the presence of docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic, linoelaidic, and eicosanoic acids in <i>L. minor</i> seldom reported in past studies. Paired Studentsâ€™ <i>t</i>-test indicated that the means of the fatty acid composition were significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in both settings, with docosahexaenoic showing the highest paired mean difference.</p>","author":"Judith Achoki, \nPaul Orina, \nCatherine Kaingu, \nJemima Oduma, \nKennedy Olale, \nMercy Chepkirui, \nAlbert Getabu, \nCarlos Rosas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"a5cc7f635ad0f7c035d3df369fec2c6f46c0fd7de70d521dd62af90b793cf12a","category":"Environment"}
