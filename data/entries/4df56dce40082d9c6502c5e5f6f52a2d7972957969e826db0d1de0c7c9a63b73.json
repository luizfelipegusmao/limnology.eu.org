{"title":"Global consumption patterns of combination hypertension medication: An analysis of pharmaceutical sales data from 2010â€“2021","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003698","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Sahan Jayawardana, Allen Campbell, Murray Aitken, Charlotte E.

Global disparities in hypertension control are widening with low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) having the fastest growing rates of hypertension and low rates of control. Treatment for hypertension can be challenging, with multiple drug classes and dosing schedules. Combination antihypertensives have been suggested as a solution for their efficacy and potential to improve adherence. Global consumption of combination and non-combination antihypertensives across 75 countries and 2 regions from 2010 to 2021 was estimated using the IQVIA MIDAS database on pharmaceutical sales. Consumption rates were standardized using Standard Units (SUs) and analysed by high-income (HIC), upper-middle income (UMIC), and LMIC income classification. Global median consumption rate of all antihypertensives per 1000 inhabitants per day increased from 184.78 SUs in 2010 to 325.6 SUs in 2021, with HICs consistently having the highest rates. Median consumption rates of combination and non-combination antihypertensives increased across all country income groups but combination drugs were consumed at a lower rate and proportion. LMICs consumed a higher percentage of combination antihypertensives relative to non-combination (45.5%) than UMICs (24.3%) and HICs (24.4%) in 2021. While combination antihypertensives may be preferred for their potential for increased adherence and effectiveness, their global uptake is inconsistent. HICs consume less combination medication relative to non-combination, despite higher overall consumption rates of antihypertensives. LMICs show increasing use of combination medications, indicating a shift towards their use.","author":"Sahan Jayawardana","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"4df56dce40082d9c6502c5e5f6f52a2d7972957969e826db0d1de0c7c9a63b73","category":"Environment"}
