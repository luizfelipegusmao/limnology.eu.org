{"title":"Changes of Central Sensitivity to Thyroid Hormones during Pregnancy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1445/v1","date":1713869048000,"content":"Introduction/Aim: Central sensitivity to thyroid hormones refers to the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis to changes in circulating free thyroxine (fT4). The relationship between fT4 levels and iodine intake is complex. The aim of the present study was to assess central sensitivity to thyroid hormones in pregnancy against iodine intake.\nMaterials &amp; Methods: One thousand one hundred two blood and urine samples were collected from pregnant women (with a mean age+SD of 30.4+4.6 years) during singleton pregnancies; women with known/diagnosed thyroid disease were excluded. Specifically, TSH &amp; fT4 and 24-hour urinary iodine excretion (UI) were measured in each trimester and at two months postpartum. The Thyroid Feedback Quantile-based Index (TFQI) was calculated to assess central sensitivity to thyroid hormones. For the statistical analysis of TFQI by time period, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, while Pearson's correlation was used to assess TFQI versus UI.\nResults: The mean TFQI index ranged from -0.06 (first trimester) to -0.07 (two months postpartum), while the corresponding UI was 141 and 172 μg/L, respectively. The TFQI-UI correlation was negative (Pearson r: -0.325, p: 0.04 and r: -0.399, p: 0.023), for UI values over 250 μg/L, in the first and the third trimester of pregnancy, respectively. \nDiscussion: TFQI is a new index reflecting central sensitivity to thyroid hormones. Lower TFQI indicates higher sensitivity to thyroid hormones. In our sample TFQI was inversely related to iodine intake, in the first trimester of pregnancy (the critical period of organogenesis) and the third trimester (the critical period of fetal growth). Thus, the observed changes in TFQI may reflect different ways of central action of thyroid hormones, according to the phase of pregnancy. The negative association between maternal TFQI (indicative of central sensitivity to thyroid hormone) and urine iodine levels during the third trimester of pregnancy may reflect the combined influence of maternal and fetal thyroid function. Our results are intriguing and have the potential to enhance our comprehension of the changes in the HPT axis’ function via variations in central sensitivity to thyroid hormones and its interplay with nutritional iodine status during pregnancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"179a52974520d83a7b01fd2cce916d34720a50ff795dd3645456606723e460ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
