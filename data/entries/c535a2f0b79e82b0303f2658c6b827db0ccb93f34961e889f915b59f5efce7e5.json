{"title":"Thermo Scientific Smart EPU: Towards the “One-button” Screening Solution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.386/7720494?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>For many years, the Cryo-EM community is expecting that software automation will achieve the ultimate goal of providing a Single Particle Analysis (SPA) data acquisition workflow that requires no setup from the user's side [<a href=\"#ozae044.386-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.386-B2\">2</a>]. Achieving that will allow many more researchers, who are not necessarily application or microscope experts an optimal use of time in high throughput cryo-electron microscopes. This is particularly important in industrial set-ups or entry-level labs where efficiency and ease of use are key adoption barriers. Moreover, it has been identified that one of the main bottlenecks in Single Particle Acquisition (SPA) is screening automation [<a href=\"#ozae044.386-B2\">2</a>]. Thermo Scientific Smart EPU with EPU Multigrid already provide a workflow that enables screening of multiple samples in highly automated way [<a href=\"#ozae044.386-B3\">3</a>]. We are now expanding on that with the goal to make SPA screening fully unattended. With the use of EPU Multigrid, EPU Quality Monitor (EQM) and Embedded CryoSPARC live, and a novel set of AI/DL algorithms, we can now demonstrate a workflow that allows users to screen a full cassette of samples on an autoloader system without the need to pass through any manual setup tasks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c535a2f0b79e82b0303f2658c6b827db0ccb93f34961e889f915b59f5efce7e5","category":"Environment"}
