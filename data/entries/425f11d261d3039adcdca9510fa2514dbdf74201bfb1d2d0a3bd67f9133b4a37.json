These techniques can be used to determine for instance orientation and structural information in crystals, as well as phase information when combined with ptychography. However, the accuracy of 4D-STEM techniques are often limited by the presence of optical distortion in the collected convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns, caused by aberrations of the electromagnetic lenses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"425f11d261d3039adcdca9510fa2514dbdf74201bfb1d2d0a3bd67f9133b4a37","category":"Environment"}
