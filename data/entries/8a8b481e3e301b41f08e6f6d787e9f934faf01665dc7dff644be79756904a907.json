{"title":"Perioperative and Long Term Outcomes of Acute Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection Repair in Octogenarians","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0258/v1","date":1722839177000,"content":"Background \nThe aims of this study were to assess the peri-operative morbidity, mortality and long-term survival of octogenarians undergoing ATAAD repair, and to compare open and closed distal anastomosis techniques.\nMethods\nThis was a single-centre retrospective study (2007-2021). Open versus closed distal anastomosis were compared. Uni and multi-variable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to compare long-term survival. \nResults\nFifty octogenarians patients were included (median age - 82 years, closed distal – 22, open distal - 28). Median CPB time was 187 minutes (open distal vs closed distal group; 219 minutes vs 115.5 minutes, p30 days or return to theatre; HR; 4.1, p=0.02) predicted adverse survival. Open distal anastomosis did no impact survival.\nConclusions –\nATAAD repair in selected octogenarians has favourable short and long-term survival. There is no significant difference between open versus closed distal anastomosis strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a8b481e3e301b41f08e6f6d787e9f934faf01665dc7dff644be79756904a907","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
