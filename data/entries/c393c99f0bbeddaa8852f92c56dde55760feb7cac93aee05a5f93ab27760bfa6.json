{"title":"Incumbent’s Disruptive Innovation Model Incorporating Customers’ Demands in the Smartphone Market: Case Study of Apple iPhone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0072/v1","date":1722506030000,"content":"The current disruptive innovation model has a limitation in incorporating customers’ demands while the customer can be a co-creator of value on performance, design, and price innovation. Thus, this research attempted to explore the disruptive innovation model which can include both the incumbent’s innovation trajectory and customer’s demand, and how incumbents behave to enable disruptive innovation in the smartphone market. Based on the Apple iPhone case study, this study verified that the current disruptive innovation model can incorporate customers’ demand by reflecting their demand in the direction of innovating the performance, design, or price of smartphones with the price-adjusted innovation trajectory. The secondary innovation trajectory which was found uniquely in this study is meaningful since it can be a creative solution for the innovator’s dilemma. Besides, Apple, as an incumbent, has behaved to innovate iPhone performance and design demands of customers creating significant papers and patents as outcomes of innovation activities. This study has practical implications for incumbents’ managers as well as customers to enable disruptive innovation in the smartphone market.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c393c99f0bbeddaa8852f92c56dde55760feb7cac93aee05a5f93ab27760bfa6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
