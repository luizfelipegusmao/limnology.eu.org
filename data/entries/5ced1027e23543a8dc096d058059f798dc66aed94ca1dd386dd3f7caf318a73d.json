{"title":"The Potential Use of Arsenic Trioxide in the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0864/v1","date":1723520210000,"content":"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is now part of the standard regimen for the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia.  The availability of an oral form of ATO has greatly reduced the incidence of cardiotoxicity as compared to intravenous administration.  Increasing evidence suggests that ATO has anti-inflammatory properties that may be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.  These include the modulation of Treg cell activation, Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, depletion of activated T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and influence of B cell differentiation, leading to reduced autoantibody and cytokine production.  ATO has also been shown to induce apoptosis of activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes through generation of reactive oxygen species and alter the gut microbiota in collagen-induced arthritis. Despite the emergence of newer treatment modalities, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially refractory manifestations, remains a challenge, owing to the paucity of effective biological and targeted therapies that are devoid of adverse effects.  Oral ATO is an attractive option for the treatment of SLE because of the lower cost of production, convenience of administration and reduced cardiotoxicity. This article summarizes the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of ATO and its potential application in the treatment of SLE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ced1027e23543a8dc096d058059f798dc66aed94ca1dd386dd3f7caf318a73d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
