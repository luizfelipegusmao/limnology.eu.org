With recent monochromation technology, energy resolution has improved even further to gain access to optical and vibrational signals down to the tens of meV while still retaining atomic resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.1007-B1\">1</a>]. To date, very few specimens have been investigated at the single defect level â€“ only those that remain highly stable under the electron beam have been amenable to the usual strategy of grid sampling (aka, spectrum imaging or EELS mapping) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1007-B2\">2</a>]. A significant barrier remains to probe even moderately beam-sensitive specimens as well as transient and metastable states induced by the electron beam. Such atomic and defect configurations can cause substantial electronic structures changes at the local level and are therefore of significant interest.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"11eaac728125b0c9d35586f4765df5db7fbca298175f1a96ecc621e771c27132","category":"Environment"}
