Despite reducing new infections, the global response to advanced HIV disease (AHD) remains ineffective, leaving HIV epidemics a significant public health threat worldwide. In Ethiopia, evidence regarding AHD is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of AHD among newly diagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV) initiating antiretroviral therapy in the Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 29, 2023, to February 06, 2024, at health facilities providing HIV care in the Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia. A total of 427 PLHIV-initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) were recruited for the study. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and record reviews using KoboCollect version 2.4 and analyzed using R version 4.3.3. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection was used to evaluate and choose the best-fitting model to describe the relationship between AHD and predictors. Finally, variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered independent predictors in the multivariable regression analysis.</p> Results <p>The study participants’ mean (±SD) age was 31.3 (±8.7) years. The overall prevalence of AHD among newly diagnosed PLHIV-initiating ART was 34.4% (95% CI: 29.8%, 39.1%). Rural residence (AOR = 3.48, 95% CI: 2.24, 5.47), alcohol consumption (AOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.59, 3.90), and being identified through community-based index case testing (ICT) (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.51) were found to be independent predictors of AHD.</p> Conclusions <p>The prevalence of AHD among newly diagnosed individuals initiating ART was high. PLHIV who consume alcohol should receive detailed counseling on how it can negatively impact their progress with antiretroviral treatment. HIV testing should be enhanced in rural communities by strengthening community health campaigns. Furthermore, community-based index case testing should be strengthened for early identification of PLHIV.</p>","author":"Temesgen Leka Lerango","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"eba620136aeb93eee6750f5c7ffaf48bc93acb44168dffbd2b24ab58c263f0f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
