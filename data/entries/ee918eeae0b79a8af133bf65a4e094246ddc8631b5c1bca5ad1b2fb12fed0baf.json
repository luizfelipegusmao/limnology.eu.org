The multiple facets of this encounter (chemotaxis, phagocytosis, destruction, evasion and pathogenicity) are largely recapitulated in the phagocytic amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Here we identified a new chemical compound (K14; ZINC19168591) which inhibited intracellular destruction of ingested <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> cells. Concomitantly, K14 reduced proteolytic activity in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> phagosomes. In <i>kil1</i> KO cells, K14 lost its ability to inhibit phagosomal proteolysis and to inhibit intra-phagosomal bacterial destruction, suggesting that K14 inhibits a Kil1-dependent protease involved in bacterial destruction. These observations stress the key role that proteases play in bacterial destruction. They also reveal an unsuspected link between Kil1 and phagosomal proteases. K14 can be used in the future as a tool to probe the role of different proteases in phagosomal physiology and in the destruction of ingested bacteria.","author":"Estelle Ifrid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee918eeae0b79a8af133bf65a4e094246ddc8631b5c1bca5ad1b2fb12fed0baf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
