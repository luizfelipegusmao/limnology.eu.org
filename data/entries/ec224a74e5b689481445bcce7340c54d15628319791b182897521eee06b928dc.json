{"title":"A tale of two pumps: Blue light and abscisic acid alter Arabidopsis leaf hydraulics via bundle sheath cell H+-ATPases","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2635/7656898?rss=1","date":1713830400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The bundle sheath cell (BSC) layer tightly enveloping the xylem throughout the leaf is recognized as a major signal-perceiving “valve” in series with stomata, regulating leaf hydraulic conductance (<span>K</span><sub>leaf</sub>) and thereby radial water flow via the transpiring leaf. The BSC blue light (BL) signaling pathway increases <span>K</span><sub>leaf</sub> and the underlying BSC water permeability. Here, we explored the hypothesis that BSCs also harbor a <span>K</span><sub>leaf</sub>-downregulating signaling pathway related to the stress phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). We employed fluorescence imaging of xylem sap in detached leaves and BSC protoplasts from different genotypes of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) plants, using pH and membrane potential probes to monitor physiological responses to ABA and BL in combination with pharmacological agents. We found that BL-enhanced <span>K</span><sub>leaf</sub> required elevated BSC cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. ABA inhibited BL-activated xylem-sap-acidifying BSC H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase AHA2 (Arabidopsis H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase 2), resulting in depolarized BSCs and alkalinized xylem sap. ABA also stimulated BSC vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (VHA), which alkalinized the BSC cytosol. Each pump stimulation, AHA2 by BL and VHA by ABA (under BL), also required Ca<sup>2+</sup>. ABA stimulated VHA in the dark depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but only in an alkaline external medium. Taken together with earlier findings on the pH sensitivity of BSC osmotic water permeability (i.e. aquaporin activity), our results suggest a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and pH-mediated causative link between the BL- and ABA-regulated activities of two BSC H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and <span>K</span><sub>leaf</sub>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ec224a74e5b689481445bcce7340c54d15628319791b182897521eee06b928dc","category":"Environment"}
