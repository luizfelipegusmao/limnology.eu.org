{"title":"A Case of B-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Presenting with an Isolated Epidural Mass Treated Successfully with Radiotherapy Followed by UKALL Chemotherapy Protocol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0859/v1","date":1728711203000,"content":"B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually involves lymph nodes, skin and soft tissue. Bone marrow and peripheral blood are normally spared from involvement by the disease. B-LBL typically forms sold masses that have similar pathologic and immunophenotypic features of the liquid counterpart, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Presentation of B-LBL with a solitary epidural mass at the cervical spine is very rare and the optimal treatment of such cases is unknown. Most of the literature on management of B-LBL comes from small case series, pediatric patients, or as part of retrospective data that combine B-LBL with B-ALL cases. \nThe case presented herein, showed a unique presentation that was then treated with three modalities, namely, surgical resection, radiotherapy, and consolidation with systemic chemotherapy adopted from United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukemia (UKALL) protocol. \nThe patient attained a complete response following the planned treatment and is still in remission five years from the time of his initial diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84355cd5fea4ea24db8dd9d8063b84d09518853bbecc8aed2447e6c00ec64d22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
