{"title":"Fixation of air nitrogen to ammonia and nitrate using cathodic plasma and anodic plasma in the air plasma electrolysis method","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14331?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The fixation of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) from the air into ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>) is usually conducted using the Haber–Bosch process, which requires the raw material of hydrocarbons for hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), which has a large amount of energy but produces high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. An environmentally friendly and energy-saving alternative is the air plasma electrolysis method, which can be used to synthesize NH<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup> under ambient conditions. In this study, this method was used to inject air into the plasma zone in a K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte solution to produce N<sub>2</sub> fixation compounds. The results showed that the use of cathodic plasma promoted the formation of NH<sub>3</sub> but suppressed NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup> production. The optimal air injection rate was achieved at 0.6 L.min<sup>−1</sup> and an electrical power of 452 W, with a total fixed N<sub>2</sub> of 51.66 mmol. The highest formation of NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup> in cathodic plasma was obtained in 35 min, with a value of 29.92 mmol, and 2.57 mmol NH<sub>3</sub> was achieved at 60 min. The high concentration of H<sub>2</sub> gas, which is a by-product of this process, can contribute to increasing the use of Haber–Bosch green technology in the production of NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>","author":"Nelson Saksono, \nPatresia Suryawinata, \nZainal Zakaria, \nBening Farawan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"4d708c51847e247b603b34e7a17736f78ba4c6f3ed1e99c964ae0841c81af1ca","category":"Environment"}
