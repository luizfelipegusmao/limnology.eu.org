The study involved 10 horses divided into two groups of young (aged 5 to 7 years) and old (aged 14 to 19 years) individuals. All animals participated in light therapy sessions every other day. Blood was sampled three times during the study: before the treatment, after five light sessions, and after ten light sessions. Morphological parameters, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, TAS values, and the levels of glutathione (GSH), vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, vitamin C, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in the whole blood. Light therapy contributed to an increase in MCV, HDW, MCVr, CHr and MPV indices, and simultaneously a decrease in the basophil counts, MCHC, RDW and CHCMr indices in both groups of horses (p ≤ 0.05). At the same time reticulocytes fell in older whereas white blood cells and monocytes counts expanded in younger individuals. The treatment also increased the activity of glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in young but decreased the activity of mentioned enzymes in blood plasma of old horses. The total antioxidant status (TAS) of the blood plasma rose progressively, whereas GSH levels declined in all individuals. Moreover, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels did not change, whereas vitamin C levels gradually decreased during the experiment. The therapy also helped to reduce levels of MDA in the blood plasma, especially of older horses (p ≤ 0.05). In turn, GPx and GR activities as well as MDA levels significantly declined, whereas GSH levels notably elevated in erythrocytes (p ≤ 0.05). Solarium light therapy appears to have a beneficial impact on the morphological parameters and antioxidant status of blood in recreational horses in the winter season. However, the observed results could in part be attributed to the natural physiological adaptation of each individual organism to the treatment.","author":"Aleksandra Orzołek","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a2b06b5047e50ac41149d06542595fe119b4d810dc9e273e647e51ae27646f88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
