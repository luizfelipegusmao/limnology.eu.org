{"title":"Auxin signaling in the cambium promotes tissue adhesion and vascular formation during Arabidopsis graft healing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/754/7664286?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The strong ability of plants to regenerate wounds is exemplified by grafting when two plants are cut and joined together to grow as one. During graft healing, tissues attach, cells proliferate, and the vasculatures connect to form a graft union. The plant hormone auxin plays a central role, and auxin-related mutants perturb grafting success. Here, we investigated the role of individual cell types and their response to auxin during Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) graft formation. By employing a cell-specific inducible misexpression system, we blocked auxin response in individual cell types using the <span>bodenlos</span> mutation. We found that auxin signaling in procambial tissues was critical for successful tissue attachment and vascular differentiation. In addition, we found that auxin signaling was required for cell divisions of the procambial cells during graft formation. Loss of function mutants in cambial pathways also perturbed attachment and phloem reconnection. We propose that cambial and procambial tissues drive tissue attachment and vascular differentiation during successful grafting. Our study thus refines our knowledge of graft development and furthers our understanding of the regenerative role of the cambium.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3f4fb2a8701dab4b22d45c0d3d2ff3f42cef2a0a946a0a58a92cc7dacb2ec4ca","category":"Environment"}
