While research in topological materials has seen great advances in recent years, the current knowledge of topological materials is largely based on materials with long-range atomic ordering (LRO), or crystal structure with well-defined symmetry. A fundamental question rises regarding whether topological states can exist in materials without LRO, <span>i.e</span>. non-crystalline or amorphous materials. Amorphous materials are ubiquitous in nature and being utilized in numerous technologically important applications, but understanding their basic properties, such as band gaps and topological behaviors, has remained very challenging. Theoretical works <span>e.g</span>. [<a href=\"#ozae044.770-B1\">1</a>] have recently suggested that amorphous materials can indeed have topological states without any crystalline order. Instead, it has been suggested that the atomic connections (ordering) at the very local level may be the key to understanding and controlling the topological phases in amorphous materials. However, both the experimental demonstration [<a href=\"#ozae044.770-B2\">2</a>] and theoretical understanding of topological amorphous materials still remain very premature, leaving the door wide open for further investigation and exciting new discovery.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"162b9193d5393bc0b622de1a5b4f815cba801c83be0bb24bac2bc74b2aaa6068","category":"Environment"}
