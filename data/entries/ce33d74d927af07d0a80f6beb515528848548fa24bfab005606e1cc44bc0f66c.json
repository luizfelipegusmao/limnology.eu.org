{"title":"Is Dark Matter a Misinterpretation of a Perspective Effect?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2020/v1","date":1719550646000,"content":"Very recently, a straightforward way was proposed in order to understand the galaxy and\ngalactic cluster world without using the very elusive dark matter concept. This way was called\nκ-model [1, 2, 3, 4]. The main idea is to save the form of the usual physical laws, especially the\nNewton’s laws of motion when gravity is weak, but only by applying a local renormalization\nprocedure for the lengths, distances and velocities. This local renormalization appears as a\ncorrespondance principle in the κ-model. In this model the fundamental physical constants\nremain universal, i.e. are independent of the point and of time. The κ-model is Newtonian\nin essence but a relativistic extension can easily be built. The aim of the present paper is to\ndetail the mathematical formalism supporting i","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce33d74d927af07d0a80f6beb515528848548fa24bfab005606e1cc44bc0f66c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
