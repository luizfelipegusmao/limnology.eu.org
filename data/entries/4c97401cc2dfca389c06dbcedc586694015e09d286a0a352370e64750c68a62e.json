{"title":"Droplet Digital Pcr Enhances Sensitivity and Accuracy in Canine Distemper Virus Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1390/v1","date":1726647867000,"content":"Canine distemper virus (CDV) poses a substantial threat to diverse carnivores, leading to sys-temic and often fatal diseases. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is paramount for effective man-agement and curbing further transmission. This study evaluates the diagnostic efficacy of drop-let digital PCR (ddPCR) in comparison to conventional reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Seventy-six clinical samples were collected from dogs with CDV symptoms diagnosed by specialized veterinarians, and sixteen samples from asymptomatic individuals. Conventional PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and ddPCR were deployed, and their diagnostic capabilities were meticulously assessed. DdPCR ex-hibited heightened analytical sensitivity, reaching a detection limit of 3 copies/μL, whereas RT-qPCR had a detection limit of 86 copies/μL. The comparative analysis between clinical diagnosis and molecular techniques, including RT-PCR and RT-qPCR, demonstrated low concordance, with Kappa coefficients of 0.268 and 0.324, respectively. In contrast, ddPCR, showed a moderate concordance, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.477. Sensitivity was 42.39% for RT-PCR, 57.89% for RT-qPCR and 72.37% for ddPCR, with 100% of specificity for all methods. This study under-scores ddPCR's superior sensitivity and concordance with clinical CDV diagnosis, even at low viral concentrations, suggesting it as a promising alternative for CDV diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c97401cc2dfca389c06dbcedc586694015e09d286a0a352370e64750c68a62e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
