{"title":"Evaluation of the Influence of Surface Roughness Parameters on Ultrasonic Rayleigh Waveforms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0872/v1","date":1728637315000,"content":"Ultrasonic nondestructive testing is widely used not only in the laboratory, but also in industry. The tests use various types of ultrasonic waves, diverse measurement techniques and different apparatus. One of the problems encountered is the high susceptibility of the surface wave to interference. Some of the interference is random in nature and can be minimized (e.g., contamination of the surface, resting a finger on the surface under study). Some of the interference is permanent in nature, such as variable surface roughness. The aim of the conducted research was to evaluate the influence of roughness on ultrasonic wave propagation. The study used samples with surface roughness Sa from 0.28 to 219µm, and ultrasonic surface wave probes with frequencies from 1.41 to 8.02 MHz. It was observed that roughness significantly affects the attenuation of the ultrasonic wave, and the differences in signal amplification reached more than 15dB. Similarly, the effect of the ultrasonic wave's transit time through surfaces of different roughness was noted. It was found that the difference in the ultrasonic wave transition time was more than 50 µs. The results of the study can be helpful, for ultrasonic testing of materials with different surface conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"beaaa2a1859969820b0d5583a4e39b84a44cc6e3a8354731d7e3f9fa28f6740d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
