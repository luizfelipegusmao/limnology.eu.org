{"title":"Phenotypical Differences Between the Epidemic Strains of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Serotype Indiana 98COE and IN0919WYB2 Using an In-Vivo Pig (Sus scrofa) Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0973/v1","date":1728956276000,"content":"During the past 25 years, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has produced multiple epidemic outbreaks in the US, resulting in the emergence of different viral lineages. Currently, very little is known about the pathogenesis of many of these lineages, thus limiting our understanding of the potential biological factors favoring each lineage in these outbreaks. To determine the potential phenotypical differences between two VSV Indiana (VSIV) serotype epidemic strains using a pig model. These strains are representative of the epidemic lineages that affected the US between 1997-1998 (IN98COE) and 2019-2020 (IN0919WYB2), the latter responsible for one of the most extensive outbreaks in the US. Our initial genome analysis revealed the existence of 121 distinct mutations between both strains, including the presence of a 14-nucleotide insertion in the intergenic region between G and L genes observed in IN0919WYB2. The levels of viral RNA in clinical samples between pigs infected with IN98COE or IN0919WYB2 were compared. Overall, higher and prolonged expression of viral RNA in pigs infected with IN98COE was observed. However, clinically, IN0919WYB2 was slightly more virulent than IN98COE, as well as more efficient to produce infection through contact transmission. Additionally, infectious virus was recovered from more samples when pigs were infected with IN0919WYB2, as revealed by virus isolation in cell culture, indicating the increased ability of this virus to replicate in pigs. Sequence analyses conducted from isolates recovered from both experimental groups showed that IN0919WYB2 produced more variability during the infection, denoting the potential of this strain to evolve rapidly after a single infection-contact transmission event in pigs. Collectively, the results showed that epidemic strains of VSIV may represent disparate phenotypes in terms of virulence/transmissibility for livestock, a situation that may impact the intensity of an epidemic outbreak. This study also highlights the relevance of pathogenesis studies in pigs to characterize phenotypical differences of VSV strains affecting livestock in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"082567d8d309d573ff857f64f5cded0ef949498fdff75c8634a40ecc339bd407","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
