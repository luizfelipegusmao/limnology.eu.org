{"title":"SMPTC3: Secure Multi-party Protocol Based Trusted Cross-chain Contracts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2248/v1","date":1722324486000,"content":"We propose an innovative approach called SMPTC3, designed specifically to enhance security and privacy in cross-chain transaction verification. This approach addresses multi-chain, multi-participant information exchange and large-scale cross-chain transfers, resisting various types of malicious attacks. We leverage the verifiability of cross-chain transactions based on smart contracts and innovatively transform transaction information into confidential sets, organizing them into quadratic secret polynomials. By utilizing secret sharing and random distribution techniques, we construct a secure multiparty computation method, tailored for cross-chain transactions. To enhance the efficiency of cross-chain transactions, we introduce cross-chain batch processing technology, grouping inter-chain transactions into cross-chain transaction sets. Unlike traditional distributed notary technologies, SMPTC3 designates honest participants as a cross-chain notary group, reducing the time required for redundant signature confirmations and significantly lowering the possibility of malicious notaries. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments demonstrate that SMPTC3 is highly efficient in addressing cross-chain transaction security issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8050940421ea2add14e8f93729839a310e6b74489689e0cc62037c3ccafac8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
