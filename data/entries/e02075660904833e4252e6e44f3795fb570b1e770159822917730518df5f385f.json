{"title":"Multi-physics Simulation and Optimization of Jet Electrodeposition for Ni-Diamond Composite Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0877/v1","date":1718270087000,"content":"This work investigated the influence of  current density, plating solution flow rate, and nozzle outlet-cathode distance on the properties of Ni-diamond composite coatings. A multi-physics field simulation is employed to analyze the interplay between current density, plating solution flow rate, and nozzle outlet-cathode distance on the flow field and electric field distribution. Additionally, particle tracing simulations were incorporated into the model to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of diamond particles during composite electrodeposition. Experimental validation of the findings shows a significant increase in the diamond particle content of the coating. This combined approach provides valuable insights for optimizing the jet electrodeposition process for Ni-diamond composite coatings with superior properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e02075660904833e4252e6e44f3795fb570b1e770159822917730518df5f385f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
