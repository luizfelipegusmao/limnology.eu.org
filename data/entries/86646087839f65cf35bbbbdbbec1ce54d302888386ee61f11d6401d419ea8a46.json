{"title":"Cultured Penaeus vannamei in Korea co‐infected with white spot syndrome virus and decapod hepanhamaparvovirus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13023?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, Pacific white shrimp (<i>Penaeus vannamei</i>), pond water, crab, <i>Helice tridens</i>, and live food samples were collected from farms in three provinces of Korea to investigate the presence of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and decapod hepanhamaparvovirus (DHPV). By polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DHPV was detected in all shrimp samples (83 of 83); among these, 41 samples were detected with WSSV. Amplicon sequencing and phylogenetic analyses indicated that all DHPV samples were classified as a novel genotype of DHPV. Additionally, the collected squid, polychaeta, and crab were also confirmed to be detected with novel genotypes of DHPV. By WSSV quantitative PCR, the average concentrations of viruses detected in shrimp and pond water samples were 2.58 × 10<sup>7</sup> copies/μL and 1.27 × 10<sup>2</sup> copies/μL, respectively. Simultaneous detection of WSSV and DHPV was observed in shrimp, pond water, and crab samples, and co-infection with both viruses in shrimp could be demonstrated by histopathological analysis. Viral infection can result in significant economic losses in shrimp production. Therefore, precise monitoring and management of WSSV and DHPV prevalence in pond water, live food, and habitats are essential to preventing the spread of viral diseases in the Korean shrimp culture industry.</p>","author":"Chorong Lee, \nHye Jin Jeon, \nBumkeun Kim, \nSangsu Suh, \nPatharapol Piamsomboon, \nJi Hyung Kim, \nJee Eun Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"86646087839f65cf35bbbbdbbec1ce54d302888386ee61f11d6401d419ea8a46","category":"Environment"}
