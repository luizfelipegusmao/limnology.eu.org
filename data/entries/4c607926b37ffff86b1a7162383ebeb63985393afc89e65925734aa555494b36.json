{"title":"Multilayer Nanocarrier for Codelivery of Interferons: A Promising Strategy for Biocompatible and Long-Acting Antiviral Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0068/v1","date":1727789745000,"content":"Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines involved in the immune response with synergistic regulatory action. They are therapeutics for various viral and proliferative conditions, with proven safety and efficacy. Their clinical application presents difficulties due to the molecules' size, degradation, and pharmacokinetics. We developed a controlled release system for viral respiratory tract infections. A core-shell nanoparticle was prototyped, which hydrolyzed the shell (polyvinylpyrrolidone), releasing the active ingredients IFN-α and IFN-γ. The core (chitosan) degraded slowly, with a controlled release of IFN-α. The primary and rapid effect of the combination of interferons ensured an antiviral and immunoregulatory response from day one, induced by IFN-α and enhanced by IFN-γ. The multilayer design demonstrated an optimal toxicity profile. This formulation is an inhaled dry powder targeted for the non-invasive intranasal route. This prototype would ensure greater bioavailability, controlled release, fewer adverse effects, and robust biological action thanks to the simultaneous impact of both molecules.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c607926b37ffff86b1a7162383ebeb63985393afc89e65925734aa555494b36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
