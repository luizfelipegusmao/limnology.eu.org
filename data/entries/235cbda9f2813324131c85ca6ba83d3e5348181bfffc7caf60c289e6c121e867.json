{"title":"MiR‐2110 induced by chemically synthesized cinobufagin functions as a tumor‐metastatic suppressor via targeting FGFR1 to reduce PTEN ubiquitination degradation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24197?af=R","date":1710315863000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Tumor cell metastasis is the key cause of death in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). MiR-2110 was cloned and identified in Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive NPC, but its role is unclear in NPC. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-2110 on NPC metastasis and its related molecular basis. In addition, we also explored whether miR-2110 can be regulated by cinobufotalin (CB) and participate in the inhibition of CB on NPC metastasis. Bioinformatics, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization were used to observe the expression of miR-2110 in NPC tissues and cells. Scratch, Boyden, and tail vein metastasis model of nude mouse were used to detect the effect of miR-2110 on NPC metastasis. Western blot, Co-IP, luciferase activity, colocalization of micro confocal and ubiquitination assays were used to identify the molecular mechanism of miR-2110 affecting NPC metastasis. Finally, miR-2110 induced by CB participates in CB-stimulated inhibition of NPC metastasis was explored. The data showed that increased miR-2110 significantly suppresses NPC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Suppressing miR-2110 markedly restored NPC cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, miR-2110 directly targeted FGFR1 and reduced its protein expression. Decreased FGFR1 attenuated its recruitment of NEDD4, which downregulated NEDD4-induced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) ubiquitination and degradation and further increased PTEN protein stability, thereby inactivating PI3K/AKT-stimulated epithelial–mesenchymal transition signaling and ultimately suppressing NPC metastasis. Interestingly, CB, a potential new inhibitory drug for NPC metastasis, significantly induced miR-2110 expression by suppressing PI3K/AKT/c-Jun-mediated transcription inhibition. Suppression of miR-2110 significantly restored cell migration and invasion in CB-treated NPC cells. Finally, a clinical sample assay indicated that reduced miR-2110 was negatively correlated with NPC lymph node metastasis and positively related to NPC patient survival prognosis. In summary, miR-2110 is a metastatic suppressor involving in CB-induced suppression of NPC metastasis.</p>","author":"Shiyi Fang, \nLanzhu Peng, \nMengmin Zhang, \nRentao Hou, \nXing Deng, \nXiaoning Li, \nJianyang Xin, \nLingrong Peng, \nZhihua Liu, \nYiyi Liu, \nYingying Xie, \nBeixian Zhou, \nWeiyi Fang, \nZhen Liu, \nChao Cheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"235cbda9f2813324131c85ca6ba83d3e5348181bfffc7caf60c289e6c121e867","category":"Environment"}
