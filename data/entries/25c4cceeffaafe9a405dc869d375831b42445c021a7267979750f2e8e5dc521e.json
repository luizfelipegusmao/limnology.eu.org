{"title":"Domain Adaptation of Deep Learning Segmentation Model of Small Agricultural Burn Area Detection Using Hi-Resolution Sentinel-2 Observations: A Case Study of Punjab, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0333/v1","date":1725458886000,"content":"This study investigates the capabilities of high-resolution Sentinel-2 observations and deep learning (DL) segmentation models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for accurate mapping of small and fragmented agricultural burn areas in Punjab, India. Initially, the model was trained using ICNF burn area data from Portugal to capture large fire and burn area delineation, achieving moderate accuracy. Subsequent fine-tuning using annotated data from Punjab improved the modelâ€™s ability to detect small burn patches, demonstrating higher accuracy and precision than the baseline Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) Index method. On-ground validation using buffer zone analysis and crop field images confirms the DL approach effectiveness. Cloud interference and temporal gaps in satellite data posed some challenges. Despite these limitations, the study highlights the methodological advancements and potential of using DL models for small burn area detection in agricultural settings. The model achieved overall testing accuracy of 0.64 in Dice score assessment. This report presents a promising approach for improved mapping of the burn area, which might engender better estimation of emissions and the management practices in regions with little available ground truth data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25c4cceeffaafe9a405dc869d375831b42445c021a7267979750f2e8e5dc521e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
