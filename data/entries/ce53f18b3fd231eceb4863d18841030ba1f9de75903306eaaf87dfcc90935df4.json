The species is taxonomically monotypic, although it exhibits size variation that manifests as a gradual increase in size from northwest to southeast. Habitat loss is currently the greatest threat to the species’ existence, although populations in the few areas where <span>C. nigrescens</span> has been studied appear to be healthy, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies it as a species whose conservation status is “Least Concern” (LC).
