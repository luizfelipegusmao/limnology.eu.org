{"title":"Thermal Behaviour of LULC in the Urban Environment of the Spanish Mediterranean based on Landsat LSTs (1985-2023)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1549/v1","date":1724233470000,"content":"The social, environmental and scientific significance of the urban climate has shaped a research stream at Universitat Jaume Iâ€™s Climate Lab. Previous research has found higher temperature trends at urban observatories. This study examines in depth the features of the urban environment and the thermal behaviour of land use and land cover and the changes which have taken place. The CORINE Land Cover database was used to delimit the primary Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and its changes between 1990 and 2018. Once this had been established, land surface temperatures (LSTs) between 1985 and 2023 were retrieved from the Landsat database available on the Climate Engine website. Analysis of the primary land cover showed the greatest thermal increase in artificial surfaces, especially in industrial, commercial and transport units which are common on their outskirts. These areas also have the highest temperatures on a monthly basis with the biggest differences occurring in the summer. The results are less clear for urban fabrics and agricultural areas due to their diversity and complexity. The study concludes that urban growth and its commercial and industrial environment has an undeniable effect on the temperatures recorded by urban observatories and enables better decision-making when setting up weather stations for a more detailed time study of the urban heat island (UHI).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f38519a5b5f58a4facefd502a653c7c2869bf62f600e783f315625c21629bf9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
