{"title":"Consumer Perception of Banana Waste in Response to Ripeness: A Case Study of European and Chinese Panels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1911/v1","date":1724752029000,"content":"High production and consumption of bananas produce large amounts of banana waste. However, the perception of banana as waste depends on the degree of ripeness, and is therefore subjective, depending on the sensorial perception, emotional reactions, and cultural differences of consumers. Understanding consumer perception of different levels of banana ripeness could contribute to better management of the supply chain, leading thus to a decrease of waste or better utilization of its waste as a byproduct. The aim of this study was to compare European and Chinese consumers’ sensorial and emotional responses to different stages of banana ripeness, using facial expression analysis, liking, and emotion measurement by self-report. One hundred and thirty-five adults of European and Chinese origin watched a video of banana consumption at five different degrees of ripeness. Participants’ facial expressions were analyzed with regard to six emotions (neutral, happy, sad, surprised, angry, disgusted, scared). Emotional responses and consumer acceptance of different degrees of banana ripeness were assessed using pictures of bananas as reference. Liking on a 9-point Likert scale and emotion measurement using PrEmo® followed, to evaluate emotional responses and acceptability of different degrees of banana ripeness. Results showed significant differences in facial reactions between cultures and among ripeness degrees. The European participants were more positively inclined towards all ripeness degrees, compared to the Chinese. Cultural expectations and level of familiarity seem to affect consumer acceptability greatly. Finally, explicit methods can give a more accurate picture of consumer preference and acceptance of different banana ripeness stages. A combination of liking and emotion measurement can be very effective in understanding consumer preference.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a81ed6dbd2466c076e37a02ff4a2d0ca9145eebba4e1bdf5d7d6af37fab98494","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
