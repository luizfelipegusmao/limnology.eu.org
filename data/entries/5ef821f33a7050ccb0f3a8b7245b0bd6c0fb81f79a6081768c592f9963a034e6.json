{"title":"321 Application of the Fick Principle for the study of visceral nutrient absorption and metabolism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/133/7757344?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In 1870, Adolf Fick introduced the concept for the calculation of cardiac output by measuring gas exchange in the lungs at a meeting of the Würzburg Physiology and Medical Society. It was not until around 1930 after the development of cardiac catheterization that it was fully verified. Fick’s equation also serves as the basis for all indicator dilution methods for measuring blood flow and has been applied to several tissues throughout the body. By measuring the blood concentration of nutrients supplying and draining a tissue bed, coupled with the flow of blood, the net nutrient exchange can be calculated. Researchers first began investigating the movement of nutrients into the portal system of ruminants in the 1950s and the first method for measuring nutrient exchange in small ruminants was published in the 1960s. This approach requires the implantation of vascular catheters into an artery and the hepatic portal vein which drains the stomach, intestines, and spleen. An additional catheter is implanted upstream in a mesenteric vein for infusion of a blood flow marker, and the addition of a catheter in a hepatic vein allows the measure of blood flow and nutrient transfer in the liver. These methods were adapted for calves and dairy cows in the 1970s. The 1980s brought further refinement of the methodologies such as improved catheter materials allowing animals to be maintained for extended periods and, several researchers published data from cattle, sheep, and goats. These methods have been coupled with measures of ruminal and intestinal disappearance as well as isotopic tracers to examine nutrient exchange and metabolism by tissues. The goal of this presentation is to review the development of this approach for studying nutrient absorption in vivo, and to highlight specific advancements in its application.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5ef821f33a7050ccb0f3a8b7245b0bd6c0fb81f79a6081768c592f9963a034e6","category":"Environment"}
