{"title":"Microwave Digital Twin Prototype for the Shoulder Injury Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0070/v1","date":1725267476000,"content":"One of the most common shoulder injuries is rotator cuff tear (RCT). The risk of RCTs increases with age, with a prevalence of 9.7% in those under 20 years old to 62% in individuals aged 80 and older. In this article, we present first Microwave Digital Twin Prototype (MDTP) for RCT detection, based on machine learning (ML) and advanced numerical modeling of the system. We generate a generalizable dataset of scattering parameters through flexible numerical modeling, in order to bypass real-world data collection challenges. This involves solving the linear system in result of finite element discretization of the forward problem with use of domain decomposition method to accelerate the computations. We use support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate between injured and healthy shoulder models. This approach is more efficient in terms of required memory resources and computing time compared to the traditional imaging methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32f7876b2cb3b2143f131d7716d6d42d86ad0a1b70e50e814ddadd83a59dc754","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
