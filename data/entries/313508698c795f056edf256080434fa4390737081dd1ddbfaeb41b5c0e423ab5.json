{"title":"Hesperetin Inhibits Xanthine Oxidase Activity via Altering the Protein&rsquo;s Secondary Structure and Suppressing Superoxide Anion Generation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1678/v1","date":1714053715000,"content":"Hyperuricemia is mainly caused by the overproduction of uric acid (UA) catalyzed from xanthine by xanthine oxidase (XO) in abnormal purine metabolism in human body. There is an increasing demand for developing novel XO inhibitors of plant origins. The inhibition kinetics and type as well as actions of hesperetin against XO were investigated in vitro using multi-spectroscopic methods including UV-Vis absorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking simulation. Results indicated that hesperetin reversibly inhibited XO in a competitive manner with an inhibition constant (Ki) value of (2.15 ± 0.05) × 10-6 mol/L. Hesperetin had a higher scavenging rate against O2- radical generated by the XO reaction system. The binding of hesperetin to the active site of XO altered the protein’s secondary structure as demonstrated by FT-IR and fluorescence spectra. Molecular docking study revealed that hesperetin had highly affinity to XO and the bonding of hesperetin to the molybdopterin (Mo-pt) active center inhibited not only substrate entry, but also prevented oxygen binding to flavin adenine dinucleotide (another active center in XO). Additionally, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds contributed to the stabilization of the hesperetin-XO complex. The results suggested that hesperetin be a promising natural XO inhibitor to alleviate hyperuricemia and gout.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"313508698c795f056edf256080434fa4390737081dd1ddbfaeb41b5c0e423ab5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
