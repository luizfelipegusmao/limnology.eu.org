{"title":"Individual quality, insecure organizational attachment, and formalistic task completion: Social cognitive perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301256","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Wenjun Wu, Huan Xiao, Dengke Yu</p>\r\n\r\nFormalistic tasks are widely utilized in modern companies due to their ability to increase productivity and contribute to the achievement of corporate goals at a lower cost. However, these tasks are often meet with resistance from individuals because they do not provide direct short-term rewards for their efforts. Drawing on social cognitive theory, this study examined the influence of individual quality and organizational attachment on the completion of formalistic tasks. To address this, the study conducted a questionnaire survey to collect data from 602 Chinese respondents and built a structural equation model for data analysis. Through empirical research, the study confirmed the positive role of individual quality, including knowledge and personality, in the completion of formalistic tasks. Furthermore, the study proved that avoidant attachment could significantly weaken the effect of some components of individual quality on formalistic task completion. This paper is the first to reveal the influence of individual and environmental factors on individualsâ€™ completion of formalistic tasks, progressing from bottom to top. The implications of these results are discussed.","author":"Wenjun Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f908a3c7f6d37c57a3453e999d408c46fd3c211aa467cc170977bd318853a665","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
