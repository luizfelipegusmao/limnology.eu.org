{"title":"Proof of Goldbach's Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2235/v1","date":1727601371000,"content":"The paper presents two novel mathematical approaches to prove Goldbach's conjecture. The conjecture states that every even number greater than or equal to 6 can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers. We propose that the conjecture has only four genetic codes, and as long as one of them remains valid, the conjecture continues to hold. Through these new mathematical ideas, we aim to prove the validity of Goldbach's conjecture comprehensively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7d5e028571ef4fafcc7d0459cff034603d675187e3795cc4c4c39d9975d707e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
