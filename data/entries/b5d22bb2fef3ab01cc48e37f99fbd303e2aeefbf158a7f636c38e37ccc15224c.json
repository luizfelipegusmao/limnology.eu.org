{"title":"Developing Standard BIM Execution Plans for Complex Construction Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1858/v1","date":1716889795000,"content":"This study focuses on the difficulties of standardizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) Execution Plans (BEPs) in the Architecture Engineering Construction and Operations (AECO) sector. The main objective is to improve digital transformation by implementing more efficient methodologies. The task involves analyzing 36 BEP documents from different international organizations to identify similarities and differences in terms of content structure operational methods and project characteristics. The research highlights the necessity of implementing a uniform method to enhance collaboration and information sharing in BIM projects. The documents contain key elements such as project information goals roles collaboration procedures model structure and quality control. The paper presents a comprehensive framework for BEPs with the goal of resolving the discrepancies observed in existing methods that impede the efficiency of project delivery. This study utilizes scientometric analysis to examine literature published between 2020 and 2023. The aim is to track the progress of BEP standards identify key research topics and determine influential works in the field. The findings support the implementation of standardized guidelines to reduce inefficiencies and improve the effectiveness of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in large-scale construction projects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5d22bb2fef3ab01cc48e37f99fbd303e2aeefbf158a7f636c38e37ccc15224c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
