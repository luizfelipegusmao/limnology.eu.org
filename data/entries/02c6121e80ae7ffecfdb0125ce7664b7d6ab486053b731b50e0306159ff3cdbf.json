{"title":"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pneumococcal Vaccine in the Pediatric Population: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0830/v1","date":1723499556000,"content":"Pneumococcal disease, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of high mortality in children worldwide. The tremendous direct cost of hospital admissions and significant indirect costs from productivity loss contributed considerably to the economic burden, with vaccination being the only efficient way against the illness. Our study aims to summarize the cost-effectiveness of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) implemented in the pediatric population. Employing online databases from Pubmed, Embase, and Medline, we looked for economic evaluation from 2018 until March 2024. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICER) and Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) were the primary outcomes for measuring PCV's cost-effectiveness. A 28-item CHEERS 2022 checklist was applied to assess the quality of collected studies. Of the 16 papers found, 9/16 discussed the lower-valent vaccine (PCV13, PCV10) and 7/16 examined the higher-valent vaccine. (PCV20, PCV15). PCV13 and PCV10 required more cost and generated more QALY compared to no vaccination. Both PCV15 and PCV20 averted substantial healthcare costs and yielded greater quality of life than PCV13. Additionally, PCV20 was a dominant strategy compared to PCV15. Utilizing PCV13 is a very cost-effective option compared to not getting vaccinated. Transitioning from PCV13 to PCV20 would result in higher QALY gain and more cost-saving than switching to PCV15.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02c6121e80ae7ffecfdb0125ce7664b7d6ab486053b731b50e0306159ff3cdbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
