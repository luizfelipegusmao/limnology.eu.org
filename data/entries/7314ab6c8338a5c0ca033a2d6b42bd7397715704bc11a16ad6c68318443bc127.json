{"title":"A Comprehensive Report on Same-Day Discharge (SDD) Following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA): A Multi-Center Database Analysis of 235,393 Patients and 25,388 Same-Day Discharges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1296/v1","date":1716208675000,"content":"Introduction:The concept of same-day discharge has garnered increasing significance within orthopedic surgery, particularly in hip and knee procedures. Despite initial concerns surrounding the absence of prolonged hospital care, a burgeoning body of evidence highlights numerous advantages associated with same-day discharge, ranging from mitigating in-hospital infections to offering substantial financial and psychosocial benefits for both patients and healthcare providers. In this study, we aim to scrutinize the trends in same-day discharge specifically within the realm of total hip arthroplasties. Method:This retrospective analysis delves into the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database spanning from 2016 to 2021. Result:In this study, same-day hip patients skewed younger, comprising 48.3%females compared to 55.6% in hospitalized hip patients. Operatively, same-day hip surgeries boasted shorter durations, averaging 83.9 minutes, in contrast to the 92.3minutes for hospitalized hip procedures. Postoperatively, same-day hip patients exhibited significantly diminished rates of 30-day readmissions (1.7%vs. 3.5%), procedure-related readmissions (1.0%vs.2.1%), reoperations (1.1%vs.1.9%), and mortality (0.02% vs. 0.04%). In addition, we found that that unplanned readmissions in the same-day group are significantly predicted by being over 65 years old (OR: 2.0), having hypertension (OR: 1.6), chronic steroid usage (OR: 2.2), and severe COPD (OR: 2.0), while gender, emergent surgery indication, and smoking were not significant predictors. Moreover, the prevalence of the same-day discharge concept experienced a remarkable ascent from 2016 to 2021, with rates escalating from 1.5% to 25.6% of all total hip arthroplasties over a span of just six years. Conclusion:In conclusion, same-day discharge is a feasible and safe option for selected THA patients, improving healthcare efficiency and patient satisfaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7314ab6c8338a5c0ca033a2d6b42bd7397715704bc11a16ad6c68318443bc127","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
