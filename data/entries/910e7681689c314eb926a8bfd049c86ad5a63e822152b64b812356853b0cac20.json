A major difficulty for investigating arrhythmias is the lack of appropriate human models. Here, we present a protocol for a translational simulation of different types of arrhythmias using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and electric cell culture pacing. The protocol comprises the handling of ventricular and atrial hiPSC-CM before and during in vitro arrhythmia simulation and possible arrhythmia simulation protocols mimicking clinical arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. Isolated or confluent hiPSC-CM can be used for the simulation. In vitro arrhythmia simulation did not impair cell viability of hiPSC-CM and could reproduce arrhythmia associated phenotypes of patients. The use of hiPSC-CM enables patient-specific studies of arrhythmias, genetic interventions, or drug-screening. Thus, the in vitro arrhythmia simulation protocol may offer a versatile tool for translational studies on the mechanisms and treatment options of cardiac arrhythmias.","author":"Thea Bommer","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"910e7681689c314eb926a8bfd049c86ad5a63e822152b64b812356853b0cac20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
