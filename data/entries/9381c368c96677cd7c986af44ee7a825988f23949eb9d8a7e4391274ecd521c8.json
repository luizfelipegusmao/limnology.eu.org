With the introduction of improved and more robust 3D printing technology, as well as more accessible powder stock for printing, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has emerged as a viable candidate to AM ultra-high strength structural alloys, specifically maraging 300 steels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9381c368c96677cd7c986af44ee7a825988f23949eb9d8a7e4391274ecd521c8","category":"Environment"}
