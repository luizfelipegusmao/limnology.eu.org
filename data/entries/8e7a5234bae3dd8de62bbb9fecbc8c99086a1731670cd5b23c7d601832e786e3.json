Through careful supervision and curation, parents and educators may maximize the usefulness of the site as a medium for teaching young learners English language skills while also minimizing any potential downsides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e7a5234bae3dd8de62bbb9fecbc8c99086a1731670cd5b23c7d601832e786e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
