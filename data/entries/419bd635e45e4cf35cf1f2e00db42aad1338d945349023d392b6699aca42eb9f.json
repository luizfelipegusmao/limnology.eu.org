Applying rational drug design, we synthesized a potent dual-targeting small molecule, SP-1-303. Here, we report SP-1-303 as a class I isoform selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and an activator of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM). <i>In vitro</i> enzymatic assays demonstrated selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3. Cellular growth inhibition studies show that SP-1-303 differentially inhibits growth of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER+ BC) cells with effective growth inhibition concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) for MCF-7 and T47D cells ranging from 0.32 to 0.34 μM, compared to 1.2–2.5 μM for triple negative breast cancer cells, and ~12 μM for normal breast epithelial cells. Western analysis reveals that SP-1-303 decreases estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) expression and increases p53 protein expression, while inducing the phosphorylation of ATM and its substrates, BRCA1 and p53, in a time-dependent manner in ER+ BC cells. Pharmacokinetic evaluation demonstrates an area under the curve (AUC) of 5227.55 ng/ml × h with an elimination half-life of 1.26 h following intravenous administration in a rat model. Collectively, SP-1-303 emerges as a novel second generation class I (HDAC1 and HDAC3) selective HDAC inhibitor, and ATM activator, capable of modulating ER expression, and inhibiting growth of ER+ BC cells. Combined targeting of class I HDACs and ATM by SP-1-303 offers a promising therapeutic approach for treating ER+ breast cancers and supports further preclinical evaluation.","author":"Mira Jung","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"419bd635e45e4cf35cf1f2e00db42aad1338d945349023d392b6699aca42eb9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
