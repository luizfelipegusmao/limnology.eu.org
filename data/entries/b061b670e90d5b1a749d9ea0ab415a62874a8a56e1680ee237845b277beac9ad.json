{"title":"Characterization of Lithraea molleoides Gum Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0074/v1","date":1727848493000,"content":"Lithraea molleoides fruit gum (LMFG) is a valuable product obtained from the total hydrolysis of the fruit. The hydrolysis process involves three methods: thermal (LMFGT), basic (LMFGB), and acid (LMFGA). Through these methods, the aim is to break bonds and de-esterify polysaccharides, resulting in increased solubility and decreased molecular weight. The resulting hydrolysates are then combined with pectins in a 1:2 ratios to form films. In this study, the focus is on utilizing the hydrolysates of Lithraea molleoides gums for film applications, with an evaluation of their structural and physicochemical characteristics. The films produced exhibit excellent mechanical properties and low water vapor permeability, as well as exceptional thermal stability. These properties make them highly suitable for industrial films in pharmaceutical and food applications. This research highlights the potential of LMFG-based films as a viable solution for various industrial needs due to their outstanding performance across multiple parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b061b670e90d5b1a749d9ea0ab415a62874a8a56e1680ee237845b277beac9ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
