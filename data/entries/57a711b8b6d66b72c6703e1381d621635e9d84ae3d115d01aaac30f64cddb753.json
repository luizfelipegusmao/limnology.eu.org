{"title":"Influenza Vaccination Uptake among Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus in Spain: A Cross-Sectional Study of Associated Factors from the European Health Interview Survey 2020","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0933/v1","date":1720684197000,"content":"Background: Vaccination against influenza has proven to reduce influenza-caused hospital entries, treatment times in intensive care units and hospitalisation costs for treating people with Diabetes Mellitus. Despite the existing influenza vaccination recommendations for all persons with Diabetes Mellitus, in Spain, vaccination rates lag behind target. We aimed to assess predictors for vaccination uptake and reasons for non-adherence. Methods: Data from the 2020 European Health Interview Survey were analysed using uni-and multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by age group and including possible confounders and vaccination as an outcome. Associations to the sociodemographic profile, healthcare access and substance use were explored. Results: Our analysis included 2,194 individuals with Diabetes Mellitus over the age of 15, showing an influenza vaccination rate of 53%. The findings revealed significant predictors of vaccination uptake, including age over 60 years and robust social support. Conversely, younger age, higher education levels, infrequent healthcare interactions, and economic barriers emerged as significant obstacles to vaccination. Conclusions: To enhance vaccination rates, targeted public health interventions should emphasize the importance of vaccination for younger, more educated individuals with DM, those facing economic barriers, and those with lower levels of social support could bridge the existing gap in vaccination coverage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57a711b8b6d66b72c6703e1381d621635e9d84ae3d115d01aaac30f64cddb753","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
