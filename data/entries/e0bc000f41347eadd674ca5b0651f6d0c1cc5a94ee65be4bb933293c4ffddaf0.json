{"title":"Relationship between Modern ART Regimens and Immunosenescence Markers in Patients with Chronic HIV Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1884/v1","date":1719460078000,"content":"The increased life expectancy of PLHIV (People Living with HIV) and the successful highly com-bined antiretroviral therapy (cART) poses new clinical challenges regarding aging and its co-morbid condition. It is commonly believed that HIV infection \"accelerates\" aging. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is characterised by inflammation and immune activation that persists despite cART and that may contribute to the development of co-morbid conditions. Toxicity associated with cART contributes to persistent immune dysregulation. Therefore, we aimed to compare current cART regimens in the light of premature aging to evaluate residual immune activation and inflammation in virologically suppressed patients. We studied a panel of biomarkers (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-18, GM-CSF, TNF-α, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, soluble CD14), which could provide a non-invasive and af-fordable approach to monitor HIV-related chronic inflammation. The results of the current study do not provide hard evidence favoring a particular cART regimen, although they show less fa-vorable regimen profile containing protease inhibitor. Our data suggests incomplete reduction of inflammation and immune activation in terms of the effective cART. It is likely that the inter-est in various biomarkers related to immune activation and inflammation as predictors of clini-cal outcomes among PLHIV will increase in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0bc000f41347eadd674ca5b0651f6d0c1cc5a94ee65be4bb933293c4ffddaf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
