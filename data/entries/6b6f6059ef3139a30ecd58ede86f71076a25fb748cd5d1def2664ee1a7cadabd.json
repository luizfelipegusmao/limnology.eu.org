It investigates how e-commerce platforms and their suppliers navigate complexities to foster trust, enhance collaboration, and ensure ethical practices in global supply chains. The research employs a qualitative approach, utilizing semi-structured interviews with industry stakeholders to gather insights into current practices, challenges, and strategies in SRM. Findings highlight transparency as pivotal for sharing critical information such as sales forecasts, inventory levels, and pricing strategies, enabling suppliers to align operations with market demands effectively. However, achieving transparency faces hurdles including data privacy concerns and competitive sensitivities, necessitating robust data security measures and clear communication protocols. Accountability mechanisms, such as formal agreements and governance frameworks, emerge as essential for mitigating risks, resolving disputes, and ensuring compliance with ethical and regulatory standards across diverse contexts. Technological innovations like AI, blockchain, and big data analytics are transforming SRM by enhancing supply chain visibility, operational efficiency, and decision-making capabilities. Cultural factors and regulatory compliance also significantly influence SRM practices, shaping communication styles, relationship dynamics, and legal considerations. Emerging trends such as sustainable sourcing practices and collaborative partnerships are reshaping SRM, emphasizing sustainability and responsible business practices. This study contributes to the understanding of effective SRM strategies, offering insights and recommendations for stakeholders navigating the complexities of e-commerce supply chains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b6f6059ef3139a30ecd58ede86f71076a25fb748cd5d1def2664ee1a7cadabd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
