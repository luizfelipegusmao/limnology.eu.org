{"title":"Effectiveness of a Mobile Health Application for Educating Outpatients About Bowel Preparation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0064/v1","date":1714544344000,"content":"Colonoscopy, essential for diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer, relies on effective bowel preparation to inspect the colonic mucosa fully. Traditional education methods include printed instructions and verbal explanations, but these may not ensure clear patient understanding. Poor bowel preparation can obscure mucosal visibility, delaying cancer diagnosis and treatment. Using the outpatientâ€™s Android mobile device, the mobile health care model is provided as a nursing guide to assist in bowel preparation for colonoscopy. This single-blinded, randomized trial en-rolled patients for colonoscopy at a Northern Taiwan gastroenterology center. Eligible patients were physically and mentally healthy and could communicate in Chinese. The study tested the ColonClean app during bowel preparation. After the procedure, endoscopists rated the prepara-tion quality using the Aronchick Scale. Data analysis with SPSS software (version 25.0) evaluated if the app significantly improved bowel preparation compared to those who did not use it. Forty patients were recruited for both the control (conventional method) and experimental (conven-tional method plus ColonClean app) groups. In the experimental group, endoscopists assessed bowel preparation quality; all achieved at least \"Fair,\" with 75% receiving \"Excellent\" or \"Good\" ratings. The ColonClean App enhanced bowel preparation quality more effectively than tradi-tional nursing guidance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39ef9010b3034e897d6b262ef1a1f1b2bc15c81989bc84998015e037a7b708cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
