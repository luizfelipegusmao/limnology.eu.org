{"title":"Environmental Concern and Minimalism in Collectivist Culture Impact on Green Purchase Intention: the Mediating Role of Pro-Environmental Behaviours (Public and Private)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1681/v1","date":1729585511000,"content":"This article investigates the impact of minimalism, collectivist culture, and environmental concern support on green purchase intention through the mediating role of pro-environmental behaviours. We found the following key insights based on our analysis of data from 385 participants in collectivist cultures at the emerging economy countries: (1) pro-environmental behaviours have a positive mediating relationship between minimalism and green purchase intention; (2) pro-environmental behaviours have a positive mediating relationship between collectivist culture and green purchase intention; and (3) pro-environmental behaviours have a positive mediating relationship between environmental concern and green purchase intention. Additionally, the findings show that people who embrace minimalism in collectivist cultures are more inclined to take part in activities that benefit the environment. Similarly, the findings will have an influence on policy-making and practical implementation in similar socioeconomic conditions. Implications relating to theory and practice are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09755b3eb674496f8423159a3b496e51264e610c261f176c108a50bc1bf059f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
