{"title":"Alginate beads loaded with rambutan extract: characterization and stability during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13397?af=R","date":1718692178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Fallen young rambutan fruit is an underrated agricultural waste which may contain several bioactive compounds. In this study, fallen young rambutan fruit was assessed regarding its phenolic contents and antioxidant activities. In order to expand its utilization, rambutan extract-loaded hydrogel beads were developed by a basic spherification technique using sodium alginate. The effect of ratios of polymer and extract and different calcium sources were evaluated. The recovery of bioactive compounds from the hydrogel beads was determined using <i>in vitro</i> gastrointestinal digestion models.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Use of 50% (v/v) ethanol yielded rambutan extract with good chemical properties. The production of hydrogel beads using a ratio of 1:3 with calcium lactate provided the highest production yield of 122.94%. The hydrogel beads developed using the ratio of 1:3 with a combination of calcium lactate and calcium chloride showed high recovery of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity after simulated intestinal digestion, which were greater compared to unencapsulated extract.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The findings demonstrate that the ratio of wall material to rambutan extract and the calcium source influence the physical properties, chemical properties and <i>in vitro</i> gastrointestinal digestion stability of alginate beads. The obtained hydrogel beads may have potential for application in the food or pharmaceutical industries.
