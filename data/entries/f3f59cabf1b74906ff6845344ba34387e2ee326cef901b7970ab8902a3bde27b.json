{"title":"Smart Viniculture: Applying AI for Improved Winemaking and Risk Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0580/v1","date":1725861953000,"content":"This review explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the entire winemaking process, from viticulture to bottling, with a particular focus on enhancing food safety and traceability. It discusses AIâ€™s applications in optimizing grape cultivation, fermentation, bottling, and quality control, while emphasizing its critical role in managing microbiological risks such as mycotoxins. The review aims to show how AI technologies not only refine operational efficiencies but also raise safety standards and ensure traceability from vineyard to consumer. Challenges in AI implementation and future directions for integrating more advanced AI solutions into the winemaking industry will also be discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of AI's potential to revolutionize traditional practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3f59cabf1b74906ff6845344ba34387e2ee326cef901b7970ab8902a3bde27b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
