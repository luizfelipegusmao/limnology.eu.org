{"title":"Enlarged External Occipital Protuberance (EEOP) and Tech Neck Posture: A Comparative CBCT Analysis between Modern and Ancient Populations in Abruzzo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0954/v1","date":1723551966000,"content":"The External Occipital Protuberance (EOP) is a notable anatomical landmark connected to neck musculature. With the rise of tech neck syndrome due to prolonged smartphone use, concerns have emerged regarding its influence on EOP morphology. This study compares EEOP characteristics in contemporary individuals (aged 18-30 years) from Abruzzo with ancient skulls from the Opi necropolis (VII-Vth century BC) Methods: Four null hypotheses were tested concerning EEOP prevalence and severity: (1) no gender differences, (2) no differences between modern and ancient populations, (3) no gender-based variations in severity, and (4) no temporal differences in severity. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the significance of these hypotheses. Results: The study found a higher prevalence of EEOP in modern individuals compared to ancient populations, with no significant gender differences in prevalence. However, severity of EEOP showed significant variation by gender and historical period, with modern individuals exhibiting greater severity. Conclusions: The observed increase in EEOP prevalence and severity in modern populations suggests a potential influence of tech neck posture associated with increased screen time. These findings underscore the need for further research into the effects of contemporary lifestyle factors on cranial morphology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ae42c1055ddd20b1f4449e2defd42232041034711f4e64d846f10bb94e17e64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
