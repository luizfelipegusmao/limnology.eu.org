{"title":"Antimicrobial Resistance of Fecal‐Indicator Bacteria Isolated from Aquatic Animal Farms along the Korean Coast","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5014754?af=R","date":1678089600000,"content":"<p>The safety of seafood is a critical public health concern in Korea because of the high rate of raw seafood consumption. We investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of fecal-associated bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) in 50 seawater samples and 48 aquatic animals collected from aquaculture farms along the Korean coast in 2018. Of them, <i>E. coli</i> was the most prevalent in seawater (24.0%) and aquatic animals (18.8%). Although more than 80.0% of <i>E. coli</i> isolates were sensitive to 9 of 15 antimicrobials, approximately 20.0% of the isolates were resistant to 4 antimicrobials, including tetracycline and streptomycin. <i>Enterococcus</i> spp. isolates (2.7–32.0%) were resistant to only 5 of 12 antimicrobials. Notably, 30.1% of <i>E. coli</i> isolates were resistant to three or more antimicrobials. To minimize health risks associated with raw seafood consumption, more research is needed concerning the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators.</p>","author":"Soon Bum Shin, \nSung Rae Cho, \nJong Soo Mok, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"928a0b6ab3b4020aa8a93f0c0551d2480e54a090770fe5ceab32431a1701859b","category":"Environment"}
