The prevalence of stunting varies significantly throughout Ethiopian regions. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the geographical variation in predictors of stunting among children under the age of five in Ethiopia using 2019 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey.</p> Method <p>The current analysis was based on data from the 2019 mini Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total of 5,490 children under the age of five were included in the weighted sample. Descriptive and inferential analysis was done using STATA 17. For the spatial analysis, ArcGIS 10.7 were used. Spatial regression was used to identify the variables associated with stunting hotspots, and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and Corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) were used to compare the models. As the prevalence of stunting was over 10%, a multilevel robust Poisson regression was conducted. In the bivariable analysis, variables having a p-value &lt; 0.2 were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression analysis, the adjusted prevalence ratio with the 95% confidence interval is presented to show the statistical significance and strength of the association.</p> Result <p>The prevalence of stunting was 33.58% (95%CI: 32.34%, 34.84%) with a clustered geographic pattern (Moran’s I = 0.40, p&lt;0.001). significant hotspot areas of stunting were identified in the west and south Afar, Tigray, Amhara and east SNNPR regions. In the local model, no maternal education, poverty, child age 6–23 months and male headed household were predictors associated with spatial variation of stunting among under five children in Ethiopia. In the multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression the prevalence of stunting among children whose mother’s age is &gt;40 (APR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.55, 0.99). Children whose mother had secondary (APR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.60, 0.91) and higher (APR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.44, 0.84) educational status, household wealth status (APR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.76, 0.99), child aged 6–23 months (APR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.53, 2.28) were all significantly associated with stunting.</p> Conclusion <p>In Ethiopia, under-five children suffering from stunting have been found to exhibit a spatially clustered pattern. Maternal education, wealth index, birth interval and child age were determining factors of spatial variation of stunting. As a result, a detailed map of stunting hotspots and determinants among children under the age of five aid program planners and decision-makers in designing targeted public health measures.</p>","author":"Beminate Lemma Seifu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cd2fbd493f95aa007b7457a6a8b38cb5aa98660dccfc67346336c091a4797d40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
