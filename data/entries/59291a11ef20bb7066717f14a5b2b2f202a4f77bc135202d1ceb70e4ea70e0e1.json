{"title":"Feasting in mussel farms fattens up snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) compared to snapper in adjacent natural habitats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aff2.155?af=R","date":1710317306000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The presence of wild fish in and around aquaculture habitats is often assumed a response to food resources within these habitats, either from input feed, the presence of cultured species, and/or the assemblage of biofouling that naturally colonises aquaculture structures. The nutritional quality of the food resources consumed by wild fish in aquaculture habitats is also important in determining their nutritional condition and subsequent productivity. Few studies have investigated the nutritional quality of prey in aquaculture habitats, and these have mostly focused on fed aquaculture by tracking manufactured fish pellets into the diets of wild fish. However, in non-fed aquaculture, the assemblage of cultured and biofouling species may also provide a nutritional benefit to fish feeding in these habitats. The Australasian snapper, <i>Chrysophrys auratus</i>, are commonly present as adults within coastal mussel farms in New Zealand and tend to become a resident species. This study investigated the nutritional quality of the gut contents of snapper in soft-sediment habitats within and outside of New Zealand green-lipped mussel farms. Total lipid, protein, carbohydrate and total calorific content were measured from the gut contents of snapper sampled from mussel farm and natural (i.e. control) habitats. Snapper in mussel farms had double the dietary intake of lipid (16% vs. 8%) from consuming lipid-rich bivalves and barnacles which are in abundance in mussel farms. Higher lipid intake can contribute to improved nutritional condition, reproduction and growth in snapper. However, the higher dietary lipid intake of snapper in mussel farms did not increase their overall body condition (i.e. Fulton condition index). This may be due to the coarse nature of this measure, or the use of the additional lipid in more rapid somatic growth or reproductive outputs, possibilities that warrant examination through further research. Overall, this study shows for the first time the potential ecosystem benefits of shellfish aquaculture in provisioning nutritionally valuable prey for coastal fish populations.</p>","author":"Lucy H.
