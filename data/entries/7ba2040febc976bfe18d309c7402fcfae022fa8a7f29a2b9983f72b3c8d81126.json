{"title":"Nanotechnological Advances in Burn Wound Care: Chitosan-Based Nanogel Incorporating Silver Sulfadiazine-loaded Nanosuspension for Partial Thickness Burns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1971/v1","date":1727234699000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Burn lesions damage the skin's outermost defensive layer, allowing pathogenic microbes including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli to infiltrate. Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is an effective antibacterial agent approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) and is considered as the gold standard for burn wound treatment. Despite the high degree of efficacy of SSD in burn wound management, it possesses some drawbacks, such as poor solubility, low topical bioavailability and skin irritations. The present study endeavours to develop nanosuspension based SSD nanogel for improving the deliverability of SSD and its therapeutic outcomes for the management of partial thickness burn; Methods: The SSD nanosuspension was formulated employing controlled nanoprecipitation approach using various surfactants; Results: The formulation was optimized utilizing one-factor-at-a-time approach and to fetch the optimized formulation of 134.6 nm size. The optimized nanosuspension was incorporated into chitosan gel that offer superior drug release potential, and also offered better spreadability (5.21 ± 0.38g) and extrudability (152.27 ± 0.22 gm) that represents the easy application over the skin and extrusion of gel from the tube; Conclusions: The formulation was well tolerated as shown by skin irritation study and offered a superior burn lesion healing characteristics vis-à-vis the marketed product, even at a lower concentration. Hence, the formulation offers a huge potential in enhancing the clinical outcomes of SSD, especially in the management of partial thickness burn. The developed system with the above mentioned outcomes could be a promising delivery system for partial thickness burn wound management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ba2040febc976bfe18d309c7402fcfae022fa8a7f29a2b9983f72b3c8d81126","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
