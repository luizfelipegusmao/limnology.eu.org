{"title":"Heat-Annealed Zinc Oxide on Carbon Nanotube Paper and Exposed to Gradient Light to Enhance Its Photoelectric Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0720/v1","date":1712801411000,"content":"Buckypaper (BP), a flexible and porous material, exhibits photovoltaic properties when exposed to light. In this study, we have employed Radio Frequency (RF) Sputtering of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) followed by rapid thermal annealing to enhance the photovoltaic response of BP. We investigated the impact of various sputtering parameters, such as the gas flow ratio of argon to oxygen and deposition time, on the morphology, composition, resistivity, and photovoltaic characteristics of ZnO-modified BP. Additionally, the photovoltaic performance of the samples under different illumination modes and wavelengths was compared. It was found that optimal sputtering conditions—argon to oxygen flow ratio of 1:2, deposition time of 20 minutes, and power of 100 watts—resulted in a ZnO film thickness of approximately 45 nanometers. After annealing at 400°C for 10 minutes, the ZnO-modified BP demonstrated a significant increase in photocurrent and photovoltage, along with a reduction in resistivity, compared to unmodified BP. Moreover, under gradient illumination, the ZnO-modified BP exhibited a photovoltage enhancement of 14.70 times and a photocurrent increase of 13.86 times, compared to uniform illumination. Under blue light, it showed a higher photovoltaic response than under other colors. The enhancement in photovoltaic response is attributed to the formation of a Schottky junction between ZnO and BP, an increased carrier concentration gradient, and an expanded light absorption spectrum. Our results validate that ZnO sputtering followed by annealing is an effective method for modifying BP for photovoltaic applications such as solar cells and photodetectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e5b786629ca408ab3ccfdfbca7afee11365c60d14e5587f2a23c7d0b471adcc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
