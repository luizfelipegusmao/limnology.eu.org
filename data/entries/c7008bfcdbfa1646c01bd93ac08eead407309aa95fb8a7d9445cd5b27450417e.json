In contrast to conventional imaging modes, e.g., BF, ADF, full-field iterative ptychographic reconstruction methods utilize the complete distribution of scattered electrons in the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern recorded on the pixelated detectors, and concurrently updates both the object and the probe functions [<a href=\"#ozae044.910-B1\">1</a>]. This allows for a spatial resolution well beyond the traditional numerical-aperture-limited resolution with high dose efficiency. Dose efficiency could be further improved by mixed-state electron ptychography accounting for the partial coherence of the electron beam [<a href=\"#ozae044.910-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c7008bfcdbfa1646c01bd93ac08eead407309aa95fb8a7d9445cd5b27450417e","category":"Environment"}
