{"title":"Exploring Egalitarianism: A Methodological Review and Research Agenda on Egalitarianism to Foster Positive Intergroup Relations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0288/v2","date":1720065481000,"content":"Considerable research on intergroup relations emphasizes attitudes, motivations, and emotions that lead to reduction of prejudice. While factors that actively promote positive intergroup interactions have been emerging, a central theoretical framework has not been formally proposed. To address this gap, we engage a positive psychology lens to explore how and why people overcome their internalized biases to seek out successful and positive intergroup relations, looking to the positive counterparts of traditional prejudice-reduction models to begin building a framework of understanding. We reviewed the literature on values that guide intergroup behavior. After scanning 16,840 records that emerged in PsycInfo using keywords “egalitarian,” “non-prejudice,” and “intergroup,” we assessed 158 articles for eligibility. Among the relevant articles (N = 54), we analyzed authors’ definitions, methods of measurement, types of processes, and outcomes associated with egalitarian and non-prejudice values as they related to intergroup behavior. Overall, there was notable variability in how researchers conceptualized and observed egalitarianism. We discuss the five broad categories of egalitarianism (prejudice reduction, positive expression, concern for others, low social-dominance orientation, and universal orientation) and how they relate to positive or negative, and approach or avoidant outcomes. We propose a centralized model for studying positive values in intergroup contexts moving forward.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6414d9618a2469625bd88953e03570826bb8db5b4f9cc5ac013545d4ff06e0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
