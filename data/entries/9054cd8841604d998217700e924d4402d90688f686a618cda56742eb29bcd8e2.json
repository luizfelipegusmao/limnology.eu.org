{"title":"Epidaure Market–Effectiveness and transferability of a school-based intervention to improve healthy and sustainable food choices by schoolchildren: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial and qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306781","date":1720533600000,"content":"<p>by Aurélie Curnier, Marie Cholley-Gomez, Florian Lecêtre, Audrey Peteuil, Nicolas Meunier-Beillard, Leslie Fonquerne, Lucy Darras, Sabrina Eymard-Duvernay, Caroline Méjean, Cyrille Delpierre, Vanessa Cottet, Florence Cousson-Gélie</p>\r\nContext <p>At least 40% of cancers are linked to environmental or behavioral factors, and dietary behavior appears to be a major lever. Epidaure Market is a prevention initiative developed using a method for co-constructing health promotion initiatives and prevention programs that stratifies evidence from the scientific literature and combines it with experiential knowledge (DEVA, TPB, BCT). It promotes a sustainable diet (i.e., healthy, ecological and ethical nutrition) among 5th and 4th grade students during the crucial period of adolescence, when these behaviors are often far from the recommendations.</p> Method <p>The protocol implemented was carried out in 72 middle school classes in the Montpellier and Dijon academies. The intervention included teaching sessions and a virtual supermarket game, integrated into the school curriculum and delivered by science teachers. Effectiveness is tested in a cluster randomized controlled trial with 3 evaluation times (pre- and post-intervention and 1 follow-up). The study also includes an implementation assessment, with process analysis and implementation elements, as well as a transferability assessment based on key functions (FIC model and Astaire grid).</p> Expected outcomes <p>The study is still underway within the school. The primary expected outcome is a positive influence on the motives underlying food choices to move towards a sustainable diet. Secondary expectations involve changes in variables such as self-efficacy and perceived social norms, as well as an increase in knowledge about healthy eating. We also expect the qualitative approaches to provide information on the deployment process in the new territories.</p> Discussion <p>The study aims not only to demonstrate the effectiveness of Epidaure Market, but also to identify the optimal conditions for its nationwide implementation in France’s middle schools. Ultimately, the initiative aims to help reduce the incidence of cancer by promoting healthier eating habits among teenagers.</p>","author":"Aurélie Curnier","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9054cd8841604d998217700e924d4402d90688f686a618cda56742eb29bcd8e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
