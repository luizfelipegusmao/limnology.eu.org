The quantum joint probability for a Bell state can be factorized enabling a local detection of the alleged quantum nonlocality, if it existed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c11c74b4527deb1f44bdbc4bd947f93b5e394e3ade7f566fc5a475e73b939dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
