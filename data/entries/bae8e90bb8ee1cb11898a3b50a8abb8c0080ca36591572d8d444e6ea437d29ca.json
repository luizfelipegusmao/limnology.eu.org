{"title":"Degrade to Upgrade: Harnessing Programmed Degradation for Sustainable, Evolving Interactive Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2136/v1","date":1727352234000,"content":"Interactive device design traditionally prioritizes delaying or preventing degradation during the functional phase, as it is generally perceived as a disadvantage. However, the concept of intentionally designing controlled material breakdown can unlock new properties and functions that enhance both the system and its environment. This approach, termed \"Degrade to Upgrade\", challenges the conventional view of degradation as merely an end-of-life process. Instead, it encourages Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers and designers to see it as an active phase, one that can be leveraged for innovative device design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bae8e90bb8ee1cb11898a3b50a8abb8c0080ca36591572d8d444e6ea437d29ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
