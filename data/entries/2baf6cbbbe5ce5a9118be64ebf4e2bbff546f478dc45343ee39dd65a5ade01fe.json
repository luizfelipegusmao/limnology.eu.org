{"title":"Protective effect of crocin on peroxidation‐induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in IPEC‐J2 cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24216?af=R","date":1710238797000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The antioxidant properties of crocin are attracting interest, yet the underlying mechanisms by which crocin mitigates oxidative stress-induced intestinal damage have not been determined. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of crocin on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and intestinal epithelial injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Using an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress model in IPEC-J2 cells, crocin was added to assess its effects. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays and flow cytometry. Additionally, oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were quantified. We investigated, in which cell oxidation and apoptosis were measured at the gene and protein levels and employed transcriptome analysis to probe the mechanism of action and validate relevant pathways. The results showed that crocin ameliorates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress by reducing ROS and MDA levels and by countering the reductions in CAT, total antioxidant capacity, and SOD. Crocin also attenuates the upregulation of key targets in the Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, it effectively mitigated IPEC-J2 cell apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, as evidenced by changes in cell cycle factor expression, apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis pathway activity. In addition, crocin preserves the integrity of the intestinal barrier by protecting tight junction proteins against oxidative stress. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that the mitochondrial pathway may be a crucial mechanism through which crocin exerts its protective effects. In summary, crocin decreases oxidative stress molecule formation, inhibits Nrf2 pathway activity, prevents apoptosis-induced damage, enhances oxidative stress resistance in IPEC-J2 cells, and maintains redox balance in the pig intestine.</p>","author":"Jing Wang, \nHongbing Song, \nYongjie Huang, \nChu Yang, \nYanling Wu, \nRuiyi Lin, \nTianfang Xiao, \nWeimin Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"2baf6cbbbe5ce5a9118be64ebf4e2bbff546f478dc45343ee39dd65a5ade01fe","category":"Environment"}
