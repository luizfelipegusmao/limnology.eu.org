{"title":"Exploring rabbit as a nonrodent species for general toxicology studies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/1/29/7610891?rss=1","date":1708300800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To avoid adverse events in humans, toxicity studies in nonclinical species have been the foundation of safety evaluation in the pharmaceutical industry. However, it is recognized that working with animals in research is a privilege, and conscientious use should always respect the 3Rs: replacement, reduction, and refinement. In the wake of the shortages in routine nonrodent species and considering that nonanimal methods are not yet sufficiently mature, the value of the rabbit as a nonrodent species is worth exploring. Historically used in vaccine, cosmetic, and medical device testing, the rabbit is seldom used today as a second species in pharmaceutical development, except for embryo-fetal development studies, ophthalmic therapeutics, some medical devices and implants, and vaccines. Although several factors affect the decision of species selection, including pharmacological relevance, pharmacokinetics, and ADME considerations, there are no perfect animal models. In this forum article, we bring together experts from veterinary medicine, industry, contract research organizations, and government to explore the pros and cons, residual concerns, and data gaps regarding the use of the rabbit for general toxicity testing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"530ed19129964a7b74f9dd09197cb468508ddd4b51a5b12256ab73805e7069c5","category":"Environment"}
