{"title":"Longitudinal Fecal Microbiota Profiles in a Cohort of Non-Hospitalized Adolescents and Young Adults with COVID-19: Associations with SARS-CoV-2 Status and Long-Term Fatigue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1824/v1","date":1727162410000,"content":"Adolescents most often experience mild acute COVID-19 but may still face fatigue and persistent symptoms such as post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and post-infective fatigue syndrome (PIFS). We explored the fecal microbiota in a prospective controlled cohort of 136 non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-positive and 32 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls aged 12â€“25 years. With a targeted qPCR approach, the quantities of 100 fecal bacterial taxa were measured at baseline (early convalescent stage) and after six months. Results: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii M21.2 and Gemmiger formicilis (both p&amp;lt;0.001) were enriched in the SARS-CoV-2-positive participants compared to controls at baseline. Lower baseline abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii M21/2 (p=0.013) and higher abundance of Clostridium spiroforme (p=0.006), Sutterella wadsworthensis (p&amp;lt;0.001) and Streptococcus thermophilus (p=0.039) were associated with six-month fatigue. Sutterella wadsworthensis and Streptococcus thermophilus enrichment was additionally associated with PCC in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (p&amp;lt;0.001 and 0.042 respectively). Conclusions: In mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents and young adults, beneficial Faecalibacterium prausnitzii M21/2 and Gemmiger formicilis were enriched compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. Additionally, both known (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Streptococcus thermophilus) and new (Clostridium spiroforme, Sutterella wadsworthensis) bacteria were associated with persistent symptoms in the COVID-19 infected group, warranting further exploration of the role of these bacteria in COVID-19 disease and PCC pathophysiology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"690dc0f2647c08288bf5289ce97ba8634ccf624b9a4d2562d1976cef4bbae318","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
