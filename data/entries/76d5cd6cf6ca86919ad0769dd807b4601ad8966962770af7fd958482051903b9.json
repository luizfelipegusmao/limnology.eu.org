{"title":"Museum Skins Enable Identification of Introgression Associated with Cytonuclear Discordance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/73/3/579/7641134?rss=1","date":1712275200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Increased sampling of genomes and populations across closely related species has revealed that levels of genetic exchange during and after speciation are higher than previously thought. One obvious manifestation of such exchange is strong cytonuclear discordance, where the divergence in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) differs from that for nuclear genes more (or less) than expected from differences between mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) in population size and mutation rate. Given genome-scale data sets and coalescent modeling, we can now confidently identify cases of strong discordance and test specifically for historical or recent introgression as the cause. Using population sampling, combining exon capture data from historical museum specimens and recently collected tissues we showcase how genomic tools can resolve complex evolutionary histories in the <span>brachyotis</span> group of rock-wallabies (<span>Petrogale</span>). In particular, applying population and phylogenomic approaches we can assess the role of demographic processes in driving complex evolutionary patterns and assess a role of ancient introgression and hybridization. We find that described species are well supported as monophyletic taxa for nDNA genes, but not for mtDNA, with cytonuclear discordance involving at least 4 operational taxonomic units across 4 species which diverged 183â€“278 kya. ABC modeling of nDNA gene trees supports introgression during or after speciation for some taxon pairs with cytonuclear discordance. Given substantial differences in body size between the species involved, this evidence for gene flow is surprising. Heterogenous patterns of introgression were identified but do not appear to be associated with chromosome differences between species. These and previous results suggest that dynamic past climates across the monsoonal tropics could have promoted reticulation among related species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"76d5cd6cf6ca86919ad0769dd807b4601ad8966962770af7fd958482051903b9","category":"Environment"}
