{"title":"Feasible Actuator Range Modifier (FARM), a Tool Aiding the Solution of Unit Dispatch Problems for Advanced Energy Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0857/v1","date":1715595453000,"content":"Integrated energy systems (IES) seek to minimize power generating costs in future power grids through the dynamic coupling of different energy technologies. To accommodate fluctuations in load demand due to the penetration of renewable energy sources, flexible operation capabilities must be fully exploited, i.e., even power plants that are traditionally considered as base-load units need to be operated according to unconventional paradigms. Thermomechanical loads induced by frequent power adjustments can accelerate the wear and tear of components. If a unit is flexibly operated without respecting limits on materials and components, the risk of failures of expensive components will eventually increase, nullifying the additional profits ensured by flexible operation. In addition to the limits on power variations (explicit constraints), the solution of the unit dispatch problem needs to meet the limits on temperature, pressure and flow rate variations (implicit constraints). The FARM (Feasible Actuator Range Modifier) module was developed to enable existing optimization algorithms to identify solutions to the unit dispatch problem that are both economically favorable and technologically sustainable. Thanks to the iterative dispatcher-validator scheme, FARM permits addressing all the imposed constraints without excessively increasing the computational costs. In this work, the algorithms constituting the module are described, and the performance was assessed by solving the unit dispatch problem for an IES composed of three units, i.e., Balance of Plant, Gas Turbine, High-Temperature Steam Electrolysis. Finally, FARM module provides dedicated tools for visualizing the response of the process variables of interest during operation transients and a tool aiding the operator at making decisions. These techniques might represent the first step towards the deployment of an Ecological Interface Design (EID) for IES units.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6f0616fb1b440f9519b841186fcf9fe917644ca5e1f01e40570ee25308e783a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
