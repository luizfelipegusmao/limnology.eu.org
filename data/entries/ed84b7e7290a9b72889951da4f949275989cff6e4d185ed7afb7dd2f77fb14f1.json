{"title":"Mediterranean Diet in the Era of Climate Change: A Reference Diet for Human and Planetary Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1864/v1","date":1721832573000,"content":"The climate change constitutes nowadays an enormous global threat for human health and environmental sustainability. The expanding world population and the increased global needs for food production have an important negative impact upon environment. Diet can link human health with environmental sustainability. Food production systems are closely related to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the aggravation of climate change, and current western type, animal-based, dietary patterns may lead to adverse environmental footprints. In the present narrative review, we address the interconnection of the Mediterranean diet (MD) with climate change and sustainability. MD is a highly recommended dietary intervention for the prevention and management of various endocrine and cardiometabolic diseases. Beyond its evidence-based, health-promoting effects, it also has beneficial environmental impact, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing biodiversity, food security and sustainability. Based on the evidence reviewed herein, MD should be incorporated within the framework of a “One Health” model, which involves the improvement not only of human health but also of planetary health and food system sustainability. Our review aims to provide a stimulus for health pro-fessionals to strongly recommend the implementation of MD under the current pressure of climate change, despite all barriers, targeting both human health preservation and the planetary well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed84b7e7290a9b72889951da4f949275989cff6e4d185ed7afb7dd2f77fb14f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
