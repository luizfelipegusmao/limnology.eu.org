{"title":"In Utero and Lactational Exposure to an Environmentally Relevant Mixture of Phthalates Alters Hypothalamic Gene Expression and Sexual Preference in Rats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24414?af=R","date":1725886701000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Several phthalates, mainly used as plasticizers, are known for their adverse effects on the male genital system. Previously, we demonstrated that an environmentally relevant mixture of six antiandrogenic phthalates (PMix), derived from a biomonitoring study in pregnant Brazilian women, was able to disrupt the reproductive development in male rats. Experimental groups (control, 0.1, 0.5, and 500 mg PMix/kg/day) were established starting from the extrapolated human dose (0.1 mg/kg/day), followed by doses 5 times and 5000 times higher. Pregnant rats received daily oral gavage administration of either vehicle (control) or PMix from gestational day 13 to postnatal day 10. Here, we examined male and female offspring regarding changes in gene expression of key reproductive factors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland at adulthood and conducted a battery of behavioral tests in males, including partner preference, sexual behavior, and male attractiveness tests. PMix induced some changes in mating-related behavior in males, as demonstrated by the absence of preference for females against males and a higher number of penetrations up to ejaculation in the 0.5 dose group. PMix decreased <i>Esr2</i> expression in the male hypothalamus across all three doses, and in females at mid and high doses in both the hypothalamus and pituitary. In male hypothalamus, we also observed decreased <i>Kiss1</i> transcripts in these groups and a reduction in AR at the 0.5 dose group. In summary, our results provide further evidence that phthalates in a mixture, even at low doses, may exert cumulative effects on the structures underlying sexual behavior, which seems to be more sensitive than reproductive endpoints for the same experimental design.</p>","author":"Tatiana Zauer Curi, \nMarcella Tapias Passoni, \nSara Emilia Lima Tolouei, \nAnderson Tadeu de Araújo Ramos, \nSamara Christina França de Almeida, \nRenata Marino Romano, \nJeane Maria de Oliveira, \nPaulo Roberto Dalsenter, \nAnderson Joel Martino‐Andrade","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"88e0b7ccf442854d0d5e6056cb1c83262af706e1981f088ea17acac2e3622e6c","category":"Environment"}
