{"title":"Rapid Monitoring of Scale Precipitation and Inhibition in Geothermal Fluid Using Optical Fiber Sensor Based on Surface Plasmon Resonance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0931/v1","date":1723547766000,"content":"An optical fiber scale sensor based on the detection principle of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was developed for the rapid, high-sensitivity real-time evaluation of scale precipitation from geothermal fluids. The optical fiber SPR scale sensor was fabricated by depositing a gold thin film on the surface of an optical fiber with an exposed core. The optimal gold film thickness of the sensor was determined to be 30 nm, which achieved a refractive index sensitivity of 2140 nm per refractive index unit. A field test was conducted using geothermal brine from the Obama Binary Geothermal Power Plant in Unzen, Nagasaki Prefecture. A conventional optical fiber scale sensor and the SPR sensor were simultaneously assessed using raw and pH-adjusted brines. For the SPR sensor, a peak shift of 0.27 nm/min was observed at a response time of 1 min, whereas no change in transmittance was observed for the conventional sensor until 180 min. After the experiments, scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis was conducted on the sensors, and findings showed that the deposition of Mg–SiO2 scale did not significantly differ between the two sensors. The developed SPR sensor achieved faster scale precipitation detection (tens of minutes to hours) than the conventional sensor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ba6446d2362fc577c0fb43806a4b66c2e7bd0a3ab9788542153c9c8c3c448a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
