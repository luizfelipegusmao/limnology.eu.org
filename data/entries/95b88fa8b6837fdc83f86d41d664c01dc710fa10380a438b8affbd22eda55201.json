The multifaceted nature of MP pollution, coupled with its intricate physiological impacts, underscores the pressing need for comprehensive policies and legislative frameworks. Such measures, alongside advancements in technology, hold promise in averting ecological catastrophe in the oceans. Mandated legislation represents a pivotal step towards restoring oceanic health and securing the well-being of the planet. This work offers an overview of the policy hurdles, legislative initiatives, and prospective strategies for addressing global pollution due to MP. Additionally, this work explores innovative approaches that yield fresh insights into combating plastic pollution across various sectors. Emphasizing the importance of a global plastics treaty, the article underscores its potential to galvanize collaborative efforts in mitigating MP pollution's deleterious effects on marine ecosystems. Successful implementation of such a treaty could revolutionize the plastics economy, steering it towards a circular, less polluting model operating within planetary boundaries. Failure to act decisively risks exacerbating the scourge of MP pollution and its attendant repercussions on both humanity and the environment. Central to this endeavor are the formulation, content, and execution of the treaty itself, which demand careful consideration. While recognizing that a global plastics treaty is not a panacea, it serves as a mechanism for enhancing plastics governance and elevating global ambitions towards achieving zero plastic pollution by 2040. Adopting a life cycle approach to plastic management allows for a nuanced understanding of possible trade-offs between environmental impact and economic growth, guiding the selection of optimal solutions with socio-economic implications in mind. By embracing a comprehensive strategy that integrates legislative measures and technological innovations, we can substantially reduce the influx of marine plastic litter at its sources, safeguarding the oceans for future generations.</p>","author":"Tonni Agustiono Kurniawan, \nAyesha Mohyuddin, \nMohd Hafiz Dzarfan Othman, \nHui Hwang Goh, \nDongdong Zhang, \nAbdelkader Anouzla, \nFaissal Aziz, \nJoan C.
