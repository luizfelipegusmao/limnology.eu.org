{"title":"Enhancing Mental Health in Stressed College Students during COVID-19: The Impact of Positive Psychology-Based Virtual Music Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0229/v1","date":1719973490000,"content":"This study explored the effectiveness of a virtual music therapy program, based on positive psychotherapy principles, for college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-four undergraduate students with partial PTSD were initially assigned to either an experimental group or a control group, with 11 participants in each group by the study's end. The experimental group underwent 15 video sessions of the therapy program, completing one session per weekday over three weeks. The program involved worksheets targeting goals aligned with positive psychology, such as positive affect, life meaning, personal strengths, gratitude, hope, and happiness. Activities included writing music autobiographies, creating and analyzing song lyrics, and exploring various music pieces. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured using the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Korean Version of Positive Psychological Capital (K-PPC) before, immediately after, and three weeks post-program. The experimental group showed significant improvements in stress, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, resilience, and the K-PPC total score compared to the control group. These improvements were maintained at the three-week follow-up. The findings suggest that positive psychology-based virtual music therapy can significantly enhance the mental health of highly stressed college students, especially during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6a9527a14eedbea0353f9594fc687ce251aab6d8a5281fa3fb6c3efb1b9ca31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
