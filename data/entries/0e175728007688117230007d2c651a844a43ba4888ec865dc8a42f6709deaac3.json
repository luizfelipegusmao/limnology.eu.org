{"title":"Understanding the Impact of Oxidative Stress on Ovarian Cancer: Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0913/v1","date":1720694673000,"content":"Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) ranks as the fifth most common cancer among women in the United States and globally, posing a significant health threat. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as critical factors in the pathophysiology of this malignancy. ROS, characterized by their instability due to an unpaired electron, are involved in essential cellular functions and play a crucial role in the immune response under normal physiological conditions. However, an imbalance in ROS homeostasis, leading to excessive ROS production, results in oxidative stress (OS), which can cause indiscriminate damage to cellular structures and contribute to the pathogenesis of specific diseases, including OC. OC is primarily classified based on the originating cell type into epithelial, stromal, and germinal tumors, with epithelial tumors being the most prevalent. Despite advancements in medical technology, early detection of OC remains challenging, often leading to delayed treatment initiation. Current therapeutic approaches include surgical excision of tumor tissue, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. While these treatments are effective in early-stage OC, high mortality rates and frequent relapse underscore the urgent need for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This review aims to elucidate the role of ROS in OC, emphasizing the potential for developing innovative diagnostic tools and treatments that target ROS-mediated pathways. Given the critical impact of early detection and effective treatment, advancing our understanding of ROS in the context of OC could significantly enhance patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e175728007688117230007d2c651a844a43ba4888ec865dc8a42f6709deaac3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
