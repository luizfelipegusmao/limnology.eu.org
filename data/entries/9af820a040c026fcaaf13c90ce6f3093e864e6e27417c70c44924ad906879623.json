{"title":"Microbial contamination of spittoons and germicidal effect of irradiation with krypton chloride excimer lamps (Far UV-C 222 nm)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308404","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Hiroaki Tanimoto, Yoshimasa Ogawa, Takayuki Nambu, Toru Koi, Hiroyuki Ohashi, Toshinori Okinaga, Kazuyo Yamamoto</p>\r\nBackground <p>In dentistry, instruments, appliances, and body fluids such as saliva or blood are possible sources of infection. Although conventional antiseptic procedures effectively prevent infection, spittoons cannot be sanitized between each treated patient and are usually washed only with running water. However, there is currently no fast and efficient disinfection method that can be implemented between treatments. An optically filtered krypton chloride excimer lamp using ultraviolet light (Far UV-C) in the 200–230 nm wavelength range (innocuous to humans) has been recently used as a virus- and bacteria-inactivating technology. This study aimed to identify the bioburden of a dental spittoon and examine the susceptibility of two oral Streptococcus and two Enterococci to 222-nm Far UV-C by irradiating the spittoon with 222 nm Far UV-C for 5 min before evaluating the disinfection effect.</p> Methods <p>Bacterial analysis and real-time polymerase-chain reaction testing was used to confirm the spittoon’s biological contamination. Bacterial susceptibility to a 222-nm Far UV-C was determined with a graded dose irradiation test. After each treatment, the spittoon was irradiated with 222-nm Far UV-C for 5 min, and the disinfecting effect was evaluated. Microbial analysis of the spittoon’s surface was performed using the Silva database.</p> Results <p>We found that &gt; 97% of the microbes consisted of six bacterial phyla, whereas no viruses were found. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> was frequently detected. The 1-log reduction value of two oral-derived Streptococci and two Enterococci species at 222-nm Far UV-C was 4.5–7.3 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Exposure of the spittoon to 222-nm Far UV-C at 3.6–13.5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> significantly decreased bacterial counts (p &lt; 0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>Irradiation with 222-nm Far UV-C at 3.6–13.5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> significantly eliminates bacteria in spittoons, even when they are only rinsed with water. Hence, 222-nm Far UV-C irradiation may inhibit the risk of bacterial transmission from droplets in sink surfaces.</p>","author":"Hiroaki Tanimoto","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9af820a040c026fcaaf13c90ce6f3093e864e6e27417c70c44924ad906879623","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
