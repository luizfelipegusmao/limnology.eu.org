{"title":"Application of Hilbert-differential phase contrast to scanning transmission electron microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/5/414/7637237?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We report a novel class of scanning transmission electron microscopy with Hilbert-differential phase contrast (HDP-STEM) that displays nanostructures of thin samples in a topographical manner. A semicircular Ï€-phase plate (PP) was used as an optical device for manipulating electron waves in HDP-STEM. This is the different design from the Zernike PP used in our previous phase plate STEM (P-STEM), but both must be placed in the front focal plane of the condenser lens. HDP-STEM images of multiwalled carbon nanotubes showed higher contrast than those obtained by conventional bright-field STEM. As the PP of the HDP-STEM is nonsymmetrical, several different images were obtained by changing the detection conditions. A two-dimensional electron detector was also used to remove the scattering contrast component in the same way as with the Zernike PP and obtain an image containing only (differential) phase contrast.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"1d6afe66881eb866905bdfa281f7da282014132263265d96ec3f63a4fd43b3cc","category":"Environment"}
