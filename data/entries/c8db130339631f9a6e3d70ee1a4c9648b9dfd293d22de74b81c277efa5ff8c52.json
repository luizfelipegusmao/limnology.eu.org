These materials have shown thermal and electrical conductance and have low density and high stiffness which open broad aspects of practical applications. Recently double transition metal MAX phases (M’<sub>2/3</sub>M’’<sub>1/3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>AX - out-of-plane ordered, labeled as <span>o</span>-MAX and in-plane ordered, labeled as <span>i</span>-MAX, were reported [<a href=\"#ozae044.605-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.605-B2\">2</a>]. However, there are few reports on the synthesis and characterization of <span>i</span>-MAX and the corresponding MXenes. In this work, we synthesized Molybdenum-based rare earth containing <span>i</span>-MAX phase using arc melt technique. We then removed “A” element of <span>i</span>-MAX phase by acid treatment and sonication which resulted in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides called MXenes [<a href=\"#ozae044.605-B3\">3</a>]. These MXenes offer high conductivity, hydrophilicity, magnetism , good dispersion ability in solvents, mechanical stability, and structural diversity with at least 100 stoichiometric MXene compositions and are recognized as multifunctional materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.605-B4\">4-7</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c8db130339631f9a6e3d70ee1a4c9648b9dfd293d22de74b81c277efa5ff8c52","category":"Environment"}
