{"title":"Semi-Supervised Facial Acne Segmentation Using Bidirectional Copy-Paste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0591/v1","date":1712639842000,"content":"Facial acne is a prevalent dermatological condition regularly observed in the general population. This study introduces a novel deep learning model for facial acne segmentation utilizing a semi-supervised learning method known as bidirectional copy-paste, which synthesizes images by interchanging foreground and background parts between labeled and unlabeled images during the training phase. To overcome the lower performance observed in the labeled image training part compared to the previous methods, a new framework was devised to directly compute the training loss based on labeled images. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated against previous semi-supervised learning methods using images cropped from facial images at acne sites. The proposed method achieved a Dice score of 0.5205 in experiments utilizing only 3% of labels, marking an improvement of 0.0151 to 0.0473 Dice score over previous methods. The proposed semi-supervised learning approach for facial acne segmentation demonstrates improvement in performance, offering a novel direction for future acne analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a8fea9a5063933dec5b0f2fca73528686c1d54e657d6003aa4d19cd60d40454","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
