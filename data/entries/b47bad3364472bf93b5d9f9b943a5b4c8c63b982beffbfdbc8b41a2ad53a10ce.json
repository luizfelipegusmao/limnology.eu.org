{"title":"PSVI-4 Impact of rotational ingredient supplements on canine GI health when exposed to rapid dietary change","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/535/7757667?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rotational feeding has been suggested in recent years as a method for improving “food boredom” in dogs. Some owners choose to add diversity to the canine diet for enrichment and potential cognitive benefits. However, little data are available on effects of rotational feeding strategies to gastrointestinal health, gut metabolites, and potential impacts to fecal consistency. The objective of this study was to understand the impact of rotational ingredient exposure on the ability of the dog to withstand an abrupt dietary change based on fecal pH, fecal dysbiosis index (DI), fecal score, calprotectin, and C-reactive protein (CrP). Labrador retrievers [n = 16; 1 to 3 yr of age; body condition scores (BCS) = 5 to 6] enrolled in detection dog training and receiving daily conditioning (exercise), were used in a 120-d study investigating the effects of an abrupt diet change on dogs with and without novel ingredient exposures. Study participants were assigned to one of two treatment groups. Control dogs (CON) received the basal diet and treatment dogs (ROT) received the basal diet along with the addition of rotating supplemental ingredients (2.5% total daily DM intake) over 90 d including oatmeal, blueberries, pumpkin, beef liver, salmon, and rabbit. All dogs were acclimated to the basal diet for 30 d, after which dogs in both groups were exposed to an abrupt (untransitioned) diet change [two meals (am and pm feeding)] on d 0, d 45, and d 90. Morning fecal samples at each timepoint were collected for three consecutive days and analyzed for fecal pH, DI, and calprotectin. Blood samples were collected 6 h following the AM dietary challenge and were used to measure CrP. Statistical analysis was performed using PROC MIXED and significance was set at 5%. Rotational ingredient supplemental did not impact DI (<span>P</span> = 0.0844). Similarly, fecal pH and calprotectin were unaffected by the addition of rotating ingredients (<span>P</span> = 0.7243; <span>P</span> = 0.9356, respectively). Fecal scores did not change by period (<span>P</span> = 0.0768) or by treatment (<span>P</span> = 0.9002). Values for CrP demonstrated no treatment effect on acute phase response (<span>P</span> = 0.8022). Markers of gastrointestinal health remained consistent, and tolerant, of rapid dietary change in both treatment groups. These findings suggest that the inclusion of rotational dietary ingredients may be well tolerated in healthy active canines, thus allowing owners to safely introduce diverse ingredients (at low levels) to the diet of their dog with minimum risk to health challenges.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b47bad3364472bf93b5d9f9b943a5b4c8c63b982beffbfdbc8b41a2ad53a10ce","category":"Environment"}
