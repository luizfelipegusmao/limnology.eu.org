{"title":"Nonspecific phospholipases C3 and C4 interact with PIN-FORMED2 to regulate growth and tropic responses in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2310/7619587?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The dynamic changes in membrane phospholipids affect membrane biophysical properties and cell signaling, thereby influencing numerous biological processes. Nonspecific phospholipase C (NPC) enzymes hydrolyze common phospholipids to release diacylglycerol (DAG), which is converted to phosphatidic acid (PA) and other lipids. In this study, 2 Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) tandemly arrayed genes, <span>NPC3</span> and <span>NPC4</span>, were identified as critical factors modulating auxin-controlled plant growth and tropic responses. Moreover, NPC3 and NPC4 were shown to interact with the auxin efflux transporter PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2). The loss of <span>NPC3</span> and <span>NPC4</span> enhanced the endocytosis and vacuolar degradation of PIN2, which disrupted auxin gradients and slowed gravitropic and halotropic responses. Furthermore, auxin-triggered activation of NPC3 and NPC4 is required for the asymmetric PA distribution that controls PIN2 trafficking dynamics and auxin-dependent tropic responses. Collectively, our study reveals an NPC-derived PA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis auxin fluxes that is essential for fine-tuning the balance between root growth and environmental responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"5f1d46f8af446da9fa6901fc81c407437f63b85e0446161c5211af89ac5addf4","category":"Environment"}
