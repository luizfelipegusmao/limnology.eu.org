The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme catalyzes NO production in endothelial cells. Overexpression of the eNOS gene has been implicated in pathologies with dysfunctional angiogenic processes, such as cancer. Therefore, modulating eNOS gene expression using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) represents a viable strategy for antitumor therapy. siRNAs are highly specific to the target gene, thus reducing off-target effects. Given the widespread distribution of endothelium and the crucial physiological role of eNOS, localized delivery of nucleic acid to the affected area is essential. Therefore, the development of an efficient eNOS-siRNA delivery carrier capable of controlled release is imperative for targeting specific vascular regions, particularly those associated with tumor vascular growth. Thus, this study aims to utilize ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction (UMMD) technology with cationic microbubbles loaded with eNOS-siRNA to enhance transfection efficiency and improve siRNA delivery, thereby preventing sprouting angiogenesis. The efficiency of eNOS-siRNA transfection facilitated by UMMD was assessed using bEnd.3 cells. Synthesis of nitric oxide and eNOS protein expression were also evaluated. The silencing of eNOS gene in a model of angiogenesis was assayed using the rat aortic ring assay. The results showed that from 6 to 24 h, the transfection of fluorescent siRNA with UMMD was twice as high as that of lipofection. Moreover, transfection of eNOS-siRNA with UMMD enhanced the knockdown level (65.40 ± 4.50%) compared to lipofectamine (40 ± 1.70%). Silencing of eNOS gene with UMMD required less amount of eNOS-siRNA (42 ng) to decrease the level of eNOS protein expression (52.30 ± 0.08%) to the same extent as 79 ng of eNOS-siRNA using lipofectamine (56.30 ± 0.10%). NO production assisted by UMMD was reduced by 81% compared to 67% reduction transfecting with lipofectamine. This diminished NO production led to higher attenuation of aortic ring outgrowth. Three-fold reduction compared to lipofectamine transfection. In conclusion, we propose the combination of eNOS-siRNA and UMMD as an efficient, safe, non-viral nucleic acid transfection strategy for inhibition of tumor progression.","author":"Elisa Villa-Martínez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7237cc7d9c511ea91e8b10845a8c22c57f4f81261132692efd16ff41f7306bce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
