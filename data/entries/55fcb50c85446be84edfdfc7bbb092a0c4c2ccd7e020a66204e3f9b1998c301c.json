Using the Ginzburg Landau (GL) theory, the expression for the GL coherence length, the critical current density, the lower critical magnetic field (Hc1), and the upper critical magnetic field (Hc2) for the entangled superconducting YBCO was obtained. At zero external magnetic fields, YBCO was found to undergo a transition from the normal state to the superconducting state at 93K and returned to normal. We found a direct relationship between the GL coherence length penetration depth and the temperature of the entangled superconducting YBCO. The graphs of the lower critical magnetic field (Hc1) and critical current density against temperature show a non-linear dependence.In contrast, the graph of the upper critical magnetic field (Hc2) against temperature (T) shows the linear dependence, which is in agreement with existing theoretical observations. On the other hand, the graph of critical current density against the distance of separation between the entangled electrons that form a cooper pair showed that the critical current density increases between 1.8 and 6 nanometers attaining a constant value after reaching 7 nanometers for infinite distances. Finally, for lower critical fields, the magnetic field decreases between 1.5 to 6 nanometers attaining a constant value of the magnetic field, for infinite values of distance of separation between the entangled pair of electrons","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55fcb50c85446be84edfdfc7bbb092a0c4c2ccd7e020a66204e3f9b1998c301c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
