{"title":"Effectiveness of Hepatitis C Virus Self-Testing Service Delivery Models among People Who Inject Drugs: A Cross-Sectional Study in Vietnam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1615/v1","date":1721395163000,"content":"This study assesses the effectiveness of HCV self-testing (HCVST) distribution models compared to provider-led HCV testing (PL-HCVT), including the standard of care facility-based HCVT (SOC-HCVT) and community-based organization HCVT (CBO-HCVT) among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was conducted as part of a larger implementation science study in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City from September 2023 to April 2024. We engaged 8 CBOs and 10 public and private clinics in offering choice of HCVST through community-based and facility-based distribution, and secondary distribution), or PL-HCVT via SOC-HCVT and CBO-HCVT. Among 1,165 PWID, 693 opted for HCVST and 472 for PL-HCVT. The proportion of first-time testers was significantly higher in HIVST community-based and secondary distribution as well as CBO-HCVT compared to SOC-HCVT and facility-based HCVST (87.1%, 93.3% and 82.7% vs. 41.9% and 35.7%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Overall, HCV seropositivity rate was lower in HCVST than PL-HCVT, however, higher in HCVST facility-based and community-based distribution compared to HCVST secondary distribution (28.1% and 20.4% vs. 5.7%, respectively). Community-based HCVST was most effective, followed by facility-based HCVST and secondary distribution. Our findings indicate that HCVST effectively reaches first-time testers and results in more people diagnosed and treated among PWID.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37fe71dd264d823911e5c89c238440d55b110b211d354a95e5d408baf3c8ebcb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
