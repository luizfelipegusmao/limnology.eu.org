{"title":"Quantum Retarded Field Engine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1617/v1","date":1713946325000,"content":"Recent efforts to conceptually design a technologically meaningful electromagnetic retarded engine indicated that this can only be done using the immense charge and current densities which exist in the atomic scale. However, this scale cannot be described by Newtonian physics, and only a quantum description will suffice to describe the dynamics of an electron on this scale properly. Here we study the retarded field quantum engine and highlight the differences between the quantum and the classical retarded engines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b590b28ccaf854821580d4e0606d656d44f2d175cf89b9ed41ca6ae750ed3de7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
