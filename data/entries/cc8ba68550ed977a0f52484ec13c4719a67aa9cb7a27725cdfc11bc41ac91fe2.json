{"title":"Imaging Biomarkers of Oral Dysplasia and Carcinoma Measured with In Vivo Endoscopic Optical Coherence Tomography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0625/v1","date":1720488623000,"content":": Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides three-dimensional visualization of subsurface tissue structures. OCT has been proposed and explored in literature as a tool to assess oral cancer status, select biopsy sites, or identify surgical margins. Our endoscopic OCT device can generate widefield (centimeters long) imaging of lesions at any location in the oral cavity â€“ but it is challenging for raters to quantitatively assess and score large volumes of data. Leveraging a previously developed epithelial segmentation network, this work develops quantifiable biomarkers that provide direct measurements of tissue properties in three-dimensions. We hypothesize that features related to morphology, tissue attenuation, and contrast between tissue layers will be able to provide a quantitative assessment of disease status (dysplasia through carcinoma). This work retrospectively assesses seven biomarkers on a lesion-contralateral matched OCT dataset of lateral and ventral tongue (40 patients, 70 sites). Epithelial depth and loss of epithelial-stromal boundary visualization provide the strongest discrimination between disease states. The stroma optical attenuation coefficient provides distinction of benign lesions from dysplasia and carcinoma. The stratification biomarkers visualize subsurface changes which provides potential for future utility in biopsy site selection or treatment margin delineation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc8ba68550ed977a0f52484ec13c4719a67aa9cb7a27725cdfc11bc41ac91fe2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
