{"title":"Prokaryotic Expression and Functional Verification of Antimicrobial Peptide LRGG","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1656/v1","date":1716557970000,"content":"The antimicrobial peptide LRGG (LLRLLRRGGRRLLRLL-NH2) was designed and chemically synthesized in a study conducted by Jia et al. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be sensitive to LRGG and exhibited a high therapeutic index. Genetic engineering methods were used to create the prokaryotic fusion expression vector pQE-GFP-LRGG, and the resulting corresponding fusion protein GFP-LRGG was subsequently expressed and purified. The precursor GFP was then removed by TEV proteolysis, and pure LRGG was obtained after another round of purification and endotoxin removal. The prokaryotic-expressed antimicrobial peptide LRGG displays a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect on gram-negative bacteria and can eliminate 99.99% of E. coli within 100 minutes at the minimal MIC concentration. Compared to the chemically synthesized LRGG, the prokaryotic-expressed LRGG exhibits similar temperature, pH, salt ion, serum stability, and cell selectivity. Furthermore, prokaryotic-expressed LRGG showed excellent therapeutic effects in both the infection model of cell selectivity and no embryotoxicity in a Galleria mellonella infection model. The mechanism by which LRGG causes bacterial death was found to be disruption of Gram-negative cell membrane.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e9780844b27ef2f599cb0c7bdd8a1637515b3290feaa637cf52b37a328ac0ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
