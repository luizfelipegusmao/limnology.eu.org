However, there has been a dearth of comprehensive studies quantifying changes in SOC pools following extended periods of rice cultivation across a broad geographical scale. Using 104 rice paddy sampling sites that have been in continuous cultivation since the 1980s across China, we studied the changes in topsoil (0–20 cm) labile organic C (LOC I), semi-labile organic C (LOC II), recalcitrant organic C (ROC), and total SOC. We found a substantial increase in both the content (48%) and density (39%) of total SOC within China's paddy fields between the 1980s to the 2010s. Intriguingly, the rate of increase in content and density of ROC exceeded that of LOC (I and II). Using a structural equation model, we revealed that changes in the content and density of total SOC were mainly driven by corresponding shifts in ROC, which are influenced both directly and indirectly by climatic and soil physicochemical factors; in particular temperature, precipitation, phosphorous (P) and clay content. We also showed that the δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>LOC</sub> were greater than δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>ROC</sub>, independent of the rice cropping region, and that there was a significant positive correlation between δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>SOC</sub> and δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>straw</sub>. The δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>LOC</sub> and δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>SOC</sub> showed significantly negative correlation with soil total Si, suggesting that soil Si plays a part in the allocation of C into different SOC pools, and its turnover or stabilization. Our study underscores that the global C sequestration of the paddy fields mainly stems from the substantial increase in ROC pool.</p>","author":"Xiaomin Yang, \nZhaoliang Song, \nLukas Van Zwieten, \nLaodong Guo, \nJi Chen, \nZhongkui Luo, \nYidong Wang, \nYu Luo, \nZhengang Wang, \nWeiqi Wang, \nJingxu Wang, \nYu Wang, \nCong‐Qiang Liu, \nHailong Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"696c46a1d10e378d27e5ee0479f2b407c86b243be6855604eafbe5d99b0a0dbf","category":"Environment"}
