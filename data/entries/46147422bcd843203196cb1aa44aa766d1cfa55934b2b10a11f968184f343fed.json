{"title":"RnP: Management Information System for Camping Equipment using Agile Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0082/v1","date":1719838985000,"content":"Camping offers invaluable experiences in nature exploration, but the expense of acquiring camping gear can deter potential enthusiasts. To mitigate this, camping gear rental services emerge as a practical solution, promoting accessibility and reducing financial barriers. However, existing rental systems often encounter issues such as limited payment options, inconvenient pickup/return processes, and opaque management. In response, this paper introduces \"Rent-n-Play,\" a web-based camping gear rental platform built on Laravel framework. It enables cashless transactions, offers pickup/delivery services, and employs a real-time admin system for transparent management. User feedback guided platform enhancements, including review systems and responsive support. The \"Rent-n-Play\" platform enhances user experience, fosters trust, and promotes sustainable camping practices, thus contributing to a more accessible and enjoyable camping culture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46147422bcd843203196cb1aa44aa766d1cfa55934b2b10a11f968184f343fed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
