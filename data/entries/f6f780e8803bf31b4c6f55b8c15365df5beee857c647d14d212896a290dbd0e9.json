{"title":"Design and Simulation for Technological Integration of Bio‐Based Components in Fa&ccedil;ade System Modules","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1552/v1","date":1711450884000,"content":"Driven by environmental sustainability concerns, the integration of biobased components in curtain wall systems is gaining traction in both research and the construction market. This paper explores the development and validation of a bio-based façade system within the Basajaun H2020 project. The project aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of introducing environmentally friendly bio-based components into the mature curtain wall façade industry. The paper focuses on identifying technological solutions for replacing key components such as profiles, insulation, and the tightness system with bio-based and less environmental impact alternatives presenting the results achieved in the façade system design of the Basajaun project funded by European Union. These solutions aimed at creating a bio-composite-based curtain wall façade that adheres to current building envelope standards and normative; to implement diverse façade typologies for vision panels, opaque sections, and integrated windows; to engineer the prefabrication process for industrialization, enabling wider market replication and simplified transport and installation. The results demonstrate that the Basajaun façade successfully integrates selected components and meets the performance requirements set by regulations. However, questions remain regarding the workability of bio-based profiles as a commercially viable, ready-to-market solution that can replace traditional aluminum profiles in the curtain wall façade industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6f780e8803bf31b4c6f55b8c15365df5beee857c647d14d212896a290dbd0e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
