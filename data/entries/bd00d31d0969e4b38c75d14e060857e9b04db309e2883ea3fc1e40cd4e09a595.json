{"title":"Oral Supplementation of L-Carnosine Attenuates Acute Stress-Induced Corticosterone Release and Mitigates Anxiety in CD157 Knockout Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1621/v1","date":1721394943000,"content":"Corticosterone, an end product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, is a crucial stress hormone. Dysregulated HPA axis and corticosterone release play pivotal roles in the onset and persistence of symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety. The intake of nutrients, probiotics, and prebiotic supplements decreases blood corticosterone levels. The dipeptide L-carnosine is composed of beta-alanine and L-histidine and is commercially available as a nutritional supplement for recovery from fatigue. L-carnosine is involved in stress-induced corticosterone responses and anxiety behaviors in rodents. Here, we assessed the effect of L-carnosine in CD157 knockout (KO) mice, a murine model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The uptake of L-carnosine suppressed the increase in plasma corticosterone levels in response to acute stress and attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in CD157 KO mice. These results suggest that L-carnosine supplementation may relieve anxiety by suppressing excessive stress responses in individuals with ASD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd00d31d0969e4b38c75d14e060857e9b04db309e2883ea3fc1e40cd4e09a595","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
