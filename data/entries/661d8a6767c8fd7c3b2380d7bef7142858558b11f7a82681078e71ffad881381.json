{"title":"Photoacclimation in the kleptoplastidic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum and its cryptophyte prey Teleaulax amphioxeia: phenotypic variability and implications for red tide remote sensing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/2/100/7603804?rss=1","date":1707350400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Mesodinium rubrum</span> is a kleptoplastidic ciliate that sequesters the chloroplasts and nuclei of cryptophyte algae to perform photosynthesis. Blooms of <span>M. rubrum</span> can cause red tides in coastal oceans worldwide. Such red tides are detectable by remote sensing, and studying <span>M. rubrum</span> pigments and optical properties is a crucial step toward characterizing its blooms using satellite observation. Previous studies have shown that <span>M. rubrum</span> photoacclimates, modifying its pigment content depending on irradiance. Using cultures at different irradiance levels, we observed that photoacclimation in <span>M. rubrum</span> closely resembles that of its cryptophyte prey <span>Teleaulax amphioxeia</span>, leading to substantial phenotypic variability. In both species, phycoerythrin 545 cellular concentrations increased 3-fold between the highest and lowest irradiance, suggesting a major role in photoacclimation. Absorption cross-section decreased, and pigment-specific absorption coefficients increased with irradiance at the peak absorption wavelengths of chlorophyll <span>a</span> and phycoerythrin 545. After assessing the variability of absorption properties in <span>M. rubrum</span>, we combined field measurements and high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images to estimate chlorophyll <span>a</span> concentration of a coastal red tide and document small-scale spatio-temporal features. This work provides an overview of pigment photoacclimation in a peculiar phytoplankter and suggests guidelines for future studies of <span>M. rubrum</span> blooms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"661d8a6767c8fd7c3b2380d7bef7142858558b11f7a82681078e71ffad881381","category":"Environment"}
