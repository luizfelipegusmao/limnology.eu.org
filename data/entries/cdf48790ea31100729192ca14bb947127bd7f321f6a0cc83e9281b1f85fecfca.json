{"title":"A Study on the Formation and Change of Yesso Scallop Odor Characteristics by GC‐O‐MS, Sensory Evaluation, and Flavor‐Precursor Analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/1319841?af=R","date":1686294000000,"content":"<p>Scallops are exposed to drying and hypoxia for a long duration in the supply chain, leading to quality deterioration and changes in odor characteristics. In this study, quality deterioration of Yesso scallop was simulated under different conditions to explore the formation and change of its unique aroma. Its volatile components were analyzed by partial least squares (PLS) regression, GC-O, and smell threshold, and its odor characteristics were analyzed with reference to flavor precursors. The sensory descriptors selected comprehensively described the odor characteristics of Yesso scallop. The 16 most relevant volatile components for each odor characteristic were identified, and a new star-mark grading method was established to evaluate the role of volatile components in the formation of odor characteristics. The possible odor precursors were determined, providing preliminary information on the generation of pleasant and unpleasant odor characteristics by Yesso scallops. Thus, our results provide a scientific basis for the further study and control of the odor characteristics of aquatic products.</p>","author":"Runze Fu, \nJianhui Su, \nYu He, \nShuai Wang, \nHouguo Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"cdf48790ea31100729192ca14bb947127bd7f321f6a0cc83e9281b1f85fecfca","category":"Environment"}
