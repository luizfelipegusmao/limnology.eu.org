{"title":"Copper Homeostasis and Its Impact on Innate Immunity in Crustaceans","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12963?af=R","date":1726120849000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Copper, an essential micronutrient in crustaceans, plays vital roles in enzymatic processes, oxygen transport, pigmentation, and structural protein synthesis, including collagen and elastin. Recent research has elucidated its pivotal role in innate immunity of crustaceans, enhancing the immune response by promoting phagocytic activity, antimicrobial peptide production, and modulation of immune gene expression. Copper ions exhibit antimicrobial effects by disrupting cell membranes and inhibiting microbial proliferation. Furthermore, copper governs antioxidant defense mechanisms, protecting crustaceans against oxidative stress and infection. However, excessive copper can lead to toxicity, highlighting the need for strict maintenance of copper homeostasis. This review explores the complex processes of copper homeostasis in crustaceans, detailing transport mechanisms, storage proteins, and detoxification pathways. It emphasizes copper's critical physiological and immunological functions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of its multifaceted roles in crustaceans and laying groundwork for further exploration of copper homeostasis as a strategy for boosting crustacean immunity. Aquaculture practices significantly influence copper levels in crustaceans. Effective copper management, including monitoring techniques, water treatment strategies, and regulatory frameworks, is crucial for both crustacean welfare and environmental sustainability.</p>","author":"Hejia Chen, \nXi Huang, \nMuhammad Tayyab, \nMingming Zhao, \nDefu Yao, \nZhihong Zheng, \nXianliang Zhao, \nYongzhen Zhao, \nXiuli Chen, \nBobo Zhang, \nQiongqiong Yang, \nYueling Zhang, \nZhongyang Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"a90a0077fe800891ed7fb4362b2864605dc5adab34422a83ddf71b23484cd799","category":"Environment"}
