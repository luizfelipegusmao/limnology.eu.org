{"title":"Feasibility of a family-oriented mHealth intervention for Chinese Americans with type 2 diabetes: A pilot randomized control trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299799","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Lu Hu, Yun Shi, Judith Wylie-Rosett, Mary Ann Sevick, Xinyi Xu, Ricki Lieu, Chan Wang, Huilin Li, Han Bao, Yulin Jiang, Ziqiang Zhu, Ming-Chin Yeh, Nadia Islam</p>\r\nObjectives <p>To test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a mHealth intervention tailored for Chinese immigrant families with type 2 diabetes (T2D).</p> Methods <p>We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with baseline, 3-, and 6-month measurements. Participating dyads, T2D patients and families/friends from NYC, were randomized into the intervention group (n = 11) or the wait-list control group (n = 12). Intervention includes 24 videos covering T2D self-management, behavioral techniques, and family-oriented sessions. Feasibility and acceptability were measured respectively by the retention rate and video watch rate, and a satisfaction survey. Patients’ HbA1c, weight, and self-management were also assessed to test potential efficacy.</p> Results <p>Most T2D patients (n = 23; mean age 56.2±9.4 years; 52.2% male) and families/friends (n = 23, mean age 54.6±11.2 years; 52.2% female) had high school education or less (69.6% and 69.6%), annual household income &lt; $25,000 (65.2% and 52.2%), and limited English proficiency (95.7% and 95.7%). The retention rates were not significantly different between the intervention and the control groups for both the patients (90.91% vs 83.3%, p = 0.589); and their families/friends (3-month: 90.9% vs 75%, p = 0.313; 6-month: 90.9% vs 83.3%, p = 0.589). The mean video watch rate was 76.8% (7%). T2D patients and families/friends rated satisfaction as 9.4 and 10 out of 10, respectively. Despite no between-group differences, the intervention group had significantly lower HbA1c (p = 0.014) and better self-management (p = 0.009), and lost 12 lbs. on average at 6 months (p = 0.079), compared to their baseline levels.</p> Conclusions <p>A culturally-tailored, family-based mHealth intervention is feasible and acceptable among low-income, limited English-proficient Chinese families with T2D in NYC. Significant changes in HbA1c and self-management within the intervention group indicate this intervention may have potential efficacy. Given the small sample size of this study, a future RCT with adequate power is needed to test efficacy.</p>","author":"Lu Hu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"940dfd9c34bb23025654303c5065f3b46fb756beeba4004babac576981c479cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
