{"title":"Quaternion Spin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202302.0055/v4","date":1716201458000,"content":"We present an analysis of the Dirac equation when the spin symmetry is changed from SU(2) to the quaternion group, $Q_8$, afforded by multiplying one of the $\\gamma$-matrices by the imaginary number. The reason for doing this is to introduce a bivector into the spin algebra. This modifies the Dirac equation which separates into two distinct and complementary spaces: one describing polarization and the other coherence. The former describes a 2D structured spin and the latter its helicity, generated by a unit quaternion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68132ee44672fc0daecd5778d6ee219d454a66b70c98ffe8af860cae0f00dfa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
