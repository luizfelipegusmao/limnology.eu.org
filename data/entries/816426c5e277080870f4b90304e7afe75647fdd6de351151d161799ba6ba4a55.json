The Ponseti technique, involving early corrective manipulations followed by the application of long leg casts and Achilles tenotomy, is widely accepted as the preferred treatment. Rapid healing of the tendon after surgery has been documented, but the aspect regarding tendon structure and properties is not known. Three cases of Achilles tendon rupture in adolescent previously treated for clubfoot have been described in the literature.  Since rupture is a rare event in this age group a possible correlation with previous surgery has been hypothesized. The primary aim of the study was to compare the ultrasound findings of the Achilles tendon, in patients treated for clubfoot, between patients treated with casting alone and the ones who underwent surgery (percutaneous tenotomy or Z-plasty lengthening). Methods: 22 asymptomatic patients, (34 feet) median age 12 years, previously treated for clubfoot, were recruited for this study; the patients underwent an Achilles tendon ultrasound examination during a follow-up outpatient visit.  Results: a greater thickness and structural alterations with presence of hypoechoic areas of the operated tendons compared to those treated with plaster alone were observed (p value: 0.0498 and","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"816426c5e277080870f4b90304e7afe75647fdd6de351151d161799ba6ba4a55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
