{"title":"Antiaging Properties of Kalanchoe blossfeldiana Ethanol Extract &ndash; Ex Vivo and In Vitro Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1806/v1","date":1727097337000,"content":"Species of the genus Kalanchoe have a long history of therapeutic use in ethnomedicine linked to their remarkable medical properties. One of them is Kalanchoe blossfeldiana succulents occurring in tropical regions. Despite the great interest in this plant, there are no reports about its therapeutic effects on the skin. In this study, the antioxidant properties and skin permeation of a topical hydrogel containing K. blossfeldiana ethanol extract was assessed. Additionally, the content of active compounds in the K. blossfeldiana extract was evaluated by UHPLC-MS and HPLC-UV. The extract was analysed with three antioxidant assays: ABTS, DPPH and FRAP. Furthermore, antielastase and antihialuronidase properties of the tested extract were assessed. The ex vivo penetration studies were performed using the Franz diffusion cells. The obtained results show that antioxidant properties of K. blossfeldiana extract were similar to ascorbic acid, while antielastase and antihialuronidase tests indicated strong antiaging and anti-inflammatory activity (IC50 was 26.8 ± 0.13 and 77.31 ± 2.44 µg/mL, respectively). Moreover, active ingredients contained in K. blossfeldiana extract penetrated through human skin and accumulate in it. In conclusion, the hydrogel containing K. blossfeldiana extract can be considered as an interesting and new alternative to dermatologic and cosmetic preparations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0749057c413f0d12bb513b5aee12fdc6ef17648ffd0f2a358b75c327c0d5206f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
