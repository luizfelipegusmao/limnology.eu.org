{"title":"The association between a rotator cuff tendon tear and a tear of the long head of the biceps tendon: Chart review study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300265","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Abdulrahman Alraddadi, Bader Aldebasi, Bander Alnufaie, Mohammed Almuhanna, Mohammed Alkhalifah, Motaz Aleidan, Yousef Murad, Awad M. Almuklass, Altayeb A. Ahmed</p>\r\n\r\nRotator cuff (RC) and long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) tears are common shoulder problems presented to the orthopedic clinic. The aim of this study was to assess the association between RC and LHBT tears among a Saudi population sample. A total of 243 patients who were diagnosed with shoulder pain due to RC or LHBT tear between 2016 and 2018 using a magnetic resonance imaging scan were included in this study. Females comprised 66% of the sample, and 59% (n = 143) of the shoulders were on the right side. The mean age of the patients was 58 Â± 11 years, ranging from 23 to 88 years. A significant association was detected between the LHBT and RC tears (P &lt; 0.001). Out of 26 cases showing RC and LHBT tears, 81% had a full thickness tear, whereas 19% had a partial tear. The LHBT tears were presented significantly in 48% of cases with at least two completely torn RC compared to 10% in cases with one completely torn RC (P &lt; 0.001). The LHBT tear was significantly observed in shoulders with RC tears including the tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus, but not the teres minor (P &lt; 0.001). Both types of tears were presented significantly in senior patients aged more than 65 years compared to younger patients (P &lt; 0.01). Thus, the LHBT should be assessed carefully in shoulders with more than one RC tear or in chronic cases.","author":"Abdulrahman Alraddadi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7a9cba3fe48c0fccb1cfa11630bf9aa351f9d9f659f50478e3be822b7bc11ef6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
