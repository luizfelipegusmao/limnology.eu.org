{"title":"Thermomechanical and Viscoelastic Characterization of Continuous GF/PETG Tape for Extreme Environment Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1994/v1","date":1724834310000,"content":"The thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties of a glass fiber polyethylene terephthalate glycol (GF/PETG) continuous unidirectional (UD) tape were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The study identified five operational conditions based on Army Regulation 70-38 Standard. The DSC results revealed a glass transition temperature of 78.0 ± 0.3°C, guiding the selection of temperatures for TMA and DMA tests. TMA provided the coefficient of thermal expansion in three principal directions, consistent with known values for PETG and GF materials. DMA tests, including strain sweep, temperature ramp, frequency sweep, creep, and stress relaxation, defined the linear viscoelastic region and temperature-dependent properties of the material. The frequency sweep indicated an increase in modulus with rising frequency, identifying several natural frequency modes. Creep and stress relaxation tests showed time-dependent behavior, with strain increasing under higher loads and stress decreasing over time for all tested input values. Viscoelastic models fitted to the data yielded R² values of 0.99, demonstrating good agreement. The study successfully measured thermo-mechanical and viscoelastic properties across various conditions, providing insights into how temperature influences the material's mechanical response under extreme conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c8175559cd8934ad4b940cf584c8b7c30a7071cf474edea9e8a716669ba0f88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
