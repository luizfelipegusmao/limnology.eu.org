One of the most needed areas for improvement are proactive methods for condition assessment of existing pipelines. This can be divided into two main categories: proactive condition assessment technologies and nonstructural proactive condition improvement technologies. The objective of this paper is to identify the best option available on the market for both these areas of proactive condition assessment for existing pipelines. The compared proactive condition assessment technologies include Acoustic Resonance Testing, Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement Testing, Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing, Pulsed Eddy Current Testing, and the Multisensor ROV. The technologies compared for nonstructural proactive condition improvement were Jetting, Pigging and also included the main requirements for a proper catalog of pipe information that can be used to produce a ranked system for assessing which pipes are at highest risk for failure and can be used to efficiently direct resources for pipe maintenance. The final conclusion was that Acoustic Resonance Testing and the Multisensor ROV are the two best products available for the proactive condition assessment of existing pipelines available on the market from their versatility of application and amount of information gathered during pipe inspection. The best option available in the group of nonstructural proactive condition improvement technologies was pigging for its incredibly low risk and low social impact as well as potential for improvement in the near future. It was also concluded that every agency would be better off with a catalog of the pipe material, age, length, diameter, and burial depth to know the location of every pipe an agency owns as well as to rank every pipe in terms of risk of failure and impact of said failure to most efficiently direct resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a874478592f36b195d463c3e0fa3d45b95e8875cd8ea3de9afd4ce9f3f49c25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
