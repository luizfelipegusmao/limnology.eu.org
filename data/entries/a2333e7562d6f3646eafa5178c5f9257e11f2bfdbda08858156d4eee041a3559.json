{"title":"Cascading Landslide: Kinematic and Fem Analysis through Re-2 Mote Sensing Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0803/v1","date":1723455426000,"content":"Cascading landslides represent a dynamic and hazardous geological phenomenon, char-15 acterized by a sequential chain of slope failures triggered by various factors such as heavy rainfall, 16 seismic activity, or anthropogenic activities. These events can amplify the damage caused by the 17 initial trigger and propagate instability along a slope, often resulting in significant environmental 18 and societal impacts. The Morino-Rendinara cascading landslide, situated in the Ernici mountains 19 along the border of Abruzzo and Lazio region (Italy), serves as a notable example of the complexities 20 and devastating consequences associated with such events. In March 2021, a substantial debris flow 21 event in Morino obstructed the Liri River, marking the latest step in a series of landslide events 22 characterized by a complexity far beyond initial expectations. This study employs a multidiscipli-23 nary approach, combining conventional techniques and advanced technologies, to understand the 24 complexities of the Morino-Rendinara landslide. Field activities, UAV image acquisition, SAR inter-25 ferometry based on SENTINEL-1 images and pixel offset analysis based on high-resolution Google 26 Earth images, offer insights into the geological and hydrogeological setting of the unstable slope, 27 landslide geometry, mechanism and kinematics. To supplement the analysis a specific FEM slope 28 stability analyses is used to reconstruct the deep geometry of the system emphasizing the modula-29 tion action of groundwater flow to the slope stability","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2333e7562d6f3646eafa5178c5f9257e11f2bfdbda08858156d4eee041a3559","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
