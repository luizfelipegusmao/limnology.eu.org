The purpose of this survey research is to unveil COVID-19 related beliefs using the Health Belief Model, and COVID-19 prevention behaviors, including self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption among university students. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 304 male and female undergraduate students from diverse ethnic backgrounds and majors at a New Jersey state university using convenience sampling. Variables measured included frequency of COVID-19 prevention behaviors (e.g.: wearing indoor mask, handwashing), and consumption of fruit and vegetables (dark green and orange vegetables) over the previous week. Health Belief Model constructs were assessed namely perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy. Statistical distributions were computed for the entire sample and t-tests were investigated for subgroups of age and sex. The sample mean age was 21.7 (SD = 4.7) years with 222 females (73%) and 82 males (27%), and 46% identified as White, non-Hispanics. Participants consumed a mean of 0.95 cups of fruit, 0.81 cups of green vegetables, and 0.46 cups of orange vegetables. Female students practiced more COVID-19 prevention behaviors with a mean difference of 0.26 (p&lt;0.001), perceived greater severity from the virus (Δ = 0.37, p = 0.002) and had stronger perceptions of benefits (Δ = 0.18, p = 0.041), barriers (Δ = 0.21, p = 0.046), and self-efficacy (Δ = 0.20, p = 0.020) than their male counterparts. Older students (aged 23 and above) adopted more COVID-19 prevention behaviors (Δ = -0.35, p = 0.001) and perceived less barriers (Δ = 0.24, p = 0.047) than their younger peers. Nutrition educators and health professionals need to emphasize the importance of adopting preventive health behaviors among university students as strategies to mitigate the severity of COVID-19. Addressing barriers younger male and female students may elevate their motivation and self-efficacy to enact health behaviors.","author":"Doreen Liou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b86958dd8130c8d3164fbfb25e409f54d99ec1d48eb39533e8410f4be8045420","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
