{"title":"Comparative Tissue Identification and Characterization of Long Non-Coding RNAs in the Globally Distributed Blue Shark Prionace glauca","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0166/v1","date":1722588908000,"content":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in numerous biological processes and serve crucial regulatory functions in both animals and plants. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of lncRNAs and their patterns of expression and roles in sharks. In the current study, we systematically identified and characterized lncRNAs in the blue shark Prionace glauca from four tissues (liver, spleen, muscle, and kidney) using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools. A total of 21,932 high confidence lncRNAs were identified with 8,984 and 3,067 stably and tissue-specific expressed lncRNAs, respectively. In addition, a total of 45,007 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs were obtained among tissues, with kidney versus muscle having the largest numbers across tissues. DE lncRNAs trans target protein-coding genes were predicted, and functional gene ontology enrichment of these genes showed GO terms such as muscle system processes, cellular/metabolic processes, and stress and immune responses, all of which correspond with the specific biological functions of each tissue analyzed. These results advance our knowledge of lncRNAs in sharks and present novel data on tissue-specific lncRNAs, providing key information to support future functional shark investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa37329838e1c41f3623e56a414c13067e1459c776b6e8ebb21a71c5329f9a28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
