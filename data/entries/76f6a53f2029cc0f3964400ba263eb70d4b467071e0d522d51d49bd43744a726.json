{"title":"Overview of High Dynamic Range Image Quality Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0935/v1","date":1723543410000,"content":"In recent years, the High Dynamic Range (HDR) image has gained widespread popularity 1\nacross various domains such as security, multimedia, and biomedical fields, owing to its ability 2\nto deliver an authentic visual experience. However, the extensive dynamic range and rich detail 3\nin HDR images present challenges in assessing their quality. Therefore, current efforts involve 4\nconstructing subjective databases and proposing objective quality assessment metrics to achieve 5\nefficient HDR Image Quality Assessment (IQA). Recognizing the absence of a systematic overview 6\nof these approaches, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing HDR IQA methods. 7\nFurthermore, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers by discussing the 8\nlimitations of current methodologies and potential research directions in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76f6a53f2029cc0f3964400ba263eb70d4b467071e0d522d51d49bd43744a726","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
