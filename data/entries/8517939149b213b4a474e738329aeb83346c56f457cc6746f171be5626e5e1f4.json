{"title":"Therapeutic Advancement of Adiponectin in Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Other Metabolic Disorders.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1029/v1","date":1721034505000,"content":"Adiponectin (APN) has been thoroughly investigated for its role in various human disorders. It is fascinating to note that this peptide plays an essential role as a therapeutic agent to cure a plethora of disorders. Our aim is to elucidate the applications and therapeutic potential of this peptide, demonstrating its involvement in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other metabolic disorders. APN has been correlated with many ocular disorders and metabolic disorders. The localization and expression of APN in various tissues were the first markers of its local actions. Screening this peptide on a wider platform helps to confirm its application as a novel peptide in various diseases. Altered levels of APN have been well elucidated in the progression of metabolic disorders, and its targeted administration has resulted in combating dysregulation of biochemical and molecular pathways involved in disease pathology. A close association of oxidative stress is also known to contribute to the onset of retinal disorders. Among so many APN has been shown to have a promising response in the context of wet AMD, but further studies are needed to elucidate its full potential in humans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8517939149b213b4a474e738329aeb83346c56f457cc6746f171be5626e5e1f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
