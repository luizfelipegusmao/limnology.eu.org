{"title":"Genomic Characterization of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacter hormaechei, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii and Morganella morganii Clinical Isolates from Bulgaria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1794/v1","date":1714285051000,"content":"Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter spp. Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia spp. and Morganella morganii (CP-ESCPM) are increasingly identified as causative agents of nosocomial infections but are still not under systematic genomic surveillance. In this study, using a combination of whole genome sequencing and conjugation experiments, we sought to elucidate the genomic characteristics and transferability of resistance genes in clinical CP-ESCPM isolates from Bulgaria. Among the 36 sequenced isolates, NDM-1 (12/36), VIM-4 (11/36), VIM-86 (8/36) and OXA-48 (7/36) carbapenemases were identified; two isolates carried both NDM-1 and VIM-86. The majority of carbapenemase genes were found on self-conjugative plasmids. IncL plasmids were responsible for the spread of OXA-48 among E. hormaechei, C. freundii and S. marcescens. IncM2 plasmids were generally associated with the spread of NDM-1 in C. freundii and S. marcescens, and also of VIM-4 in C. freundii. IncC plasmids were involved in the spread of the recently described VIM-86 in P. stuartii isolates. IncC plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 and blaVIM-86 have been observed too. blaNDM-1 was also detected on IncX3 in S. marcescens and on IncT plasmid in M. morganii. The significant resistance transfer rates highlight the role of the ESCPM group as a reservoir of resistance determinants and stress the need for strengthening the infection control measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6bfd0204f9b91db7d5936f9f108a5b3a58286ef10ec0ab77bd7d0e014772e45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
