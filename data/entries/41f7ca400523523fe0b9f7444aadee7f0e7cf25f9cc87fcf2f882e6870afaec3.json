{"title":"Solriamfetol and m-chlorophenylpiperazine cause false positive amphetamine results on urine drug screening","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/2/126/7458233?rss=1","date":1701648000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Urine drug screening by immunoassay is a common method to quickly identify drug exposures in the emergency setting and to detect unexpected drug exposures in a variety of patient care and occupational health settings. Although they provide rapid results, immunoassays are susceptible to cross-reactivity with other medications and metabolites. Herein we evaluate the performance of the Thermo Scientific DRI Amphetamines immunoassay for reactivity with trazodone, aripiprazole, atomoxetine, solriamfetol and relevant metabolites. Each of these compounds were spiked into drug-free urine across a range of concentrations and assessed for positivity on amphetamine screen. We demonstrate that the Thermo Scientific DRI assay is susceptible to interferences from m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), the main metabolite of trazodone, and solriamfetol. Characterization of assay-specific interferences in toxicology screening is instrumental for accurate interpretation of toxicology results, evaluation of patients in emergent settings and supporting patient care.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"41f7ca400523523fe0b9f7444aadee7f0e7cf25f9cc87fcf2f882e6870afaec3","category":"Environment"}
