This paper takes a green competitiveness perspective to delve into the interactive relationship between port development and the hinterland economy, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation and policy recommendations for the green development of ports. An evaluation index system for green competitiveness of ports was constructed, and a combination of the Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) and the Entropy Weighted-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (EW-TOPSIS) method was employed to quantitatively measure and assess the 25 major coastal ports and their hinterland economic systems in China. The study reveals that the overall green competitiveness of these major coastal ports is on the rise, yet notable disparities exist among individual ports. Regionally, the green competitiveness of the Yangtze River Delta port group stands out, while that of the Bohai Rim, southeastern, Pearl River Delta, and southwestern coastal port groups is relatively low. Empirical analysis conducted in this paper demonstrates the positive impact of port green competitiveness on the hinterland economic system, particularly its significant role in enhancing the total and quality aspects of the hinterland economy. Furthermore, it was found that the green competitiveness of ports exerts a more pronounced promotional effect on the hinterland economies of the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta port groups compared to that on the Bohai Rim, southeastern, and southwestern coastal port groups. The results of this paper also hold important guiding value for optimizing the allocation of port resources, promoting port technological innovation, and improving port environmental management, contributing to the harmonious coexistence and long-term development of ports and their hinterlands.","author":"Yajing Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6e4f6741b08eac862937de1eae938c5fe38b129f1e858b43c3acedba82e112a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
