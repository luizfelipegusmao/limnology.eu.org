To enable global electrification, high, consistent, reliable battery performance is needed. LB performance is defined by many factors ranging from quality of materials and manufacturing protocols to cycling conditions. However, active materials properties and microstructure of the electrodes define an available capacity, operating voltage, cycle life, and charge/discharge rates. The mission of global electrification relies heavily on materials science methods that link materials properties to the battery performance. Modern materials science methods, particularly various microscopy techniques, play a crucial role in battery materials development, optimization and quality control.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d2a4e39896c0630eb96e328fa68b27bb8bb41c1a1acfcea695e12b6258012e46","category":"Environment"}
