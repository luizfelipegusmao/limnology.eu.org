{"title":"A Real-World Safety Profile in Neurological, Skin, and Sexual disorders of Antiepileptic Drugs Using Pharmacovigilance Database of the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0844/v1","date":1718229174000,"content":"This study aims to examine the safety profile of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) using real-world data, with a focus on neurological, skin, and sexual/reproductive disorders. Data were collected from AED-caused reports in the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System Database (KAERS-DB) from 2012 to 2022. Totally, 46,963 adverse drug reaction (ADR)-drug pairs were analyzed. At the system organ class level, the most frequently reported classes for sodium channel blockers (SCBs) were skin (37.9%), neurological (16.7%), and psychiatric disorders (9.7%). However, for non-SCBs, these were neurological (31.2%), gastrointestinal (22.0%), and psychiatric disorders (18.2%). The most common ADRs induced by SCBs were rash (17.8%), pruritus (8.2%), and dizziness (6.7%). In contrast, non-SCBs induced dizziness (23.7%), somnolence (13.0%), and nausea (6.3%). Among the most commonly reported ADRs, rash, pruritus, and urticaria occurred on average two days later with SCBs compared to non-SCBs. Sexual/reproductive disorders were reported at a frequency of 0.23%. SCBs were reported as the cause more frequently than non-SCBs (59.8% vs. 40.2%, Fisherâ€™s exact test, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Based on real-world data, we identified the safety profiles of AEDs. AED-induced ADRs exhibited different patterns depending on the mechanism. Therefore, it is important to establish different pharmacovigilance strategies to ensure proper monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c4edd44ac8ffd365d8cfa634de4599c26121c641af3737faf6bc09fb5a81325","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
