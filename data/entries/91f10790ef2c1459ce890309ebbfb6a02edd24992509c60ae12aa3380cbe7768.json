{"title":"Why do people sell their kidneys? A thematic synthesis of qualitative evidence","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003015","date":1711548000000,"content":"<p>by Bijaya Shrestha, Luechai Sringernyuang, Manash Shrestha, Binita Shrestha, Anuska Adhikari, Dev Ram Sunuwar, Shiva Raj Mishra, Bipin Adhikari</p>\r\n\r\nGlobally, demands for the kidneys have surpassed supply both living and deceased donors. High demands relative to the availability have made the kidney one of the most saleable human organs. The main objective was to explore the drivers of kidney selling. Literature related to kidney selling and its drivers was explored in three databases including MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus (Elsevier), and JSTOR covering the period from 1987 to 2022. A total of 15 articles were selected, which underwent thematic analysis. Investigators independently assessed the articles for relevance and study quality to synthesize the data. The thematic analysis involved a critical approach to understanding the reasons for kidney selling by examining power disparities and social inequities. Kidney selling and the underlying reasons for it showed similarities across various geographic regions. Several factors were identified which increased individuals’ vulnerability for kidney selling. At the micro level, poverty and illiteracy emerged as significant factors. Lack of financial safety nets obliged family to resort to kidney selling which helped to alleviate poverty, resolve debt, and other urgent financial issues. Nonetheless, the revenues from kidney selling were also used to purchase luxury items (diverting away from investing in livelihood expenses) such as buying motorbikes, mobile phones and televisions. Family, and gender responsibilities also played roles in kidney selling such as obligations related to paying dowry made parents particularly vulnerable. Surprisingly, a few victims of kidney selling later adopted kidney brokering role to support their livelihood. Kidney selling was further fostered by lack of stringent policy to regulate and monitor background checks for kidney transplantation. There were myriad factors that affected individual’s vulnerability to kidney selling which stemmed from micro (poverty, illiteracy), meso (weak legal system, lacking stringent institutional policy, regulatory framework) and macro (social inequalities, corruption, organ shortage, insufficient health infrastructure) levels.","author":"Bijaya Shrestha","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"91f10790ef2c1459ce890309ebbfb6a02edd24992509c60ae12aa3380cbe7768","category":"Environment"}
