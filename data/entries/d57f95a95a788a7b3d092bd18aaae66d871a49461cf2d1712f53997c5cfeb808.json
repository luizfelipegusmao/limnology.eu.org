This research proposes a coupled time–frequency analysis method that synergistically incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition, fractional Fourier transform, Choi–Williams (CW) distribution and adaptive filtering. This coupled method facilitates the comprehensive analysis of full-waveform acoustic logging signals within rigid geological formations. Specifically, it is designed to explore the time–frequency characteristics of shear wave (S-wave) within the context of igneous reservoirs. The coupled time–frequency analysis method significantly ameliorates the time–frequency coupling phenomenon of full-waveform acoustic logging signal. This coupled method is applied across different wells to confirm its wide-ranging applicability and study the time–frequency characteristics response of S-wave through the information of the peak time of the S-wave, the main frequency and the amplitude of the CW distribution.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"d57f95a95a788a7b3d092bd18aaae66d871a49461cf2d1712f53997c5cfeb808","category":"Environment"}
