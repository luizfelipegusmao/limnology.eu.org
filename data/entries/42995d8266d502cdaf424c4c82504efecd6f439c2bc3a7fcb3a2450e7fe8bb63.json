{"title":"Endotaxial Stabilization of 2D Charge Density Waves with Long-Range Order","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.692/7719935?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Charge density waves (CDWs) are an emergent periodic modulation of the electron density that spans a crystal with strong electron-lattice coupling. CDW phases spontaneously break crystal symmetry, facilitate metalâ€“insulator transitions, and compete with superconductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.692-B1\">1</a>]. However, such quantum state is extremely fragile under thermal and external disorder, especially in low dimensions [<a href=\"#ozae044.692-B2\">2</a>]. Here we stabilize long-range order of fragile incommensurate (IC-) CDW phase with <span>endotaxial engineering</span> [<a href=\"#ozae044.692-B8\">8</a>]. The endotaxial synthesis encapsulates monolayers of IC-CDWs within metallic matrices to protect the quantum state from disorder. In addition, we found up to 100 times enhancement of the charge order amplitude. Endotaxial engineering opens a new way to study fragile low-dimensional quantum states in their native chemical environment. By further heating ordered IC-CDWs, we discovered that IC-CDWs undergo a continuous hexatic melting as where translational order quickly decays while retaining six-fold orientational order from proliferation of defects with temperature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"42995d8266d502cdaf424c4c82504efecd6f439c2bc3a7fcb3a2450e7fe8bb63","category":"Environment"}
