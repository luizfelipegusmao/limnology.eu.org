{"title":"The Compact Root Architecture 2 systemic pathway is required for the repression of cytokinins and miR399 accumulation in Medicago truncatula N-limited plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5667/7701203?rss=1","date":1719532800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Legume plants can acquire mineral nitrogen (N) either through their roots or via a symbiotic interaction with N-fixing rhizobia bacteria housed in root nodules. To identify shoot-to-root systemic signals acting in <span>Medicago truncatula</span> plants at N deficit or N satiety, plants were grown in a split-root experimental design in which either high or low N was provided to half of the root system, allowing the analysis of systemic pathways independently of any local N response. Among the plant hormone families analyzed, the cytokinin <span>trans</span>-zeatin accumulated in plants at N satiety. Cytokinin application by petiole feeding led to inhibition of both root growth and nodulation. In addition, an exhaustive analysis of miRNAs revealed that miR2111 accumulates systemically under N deficit in both shoots and non-treated distant roots, whereas a miRNA related to inorganic phosphate (Pi) acquisition, miR399, accumulates in plants grown under N satiety. These two accumulation patterns are dependent on Compact Root Architecture 2 (CRA2), a receptor required for C-terminally Encoded Peptide (CEP) signaling. Constitutive ectopic expression of miR399 reduced nodule numbers and root biomass depending on Pi availability, suggesting that the miR399-dependent Pi-acquisition regulatory module controlled by N availability affects the development of the whole legume plant root system.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bb3ce2bfdfa235f7a82d4aacd648ce47e1b7dbb3b02227a35301d34ad14f1508","category":"Environment"}
