{"title":"Compound Attitude Control Strategy for Reusable Launch Vehicle Based on Improved PSO Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1410/v1","date":1716358382000,"content":"This study introduces an advanced dual-mode composite attitude control framework for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs), underpinned by an enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. This innovative strategy is tailored to meet the stringent demands for precision and robust anti-interference capabilities across the entire flight envelope of RLVs. The research commences with the formulation of a comprehensive attitude dynamics model and diverse heterogeneous actuator representations, meticulously crafted to reflect the distinct phases of RLV flight. Building upon this foundation, a synergistic control paradigm is engineered, integrating PID and fuzzy PID controllers, complemented by a refined fitness evaluation function. The crux of the study is the application of an upgraded PSO algorithm to fine-tune the controllers' weighting coefficients, culminating in an optimized dual-mode composite attitude control system. A series of comparative simulation analyses are meticulously executed to appraise the system's responsiveness, stability, precision, and resilience to interference. The findings unequivocally substantiate the superior performance of the proposed control system, affirming its substantial contribution to the advancement of RLV attitude control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5246ee263948c0abb80e5dcb0ef474ac8e4abb9c3c3cb0178fe3621ca26f2127","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
