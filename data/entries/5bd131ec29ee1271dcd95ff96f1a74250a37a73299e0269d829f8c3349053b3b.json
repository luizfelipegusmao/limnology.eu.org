{"title":"Toward an Integrated Understanding of the Lepidoptera Microbiome","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-020723-102548?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Research over the past 30 years has led to a widespread acceptance that insects establish widespread and diverse associations with microorganisms. More recently, microbiome research has been accelerating in lepidopteran systems, leading to a greater understanding of both endosymbiont and gut microorganisms and how they contribute to integral aspects of the host. Lepidoptera are associated with a robust assemblage of microorganisms, some of which may be stable and routinely detected in larval and adult hosts, while others are ephemeral and transient. Certain microorganisms that populate Lepidoptera can contribute significantly to the hosts’ performance and fitness, while others are inconsequential. We emphasize the context-dependent nature of the interactions between players. While our review discusses the contemporary literature, there are major avenues yet to be explored to determine both the fundamental aspects of host–microbe interactions and potential applications for the lepidopteran microbiome; we describe these avenues after our synthesis.</p></div>","author":"Yongqi Shao, Charles J.
