{"title":"Therapeutic Vaccination in Chronic Hepatitis B: A Systematic Assessment by the HeberNasvac Therapeutic Vaccine Team","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1272/v1","date":1724061953000,"content":"The immune system is central in controlling acute hepatitis B infection and in patients resolving chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Given that 221 million (75%) of CHB patients reside in low- and middle-income countries, developing a vaccine with therapeutic properties represents a rational and cost-effective approach more than a romantic endeavor. This review systematically analyses the critical variables related to the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of CHB treatments. HeberNasvac's experience is revisited to address the challenges and potentialities of therapeutic vaccines, as well as the current roadblocks in research and development, registration, and large-scale implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4a3e6a4ecda953c1fa9778a7cb4e73efe2244f2b02db9dd441b12d9496c7d19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
