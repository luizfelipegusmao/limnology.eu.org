{"title":"History and Toxinology of Palytoxins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0522/v1","date":1723031807000,"content":"Palytoxins are a group of highly potent and structurally complex marine biotoxins that rank among some of the most toxic substances known to science. Palytoxins are naturally synthesized by a variety of marine organisms, including Palythoa zoanthids, Ostreopsis dinoflagellates, and Trichodesmium cyanobacteria, and are widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions where they can bioaccumulate in marine life. The evolution of research on palytoxins has been an intricate exchange between interdisciplinary fields, drawing insights from chemistry, biology, medicine, and environmental science in efforts to better understand and mitigate the health risks associated with this family of toxins. In this review, we begin with a brief history covering the discovery of this group of toxins and the events that led to its isolation. We then focus on the chemical structure of these compounds and their proposed mechanism of action. Finally, we review in vitro and in vivo studies related to their toxicity, with the aim to provide a broad overview of the current knowledge on palytoxin toxicology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b228e185396c67f264ca7fdbca809ef4f32448146f985305fb6e0b77da05131","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
