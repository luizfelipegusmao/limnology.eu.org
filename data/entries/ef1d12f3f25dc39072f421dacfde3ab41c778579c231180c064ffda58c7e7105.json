{"title":"Proposition of an Innovative Methodology Coupling Structure from Motion Photogrammetry and Reflectance Transformation Imaging as a Standard Workflow Tool for Documenting and Researching Painted Surfaces in 2.5D. The Case Study of a Mural Painting from the Palace of Tiryns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1075/v1","date":1723646297000,"content":"Traditional painting artefacts study and documentation face the limitations of well-known recording tools and methods, such as handwritten or digital descriptions, scaled 2D drawings in situ, measurements with calipers, rulers or tape measures, sketches, tracings, as well as conventional or technical photographs. This paper advocates Close-Range Photogrammetry (SfM-MVS) and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for recording vital morphological and 2.5D geometric features of painted surfaces with high accuracy. These digital tools, widely accessible due to increased computing power, enhance art observation, material study and conservation assessment. Despite specialized alternatives like 3D laser scanners, the focus here is on the cost-effective SfM-MVS and RTI, which offer advanced pixel colour accuracy. The ability to reproduce photorealistic textures proves essential for accurate documentation of painted artefacts. The paper showcases promising results from applying these methods to a mural from the Palace of Tiryns, justifying their fundamental role in an integrated scientific art study methodology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef1d12f3f25dc39072f421dacfde3ab41c778579c231180c064ffda58c7e7105","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
