{"title":"From algae to apples: The structural and functional conservation of NLRs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2453/7659712?rss=1","date":1714348800000,"content":"<span>Plant species have been warding off microbial infections throughout their evolutionary history, which has led to the development of innate immune systems tailored to sensing and responding to pathogens. In plants, the intracellular immune response is spearheaded by <strong>N</strong>ucleotide-Binding <strong>L</strong>eucine-Rich-Repeat <strong>R</strong>eceptors, or NLRs, which often detect “effector” virulence proteins used by pathogens to evade or subvert host defenses. Upon activation, NLRs induce a suite of defense responses, including accumulation of defense hormones, induction of immune-related genes, and activation of programmed cell death (<a href=\"#koae131-B1\">Adachi et al. 2019</a>). A key to the function of NLRs is oligomerization driven by the nucleotide-binding domain upon binding of ATP. Such oligomers are referred to as “resistosomes,” but the function of resistosomes differs between subclasses of NLRs and is determined by their N-terminal domains and subcellular localization. The oldest group of NLRs in terms of evolution contain an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, some of which have been shown to form calcium channels upon oligomerization (<a href=\"#koae131-B4\">Hu and Chai 2023</a>). While the field of NLR biology in plants has received an enormous amount of attention in the last 5 years, this attention has been focused almost entirely on angiosperms (or flowering plants). In this issue, Khong-Sam Chia and colleagues (<a href=\"#koae131-B3\">Chia et al. 2024</a>) expand our understanding of NLR biology in nonflowering plant lineages, identifying immunity-related mechanisms that have likely been in place for hundreds of millions of years.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"370ff4c5e28ba76f1ffe9661c5354bb480319552a7318a657ddeb068239e5aeb","category":"Environment"}
