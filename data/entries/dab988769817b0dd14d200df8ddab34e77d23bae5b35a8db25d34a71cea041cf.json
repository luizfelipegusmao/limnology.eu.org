{"title":"Using association rules to explore occult patterns in Breast Cancer Mitochondrial Genomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2461/v1","date":1722347784000,"content":"Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome have been investigated in relation to breast cancer. Certain variants could be associated with an increased risk of this malignant disease. These associations underline the importance of mitochondrial function in cancer biology and highlight the potential for mtDNA-based biomarkers and future therapies. \nThe general objective of this research was to develop a model which is capable of identifying nonlinear patterns in breast cancer mitochondrial sequences. Association rules were used to explore mtDNA variant positions. The analysis included 41 breast cancer patients and 28 control samples. An a priori algorithm identified significant association rules with lift &gt; 1 and confidence &gt; 0.5. A total of 5562 rules for cancer and 157,140 for control sequences were refined after redundancy removal. A total of 150 associations were identified, of which only 78 showed significant support and confidence, while 315 and 1438 positions showed strong associations with breast cancer. Association rules analysis revealed significant patterns, especially in sequences associated with the control region and a specific locus around genes coding for tRNAs and NADH dehydrogenase subunits. However, further research is necessary to establish causality, clinical relevance, and to confirm these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dab988769817b0dd14d200df8ddab34e77d23bae5b35a8db25d34a71cea041cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
