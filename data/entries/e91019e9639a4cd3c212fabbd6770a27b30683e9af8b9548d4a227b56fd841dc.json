{"title":"Transcription factor PgNAC72 activates DAMMARENEDIOL SYNTHASE expression to promote ginseng saponin biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2952/7644681?rss=1","date":1712880000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ginsenosides, the primary bioactive constituents in ginseng (<span>Panax ginseng</span>), possess substantial pharmacological potential and are in high demand in the market. The plant hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) effectively elicits ginsenoside biosynthesis in <span>P. ginseng</span>, though the regulatory mechanism remains largely unexplored. NAC transcription factors are critical in intricate plant regulatory networks and participate in numerous plant physiological activities. In this study, we identified a MeJA-responsive NAC transcription factor gene, <span>PgNAC72</span>, from a transcriptome library produced from MeJA-treated <span>P. ginseng</span> callus. Predominantly expressed in <span>P. ginseng</span> flowers, PgNAC72 localizes to the nucleus. Overexpressing <span>PgNAC72</span> (OE-<span>PgNAC72</span>) in <span>P. ginseng</span> callus notably elevated total saponin levels, particularly dammarane-type ginsenosides, by upregulating <span>dammarenediol synthase</span> (<span>PgDDS</span>), encoding a key enzyme in the ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and dual-luciferase assays confirmed that PgNAC72 binds to the NAC-binding elements in the <span>PgDDS</span> promoter, thereby activating its transcription. Further RNA-seq and terpenoid metabolomic data in the OE-<span>PgNAC72</span> line confirmed that <span>PgNAC72</span> enhances ginsenoside biosynthesis. These findings uncover a regulatory role of <span>PgNAC72</span> in MeJA-mediated ginsenoside biosynthesis, providing insights into the ginsenoside regulatory network and presenting a valuable target gene for metabolic engineering.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e91019e9639a4cd3c212fabbd6770a27b30683e9af8b9548d4a227b56fd841dc","category":"Environment"}
