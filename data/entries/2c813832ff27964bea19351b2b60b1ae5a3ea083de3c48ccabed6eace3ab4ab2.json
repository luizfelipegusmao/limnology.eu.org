Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an endogenous gaseous transmitter that exerts cardioprotective effects via the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis and maintenance of mitochondrial function, among other mechanisms. AP39 is a novel mitochondria-targeted H<sub>2</sub>S donor that, at appropriate concentrations, attenuates intracellular oxidative stress damage, maintains mitochondrial function, and ameliorates cardiomyocyte injury. In this study, DOX-induced cardiotoxicity models were established using H9c2 cells and Spragueâ€“Dawley rats to evaluate the protective effect of AP39 and its mechanisms of action. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that DOX induces oxidative stress injury, apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes and decreases the expression of p-AMPK/AMPK and UCP2. All DOX-induced changes were attenuated by AP39 treatment. Furthermore, the protective effect of AP39 was significantly attenuated by the inhibition of AMPK and UCP2. The results suggest that AP39 ameliorates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating the expression of AMPK/UCP2.","author":"Bin Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2c813832ff27964bea19351b2b60b1ae5a3ea083de3c48ccabed6eace3ab4ab2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
