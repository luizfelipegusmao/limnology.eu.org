{"title":"Risk relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and urolithiasis: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301545","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Wenqiang Fu, Bin Zhu, Jun Chen, Xuelin Jin</p>\r\nBackground <p>The causal genetic relationship between common parenteral manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and urolithiasis remains unclear because their timing is difficult to determine. This study investigated the causal genetic association between IBD and urolithiasis using Mendelian randomization (MR) based on data from large population-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs).</p> Methods <p>A two-sample MR analysis was performed to assess the potential relationship between IBD and urolithiasis. Specific single nucleotide polymorphism data were obtained from GWASs, including IBD (n = 59957) and its main subtypes, Crohn’s disease (CD) (n = 40266) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 45975). Summarized data on urolithiasis (n = 218792) were obtained from different GWAS studies. A random-effects model was analyzed using inverse-variance weighting, MR-Egger, and weighted medians.</p> Results <p>Genetic predisposition to IBD and the risk of urolithiasis were significantly associated [odds ratio (OR), 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–.08), <i>P</i> = 0.01]. Consistently, the weighted median method yielded similar results [OR, 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00–1.12), <i>P</i> = 0.02]. The MR-Egger method also demonstrated comparable findings [OR, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96–1.08), <i>P</i> = 0.45]. Both funnel plots and MR-Egger intercepts indicated no directional pleiotropic effects between IBD and urolithiasis. CD was strongly associated with it in its subtype analysis [OR, 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01–1.07), <i>P</i> = 0.01], and UC was also causally associated with urolithiasis, although the association was not significant [OR, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.03), <i>P</i> = 0.71].</p> Conclusion <p>A unidirectional positive causal correlation was identified between IBD and urolithiasis, with varying degrees of association observed among the different subtypes of IBD. Recognizing the increased incidence of urolithiasis in patients with IBD is crucial in clinical practice. Early detection and surveillance of IBD, improved patient awareness, adoption of preventive strategies, and promotion of collaborative efforts among healthcare providers regarding treatment methodologies are vital for improving patient outcomes.</p>","author":"Wenqiang Fu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c8f05522d94c07c4babdfa5455b5d92e81acc6c3cf72f5e02705ca6a7a8068bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
