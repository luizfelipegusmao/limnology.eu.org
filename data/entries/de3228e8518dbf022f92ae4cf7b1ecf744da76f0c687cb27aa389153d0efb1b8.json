{"title":"A New Tailored Nano-Droplet Carrier of Astaxanthin Can Improve Its Pharmacokinetic Profile and Antioxidant Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0556/v1","date":1712626120000,"content":"Astaxanthin (ATX) is a carotenoid nutraceutical with a poor bioavailability due to its high lipophilicity. We tested a new tailored nano-droplet capable of solubilizing ATX in an oil-in-water micro-environment (LDS-ATX, manufactured by Lyotropic Delivery Systems (LDS)), for its capacity to improve ATX pharmacokinetic profile and anti-oxidant efficacy. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of ATX and LDS-ATX and protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation assays to compare their basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative damage. Our results show that only LPS-induced oxidative damage was corrected by ATX and LDS-ATX. While in the liver and muscle LDS-ATX was more efficacious than ATX in attenuating oxidative damage to both proteins and lipids, only oxidative damage to lipids was preferably corrected by LDS-ATX in the brain. These results strongly suggest improvement of ATX bioavailability and efficacy by the LDS-ATX nano-formulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de3228e8518dbf022f92ae4cf7b1ecf744da76f0c687cb27aa389153d0efb1b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
