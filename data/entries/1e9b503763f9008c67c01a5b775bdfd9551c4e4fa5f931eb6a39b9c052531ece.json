{"title":"Seeking a Treatable Cause of Cardiac Arrest During and After Resuscitation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0860/v1","date":1723561378000,"content":"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) represents a significant global public health burden, characterized by low survival and few established diagnostic tools to guide intervention. OHCA presents with a wide variety of etiologies in a heterogeneous population, posing a clinical challenge to care teams. In this review, we describe evolving research focused on diagnostic approaches to OHCA following resuscitation, including electrocardiography, coronary angiography, computed tomography, ultrasonography, and serologic biomarker assessment. These diagnostic tools have been employed in post-resuscitative efforts for diagnosing ischemic and non-ischemic cardiac, respiratory, neurologic, vascular, traumatic, and metabolic causes of arrest.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e9b503763f9008c67c01a5b775bdfd9551c4e4fa5f931eb6a39b9c052531ece","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
