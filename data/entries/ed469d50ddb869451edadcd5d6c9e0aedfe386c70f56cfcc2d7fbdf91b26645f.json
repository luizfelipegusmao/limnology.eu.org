{"title":"New Data on Distribution of Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) in Oltenia Region, Rom&acirc;nia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2053/v1","date":1717115837000,"content":"Castanea sativa Mill. is a Mediterranean taxon originating in western Asia and southeastern Eu-rope. This paper presents data on the ecology, chorology and phytocenology of C. sativa species from Oltenia region (Romania) (data from the literature, herbariums, and the field). In the sub-spontaneous flora of Oltenia region, the C. sativa species is found in sheltered resorts in the counties of Gorj (Glogova, Valea Perilor, Tismana, Pocruia, Polovragi, etc.) and Mehedinți (Comăneşti, Baia de Aramă, etc.), on mesobasic soils, balanced from a hydraulic point of view. It was identified in a cultivated state, in few specimens, in the previously mentioned counties and in Vâlcea county, near the monasteries (eg Horezu Monastery). The phytocoenoses where this species grows are rich in southern elements (eg Cornus mas L., Cerasus avium (L.) Moench, Quer-cus dalechampii Ten., Tilia tomentosa Moench etc.). They are included in the association Castaneo-Quercetum Horvat 1938. If we refer to the habitats in Romania, the areas occupied by edible chestnut are included in the R4141 habitat - Daco-Balkan forests of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and chestnut (C. sativa) with Genista tinctoria - a habitat with a very high conservation value, and according to Natura 2000, forests of C. sativa are included in the 9260 habitats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed469d50ddb869451edadcd5d6c9e0aedfe386c70f56cfcc2d7fbdf91b26645f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
