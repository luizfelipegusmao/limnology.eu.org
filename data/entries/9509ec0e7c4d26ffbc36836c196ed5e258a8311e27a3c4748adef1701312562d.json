{"title":"Sympathetic Innervation of Interscapular Brown Adipose Tissue is not a Predominant Mediator of Oxytocin-Induced Brown Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis in Female High Fat Diet-Fed Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0284/v2","date":1727662501000,"content":"Previous studies in our lab show that that administration of oxytocin (OT) into the fourth ventricle (4V; hindbrain) elicits weight loss and stimulates interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT) in male diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. What remains unclear is whether chronic hindbrain (4V) OT can impact body weight in female high fat diet-fed (HFD) rodents and whether this involves activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). We hypothesized that OT-elicited stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) contributes to its ability to activate BAT and reduce body weight in female high HFD-fed rats. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of disrupting SNS activation of IBAT on OT-elicited stimulation of TIBAT and reduction of body weight in DIO rats. We first measured the impact of bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT on the ability of acute 4V OT (0.5, 1, and 5 µg ≈ 0.5, 0.99, and 4.96 nmol) to stimulate TIBAT in female HFD-fed rats. We found that the high dose of 4V OT (5 µg ≈ 4.96 nmol) stimulated TIBAT similarly between sham rats and denervated rats (P=NS). We subsequently measured the effect of bilateral surgical denervation of IBAT on the effect of chronic 4V OT (16 nmol/day ≈ 16.1 mg/day) or vehicle infusion to reduce body weight, adiposity and energy intake in female HFD-fed rats (N=7-8/group). Chronic 4V OT reduced body weight gain (sham:  -18.0±4.9 g; denervation:  -15.9±3.7 g) and adiposity (sham:  -13.9±3.7 g; denervation:  -13.6±2.4 g) relative to vehicle treatment (P&lt;0.05) and these effects were similar between groups (P=NS). These effects were attributed, in part, to reduced energy intake evident during weeks 2 (P&lt;0.05) and 3 (P&lt;0.05). To test whether these results translate to other female rodent species, we also examined the effect of chronic 4V infusion of OT on body weight and adiposity in two strains of female HFD-fed mice. Similar to what we found in the HFD-fed rat model, we also found that chronic 4V OT (16 nmol/day) infusion resulted in reduced body weight gain, adiposity and energy intake in female DIO C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (P&lt;0.05 vs vehicle). Together, these findings suggest that 1) sympathetic innervation of IBAT is not necessary for OT-elicited increases in BAT thermogenesis and weight loss in female HFD-fed rats and 2) the effects of OT to elicit weight loss translate to other mouse models of diet-induced obesity (DIO).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9509ec0e7c4d26ffbc36836c196ed5e258a8311e27a3c4748adef1701312562d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
