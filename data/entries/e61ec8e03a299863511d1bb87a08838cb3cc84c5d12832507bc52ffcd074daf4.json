{"title":"Current Perspectives of Antifungal Therapy: A Special Focus on Candida auris","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1513/v1","date":1716459121000,"content":"Candida auris is considered an emerging Candida species that has rapidly spread all over the world. The evidence of its origin and emerging resistance is still unclear. The severe infection by this species causes significant mortality and morbidity among the elderly and immune compressed individuals. Development of drug resistance is the major factor associated with therapeutic failure of existing antifungal agents. Previous studies addressed the antifungal resistance profile and drug discovery for C. auris. However, comprehensive coverage of these information in a single investigation yet to be available. In this review, we have mainly focused on recent development in therapeutic strategy against C. auris. Based on the available information, several differential approaches were discussed, including existing antifungal drugs, chemical compounds, essential oils, natural products, antifungal peptides, immunotherapy, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, drug repurposing, and drug delivery systems. Among them, chemical medications, natural products, and antifungal peptides are the prime contributors. However, a limited number of resources are available to prove the efficiency of these potential therapies in clinical usage. Hence, we hope that the data gathered in this review can encourage in vivo studies and clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e61ec8e03a299863511d1bb87a08838cb3cc84c5d12832507bc52ffcd074daf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
