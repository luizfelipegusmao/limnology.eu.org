{"title":"Upgraded diesel‐like fuel from pyrolysis of a waste tire and its engine performance and exhaust emissions","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14367?af=R","date":1722427964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Granulated truck waste tire was first pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor under an inert atmosphere and at certain conditions. The highest oil yield of which was 47.0 wt %, was attained at 550 and 20°C/min. The oil was separated into a fraction of 150–300°C boiling points, so-called diesel-like fuel (DBY), with a calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst at an optimal ratio of 2 wt %. The fraction was subjected to desulfurization, bleaching, and deodorization, respectively, at specific conditions, and this process resulted in a decrease of 75.8 wt % compared to its initial sulfur content of 5000 ppm. The upgraded diesel-like oil (DAF) fraction contained chemical compounds with carbon numbers C<sub>6</sub>–C<sub>26</sub>. In addition, its physicochemical characteristics showed a kinematic viscosity of 3.13 cSt (40°C), a density of 832 g/L (15°C), a lower heating value of 42.32 MJ/kg, and an H/C molar ratio of 1.73. Lastly, the DAF was tested with commercial diesel fuel for its motor and emission performance via a single-cylinder diesel engine. All in all, it can be said that the DAF may be harnessed as a substitute for diesel fuels after its further upgrading via catalytic hydrodesulfurization etc.</p>","author":"Nejdet Şen, \nCaner Demir, \nYakup Kar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"ddb804f98df86c3b1a85f117f6c1b6b087c58b657fc221b3b27535a97ab2b827","category":"Environment"}
