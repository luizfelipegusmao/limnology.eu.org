A predicting formula and scoring system based on low-cost investigations is needed. This cross-sectional study was conducted among thalassemia aged 6–18 years at Rumah Sakit Anak dan Bunda RSAB Harapan Kita Indonesia, during October 2017 to April 2019. All subjects were scheduled for clinical examination, laboratory tests, ECGs, echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, and MRIT2*. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the formula, simplifying to a scoring system, and risk classification for myocardial iron overload using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Significance was set as p&lt;0,05. We recruited 80 children, of those, 8 (10%) were classified as cardiac iron overload based on MRI T2* screening. Multivariate logistic regression showed determinant factors for cardiac iron overload were hemoglobin (95% CI:1.92–369.14), reticulocyte (95% CI:1.14–232.33), mitral deceleration time (DT) (95% CI:1.80–810.62,), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR Vmax) (95% CI:1.87–1942.56) with aOR of 26.65, 14.27, 38.22, and 60.27 respectively. The formula for cardiac iron overload was decided as 9.32 + 3.28 (Hb) + 2.9 (reticulocyte) + 3.64 (DT) + 4.1 (TR Vmax). A scoring system was defined by simplifying the formula of Hb ≤ 8.2 g/L, reticulocyte ≤0.33%, DT ≤ 114.5 cm/s, and TR Vmax ≥ 2.37 m/s were given a score of 1, while others were assigned 0. Total scores of 0 or 1, 2 and 3 or 4 were categorized as low, moderate, and high risk for iron cardiac overload. The cardiac iron overload formula was 9.32 + 3.28 (Hb) + 2.9 (reticulocyte) + 3.64 (DT) + 4.1 (TR Vmax). Variables of Hb ≤ 8.2 g/L, reticulocyte ≤0.33%, DT ≤ 114.5 cm/s, and TR Vmax ≥ 2.37 m/s were given a score of 1, while others were assigned 0. Total scores of 0 or 1, 2, and 3 or 4 were categorized as low, moderate, and high risk for iron cardiac overload.","author":"Syarif Rohimi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"73b2b543acdb189b08554b75b7beb42c0e2ca9fb646a2e057c6d2b7c3d162d1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
