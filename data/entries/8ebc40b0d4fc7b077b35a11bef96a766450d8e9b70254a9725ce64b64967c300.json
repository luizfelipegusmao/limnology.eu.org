{"title":"Enterprise Architecture and Agile Approach for Digital Transformation: An Integrated Analysis Approach Using Bibliometric and Content Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0795/v1","date":1728563209000,"content":"Enterprise Architecture (EA) development with an Agile approach is believed to be an alternative solution to various current EA development challenges. Agile Enterprise Architecture (EA) is an EA development that applies Agile principles and focuses on collaborative and incremental de-velopment, adaptation, and sharing information about business and IT modes to guide the ef-fective implementation of Agile projects. There have been many discussions of literature related to EA management, but literature review studies that specifically describe Adaptive or Agile EA management are still rare. The research method of this study follows two consecutive phases: bibliometric analysis and content based analysis. First, bibliometric analysis utilizing the VOSviewer software to identify the state of the field and global research patterns in Agile EA from 2012 to 2023, including author and institutional distributions, frequent categories and keywords, contributions from journals and authors, and highly cited works. Next, thematic analysis and meta-analysis to reveal various frameworks or models used in agile EA implementation and its dimensions. The extracted bibliometric and content data from 59 selected articles were processed using the VOSviewer tool for identifying and understanding the relationships between main concepts through network mapping. There are several Agile-based EA frameworks based on empirical research found in EA development, such as Adaptive Enterpise Architecture, Adaptive Integrated Digital Architecture Framework (AIDAF), Lean Enterprise Architecture Frameowrk (LEAF), Scrum for EA, and several other Agile EA frameworks developed that have been ob-served. Various agile methods have been adopted in developing the agile EA framework, in-cluding its application in various industrial sectors in several countries, the risks faced and future research opportunities to increase the effectiveness of agile EA implementation in Digital Transformation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ebc40b0d4fc7b077b35a11bef96a766450d8e9b70254a9725ce64b64967c300","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
