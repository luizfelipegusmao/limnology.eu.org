{"title":"The NGDOs Efficiency: a PROMETHEE Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1629/v1","date":1721631917000,"content":"The current economic and political crisis has brought about a change in the environment in which Non-Governmental Development Organizations (NGDOs) have traditionally operated. This change can be summed up as a reduction in the funds they receive and an increase in the population they must serve. The need then arises to have mechanisms that allow an analysis of the good work performed by the NGDOs. Knowing the efficiency of the NGDOs in the management of their previous projects can contribute towards improving their future achievements. The aim of this research is to establish some objective indicators that allow an evaluation of the efficiency of these organizations. Firstly, a detailed analysis of the regulation of the three Agencies is conducted (Spanish-AECID, European- EuropeAid and American -USAID). This allows us to synthesize the indicators of good performance of the NGDO based on the study of the eligibility criteria of public donors. The research concludes with the study of the efficiency following the Promethee Approach. Our results reveals that 44.6% of the NGDOs (33 out of the 74 studied) operate inefficiently, compared to 29.7% which are efficient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7969ebe58eb34af964abae3553413689135af623569ec67b469cafc3a5ab4190","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
