Tejani, Pinank Patel, Mohammad Khishe</p>\r\n\r\nThis research article presents the Multi-Objective Hippopotamus Optimizer (MOHO), a unique approach that excels in tackling complex structural optimization problems. The Hippopotamus Optimizer (HO) is a novel approach in meta-heuristic methodology that draws inspiration from the natural behaviour of hippos. The HO is built upon a trinary-phase model that incorporates mathematical representations of crucial aspects of Hippo’s behaviour, including their movements in aquatic environments, defense mechanisms against predators, and avoidance strategies. This conceptual framework forms the basis for developing the multi-objective (MO) variant MOHO, which was applied to optimize five well-known truss structures. Balancing safety precautions and size constraints concerning stresses on individual sections and constituent parts, these problems also involved competing objectives, such as reducing the weight of the structure and the maximum nodal displacement. The findings of six popular optimization methods were used to compare the results. Four industry-standard performance measures were used for this comparison and qualitative examination of the finest Pareto-front plots generated by each algorithm. The average values obtained by the Friedman rank test and comparison analysis unequivocally showed that MOHO outperformed other methods in resolving significant structure optimization problems quickly. In addition to finding and preserving more Pareto-optimal sets, the recommended algorithm produced excellent convergence and variance in the objective and decision fields. MOHO demonstrated its potential for navigating competing objectives through diversity analysis. Additionally, the swarm plots effectively visualize MOHO’s solution distribution of MOHO across iterations, highlighting its superior convergence behaviour. Consequently, MOHO exhibits promise as a valuable method for tackling complex multi-objective structure optimization issues.","author":"Nikunj Mashru","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"79ca30b37630eb0cd7032a2e16c13aec0949132aba21012e0014cce88a7daa45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
