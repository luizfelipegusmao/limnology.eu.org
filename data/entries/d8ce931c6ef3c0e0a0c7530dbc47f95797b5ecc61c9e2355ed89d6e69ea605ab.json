{"title":"Weight-Bearing CT for Diseases of the Foot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1014/v1","date":1728902436000,"content":"Since its introduction, weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) has gained prominence due to its ability to produce accurate three-dimensional images under natural loading conditions, making it particularly useful for assessing complex foot deformities. This review aimed to focus on the diseases of the foot and categorized the pathological conditions into forefoot disease (hallux valgus), midfoot disease (Lisfranc injuries and midfoot osteoarthritis), and progressive collapsing foot deformity. Owing to its superior diagnostic therapeutic value, WBCT is poised to become the gold standard in foot and ankle imaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8ce931c6ef3c0e0a0c7530dbc47f95797b5ecc61c9e2355ed89d6e69ea605ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
