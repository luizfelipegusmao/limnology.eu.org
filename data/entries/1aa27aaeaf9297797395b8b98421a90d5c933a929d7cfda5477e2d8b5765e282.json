{"title":"Foundation Behaviour in Unsaturated Expansive Soils: A Review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-97-8241-3_29","date":1735689600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Foundation designs typically rely on traditional soil mechanics principles, which assume the soil is either completely saturated or entirely dry. However, the impact of soil suction associated with the alternate wetting and drying conditions in the unsaturated zone (i.e. soil suction) is generally overlooked in traditional design approaches. This may lead to ground heave or differential settlement contributing to extreme distress to various infrastructures built in unsaturated expansive soils. Shallow foundations are usually built above the groundwater table, leaving much of the soil beneath them unsaturated. As a result, soil suction greatly affects the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour. Further, deep foundations extend through the active layer of unsaturated expansive soil until reaching the bedrock or rest on a high-quality soil-bearing stratum. The volume-changing behaviour of the unsaturated expansive soil typically moves upward along the pile, creating additional positive friction that can potentially uplift lightly loaded structures. This paper presents a review of foundation behaviour in unsaturated expansive soils. Particularly, this review focuses on the influence of matric suction on soil-volume expansion which contributes to the ground heave, soil-structure interface shear strength properties, bearing capacity, and load-settlement behaviour of foundations.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"1aa27aaeaf9297797395b8b98421a90d5c933a929d7cfda5477e2d8b5765e282","category":"Environment"}
