This reactor system allows precise temperature control, continuous pH monitoring, and controlled dosing of reagents to optimize reaction conditions. Detailed characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), BET (specific surface area) analysis, point of zero charge (PZC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the SCR, SCRT, and 5%Fe@SCRT materials. For Malachite Green adsorption, SRCT demonstrated a maximum adsorption capacity of 39.78 ± 0.5 mg/g using the Langmuir isotherm model and followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Optimum conditions for adsorption were found to be: an initial concentration of 50 ppm, an adsorbent dosage of 1 g/l, a pH of 8.5, and a temperature of 50°C. For the catalytic oxidation of phenol, 5%Fe@SRCT achieved a remarkable removal rate of 99.9 ± 0.1% under optimum conditions (50 ppm phenol, 1 g/l catalyst dosage, pH 3.5, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration 8.7 mM, and temperature 70°C). Intermediates identified during the reaction included hydroquinone, benzoquinone, catechol, and resorcinol, with degradation occurring over a 60-minute reaction period. The 5%Fe@SCRT material showed excellent reusability in the removal of phenol by catalytic oxidation, with no significant loss of efficiency over three cycles, while the SRCT underwent three cycles of regeneration for the adsorption of Malachite Green. Scavenger tests confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the catalytic oxidation process. In addition, fish survival tests after catalytic oxidation of phenol by 5%Fe@SRCT showed no impact on fish, underlining the environmental safety of this process. In addition, germination tests after decolorization of MG by SRCT demonstrated a good effect with no negative impact, reinforcing the ecological value of this innovative technology. These results highlight the innovative use of SCRT and 5%Fe@SCRT as versatile materials for environmental remediation, exploiting their effective adsorption capacities and efficient catalytic oxidation performance within the proposed double-walled borosilicate glass reactor system.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe study demonstrates the effectiveness of an innovative reactor system employing SRCT adsorbent and Fe@SRCT catalyst for efficient removal of malachite green and phenol from wastewater.\nEnvironmental impact assessment, including seed germination and fish survival evaluation, validates the method's eco-friendly potential.\nImplementation of this approach could significantly contribute to sustainable water treatment practices.\n</p>","author":"Omar Boualam, \nSouad El Alami, \nHanane Ibaghlin, \nChaimae Chadli, \nKarim Tanji, \nAbdelali El Gaidoumi, \nRaja Belaabed, \nHakima Elknidri, \nAbdelhak Kherbeche, \nAbdellah Addaou, \nAli Laajeb","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"21756551948611a8b66c818f5b036a62d4de7547a9997452de7b0e2d2e75bafb","category":"Environment"}
