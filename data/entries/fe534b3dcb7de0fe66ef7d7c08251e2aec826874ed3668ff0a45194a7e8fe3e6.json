{"title":"Metabarcoding of the bacterial assemblages associated with Toxopneustes roseus in the Mexican Central Pacific","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2023/v1","date":1717053169000,"content":"The Mexican Central Pacific (MCP) has discontinuous coral ecosystems with different protection and anthropogenic disturbance. Characterizing the bacterial assemblage associated with the sea urchin Toxopneustes roseus and its relationship with environmental variables will contribute to understanding the species’ physiology and ecology. We collected sea urchins from coral ecosystems at six sites in the MCP during the summer and winter for two consecutive years. The spatial scale represented the most important variation in the T. roseus bacteriome, particularly because of Isla Isabel National Park (PNII). Likewise, spatial differences correlated with habitat structure variables, mainly the sponge and live coral cover. The PNII exhibited a highly diverse bacterial assemblages compared to other sites, characterized by families associated with diseases and environmental stress (Saprospiraceae, Flammeovirgaceae, and Xanthobacteraceae). The remaining five sites presented a constant spatio-temporal pattern, where the predominance of Campylobacteraceae and Helicobacteraceae families were key to T. roseus’ holobiont. However, the dominance of certain bacterial families in the second analyzed year, such as Enterobacteriaceae, suggests that Punto B, and Islas e islotes de Bahía Chamela Sanctuary, were exposed to sewage contamination. Overall, our results improve the understanding of host-associated bacterial assemblage in specific time and space and its relationship with the environmental condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe534b3dcb7de0fe66ef7d7c08251e2aec826874ed3668ff0a45194a7e8fe3e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
