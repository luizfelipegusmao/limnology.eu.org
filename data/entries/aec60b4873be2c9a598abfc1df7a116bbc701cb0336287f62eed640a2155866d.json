{"title":"The effect of live body condition score of beef cows on carcass characteristics, carcass-cutting yields, processor profitability, and tenderness in the longissimus lumborum and psoas major muscles","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae129/7742281?rss=1","date":1724716800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of body condition score (BCS) of cull cows on carcass characteristics, carcass-cutting yields, profitability, and tenderness development for the <span>longissimus lumborum</span> and <span>psoas major</span> muscles. During a 5-wk period (May–June 2023), 10 boner cull cows (BCS 4 to 6) and 10 leaner cull cows (BCS 1 to 3) were purchased at a commercial auction market. Live conformation, carcass characteristics, weights of fabricated cuts, tenderness, pH decline, and temperature decline were recorded following slaughter. Carcasses were fabricated into the following cuts: knuckle, inside round, outside round, eye of round, strip loin, top sirloin, bottom sirloin flap, tenderloin, flank, ribeye roll, chuck tender, and brisket, whereas lean was separated into lean and fat components. Beef processor returns for boner cows were calculated as the sum of USDA Carlot Report values for the subprimal cuts, trim, bone, and drop value subtracted by actual live costs at the auction market whereas beef processor returns for leaner cows were calculated as the sum of USDA Carlot Report values for the trim, bone, and drop value subtracted by actual live costs at the auction market. Carcass and merchandizing value parameters were analyzed using a completely randomized design with a fixed effect of classification (leaner or boner) and a random effect of slaughter day. Live weight was used as a covariant for all carcass and merchandizing value parameters due to the pronounced effect of live weight for most parameters. Temperature decline, pH decline, shear force, and cooking loss parameters were analyzed using a completely randomized design with a fixed effect of classification (leaner or boner) and a random effect of slaughter day. Boner cows were found to be heavier for both live and carcass weights when compared with leaner cows. In addition, backfat thickness was 0.39 cm greater (<span>P</span> = 0.03), and ribeye area was 9.17 cm<sup>2</sup> (<span>P</span> = 0.05) greater for boner cows compared with leaner cows. This resulted in boner cows yielding larger subprimal cuts and a greater amount of lean trim, which in turn generated more beef processor revenue. However, specific consideration should be provided for profitability as the ability to market subprimal cuts is highly dependent on muscle size, fat deposition, meat quality, and market prices for both boner and leaner cows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"aec60b4873be2c9a598abfc1df7a116bbc701cb0336287f62eed640a2155866d","category":"Environment"}
