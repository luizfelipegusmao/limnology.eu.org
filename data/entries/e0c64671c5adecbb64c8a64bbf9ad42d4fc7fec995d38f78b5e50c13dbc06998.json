{"title":"Ex Vivo Intestinal Organoid Models: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges in Disease Modelling and Therapeutic Testing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1839/v1","date":1727146000000,"content":"Despite improvements in participation in population-based screening programs, colorectal cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Targeted interventions are desirable to reduce the health and economic burden of this disease. Two-dimensional monolayers of colorectal cancer cell lines represent the traditional in vitro models for disease and are often used for diverse purposes, including delineation of molecular pathways associated with disease aetiology or to gauge drug efficacy. The lack of complexity in such models, chiefly the limited epithelial cell diversity and differentiation, attenuated mucus production, lack of microbial interactions and mechanical stresses, has driven interest in development of more holistic and physiologically relevant in vitro model systems. In particular, established ex vivo patient-derived explant and patient-derived tumour xenograft models have been supplemented by progress in organoid and microfluidic organ-on-a-chip cultures. Here we discuss the applicability of advanced culturing technologies, such as organoid systems, as models for colorectal cancer and for testing chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity and efficacy. We highlight current challenges associated with organoid technologies and discuss their future for more accurate disease modelling and personalized medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0c64671c5adecbb64c8a64bbf9ad42d4fc7fec995d38f78b5e50c13dbc06998","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
