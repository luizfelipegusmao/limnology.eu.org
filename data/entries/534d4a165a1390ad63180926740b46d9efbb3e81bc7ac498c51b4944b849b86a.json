Recent studies have reported the emergence of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites tolerant to artemisinin agents in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. The current study assessed the day 3 parasite clearance and its correlation with <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum K13</i> propeller gene (<i>pfkelch13</i>) mutations in <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> parasites isolated from patients with uncomplicated malaria under artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment. This study enrolled 100 <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum-</i>positive patients to whom AL was prescribed between 09/September/2022 and 06/November/2022. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes before treatment initiation (day 0) and on day 3. Parasitemia was assessed by microscopy from blood smears and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from the DNA extracted. The day 0 parasite <i>K13</i> gene was sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Sequence data were analysed using MEGA <i>version</i> 11 software. The data were analysed using STATA <i>version</i> 15, and the Mannâ€’Whitney U test was used to compare PCR parasite clearance on day 3 using the comparative CT value method and <i>pfkelch13</i> mutations. The prevalence of day 3 parasitaemia was 24% (24/100) by microscopy and 63% (63/100) by qPCR from the AL-treated patients. <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum K13</i>-propeller gene polymorphism was detected in 18.8% (15/80) of the day 0 DNA samples. The <i>K13</i> mutations found were C469Y, 12.5% (10/80); A675V, 2.5% (2/80); A569S, 1.25%, (1/80), A578S, 1.25%, (1/80) and; F491S, 1.25%, (1/80) a new allele not reported anywhere. The C469Y mutation, compared to the wild-type, was associated with delayed parasite clearance <i>p</i> = 0.0278, Hodges-Lehmann estimation 3.2108 on the log scale, (95%CI 1.7076, 4.4730). There was a high prevalence of day 3 <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> among malaria patients treated using artemether-lumefantrine. We conclude the presence of the <i>K13</i> mutation associated with artemisinin resistance <i>by P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> in Adjumani district, Uganda, necessitates regular surveillance of the effectiveness and efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in the country.","author":"Martin Kamilo Angwe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"534d4a165a1390ad63180926740b46d9efbb3e81bc7ac498c51b4944b849b86a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
