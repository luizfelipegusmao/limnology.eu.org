{"title":"Spermidine supplementation influence on protective enzymes of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae098/7816043?rss=1","date":1728432000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Dietary supplementation has been proposed as a sustainable way to improve the health and resilience of honey bees (<span>Apis mellifera</span>, L.), as the decline in their numbers in recent decades has raised scientific, environmental, and economic concerns. Spermidine, a natural polyamine, has been shown to be a promising substance for honey bee supplementation, as its health-promoting effects have been demonstrated in numerous studies and in different organisms. As already shown, supplementation with spermidine at a certain concentration prolonged lifespan, reduced oxidative stress, and increased antioxidative capacity in honey bees. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether spermidine supplementation affects gene expression and/or enzyme activity of antioxidative and detoxification enzymes and immune response markers in honey bee workers. The different gene expression and enzyme activity patterns observed in abdominal and head tissues in response to spermidine supplementation suggest tissue-specific and concentration-dependent effects. In addition, the immune response markers suggest that spermidine has the ability to boost honey bee immunity. The observed changes make a valuable contribution to understanding the molecular mechanisms by which spermidine may exert its beneficial effects on the beeâ€™s health and lifespan. These results support the idea of the use of spermidine supplementation to promote bee health and resilience to environmental stressors, emphasizing that the dose must be carefully chosen to achieve a balance between the pro- and antioxidant effects of spermidine.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"450a426d69265f1f37d7b9ae1ab5f206ea145cdc4fc34d1bef0fcfe6555f0d28","category":"Environment"}
