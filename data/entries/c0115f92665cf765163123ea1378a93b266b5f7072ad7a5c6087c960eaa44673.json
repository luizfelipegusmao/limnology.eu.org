{"title":"A Preliminary Observational Study of the Endoscopic Anatomical Structures of the Lumbar Spine Through the Foraminal and the Interlaminar Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1281/v1","date":1721112671000,"content":"Objective To explore the endoscopic anatomical structures of lumbar surgery. Methods A total of 290 patients who underwent lumbar endoscopic surgery due to lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation from September 2020 to September 2022 were retrospectively reviewed in our hospital,179 patients had complete surgical video recordings, including 108 males and 71 females, aged from 19 to 65 years, with an average age of 41Â±16 years. The endoscopic structures through the intervertebral foramen and interlaminar space were independently identified by 3 doctors with more than 3 years of related surgery experience. When there were differences of opinions, the three doctors would discuss and come to a consensus. The probability, location, and neighboring structures of each specific structures were statistically analyzed. Results The anatomical structures observed through the lumbar foramen under endoscopy include muscles and ligaments attached to the superior articular process (SAP), main blood vessels inside the intervertebral foramen, blood vessels on the surface of IVD, and blood vessels on the surface of the dural sac and nerve root. The major anatomical structures observed through interlaminar space are multifidus, the conjugated ligament of ligament flavum and capsule ligament (capsule part of flavum ligaments), edges of the lamina, specific vessel bundle to facet with exit nerve root. Conclusion The anatomical structures under spinal endoscopy have certain characteristics, which are grossly different from those under open surgery. Familiarity with these anatomical structures has important clinical significance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0115f92665cf765163123ea1378a93b266b5f7072ad7a5c6087c960eaa44673","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
