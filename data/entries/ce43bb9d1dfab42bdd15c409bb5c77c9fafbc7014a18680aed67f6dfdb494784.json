{"title":"Decadal (2010–2019) variability in the marine ecosystems of the North Atlantic","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/3/505/7624343?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The “Symposium on Decadal Variability of the North Atlantic and its Marine Ecosystems: 2010–2019” took place in Bergen, Norway, from 20 to 22 May 2022. This event, hosted by the Institute of Marine Research, was jointly sponsored by ICES and NAFO and constitutes the fourth in a series of these symposia that started in 1991. The first symposium’s aim was to review the hydrobiological variability in the decade of the 1980s, addressing the physical environment, plankton, invertebrates, and fish. Subsequent symposia maintained the classical structure, whilst a new theme session covering social sciences was added to the programme in the 2022 edition. Studies of climate impacts on marine ecosystems and living marine resources, including trends and regime shifts, emerged from increasingly longer ecosystem time series across the North Atlantic and subarctic regions. This symposium collection presents key findings discussed during the symposium. Whilst some progress has been made in advancing our ability to understand new trends and patterns of climate change and variability across physical, plankton, and fish communities, more work is needed to integrate these physical-ecological processes and scales with social science.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"ce43bb9d1dfab42bdd15c409bb5c77c9fafbc7014a18680aed67f6dfdb494784","category":"Environment"}
