These conditions can be primary with unknown cause or secondary, associated with diseases or infections.  There are seven different categories of AIHA, warm-antibody AIHA (wAIHA); cold-antibody AIHA that includes cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) and cold agglutin disease (CAD);  mixed AIHA, also called combined cold and warm AIHA; paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) also termed Donath-Lansteiner test-positive AIHA; direct antiglobulin test-negative AIHA (DAT-neg AIHA); drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA); and passenger lymphocyte syndrome.  This review will discuss each of these AIHAs and provide information on diagnosis and treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c7219d2469343cd90c15a90a6ddd08eded2858043983319729c18d792b13743","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
