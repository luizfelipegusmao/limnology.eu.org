{"title":"Enhancing Drought and Arsenic Resistance in Oryza sativa by Hyperexpression of Aquaporin Genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1280/v1","date":1716202435000,"content":"Drought and arsenic contamination pose a serious threat to global rice crop yield. Existing solutions focus on either heavy metal or drought remediation, but not both. Examination of the Oryza sativa metagenome via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database revealed promising candidates within the aquaporin gene family capable of efficiently mitigating both arsenic toxicity and drought stress. Rice cotyledons were genetically augmented with arsenic-resistant OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP3;2 genes, and drought-resistant OsPIP2;2 genes. In moderate drought conditions and 25 ppm arsenic-contaminated soil, transgenic plants showed drought tolerance and reduced translocation of arsenic from root to shoot. Soil arsenic levels plummeted from 25 ppm to 5 ppm, demonstrating the strategy's efficacy. Statistical significance was confirmed using T tests. Thus, aquaporin-augmented Oryza sativa offers a promising solution to mitigate both arsenic and drought stress in rice plants improving crop yield and facilitating soil decontamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"115341287977e6963ed0748dbb01f83e9707c57d73d83cf4bb6178ee6bb13148","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
