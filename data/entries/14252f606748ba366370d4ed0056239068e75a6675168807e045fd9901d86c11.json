{"title":"Closing the Gap in Electron Detection Capabilities between SEM and TEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.325/7720428?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>In parallel to finding new records in resolution in high energy Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM) applications - somehow a little behind the scenes - the Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) and TEM machines reach out for each other. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) in SEM becomes a more and more versatile tool for economical STEM examinations. This may be as a pre-study for further STEM measurements in high end machines or as the final inspection tool. Even though this is an ongoing trend, there is still a gap between the detection capabilities of transmitted electrons in SEM and TEM machines. In SEM, STEM detectors mostly range from passive detection - via generated secondary electrons - to diode arrays and simple segmented diodes. In contrast, in TEM machines the varieties span from single cell detectors over multi segmented ring diodes to fully pixelated electron cameras. Nevertheless, there is a strong demand of expanding the detection possibilities in the SEM closer to TEM machines in order to increase the overlap in detection variability. Here, we introduce a versatile multi-channel STEM setup which can be used in SEM as well as TEM sharing the same platform but addressing the specialties of both worlds.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"14252f606748ba366370d4ed0056239068e75a6675168807e045fd9901d86c11","category":"Environment"}
