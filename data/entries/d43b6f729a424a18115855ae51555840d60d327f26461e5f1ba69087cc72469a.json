{"title":"Effect of extrusion on energy and nutrient digestibility of lentil-based diets containing either supplemental plant or animal protein fed to growing pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae017/7604327?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Non-food grade and excess lentil grain production may be included in swine feeds to provide starch and protein and reduce feed cost. Extrusion processing may increase energy and nutrient digestibility of lentil-based diets containing either supplemental plant or animal protein sources. Therefore, the apparent ileal digestibility (<strong>AID</strong>) of crude protein (<strong>CP</strong>) and amino acids (<strong>AA</strong>), apparent total tract digestibility (<strong>ATTD</strong>) of gross energy (<strong>GE</strong>), and digestible energy (<strong>DE</strong>) value of lentil-based diets were assessed in growing pigs. Two diets were formulated to provide 2.4 Mcal net energy (<strong>NE</strong>)/kg and 4.35 g standardized ileal digestible lysine/Mcal NE: (1) soybean meal (<strong>SBM</strong>) diet, containing 50% lentil, 31% wheat, and 12.8% SBM; and (2) fish meal (<strong>FM</strong>) diet, containing 40% lentil, 45% wheat, and 10% FM. Following mixing, each diet batch was divided into two parts: one part remained as mash, whereas the other part was extruded using a single-screw extruder (400 rpm, 250 kg/h). Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (32.3 ± 1.5 kg) were fed the four diets at 2.8 times maintenance DE requirement (110 kcal per kg of body weight<sup>0.75</sup>) for four 9-d periods in a double 4 × 4 Latin square to achieve 8 observations per diet. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement including protein source, post-mixing processing, and their interaction as fixed effects. The lentil sample contained 32.3% starch, 24.4% CP, 9.3% total dietary fiber, and 1.7 mg/g of trypsin inhibitor activity on as is-basis. Interactions between dietary protein source and post-mixing processing were not observed. Feeding FM diets resulted in greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) AID of dry matter (<strong>DM</strong>), GE, and most AA, and ATTD of CP, but lower apparent hindgut fermentation of DM and GE than SBM diets. Extrusion increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the ATTD of GE and DE value of diets. The AID of CP and AA was 3.2 and 4.7%-units greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), respectively, for the extruded than mash diets. In conclusion, feeding FM diets resulted in greater ileal digestibility of DM, GE, and AA than SBM diets. Extrusion increased the AID of CP and most AA, and DE value of lentil-based diets containing either supplemental plant protein or animal-protein, indicating that extrusion can increase the energy and protein value of plant-based diets fed to pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"d43b6f729a424a18115855ae51555840d60d327f26461e5f1ba69087cc72469a","category":"Environment"}
