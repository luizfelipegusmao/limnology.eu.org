{"title":"Mode of carbon gain and fungal associations of Neuwiedia malipoensis within the evolutionarily early-diverging orchid subfamily Apostasioideae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/3/511/7697898?rss=1","date":1724284800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>The earliest-diverging orchid lineage, Apostasioideae, consists only of two genera: <span>Apostasia</span> and <span>Neuwiedia</span>. Previous reports of <span>Apostasia nipponica</span> indicated a symbiotic association with an ectomycorrhiza-forming Ceratobasidiaceae clade and partial utilization of fungal carbon during the adult stage. However, the trophic strategy of <span>Neuwiedia</span> throughout its development remains unidentified. To further improve our understanding of mycoheterotrophy in the Apostasioideae, this study focused on <span>Neuwiedia malipoensis</span> examining both the mycorrhizal association and the physiological ecology of this orchid species across various development stages.<div>Methods</div>We identified the major mycorrhizal fungi of <span>N. malipoensis</span> protocorm, leafy seedling and adult stages using molecular barcoding. To reveal nutritional resources utilized by <span>N. malipoensis</span>, we compared stable isotope natural abundances (<span>δ</span><sup>13</sup>C, <span>δ</span><sup>15</sup>N, <span>δ</span><sup>2</sup>H, <span>δ</span><sup>18</sup>O) of different developmental stages with those of autotrophic reference plants.<div>Key Results</div>Protocorms exhibited an association with saprotrophic Ceratobasidiaceae rather than ectomycorrhiza-forming Ceratobasidiaceae and the <sup>13</sup>C signature was characteristic of their fully mycoheterotrophic nutrition. Seedlings and adults were predominantly associated with saprotrophic fungi belonging to the Tulasnellaceae. While <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>2</sup>H stable isotope data revealed partial mycoheterotrophy of seedlings, it is unclear to what extent the fungal carbon supply is reduced in adult <span>N. malipoensis</span>. However, the <sup>15</sup>N enrichment of mature <span>N. malipoensis</span> suggests partially mycoheterotrophic nutrition. Our data indicated a transition in mycorrhizal partners during ontogenetic development with decreasing dependency of <span>N. malipoensis</span> on fungal nitrogen and carbon.<div>Conclusions</div>The divergence in mycorrhizal partners between <span>N. malipoensis</span> and <span>A. nipponica</span> indicates different resource acquisition strategies and allows various habitat options in the earliest-diverging orchid lineage, Apostasioideae. While <span>A. nipponica</span> relies on the heterotrophic carbon gain from its ectomycorrhizal fungal partner and thus on forest habitats, <span>N. malipoensis</span> rather relies on own photosynthetic carbon gain as an adult, allowing it to establish in habitats as widely distributed as those where <span>Rhizoctonia</span> fungi occur.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"9f0603a3cfe2517813031352ec27a678f660321a07776c34973682e87d53c7aa","category":"Environment"}
