{"title":"Simultaneous Estimation of P- and S-Wave Velocities by Integrated Inversion of Guided-P and Surface Wave Dispersion Curves","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10712-023-09814-8","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Compared with surface wave corresponding to the normal mode, which is widely studied, there is less research on guided-P wave corresponding to the leaking mode. Guided-P wave carries the dispersion information that can be used to construct the subsurface velocity structures. In this paper, to simultaneously estimate P-wave velocity (<span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{P}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span>) and S-wave velocity (<span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{S}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span>) structures, an integrated inversion method of guided-P and surface wave dispersion curves is proposed. Through the calculation of Jacobian matrix, the sensitivity of dispersion curves is quantitatively analyzed. It shows that the dispersion curves of guided-P and surface waves are, respectively, sensitive to the <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{P}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span> and <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{S}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span>. Synthetic model tests demonstrate the proposed integrated inversion method can estimate the <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{P}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span> and <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{S}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span> models accurately and effectively identify low-velocity interlayers. The integrated inversion method is also applied to the field seismic data acquired for oil and gas prospecting. The pseudo-2D <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{P}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span>, <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{S}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span> and Poissonâ€™s ratio inversion results are of significance for near-surface geological interpretation. The comparison with the result of first-arrival traveltime tomography further demonstrates the accuracy and practicality of the proposed integrated inversion method. Not only in the field of exploration seismic, the guided-P wave dispersion information can also be extracted from the earthquake seismic, engineering seismic and ambient noise. The proposed inversion method can exploit previously neglected guided-P wave to characterize the subsurface <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{P}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span> structures, showing broad and promising application prospects. This compensates for the inherent defect that the surface wave dispersion curve is mainly sensitive to the <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\({{v}}_{{S}}\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span> structure.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"fec4706a62b9b8ddd014d23612d2a8232aefe5470aa6f8c4a4e4a6b8cd28dbf3","category":"Environment"}
