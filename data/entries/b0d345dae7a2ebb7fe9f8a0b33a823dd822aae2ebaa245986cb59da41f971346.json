{"title":"Tunnel-Shaped Weathering Features in Soil Grains: Why 3D Imaging Must be Performed for Accurate Characterization and Interpretation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.251/7719780?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The evolution of the first plant dominated terrestrial ecosystems some âˆ¼450 million years ago [<a href=\"#ozae044.251-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.251-B2\">2</a>] had a profound effect on the soil development, shifts in fluvial sedimentary environments through diverse below-ground stabilization strategies [<a href=\"#ozae044.251-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.251-B4\">4</a>], and changes in global biogeochemical cycles, notably drawdown of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere [<a href=\"#ozae044.251-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.251-B6\">6</a>]. In some part these shifts were due to biologically mediated weathering of soil grains. Cryptogamic Ground Covers (CGCs) serve as modern analogous examples of these early plant ecosystems, and are composed of a varied assortment of bryophyte plants (liverworts, hornworts, mosses), fungi, cyanobacteria, lichens, and algae. Importantly, these can be studied to understand the nano-to-macro scale weathering processes that are occurring within CGCs, with a view to understanding better the processes that might have been occurring in the geologic past and that are missing from the sedimentological/fossil record. Some of these processes include nutrient acquisition from grains by symbiotic (and other) organisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi. Many features have been identified in modern examples, including direct interactions (e.g., tunnel formation due to biomechanical forcing and mining) and indirect interactions (e.g., biological secretions, exudates, and root- and soil gas- mediated dissolution) [<a href=\"#ozae044.251-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.251-B8\">8</a>]. However, the majority of these are from conventional 2D observations of thin sections using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and fail to consider the whole feature in 3D.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b0d345dae7a2ebb7fe9f8a0b33a823dd822aae2ebaa245986cb59da41f971346","category":"Environment"}
