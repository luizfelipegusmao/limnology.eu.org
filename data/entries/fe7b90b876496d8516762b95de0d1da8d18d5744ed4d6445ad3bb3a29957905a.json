{"title":"Crocosphaera watsonii – A widespread nitrogen‐fixing unicellular marine cyanobacterium","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13450?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Crocosphaera watsonii</i> is a unicellular N<sub>2</sub>-fixing (diazotrophic) cyanobacterium observed in tropical and subtropical oligotrophic oceans. As a diazotroph, it can be a source of bioavailable nitrogen (N) to the microbial community in N-limited environments, and this may fuel primary production in the regions where it occurs. <i>Crocosphaera watsonii</i> has been the subject of intense study, both in culture and in field populations. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the phylogenetic and physiological diversity of <i>C. watsonii</i>, its distribution, and its ecological niche. Analysis of the relationships among the individual <i>Crocosphaera</i> species and related free-living and symbiotic lineages of diazotrophs based on the <i>nif</i>H gene have shown that the <i>C. watsonii</i> group holds a basal position and that its sequence is more similar to <i>Rippkaea</i> and <i>Zehria</i> than to other <i>Crocosphaera</i> species. This finding warrants further scrutiny to determine if the placement is related to a horizontal gene transfer event. Here, the <i>nif</i>H UCYN-B gene copy number from a recent synthesis effort was used as a proxy for relative <i>C. watsonii</i> abundance to examine patterns of <i>C. watsonii</i> distribution as a function of environmental factors, like iron and phosphorus concentration, and complimented with a synthesis of <i>C. watsonii</i> physiology. Furthermore, we have summarized the current knowledge of <i>C. watsonii</i> with regards to N<sub>2</sub> fixation, photosynthesis, and quantitative modeling of physiology. Because N availability can limit primary production, <i>C. watsonii</i> is widely recognized for its importance to carbon and N cycling in ocean ecosystems, and we conclude this review by highlighting important topics for further research on this important species.</p>","author":"Takako Masuda, \nJan Mareš, \nTakuhei Shiozaki, \nKeisuke Inomura, \nAmane Fujiwara, \nOndřej Prášil","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"fe7b90b876496d8516762b95de0d1da8d18d5744ed4d6445ad3bb3a29957905a","category":"Environment"}
