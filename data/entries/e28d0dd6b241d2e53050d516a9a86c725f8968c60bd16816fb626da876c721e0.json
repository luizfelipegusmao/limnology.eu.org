{"title":"Amphiphilic Fluorescein Triazoles: Synthesis and Visible Light Catalysis in Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2001/v1","date":1721892310000,"content":"Triazole derivatives of fluorescein containing N,N-dimethylaminopropyl fragments and their ammonium salts were synthesized with yields of 74 - 85%. The resulting compounds exhibit fluorescent properties in the green region of the visible spectrum. The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) was estimated using a py-rene fluorescent probe corresponding to a range of 0.28 - 1.43 mM, and at concentrations above the CAC the compounds form stable aggregates ranging from 165 to 202 nm. A relative quantum yield of 5-24% has been calculated based on fluorescence and UV spectra. The best value is shown by a derivative containing a tetradecyl substituent. When studying the photocatalytic properties of synthesized compounds through the reaction between N-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and malonic ester, the mono-tetradecyl deriva-tive demonstrated the best results. According to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data, the conversion of the initial heterocycle reached 95%. Therefore, these resulting compounds have the potential to act as an effective photocatalysts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e28d0dd6b241d2e53050d516a9a86c725f8968c60bd16816fb626da876c721e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
