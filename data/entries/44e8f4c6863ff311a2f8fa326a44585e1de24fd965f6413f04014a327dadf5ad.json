{"title":"Fuzzy Analysis of Financial Risk Management Strategies for Sustainable Public-Private Partnership Infrastructure Projects in Ghana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1112/v2","date":1711419027000,"content":"Public-private partnership (PPP) is a prominent tool for sustainable infrastructure development. However, the positive contributions of PPPs towards attainment of sustainable, climate resilience and zero carbon infrastructure projects are hampered by poor financial risk management. This problem is more prevalent in developing countries like Ghana where private investment inflow has plummeted due to COVID-19 recession and poor project performance. Thus, this study aims at assessing the key financial risk management strategies in ensuring sustainable PPP infrastructure projects in Ghana. The study utilised primary data from PPP practitioners in Ghana solicited through survey questionnaires. Factor analysis, mean scores and fuzzy synthetic analysis are the data analysis techniques for this study. The results revealed sustainable and green funding models, effective cost reduction initiatives, competent team with committed leadership, and emerging technologies and regulations constitute the key strategies to manage financial risks of sustainable PPP infrastructure projects. Although, future studies must expand the scope of data gathering, the findings of the study enrichen the theoretical understanding of financial risks in sustainable investments in PPP infrastructures. Relevant remedies that will aid the development of practical financial risk management guidelines are provided in this study for PPP practitioners.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44e8f4c6863ff311a2f8fa326a44585e1de24fd965f6413f04014a327dadf5ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
