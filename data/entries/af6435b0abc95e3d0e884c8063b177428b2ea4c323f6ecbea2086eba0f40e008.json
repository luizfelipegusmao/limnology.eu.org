{"title":"Indexing serum and mucous biochemical parameters of endangered Chinese sturgeon Acipenser sinensis with implications for health assessment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15662?af=R","date":1712853919000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Chinese sturgeon (<i>Acipenser sinensis</i>) is a critically endangered aquatic fish. Health monitoring and welfare assessments are critical for the conservation of Chinese sturgeon. In this study, biochemical parameters of serum and skin mucus in Chinese sturgeon were examined to evaluate the potential biomarkers. Serum and mucous samples were obtained from Chinese sturgeon, and the levels of total protein (TP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), lactic acid (LD), acid phosphatase (ACP), lysozyme (LYZ), glucose (GLU), and cortisol were determined. The concentrations of ALT, AST, cortisol, and LYZ were significantly higher in the mucous group than those in the serum group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, the concentrations of ALP, ACP, LD, LDH, CK, and TP were significantly higher level in the serum group than those in the mucous group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the correlations between serum and mucous biochemical parameters were established. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between serum and skin mucous markers (ACP, cortisol, and LYZ). AST versus ALT in serum and mucus showed a significant positive correlation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A significant positive correlation was found between cortisol and CK in mucus (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Moreover, LD versus LDH in serum showed a significant but weak positive correlation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Principal component analysis revealed a complete separation between the serum and mucous groups, with the biomarkers that contributed the most being ALP, TP, ALT, and AST. This study provides baseline data and reference intervals for serum and mucous biochemical parameters in presumably healthy Chinese sturgeons. The current study has important implications for the development of conservation strategies and the conservation status of critically endangered species.</p>","author":"Jiehao Liu, \nFahim UllahKhan, \nShen Jin, \nYueping Zheng, \nJianan Xu, \nHouyong Fan, \nYouji Wang, \nMenghong Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"af6435b0abc95e3d0e884c8063b177428b2ea4c323f6ecbea2086eba0f40e008","category":"Environment"}
