{"title":"Instances of Safety-Related Advances on Hydrogen as Regards Its Gaseous Transport and Buffer Storage and Its Solid-State Storage☆","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0021/v1","date":1717462401000,"content":"In the ongoing transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies, advances are particularly expected regarding safe and cost-effective solutions. Publicising instances of such advances and emphasising safety considerations constitute the rationale for this communication. Knowing that high-strength steels can prove economically relevant for transporting hydrogen in pipelines by limiting the pipe wall thickness required to withstand high pressure, one advance relates to a bench designed for contributing to study the safety of the gaseous transport or renewable-energy-related buffer storage of hydrogen. That bench has been specifically implemented at technology readiness level TRL 6 for testing initially intact, damaged, or pre-notched DN 300/NPS 12, DN 600/NPS 24, and DN 900/NPS 36 pipe sections in order to provide data allowing for the possible validation of fully satisfactory predictive models in terms of hydrogen embrittlement and potential corollary ruin. The other advance relates to the reactivation of a previously fruitful applied research into mass solid-state hydrogen storage through a new public-private partnership. This latest development comes at a time when markets have started driving the hydrogen economy, bearing in mind that phase-change materials decisively allow levelling the heat transfers during the absorption/melting and solidification/desorption cycles and attaining an overall energy efficiency of up to 80% for MgH₂-based compacts doped with expanded natural graphite.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf30ee46499df955acaad65e5be2618ed80055777038e9e95bef709d3d41ea40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
