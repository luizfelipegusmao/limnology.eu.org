{"title":"Museum Genomics Reveals the Hybrid Origin of an Extinct Crater Lake Endemic","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/73/3/506/7643210?rss=1","date":1712707200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Crater lake fishes are common evolutionary model systems, with recent studies suggesting a key role for gene flow in promoting rapid adaptation and speciation. However, the study of these young lakes can be complicated by human-mediated extinctions. Museum genomics approaches integrating genetic data from recently extinct species are, therefore, critical to understanding the complex evolutionary histories of these fragile systems. Here, we examine the evolutionary history of an extinct Southern Hemisphere crater lake endemic, the rainbowfish <span>Melanotaenia eachamensis</span>. We undertook a comprehensive sampling of extant rainbowfish populations of the Atherton Tablelands of Australia alongside historical museum material to understand the evolutionary origins of the extinct crater lake population and the dynamics of gene flow across the ecoregion. The extinct crater lake species is genetically distinct from all other nearby populations due to historic introgression between 2 proximate riverine lineages, similar to other prominent crater lake speciation systems, but this historic gene flow has not been sufficient to induce a species flock. Our results suggest that museum genomics approaches can be successfully combined with extant sampling to unravel complex speciation dynamics involving recently extinct species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"00e4db62253e5e58c6efdf11886317e3b7a0f8db2ece814d74794999cb38173a","category":"Environment"}
