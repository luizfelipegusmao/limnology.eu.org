At the AMR class level, data showed similar trends at all WWTWs, showing that aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance was most abundant. AMR abundance differences were shown between municipalities, where Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (TMM) WWTWs showed overall higher abundance of AMR compared to Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM) WWTWs. Also, within each municipality, there were differing trends in AMR abundance. Notably, within TMM, certain AMR classes (macrolides and macrolides_streptogramin B) were in higher abundance at a WWTW serving an urban high-income area, while other AMR classes (aminoglycosides) were in higher abundance at a WWTW serving a semi-urban low income area. At the AMR gene level, all WWTWs samples showed the most abundance for the <i>sul1</i> gene (encoding sulfonamide resistance). Following this, the next 14 most abundant genes encoded resistance to sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines and beta-lactams. Notably, within TMM, some macrolide-encoding resistance genes (<i>mefC</i>, <i>msrE</i>, <i>mphG</i> and <i>mphE</i>) were in highest abundance at a WWTW serving an urban high-income area; while <i>sul1</i>, <i>sul2</i> and <i>tetC</i> genes were in highest abundance at a WWTW serving a semi-urban low income area. Differential abundance analysis of AMR genes at WWTWs, following stratification of data by season, showed some notable variance in six AMR genes, of which <i>bla</i><sub>KPC-2</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>KPC-34</sub> genes showed the highest prevalence of seasonal abundance differences when comparing data within a WWTW. The general trend was to see higher abundances of AMR genes in colder seasons, when comparing seasonal data within a WWTW. Our study investigated wastewater samples in only one province of South Africa, from WWTWs located within close proximity to one another. We would require a more widespread investigation at WWTWs distributed across all regions/provinces of South Africa, in order to describe a more comprehensive profile of AMR abundance across the country.","author":"Anthony M.
