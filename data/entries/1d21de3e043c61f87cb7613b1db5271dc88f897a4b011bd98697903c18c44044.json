{"title":"Investigation of Scaling and Materials Performance in Simulated Geothermal Brine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1802/v1","date":1727094853000,"content":"Geothermal energy generation faces challenges in efficiency, partly due to restrictions on reinjection temperatures caused by scaling issues. Therefore, developing strategies to prevent scaling is critical. This study aims to simulate the scaling tendencies and corrosion effects of geothermal fluids on various construction materials used in scaling reactor/retention tank systems. A range of materials, including carbon steel, austenitic stainless steel, duplex stainless steel, two proprietary two-part epoxy coatings, and thermally sprayed aluminium (TSA), were tested in a simulated geothermal brine. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory vessel designed to replicate the wall shear stress conditions expected in a scaling reactor. The tests revealed varying scaling tendencies among the materials, with minimal corrosion observed. The dominant scale formed was calcium carbonate, consistent with geochemical modelling. The findings suggest that despite the high operating temperatures, the risk of corrosion remains low due to the brine's low chloride content, while the wettability of materials after immersion may serve as a useful indicator for selecting those that promote scaling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d21de3e043c61f87cb7613b1db5271dc88f897a4b011bd98697903c18c44044","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
