{"title":"72 Environmental impacts associated with the removal of productivity enhancing technologies from three different post-weaning feed management strategies in Saskatchewan: A case study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/306/7757459?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The purpose of this research was to examine the use of productivity enhancing technologies (PETs) and post-weaning management on the environmental impacts of beef steers in western Canada. The PETs considered in the current study included ionophores (i.e., monensin, 33 ppm) and hormone implants (i.e., Ralgro, 36 mg zeranol). The production management systems considered were direct finishing (Heavy), confined backgrounding prior to finishing (Medium), and confined and pasture-based backgrounding prior to finishing (Light). The objectives were to model and compare environmental outcomes [greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions, land requirements and water use] using a whole-farm perspective and better understand the environmental footprint of the Canadian beef industry. Compared with natural steers, PETs led to a 10 to 13% reduction in GHG emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>e kgּ boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>), a 10 to 32% decrease in NH<sub>3</sub> emissions (kg NH<sub>3</sub>ּּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>), a 9 to 22% reduction in land use (haּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>) and 12 to 25% decrease in water (m<sup>3</sup>ּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>) use. Direct finishing compared with backgrounded, and 2-stage backgrounded steers reduced GHG by 32% and 39% kg CO<sub>2</sub>eּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>, NH<sub>3</sub> emissions by 36% and 52% kg NH<sub>3</sub>ּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>, land requirements by 25% and 73% haּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup> and water use by 18% and 51% m<sup>3</sup>ּ kg boneless beef<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Varying post-weaning strategies allows producers to value-add (additional weight through backgrounding) and maximize the use of available feed (grazing). The full environmental impacts of removal of PETs from Canadian beef production must consider a whole-systems approach including economic viability, ecosystem services, as well as consumer demand and social acceptance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0f10d9bdd24330889fc116944896cf544f3e8bd280695904ba018fec9e23ebcc","category":"Environment"}
