{"title":"Susceptibility status of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) to public health insecticides in Southern Afar Region, Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309335","date":1724421600000,"content":"<p>by Mohammed Seid, Esayas Aklilu, Abebe Animut</p>\r\n\r\nMosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever have been documented in Ethiopia since the 1960s. However, the efficacy of public health insecticides against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> that transmits these viruses remains poorly understood in the country, particularly in the Afar Region. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the susceptibility status of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> to deltamethrin, permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, pirimiphos-methyl, bendiocarb, and propoxur insecticides. Larvae and pupae of <i>Aedes</i> species were collected from Awash Arba, Awash Sebat, and Werer towns of the Afar Region of Ethiopia during July-October 2022, brought to the Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, insectary and reared to adults. Non-blood-fed, 3â€“5 days-old females <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> were exposed to pyrethroid, carbamate, and organophosphate insecticide impregnated papers in tube test following the standard guidelines. Knockdown rates were noted at 10 minutes interval until one hour. The mortality in mosquitoes was recorded 24 hours after 60 minutes of exposure. The mortality rates of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> exposed to propoxur were 87% in all the study towns. Similarly, 88% mortality in <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> was recorded when tested with bendiocarb in Awash Sebat and Awash Arba towns. Suspected resistance of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> (95% mortality) to alpha-cypermethrin was observed in Awash Arba town. However, <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> collected from all the three sites was observed to be susceptible to deltamethrin, permethrin, and pirimiphos-methyl. <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> was resistant to 0.1% bendiocarb and 0.1% propoxur and possibly resistant to 0.05% alpha-cypermethrin. On the other hand, it was susceptible to 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin, and 0.25% pirimiphos-methyl. Thus, vector control products with deltamethrin, permethrin, and pirimiphos-methyl can be used in the control of adult <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> in the Afar Region of Ethiopia. However, further studies should be carried out to evaluate the susceptibility status of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> to alpha-cypermethrin in the Awash Arba area.","author":"Mohammed Seid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a8ddfc1885bc4c90b6e236793424ac523eb083bf18840dfd1b3e14f16d85fbf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
