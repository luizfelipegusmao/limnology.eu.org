{"title":"An anthocyanin activation gene underlies the purple central flower pigmentation in wild carrot","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1147/7719071?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Many organisms have complex pigmentation patterns. However, how these patterns are formed remains largely unknown. In wild carrot (<span>Daucus carota</span> subsp. <span>carota</span>), which is also known as Queen Anne's lace, one or several purple central flowers occur in white umbels. Here, we investigated the unique central flower pigmentation pattern in wild carrot umbels. Using wild and cultivated carrot (<span>D. carota</span> subsp. <span>sativus</span> L.) accessions, transcriptome analysis, protein interaction, stable transformation, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout, an anthocyanin-activating R2R3-myeloblastosis (MYB) gene, <span>Purple Central Flower</span> (<span>DcPCF</span>), was identified as the causal gene that triggers only central flowers to possess the purple phenotype. The expression of <span>DcPCF</span> was only detected in tiny central flowers. We propose that the transition from purple to nonpurple flowers in the center of the umbel occurred after 3 separate adverse events: insertion of transposons in the promoter region, premature termination of the coding sequence (caused by a Câ€“T substitution in the open reading frame), and the emergence of unknown anthocyanin suppressors. These 3 events could have occurred either consecutively or independently. The intriguing purple central flower pattern and its underlying mechanism may provide evidence that it is a remnant of ancient conditions of the species, reflecting the original appearance of Umbelliferae (also called Apiaceae) when a single flower was present.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"40d2ec834b539f043aa755feb455a4e97e64fb7ad28b86625ad49fb793178918","category":"Environment"}
