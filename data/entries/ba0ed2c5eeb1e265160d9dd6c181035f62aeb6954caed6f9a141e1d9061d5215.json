{"title":"A Comprehensive Review of HER2 in Cancer Biology and Therapeutics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0515/v1","date":1717765145000,"content":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a targetable transmembrane glycoprotein receptor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Aberrant HER2 signaling is implicated in various cancers, particularly breast and Gastric cancer, where HER2 overexpression or amplification correlates with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Her2 activating mutations contribute to accelerated tumorigenesis and metastasis. This review provides an overview of HER2 biology, signaling pathways, mechanisms of dysregulation, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies targeting HER2 in cancer. Understanding the intricate details of HER2 regulation is essential for developing effective targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba0ed2c5eeb1e265160d9dd6c181035f62aeb6954caed6f9a141e1d9061d5215","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
