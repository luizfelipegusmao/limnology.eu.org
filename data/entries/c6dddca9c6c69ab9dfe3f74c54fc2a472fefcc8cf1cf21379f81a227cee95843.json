{"title":"Tuberculin skin test and Interferon-gamma release assay agreement, and associated factors with latent tuberculosis infection, in medical and nursing students in Bandung, Indonesia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299874","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Lika Apriani, Susan McAllister, Katrina Sharples, Isni Nurul Aini, Hanifah Nurhasanah, Dwi Febni Ratnaningsih, Agnes Rengga Indrati, Rovina Ruslami, Bachti Alisjahbana, Reinout van Crevel, Philip C. Hill</p>\r\nBackground <p>No gold standard diagnostic test exists for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The intra-dermal tuberculin skin test (TST) has known limitations and Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) have been developed as an alternative. We aimed to assess agreement between IGRA and TST, and risk factors for test positivity, in Indonesian healthcare students.</p> Methods <p>Medical and nursing students starting their clinical training were screened using IGRA and TST. Agreement between the two tests was measured using Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with test positivity.</p> Results <p>Of 266 students, 43 (16.2%) were IGRA positive and 85 (31.9%) TST positive. Agreement between the two tests was 74.7% (kappa 0.33, 95% CI 0.21–0.45, P&lt;0.0001). Students who had direct contact with family or friends with TB were less likely to be test positive using IGRA (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05–0.64) and using TST (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–0.99).</p> Conclusion <p>Test positivity for LTBI was lower when measured by IGRA than by TST, with poor agreement between the two tests. Known close TB contact was unexpectedly negatively associated with positivity by either test. Longitudinal studies may be required to help determine the best test for LTBI in healthcare students in Indonesia.</p>","author":"Lika Apriani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c6dddca9c6c69ab9dfe3f74c54fc2a472fefcc8cf1cf21379f81a227cee95843","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
