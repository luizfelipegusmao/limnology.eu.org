{"title":"The Importance of Vitamin K and the Vitamins K and D Combined for the Calcium Metabolism and Bone Health: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0766/v1","date":1718196070000,"content":"Abstract\n\nThe aim of the present review is to discuss the roles of vitamin K and vitamin K-dependent proteins, and the combined action of the vitamins K and D, for maintenance of bone health. The most relevant vitamin K-dependent proteins in this respect are osteocalcin and matrix Gla-protein (MGP). When carboxylated these proteins appear to have the ability to chelate and import calcium from the blood to the bone, thereby reducing the risk of osteoporosis. Carboxylated osteocalcin appears to contribute directly to bone quality and strength. Adequate vitamin K status is required for carboxylation of MGP and osteocalcin. In addition, vitamin K acts on bone metabolism by other mechanism, such as a ligand for the nuclear steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR). In this narrative review, we examine the evidence for increased bone mineralization through dietary adequacy of vitamin K (phylloquinone or menaquinone). Summarizing the evidence for a synergistic effect of vitamin K and vitamin D3 we find that an adequate supply of vitamin K on top of an optimal vitamin D status seems to add to the benefit for maintaining bone health. More research related to synergism and possible mechanisms of vitamins D3 and K interaction in bone health is needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93caae7ff795ce76a927ec234a71b3c7b3b75ca3e63fed300adee1b8167ae083","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
