{"title":"Differences of Energy Balance and GHG Emissions in Legume Intercropped Maize Agroecosystem as a Result of Climate Change","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1429/v1","date":1718940604000,"content":"Multicropping can solve the energy and GHG balance problems, but the emergence, development and productivity of such mixed crops are at risk due to uneven distribution of precipitation. For this reason, investigations were performed at the Experimental Station of Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuania. Single maize crop was compared with Crimson/red clover, Persian clover, and alfalfa intercropped maize cultivations. Results showed that under arid conditions, the intercrops biomass was about 4 times less than under humid. Humid conditions were less suitable for maize and when growing with intercrops they produced about 3-5 t ha-1 less dried biomass, and when growing sole - about 6 t ha-1 less biomass than in arid conditions. Due to the higher yield of maize biomass in arid season, better energy indicators of the crop were obtained in arid conditions than in humid. The difference between net energy was about 122-123 MJ ha-1 in all treatments, except for the maize crop with intercropped alfalfa, where the difference was 62 MJ ha-1. All tested technologies were environmentally friendly, CO2 equivalent varied between treatments from 804 to 884 kg ha-1. Uneven distribution of precipitation during vegetative season makes us think about the improvement of intercropping technologies. Sowing intercrops at the same time with maize could improve its germination but increase the problem of weed spread.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c57b475f9e23906e3a6829a632933cee8fe38451ab2518ab862b5808fb8110ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
