{"title":"Optimizing Multi-time Series Forecasting for Enhanced Cloud Resource Utilization Based on Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0616/v1","date":1725864206000,"content":"Due to its flexibility, cloud computing has become essential in modern operational schemes. However, the effective management of cloud resources to ensure cost-effectiveness and maintain high performance presents significant challenges. The pay-as-you-go pricing model, while convenient, can lead to escalated expenses and hinder long-term planning. Consequently, FinOps advocates proactive management strategies, with resource usage prediction emerging as a crucial optimization category. In this research, we introduce the multi-time series forecasting system (MSFS), a novel approach for data-driven resource optimization alongside the hybrid ensemble anomaly detection algorithm (HEADA). Our method prioritizes the concept-centric approach, focusing on factors such as prediction uncertainty, interpretability and domain-specific measures. Furthermore, we introduce the similarity-based time-series grouping (STG) method as a core component of MSFS for optimizing multi-time series forecasting, ensuring its scalability with the rapid growth of the cloud environment. The experiments performed demonstrate that our group-specific forecasting model (GSFM) approach enabled MSFS to achieve a significant cost","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0541df35e718d0906af48ecb5df585daa061f81fc29a95e57e5c22fa5e8c157","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
