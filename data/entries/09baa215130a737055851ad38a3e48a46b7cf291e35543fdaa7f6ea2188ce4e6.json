The system uti- lizes the MediaPipe face mesh model for facial landmark detection and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine the eye state. Results demonstrate high accuracy and responsiveness, indicating po- tential applications in driver drowsiness detection, human-computer interaction, and medical diagnostics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09baa215130a737055851ad38a3e48a46b7cf291e35543fdaa7f6ea2188ce4e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
