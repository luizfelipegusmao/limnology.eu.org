{"title":"The maternal embrace: the protection of plant embryos","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4210/7613627?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>All land plants—the embryophytes—produce multicellular embryos, as do other multicellular organisms, such as brown algae and animals. A unique characteristic of plant embryos is their immobile and confined nature. Their embedding in maternal tissues may offer protection from the environment, but also physically constrains development. Across the different land plants, a huge discrepancy is present between their reproductive structures whilst leading to similarly complex embryos. Therefore, we review the roles that maternal tissues play in the control of embryogenesis across land plants. These nurturing, constraining, and protective roles include both direct and indirect effects. In this review, we explore how the maternal surroundings affect embryogenesis and which chemical and mechanical barriers are in place. We regard these questions through the lens of evolution, and identify key questions for future research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0ef2cd86708fa53f9162051e49e25d60e47592504547e4307a37381c942859e9","category":"Environment"}
