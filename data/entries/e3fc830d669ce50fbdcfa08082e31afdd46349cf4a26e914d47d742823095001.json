{"title":"Evaluation of Sentinel-3 SYN VGT Products in Comparison to the SPOT/VEGETATION and PROBA-V Archives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0129/v1","date":1725325417000,"content":"Sentinel-3 synergy (SYN) VEGETATION (VGT) products were designed to provide continuity to SPOT/VEGETATION (SPOT VGT). In past years, important changes have been implemented in the SYN VGT processing baseline. Since the PROBA-V mission acted as a gap filler between SPOT VGT and Sentinel-3, and in principle a continuous series of data products from the combined data archives of SPOT VGT (1998 â€“ 2014), PROBA-V (2013-2020) and Sentinel-3 SYN VGT (from 2018 onwards) is available to users, consistency of Sentinel-3 SYN VGT with both the latest SPOT VGT (VGT-C3) and PROBA-V (PV-C2) archives is highly relevant. Spatio-temporal intercomparison of the combined time series of VGT-C3, PV-C2 and Sentinel-3 SYN VGT 10-day NDVI composite products with an external reference from LSA-SAF, and the intercomparison of Sentinel-3 SYN V10 products with a climatology of VGT-C3 resp. PV-C2 for 3 distinct periods with different levels of product quality have shown that the subsequent processing baseline updates have resulted in better quality products. It is therefore essential to reprocess the entire Sentinel-3 SYN VGT archive: a uniform data record of standard SPOT VGT, PROBA-V and Sentinel-3 SYN VGT products, spanning over 25 years, would provide valuable input for a wide range of applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3fc830d669ce50fbdcfa08082e31afdd46349cf4a26e914d47d742823095001","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
