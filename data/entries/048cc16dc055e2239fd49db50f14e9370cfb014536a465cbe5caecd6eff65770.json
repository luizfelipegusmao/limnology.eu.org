While it is generally accepted that most brain neurons are not replaced during an animal’s lifetime, little is known about the longevity of cells in somatic organs. Similarly, while the turnover of organelles and protein complexes has been studied at length using bulk mass spectrometry approaches, we lack the understanding on the spatial distribution of protein and organelle longevity in animal models and <span>in situ</span>. Because of their longevity, long-lived biological structures – whether a post-mitotic cells (i.e., neurons) or a long-lived protein (i.e., histones) - are more likely to accumulate age-related damage that compromises cell function. Therefore, there is a need to create microscopy methods to quantify cell or macromolecular turnover <span>in situ</span> at the single cell level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"048cc16dc055e2239fd49db50f14e9370cfb014536a465cbe5caecd6eff65770","category":"Environment"}
