Conservation Laws","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1030/v1","date":1728957052000,"content":"The paper provides analysis that the generation of the gyroscopic torque described by the vector multiplication is one-way inertial phenomenon. Respectively, vector multiplication is one-way equation from the type: If B times C is equal A, A is not equal B times C. Presumably, it affects the Conservation Laws.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa703060901a52605f8cac927595ea85560380e0e4d7baf7904b1f35086ebde5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
