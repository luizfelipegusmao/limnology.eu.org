{"title":"Conceptualizing an Interferometer with Multiple Beams Splitting and Multiple Interference","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1371/v2","date":1712583772000,"content":"This article proposes an interferometer which should in principle split further an initially split beam to yield new sets of beams, effectively multiplying the number of beams that can be subjected to detectable interference. It can be considered a modification to the Michelson interferometer that introduces additional arrays of beam splitters, mirrors and detectors. It is expected of the interferometer to provide us with a set or sets of data holding details of phase changes in multiple interference patterns detectable by multiple detectors, enabling comparative analysis of data for multiple interference patterns recorded from a single measurement or activity. The number of multiplied beams possible is not limited, as it only depends on the specific amount of beam splitters required for certain experiments and practicals. The interference of multiple beams may improve sensitivity and detection for instrumentation purposes. The use of multiplied beam interferometry may also extend to quantum computation, particularly in linear optical quantum computation scheme as it enable production of multiple coherent beams which may exhibit properties of entanglement, making it suitable for developing optical multi-qubit systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b78a0072e92df5ba9db0ea8350090d99f18653dd18a11760c2441e2386b453ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
