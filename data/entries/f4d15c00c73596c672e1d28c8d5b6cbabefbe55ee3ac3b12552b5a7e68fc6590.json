{"title":"Harnessing Magneto Hydrodynamic Propulsion: A Path Toward Sustainable Commercial Shipping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0165/v1","date":1727938937000,"content":"Magneto Hydrodynamic (MHD) propulsion presents an innovative and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional marine propulsion systems. By utilizing electromagnetic fields to generate thrust, MHD propulsion reduces both noise and air pollution, making it an appealing option for the future of commercial shipping. However, the widespread adoption of MHD technology has been limited by several significant challenges. High energy demands, particularly for generating the necessary magnetic fields, require advanced power sources such as nuclear reactors or large-scale batteries, which are impractical for most commercial vessels. Additionally, the cost of installing and maintaining the high-powered electromagnets and energy infrastructure remains prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, material durability is another concern, as system components such as electrodes are exposed to corrosion and wear due to their interaction with seawater and high electrical currents. By addressing these constraints, MHD propulsion has the potential to transform the commercial maritime industry, contributing to more sustainable and less polluting marine transportation. This paper explores the feasibility of overcoming these challenges through advancements in cost-effective energy efficient methods. We identify the primary limiting factor for the practical implementation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) propulsion systems as the magnetic field strength. Drawing comparisons with similar applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, we explore advancements in generating strong, homogenous magnetic fields over large volumes. Insights from these research areas provide a foundation for improving the scalability and efficiency of magnetic field generation in MHD systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4d15c00c73596c672e1d28c8d5b6cbabefbe55ee3ac3b12552b5a7e68fc6590","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
