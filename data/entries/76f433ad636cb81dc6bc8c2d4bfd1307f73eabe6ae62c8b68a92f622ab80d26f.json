Drawing inspiration from “biomimetic camouflage,” we isolated cell membranes (CMs) from human glioblastoma (T98G) cell lines via the extrusion method to facilitate homotypic glioma targeting. At an 8:1 mass ratio of ferric chloride hexahydrate to gallic acid (GA), the resulting iron (Fe)–GA nanoparticles (NPs) proved effective as a T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI contrast agent. T98G CM–coated Fe–GA NPs demonstrated improved homotypic glioma targeting, validated through Prussian blue staining and <i>in vitro</i> MRI. This biomimetic camouflage strategy holds promise for the development of targeted theranostic agents in a safe and effective manner.","author":"Yan Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"76f433ad636cb81dc6bc8c2d4bfd1307f73eabe6ae62c8b68a92f622ab80d26f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
