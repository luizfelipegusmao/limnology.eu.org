{"title":"450 Understanding communication barriers: Demographic variables and language needs in the interaction between English-speaking agriculture professionals and Spanish-speaking animal caretakers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/320/7757220?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study focused on assessing the language needs of English-speaking animal professionals in their interactions with the Hispanic/Spanish-speaking animal caretakers. A survey was administered to a target audience of non-Spanish speaking and bilingual animal professionals to identify communication gaps while interacting with Hispanic caretakers. The data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics, including ordinal regression analyses, to examine the impact of demographic variables on respondentsâ€™ answer choices. Results showed that English-speaking professionals struggled with written and oral communication, which differed compared with bi-lingual professionals (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, female professionals showed differences in their responses to statements regarding the aspects of the Spanish language deemed necessary for interacting with Hispanic animal caretakers, as well as the topics likely to be addressed when agriculture professionals communicate with animal caretakers (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Hispanic professionals demonstrated a significant inclination towards strong disagreement with respect to the major issues encountered when interacting with Hispanic animal caretakers, particularly in understanding written information provided by animal caretakers in Spanish. These findings indicate that there are communication gaps that need to be addressed to improve communication with on-farm Hispanic animal caretakers and consequently contribute to enhancing animal health, welfare, and production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"82f4470c06eb0ff35d1253d3dc3ff617adfd2fd4e614c6d1ab8661f8deb99990","category":"Environment"}
