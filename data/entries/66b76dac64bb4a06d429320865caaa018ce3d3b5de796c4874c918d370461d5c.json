{"title":"Public awareness of gastric cancer risk factors and screening behaviours in Shijiazhuang, China: A community-based survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311491","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Qian Wang, Xiao-Ci He, Lian-Xia Geng, Shu-Lin Jiang, Chuan-Jie Yang, Kai-Yue Xu, Shu-Fang Shen, Wen-Wen Cao, Wei Qi, Shu-Ping Zhao</p>\r\nBackground <p>Reducing exposure to risk factors and screening represent 2 major approaches to gastric cancer (GC) prevention, but public knowledge GC risk factors and screening behaviour remain unknown. We aimed to investigate public awareness of GC risk factors, adherence to screening, and barriers hindering screening practices in China.</p> Methods <p>This community-based household survey was conducted within Shijiazhuang, China, and 1490 residents were recruited through a multistage stratified cluster random sampling approach. A self-administered questionnaire was completed which consisted of three sections: demographics, awareness of GC risk factors, and personal screening behaviours. Factors associated with knowledge of risk factors and screening behaviours were evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis.</p> Results <p>The mean risk factor awareness score of 12 (7, 15) revealed insufficient knowledge in 51.1% of participants. Dietary lifestyle factors were better understood than physical activity and weight-related factors. Marital status (OR 1.967; 95% CI 1.415 to 2.734), higher income (OR 1.197; 95% CI 1.010 to 1.418), and a history of upper gastrointestinal problems (OR 0.048; 95% CI 1.002 to 1.311) were associated with higher awareness. Merely 21.5% underwent GC screening, with higher rates linked to older age (OR 1.642; 95% CI 1.418 to 1.902), higher education (OR 1.398; 95% CI 1.176 to 1.662), a history of upper gastrointestinal problems (OR 3.842; 95% CI 2.833 to 5.209), and moderate (OR 2.077; 95% CI 1.352 to 3.191) and high (OR 2.529; 95% CI 1.311 to 4.878) perceived GC risk. Notably, participants commonly refused gastroscopy due to the absence of symptoms or signs.</p> Conclusions <p>In Shijiazhuang, more than half of participants demonstrated inadequate knowledge of GC risk factors, and screening participation rates were remarkably low. This emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance GC awareness and significantly improve screening rates.</p>","author":"Qian Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"66b76dac64bb4a06d429320865caaa018ce3d3b5de796c4874c918d370461d5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
