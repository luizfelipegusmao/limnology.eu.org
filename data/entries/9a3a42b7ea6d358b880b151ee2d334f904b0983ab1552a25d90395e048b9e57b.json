{"title":"Navigating The Proteomic Landscape of Menopause: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0652/v1","date":1723423633000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Proteomics encompasses the exploration of protein composition, regulation, function, and pathways. Its influence spans diverse clinical fields and holds promise in addressing various womenâ€™s health conditions, including cancers, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disorders. However, no comprehensive summary of proteomics and menopausal health exists. Our objective was to summarize proteomic profiles associated with diseases and disorders in peri and postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane database, Elsevier, and ScienceDirect until 2022. A total of 253 studies were identified, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria to identify data of interest. These included study design, disease, and proteomics/proteins of significance as described by the authors. Results: The 41 studies, covered diverse areas including bone disorders (10 studies), cardiovascular diseases (5 studies), oncological malignancies (10 studies), and conditions such as obesity, nonalcoholic liver disease, the effects of hormone replacement therapy, and neurological diseases (16 studies). Results of our study indicate that proteomic profiles correlate with heart disease in peri- and postmenopausal women, with distinct sex differences. Furthermore, proteomic profiles significantly differed between women with and without osteoporosis. Additionally, patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer exhibited notable variations in proteomic profiles compared to those without these conditions. Conclusions: Proteomics has the potential to enhance risk assessment and disease monitoring in peri- and postmenopausal women. By analyzing unique protein profiles, clinicians can identify individuals with heightened susceptibility to specific diseases or those already affected by established conditions. This review suggests that there is sufficient preliminary data for proteomics in peri- and postmenopausal women for early identification of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cancers, in disease monitoring, and in tailoring individualized therapies. Rigorous validation studies involving large populations are essential before drawing definitive conclusions regarding the clinical applicability of proteomic findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a3a42b7ea6d358b880b151ee2d334f904b0983ab1552a25d90395e048b9e57b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
