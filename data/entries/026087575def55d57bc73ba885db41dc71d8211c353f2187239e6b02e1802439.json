{"title":"A droplet digital PCR assay to detect Chinese rice‐field eels rhabdovirus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14020?af=R","date":1726483546000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Chinese rice-field eels rhabdovirus (CrERV) causes haemorrhagic disease in Chinese rice-field eels (<i>Monopterus albus</i>), leading to significant mortality and economic losses. Sensitive detection of CrERV nucleic acids is essential to control the spread of this pathogen and to treat infected individuals. Herein, we developed an efficient and sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method to rapidly detect and quantify CrERV. The ddPCR assay optimal conditions were an annealing temperature of 53°C, and primer and probe concentrations of 0.5 and 0.25 μM, respectively. The assay had a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.23 copies/μL, and was highly specific, showing no cross reactivity with other viruses (infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus, grass carp reovirus, spring viremia of carp virus, largemouth bass ranavirus, carp edema virus, Chinese giant salamander iridovirus, and white spot syndrome virus). Real-time quantitative PCR testing of 30 Chinese rice-field eels samples detected CrERV in 7 samples (23.3%), whereas ddPCR detected CrERV in 12 samples (40%), demonstrating its higher sensitivity. Thus, ddPCR represents an advanced method to absolutely quantify CrERV in infected fish with low virus concentrations, providing a valuable tool to manage the spread and impact of CrERV.</p>","author":"Wenzhi Liu, \nYong Zhou, \nNan Jiang, \nChen Xu, \nQiwang Zhong, \nYuding Fan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"026087575def55d57bc73ba885db41dc71d8211c353f2187239e6b02e1802439","category":"Environment"}
