{"title":"Synergistic Enhancement in the Mulberry Juice&rsquo;s Antioxidant Activity by Using Lactic Acid Bacteria Co-culture Fermentation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1734/v1","date":1721662283000,"content":"Studying the multi-function bacterial implications on the natural phytochemicals could be among the best solutions for producing clean-label functional juices. This study aimed to develop a high-quality mulberry juice with enhanced antioxidant capacity through fermentation. The juice was fermented using mono- and co-cultures of Lactobacillus casei (LC), L. plantarum (LP), L. paracasei (LPC), L. acidophilus (LA), and L. helveticus (LH) at different time intervals (24, 48, 72, and 96 h). The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonols, anthocyanins, and proan-thocyanidins were determined, along with the antioxidant activity assays and FTIR analysis. The results revealed significant changes in molecular interactions and functional group presence post-fermentation, indicating microbial incorporation's effect on the juice's functional profile. These changes were attributed to the formation of new compounds during fermentation, such as organic acids, alcohols, glycerol, and phenols, as evidenced by the FTIR spectra. Besides, LC-LA and LC-LPC co-culture treatments yield the most substantial stability in TPC, TFC, and TF after 48 h compared to 24 h and 72 h. After 48 h, the co-cultures of LPC-LH (1265.5 GAE/L) and LPC-LA (1145 GAE/L) were increased the TPC after 48 h than the single cultures. Conclusively, LC-LPC and LP-LPC co-culture fermentation was recommended as a cost-effective method to enhance the an-tioxidant potential and the overall phytochemical capacity of mulberry products. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential of fermented mulberry juice as a functional food with improved health benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15c5dc1e54613f1921915d8ff9997ee4f9c4861bde6d3b7df6ea6e9a3dd8c3c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
