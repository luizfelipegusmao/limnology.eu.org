{"title":"Apixaban plasma concentrations before and after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308022","date":1722434400000,"content":"<p>by Rachel Aakerøy, Jan Pål Loennechen, Roar Dyrkorn, Stian Lydersen, Arne Helland, Olav Spigset</p>\r\nBackground <p>Catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation is associated with a transient increase in thromboembolic risk and adequate anticoagulation is highly important. When patients are anticoagulated with apixaban, monitoring of plasma concentrations of the drug is not routinely performed. This study aimed to assess the influence of clinical patient characteristics, concomitant drug treatment and self-reported adherence on apixaban concentrations, and to describe the intra- and inter-individual variability in apixaban concentrations in this group of patients.MethodApixaban concentrations from 141 patients were measured in plasma one week before ablation and two, six and ten weeks after ablation, employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In samples not obtained at trough, apixaban concentrations were adjusted to trough levels. Self-reported adherence was registered by means of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale before and after ablation.</p> Results <p>There were statistically significant, positive correlations between apixaban concentrations and increased age, female sex, lower glomerular filtration rate, higher CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score, use of cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inhibitors, and use of amiodarone. Self-reported adherence was generally high. The mean intra-individual and inter-individual coefficients of variation were 29% and 49%, respectively.</p> Conclusion <p>In patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, age, sex, renal function, interacting drugs and cerebrovascular risk profile were all associated with altered plasma apixaban concentration. In this group of patients with a generally high self-reported adherence, intra-individual variability was modest, but the inter-individual variability was substantial, and similar to those previously reported in other patient apixaban-treated populations. If a therapeutic concentration range is established, there might be a need for a more flexible approach to apixaban dosing, guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.</p>","author":"Rachel Aakerøy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"91266fc95ef8febce07c29aa62ed1465baa3191cce36f897a7ef2b983f646d73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
