{"title":"6&prime;-Sialyllactose Enhances Exercise Performance via Increased Muscle Mass and Strength","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1823/v1","date":1721781623000,"content":"Sialyllactose (SL) is a functional human milk oligosaccharide essential for immune support, \nbrain development, intestinal maturation, and antiviral defense. However, despite its \nestablished health benefits, the effect of SL on exercise performance and muscle mass in mice \nremains unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, the effects of 6′-SL on \nmuscle functions. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were administered 100 mg/kg 6′-SL\nfor 12 weeks, after which exhaustive treadmill performance, muscle strength, and muscle \nphenotype were examined. The administration of 6′-SL significantly improved exhaustive \ntreadmill performance metrics, including distance and exhaustion time. Grip strength was also \nincreased by 6′-SL administration. Additionally, 6′-SL increased muscle mass in both the \ngastrocnemius (GAS) and soleus. 6′-SL administration led to an increase in the minimum \nFeret’s diameter and the protein expression of total myosin heavy chain in the GAS muscle. In \nconclusion, 6′-SL administration in vivo led to increased running distance and time by\nincreasing muscle mass and strength. These findings collectively indicate that 6′-SL is a \npotential agent for improving muscle health and exercise performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7dbd7633dbcf76dfb945b95cd08eb1975ba7f1e11eac8f51a61d78d0579620e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
