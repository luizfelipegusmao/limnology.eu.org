{"title":"Arabidopsis class A S-acyl transferases modify the pollen receptors LIP1 and PRK1 to regulate pollen tube guidance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3419/7651147?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Protein <span>S</span>-acylation catalyzed by protein <span>S</span>-acyl transferases (PATs) is a reversible lipid modification regulating protein targeting, stability, and interaction profiles. PATs are encoded by large gene families in plants, and many proteins including receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are subject to <span>S</span>-acylation. However, few PATs have been assigned substrates, and few <span>S</span>-acylated proteins have known upstream enzymes. We report that Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) class A PATs redundantly mediate pollen tube guidance and participate in the <span>S</span>-acylation of POLLEN RECEPTOR KINASE1 (PRK1) and LOST IN POLLEN TUBE GUIDANCE1 (LIP1), a critical RLK or RLCK for pollen tube guidance, respectively. <span>PAT1</span>, <span>PAT2</span>, <span>PAT3</span>, <span>PAT4</span>, and <span>PAT8</span>, collectively named <span>PENTAPAT</span> for simplicity, are enriched in pollen and show similar subcellular distribution. Functional loss of <span>PENTAPAT</span> reduces seed set due to male gametophytic defects. Specifically, <span>pentapat</span> pollen tubes are compromised in directional growth. We determine that PRK1 and LIP1 interact with PENTAPAT, and their <span>S</span>-acylation is reduced in <span>pentapat</span> pollen. The plasma membrane (PM) association of LIP1 is reduced in <span>pentapat</span> pollen, whereas point mutations reducing PRK1 <span>S</span>-acylation affect its affinity with its interacting proteins. Our results suggest a key role of <span>S</span>-acylation in pollen tube guidance through modulating PM receptor complexes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"95c7c9099016329aa9bd7006ccf9bddb47674566009968c9951a7b1db262957c","category":"Environment"}
