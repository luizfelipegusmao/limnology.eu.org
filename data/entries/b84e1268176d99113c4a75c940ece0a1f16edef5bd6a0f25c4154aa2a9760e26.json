The study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary short- and medium-chain fatty acid monoglyceride and cinnamaldehyde (SMMG) on the growth performance, survival, immune responses, and tolerance to hypoxic stress of Pacific white shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>). In Experiment 1, shrimp post-larvae were divided into 4 groups with 6 replicates and fed with diets supplemented with 0 (control), 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5% diet for 30 days. The final body weight and survival rate were determined. In Experiment 2, the juvenile shrimp from Experiment 1 were subjected to hypoxic stress conditions (dissolved oxygen level 2–2.5 mg/L) for 14 days, then the specific growth rate (SGR), survival rate, intestinal <i>Vibrio</i> spp. count, immune responses, and histopathological change of the hepatopancreas were analyzed. Following the 30-day feeding trial, the results revealed that the final body weight and survival of the 0.3–0.5% SMMG groups (2.81–3.06 g and 74.00–84.33%, respectively) were significantly higher than the control shrimp (1.96 g and 68.33%, respectively). In the hypoxic stress experiment, the survival rates of shrimp fed 0.4–0.5% SMMG (71.67–80.00%) were significantly higher than the control (51.67%). Although the SGR were not affected by SMMG supplementation, all immune parameters evaluated were significantly enhanced, and the intestinal <i>Vibrio</i> spp. counts were significantly decreased in the 0.4–0.5% SMMG-fed shrimp; the histopathological structure of the hepatopancreas was also improved in these shrimp compared to the control. Our findings indicated that SMMG as a feed additive has beneficial effects in improving shrimp health and increasing tolerance to hypoxic conditions.","author":"Tirawat Rairat","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b84e1268176d99113c4a75c940ece0a1f16edef5bd6a0f25c4154aa2a9760e26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
