{"title":"2 Another renaissance for bile acid gastrointestinal microbiology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/199/7664866?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The field of bile acid microbiology in the gastrointestinal tract is going through a current rebirth after a peak of activity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This renewed activity is a result of many factors including the discovery near the turn of the century that bile acids are potent signaling molecules, technological advances in next generation sequencing, computation, culturomics, gnotobiology, and metabolomics. The current state of the field with particular emphasis on questions that have remained unanswered for many decades in both bile acid synthesis by the host, and metabolism by the gut microbiota will be addressed. Current knowledge of established enzymatic pathways including bile salt hydrolase, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases involved in the oxidation and epimerization of bile acid hydroxy groups, the Hylemon-Bj”ßrkhem Pathway (HBP) of bile acid C7-dehydroxylation, and the formation of secondary allo-bile acids are described. Aspects of bile acid conjugation and esterification, and evidence for bile acid C3- and C12-dehydroxylation that are less well understood, but potentially critical for our understanding of bile acid metabolism in the human gut will be covered. The physiological consequences of bile acid metabolism for human health, important caveats and cautionary notes on experimental design and interpretation of bile acid metabolism are also explored.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e561d6ea7e5739f4ccb6feec818714a0e82f43486caf6f13bc553964f08938c6","category":"Environment"}
