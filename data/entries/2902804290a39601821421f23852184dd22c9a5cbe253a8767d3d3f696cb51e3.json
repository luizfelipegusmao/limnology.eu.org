{"title":"Nutritional status, dietary habits, and their relation to cognitive functions: A cross-sectional study among the school aged (8–14 years) children of Bangladesh","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304363","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Mowshomi Mannan Liza, Simanta Roy, Mohammad Azmain Iktidar, Sreshtha Chowdhury, Azaz Bin Sharif</p>\r\nBackground <p>Limited research addressed links between nutritional status, dietary habits, and cognitive functions in young children. This study assessed the status of cognitive functions and their association with nutritional status and dietary habits of school age children of Bangladesh.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional multi-centre study was conducted on 776 participants in 11 conveniently selected educational institutions. A printed questionnaire with three sections (Section 1: background information, section 2: PedsQL™ Cognitive Functioning Scale, and section 3: semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire) was utilized for the data collection purpose. Sections 1 and 3 were self-reported by parents, and trained volunteers completed section 2 in-person along with the anthropometric measurements. Statistical analyses were done in Stata (v.16). Mean with standard deviation and frequencies with percentages were used to summarize quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively. Pearson’s chi-square test and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were used to explore bivariate relationships.</p> Results <p>The mean age of the participants was 12.02±1.88 years, and the majority (67%) were females. The prevalence of poor cognitive function was 46.52%, and among them, 66.02% were females. In terms of body mass index (BMI), 22.44% possessed normal weight, 17.51% were overweight, and 5.19% were obese. This study found a statistically significant relationship between BMI and cognitive functions. Furthermore, different dietary components (e.g., protein, carbohydrate, fat, fiber, iron, magnesium) showed a significant (p&lt;0.05 for all) weak positive correlation with cognitive function.</p> Conclusion <p>BMI and dietary habits were associated with the cognitive function of young children in Bangladesh. Although the cross-sectional design of the study precludes causal relationships from being determined, the study finding deserves further examination via longitudinal research.</p>","author":"Mowshomi Mannan Liza","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2902804290a39601821421f23852184dd22c9a5cbe253a8767d3d3f696cb51e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
