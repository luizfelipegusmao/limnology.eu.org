{"title":"Baicalein targets STMN1 to inhibit the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma via regulating the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24173?af=R","date":1707201644000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a common malignancy in the head and neck. Baicalein has been reported to exert the anticancer effects on various cancers. In this study, our aim was to explore the function of baicalein in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and further investigate the potential underlying mechanisms.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay, EdU assay, sphere formation assay, flow cytometry, and transwell invasion assay were conducted to determine cell proliferation, stemness, apoptosis, and invasion, respectively. Western blot was performed to examine the protein levels of PCNA, MMP9, STMN1, β-catenin, and Wnt3A. The mRNA level of STMN1 was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Xenograft tumor model was carried out to evaluate the effects of baicalein on tumor growth in vivo. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was used to detect the levels of PCNA, MMP9, and STMN1 in tumor tissues from mice.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Baicalein significantly induced cell apoptosis and impeded cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. STMN1 was highly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and baicalein could directly downregulate STMN1 expression. STMN1 knockdown hampered the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Moreover, the effects of baicalein on cell proliferation, stemness, invasion, and apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells were harbored by STMN1 overexpression. Baicalein regulated STMN1 to inhibit the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. SKL2001, an agonist of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, could reverse the effects of STMN1 knockdown on the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In addition, baicalein markedly impeded tumor growth in vivo.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Baicalein regulated the STMN1/Wnt/β-catenin pathway to restrain the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</p>","author":"Zheng Li, \nXiaohang Cai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"43406bc5ce4793b9f112ec77fc5ec940206bdfc5b9615c64125aa4cc1857c452","category":"Environment"}
