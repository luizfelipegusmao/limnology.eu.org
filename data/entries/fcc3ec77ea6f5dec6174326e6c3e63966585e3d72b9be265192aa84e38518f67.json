{"title":"Dorsoventrally asymmetric expression of miR319/TCP generates dorsal-specific venation patterning in petunia corolla tube","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3401/7630452?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Vein-associated pigmentation (venation) is a type of floral coloration adopted by plants to attract pollinators. Several petunia (<span>Petunia hybrida</span>) lines generate dorsoventrally asymmetric venation patterning of the corolla tube, in which venation is only present in the dorsal tube. The molecular mechanism underlying this trait is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that <span>miR319</span> is preferentially expressed in the dorsal corolla tube, leading to dorsoventrally asymmetric expression of its target genes. Transgenic lines overexpressing <span>phy-miR319a</span> generated uniform venation patterning of the corolla tube. Knockout of TCP genes targeted by <span>miR319</span> promoted venation patterning in the ventral and dorsal tube, while overexpression of the <span>miR319</span> target gene, <span>PhTCP6</span>, completely inhibited corolla tube venation patterning. In addition, <span>miR319</span>-targeted TCPs negatively regulated venation patterning, probably by repressing the regulator of venation patterning, <span>AN4</span>. Together, our data demonstrate that asymmetric expression of <span>miR319</span> promotes venation patterning in the petunia dorsal tube alone by repressing the expression of its target TCP genes, which negatively regulate corolla tube venation patterning. These findings provide novel insights into how the dorsoventrally asymmetric distribution of venation patterning is established in zygomorphic flowers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"fcc3ec77ea6f5dec6174326e6c3e63966585e3d72b9be265192aa84e38518f67","category":"Environment"}
