{"title":"Birds that breed exclusively on islands have smaller clutches","link":"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/doi/10.1093/ornithology/ukae005/7589543?rss=1","date":1706140800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The “island syndrome” refers to similarity in the biology of island organisms, but its generality is questionable, as the scope of species and traits examined are often limited. Here, I show that birds breeding exclusively on islands (breeding island endemics) evolved smaller clutches, using a dataset of 4,530 bird species. Using an inclusive definition of a breeding island endemic, which also encompasses migratory species and seabirds, I examine the evolution of clutch sizes in island breeding species using phylogenetic generalized linear models. Across disparate phylogenetic hypotheses, and after accounting for biological and geographical co-variables, I show that breeding island endemic landbirds (470 species) evolved smaller clutch sizes than continental breeding species (3,818 species). I show that the evolution of clutch size follows the expectations of the island syndrome, as among breeding island endemic landbirds there is a positive relationship between clutch size and breeding range area. Finally, I reinforce the view that the island syndrome is a general pattern in birds, spanning diverse phylogenetic and ecological groups, by showing that in a seabird-only dataset (242 species), breeding island endemic seabirds show evolution of smaller clutch sizes. In a model of the full dataset of both landbirds and seabirds (4,530 species) there was no evidence of an interaction of being a seabird with breeding island endemicity, showing that seabirds and landbirds respond in the same way. This study, using more than 40% of all bird species, provides the first evidence of a general evolutionary response in a life history trait, clearly showing the island syndrome as a general evolutionary tendency associated with island environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithology Current Issue","siteHash":"4b42e15d9ceec568e037973cb16bc8a0448c103c6eaf3f714117d3650f8eefe7","entryHash":"abc7050d6c90c5e5b26f8d23c1922c21c53fa342a9f07a68c746e591043a0779","category":"Environment"}
