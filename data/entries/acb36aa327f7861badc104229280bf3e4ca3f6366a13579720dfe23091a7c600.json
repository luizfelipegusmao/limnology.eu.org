{"title":"Construction finishes Materials and Innovations in the Global South","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1523/v1","date":1724298914000,"content":"Health resorts aim to create health sanctuaries, fostering an environment conducive to treatment, healing, and well-being. Material selection choices for health resort designers should comply with specific minimal requirements and criteria to provide a suitable atmosphere for health and wellness. Based on this assumption and some selection criteria, the study intended to analyse purposefully selected health resorts as the foundation for identifying acceptable materials to construct health resorts. This study had three main goals: to define the evaluated health resortsâ€™ physical characteristics, determine their external works specifications, and investigate the material usage utilised in the interior of three primary functional spaces. We employed a case study approach as the qualitative research method.Top of Form Data was analysed using narrative and content analysis. According to the findings, natural materials, particularly those produced locally, are best suited for the outside and interior of health resort buildings. Wood is the most commonly used material, appearing in all instances studied. The findings are consistent with current worldwide trends toward environmentally friendly facilities. Adopting natural materials such as wood, stone, and soil for health resort planning would be practical, considering the health advantages of such environmentally friendly materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acb36aa327f7861badc104229280bf3e4ca3f6366a13579720dfe23091a7c600","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
