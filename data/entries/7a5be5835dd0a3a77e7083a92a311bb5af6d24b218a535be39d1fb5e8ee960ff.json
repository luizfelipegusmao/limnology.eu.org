{"title":"Planck Quantized General Relativity Theory Written on Different Forms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1675/v2","date":1716801913000,"content":"This paper is a brief review of our work on the Planck quantized version of general rela- tivity theory. It demonstrates several straightforward methods to rewrite the same equations that we have already presented in other papers. We also explore a relatively new general relativity-inspired field equation based on the original Newtonian mass, which is very differ- ent from today’s kilogram mass. Additionally, we examine two other field equations based on collision space-time, where both energy and matter can be described simply as space and time. We are thereby fulfilling Einstein’s dream of a theory where energy and mass are not needed, or are just aspects of space and time. If this is extended beyond the 4-dimensional space-time formalism of general relativity theory to a 6-dimensional framework—with 3 space dimensions and 3 time dimensions—this ultimately reveals that they are two sides of the same coin. In reality, it is a three-dimensional space-time theory, where space and time are just two sides of the same coin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a5be5835dd0a3a77e7083a92a311bb5af6d24b218a535be39d1fb5e8ee960ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
