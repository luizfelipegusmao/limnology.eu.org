{"title":"Numerical Approach on Collatz Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1570/v2","date":1714728129000,"content":"We can analyze the properties of the Collatz Conjecture by using Terras’ Theorem, and computational graphical calculations. To do this, we introduce the concept of “tree\" which shows the relationship between the input and output positive integers of the Collatz process. This approach offers a novel way for determining the non-existence of loops and diverge trees through computer simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"797e696e040abccfea182fb8322de83c6340b15199fde09decd2ea9e69313977","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
