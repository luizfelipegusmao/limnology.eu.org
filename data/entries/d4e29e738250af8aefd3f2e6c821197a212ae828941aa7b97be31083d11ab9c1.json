Due to the reduced Coulomb screening at atomic thicknesses, TMD optical properties are extremely sensitive to their local dielectric environment. This contributes detrimentally to the exciton linewidth due to inhomogeneous broadening [<a href=\"#ozae044.734-B1\">1</a>], but also provides opportunities for tuning the electronic gap and exciton binding energy [<a href=\"#ozae044.734-B2\">2</a>] or neutralization of charged exciton emission [<a href=\"#ozae044.734-B3\">3</a>] as demonstrated previously with graphene. Obtaining exciton linewidths towards the homogeneous limit for TMD monolayers in both optical absorption and emission (by photoluminescence) has been made possible by encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (<span>h</span>-BN).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d4e29e738250af8aefd3f2e6c821197a212ae828941aa7b97be31083d11ab9c1","category":"Environment"}
