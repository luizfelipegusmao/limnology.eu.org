{"title":"An Immunoinformatics Approach for Identifying and Designing Conserved Multi-Epitope Vaccines for Coronaviruses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0239/v1","date":1725379692000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has exposed the vulnerabilities and unpreparedness of the global healthcare system in dealing with emerging zoonoses. In the past two decades, coronaviruses (CoV) have been responsible for three major viral outbreaks, and the likelihood of future outbreaks caused by these viruses is high and nearly inevitable. Therefore, effective prophylactic universal vaccines targeting multiple circulating and emerging coronavirus strains are warranted. This study utilized an immunoinformatic approach to identify evolutionarily conserved CD4+ (HTL) and CD8+ (CTL) T cells, and B-cell epitopes in the coronaviral spike (S) glycoprotein. A total of 132 epitopes were identified, with the majority of them found conserved in the bat CoV, pangolins CoV, endemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Their peptide sequences were then aligned and assembled to identify the overlapping regions. Eventually, two major peptide assemblies were derived based on their promising immune-stimulating properties. In this light, they can serve as lead candidates for universal coronavirus vaccine development, particularly in the search for pan-coronavirus multi-epitope universal vaccines that can confer protection against current and novel coronaviruses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc2322c12873299377f71ce9b0f8d49119594e5d6cf1bc390766c1b796483a51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
