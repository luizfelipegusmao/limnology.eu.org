{"title":"Comparative plasma biochemistry analyte data in nesting leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), foraging green (Chelonia mydas) and foraging and nesting hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles in Grenada, West Indies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae028/7675710?rss=1","date":1715904000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Blood biochemistry represents a minimally invasive tool for monitoring sea turtle health, assessing injured sea turtles and supporting conservation strategies. In Grenada, West Indies, plasma biochemical variables were examined in 33 nesting leatherback (<span>Dermochelys coriacea</span>), 49 foraging green (<span>Chelonia mydas</span>), 49 foraging hawksbill (<span>Eretmochelys imbricata</span>) and 12 nesting hawksbill sea turtles sampled between 2017 and 2022. Plasma biochemistry reference intervals are described herein except for nesting hawksbills, which are represented by descriptive statistics due to the low sample size. Select analyte concentrations were positively correlated with curved carapace length in leatherbacks (chloride), green turtles (total protein, albumin and globulin) and foraging hawksbills (total protein, albumin and phosphorus). Cholesterol (7.8 mmol/l ± 1.6 SD) and triglyceride (6.9 mmol/l ± 1.9 SD) concentrations were significantly higher in leatherbacks compared to foraging green turtles, foraging hawksbills and nesting hawksbills (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001 for all). Cholesterol was significantly higher in nesting hawksbills compared to foraging green turtles (<span>P</span> = 0.050) and foraging hawksbills (<span>P</span> = 0.050). Foraging hawksbills demonstrated significantly higher aspartate transaminase activities than leatherbacks (<span>P</span> = 0.002), green turtles (<span>P</span> = 0.009) and nesting hawksbills (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Biochemical results provide baseline population health data and support guidance for treatments during clinical sea turtle rehabilitation efforts. They also provide insight into species-specific physiologic differences and preludes further studies to better characterize the impacts of life-stage class on biochemistry reference intervals to better support wild sea turtle populations in Grenada.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"1d213ceab8f11b7b306db30f24b2cf61332a7d62c473adfc00ba0a6f76825dc5","category":"Environment"}
