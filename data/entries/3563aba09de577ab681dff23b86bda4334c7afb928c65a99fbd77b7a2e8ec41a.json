{"title":"Proximate Composition of Pretreated Cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) Flour in Relation to Milling Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1775/v1","date":1716812794000,"content":"Cocoyam is a highly nutritious root crop and very promising with vast industrial potentials. The effect of some processing methods on the proximate composition of cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) flour was investigated by subjecting the cormels to three pre-treatment methods (soaking, fermentation and steaming) and subsequently, to two different milling methods (wet and dry-milling methods). The proximate composition namely moisture content, crude protein, crude fat, fibre, ash and carbohydrate contents of the flours obtained was carried out. The fermented samples of the wet- and dry-milled flours retained the highest nutrients compared with the soaked and steamed samples. However, the fermented dry-milled flour had the highest crude protein (5.83-6.98 %), crude fat (0.55-2.21%), ash (3.75-4.29%), and carbohydrate (83.75-87.62%), which made it the most acceptable of the samples. The milling methods (wet and dry) had significant effects (pâ‰¤0.05) on the proximate composition of the flour for the selected pretreatment methods (soaking, fermentation and steaming). Fermentation as a pretreatment method was therefore, recommended for better nutrient retention for cocoyam flour.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3563aba09de577ab681dff23b86bda4334c7afb928c65a99fbd77b7a2e8ec41a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
