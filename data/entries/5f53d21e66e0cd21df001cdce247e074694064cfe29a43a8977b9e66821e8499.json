{"title":"Analysis of Aviation Risks Due to Adverse Weather Conditions. Case Study: Pucallpa Accident 08/23/2005","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1638/v1","date":1716540419000,"content":"Weather-related risks in aviation are one of the main causes of accidents worldwide. This article aims to analyze aviation risks resulting from adverse weather conditions, using the case study of the Pucallpa accident that occurred on August 23, 2005, in eastern Peru. In this analysis, we have determined the relationship between meteorological information and aviation risks, presented a matrix of risks associated with the most predominant meteorological variables at Pucallpa airport, and drawn up three maps of meteorological risks indicating the month of the year in which their incidence is most relevant. Finally, we conclude that it is essential to emphasize the importance of considering the prevailing weather conditions at Pucallpa airport to help mitigate the potential risks that may occur during different phases of the flight.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f53d21e66e0cd21df001cdce247e074694064cfe29a43a8977b9e66821e8499","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
