{"title":"36 Benefits of pre- and pro-biotics on oral care in companion animals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/125/7757324?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Oral health is paramount for the overall well-being of companion animals, with periodontal disease (PD) being one of the most prevalent oral inflammatory diseases in dogs. PD is a multifactorial disease, prompted by the formation of a polymicrobial biofilm on the teeth surface, known as dental plaque, that triggers the local host inflammatory response. PD prevalence ranges from 44 to 63.6%, increasing to 84 to 86% in dogs with 3 or more years old, or to 100% in poodles with more than 4 yr old. Besides its increased prevalence in the canine population, this disease is associated with several severe systemic complications, highlighting its relevance in veterinary medicine and the importance of developing new preventive measures and new therapeutic procedures to manage this disease. Symbiotics, including pre- and pro-biotics, are one promising approach for the control of canine PD. As demonstrated by several studies, these microorganisms can contribute for the maintenance of a healthy oral microbiota, helping in the prevention of periodontitis, and can be used in combination with conventional PD treatments for a better efficacy towards established disease. For example, it has been shown that the stability of the oral microbiota in healthy dogs can be positively influenced by probiotic administration over time, having a potential long-term effect on oral microbial balance and health. Another study proved that the oral administration of bacteriocin-producing strains of <span>Enterococcus faecium</span> were effective in reducing bacterial count in dental plaque, highlighting the anti-biofilm effects of probiotics in the oral cavity of dogs. Additionally, specific strains like <span>Lactobacillus acidophilus</span> MJCD175 were described as having potential as probiotics for the promotion of oral health in dogs, suggesting a targeted approach to promoting oral microbial balance, improving oral health parameters, and preventing periodontal disease. Similarly, another study investigated the anti-biofilm effects of dextranase enzyme and <span>Enterococcus faecium</span> probiotic in reducing bacterial count in dental plaque in oral cavities of dogs, highlighting the potential of probiotics in mitigating PD progression by targeting bacterial biofilms. Lastly, understanding the impact of symbiotics on the gastrointestinal microbiome of dogs is essential, as it can indirectly affect oral health. By influencing the gut microbiota, nutrition can modulate systemic inflammation and immune responses, potentially impacting oral health outcomes. Overall, the integration of pre- and probiotics into oral care regimens for dogs holds promise for promoting oral microbial balance, enhancing immune responses, and mitigating the progression of PD, ultimately improving the oral health and well-being of companion animals. Incorporating these products into oral care regimens holds promise for preventing and treating PD, potentially improving the quality of life for companion animals. Further research in this area is warranted to elucidate optimal protocols and the long-term efficacy of pre-, pro-, and postbiotic interventions in veterinary dentistry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c4b76734d72f1bbb4997cfd0e782e294694655a2866368baed993e40fce45cfe","category":"Environment"}
