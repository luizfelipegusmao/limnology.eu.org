{"title":"Syphilis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Ghana: The 2023 biobehavioral survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310909","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Chris Guure, Adikwor Ewoenam Puplampu, Samuel Dery, Gamji Rabiu Abu-Ba’are, Seth Kwaku Afagbedzi, Stephen Ayisi Addo, Kwasi Torpey</p>\r\nBackground <p>Apart from HIV acquisition, men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis. Although the intersection between syphilis and HIV poses a formidable challenge among key populations who are known to be vulnerable to many health threats, there is little known about syphilis infection among MSM living with HIV in Ghana. This study seeks to investigate the burden of syphilis and address the existing knowledge gap by exploring behavioral, healthcare access, and structural factors influencing the syphilis burden within the HIV-positive MSM population.</p> Method <p>This study was conducted in 2023 as part of the bio-behavioral survey (BBS) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey that used a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) approach was conducted in the old ten regions of Ghana. Data was collected on 3,420 participants, however, 857 HIV-positive MSM were included in this study since it focused on syphilis among HIV-positive MSM in Ghana. The study estimated the prevalence of syphilis among MSM living with HIV and provided a 95% confidence interval across different categories of explanatory variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with overall syphilis prevalence. All other analyses were weighted due to the complex design of the study.</p> Results <p>The overall prevalence of syphilis was 23.83% (95% CI: 20.44, 27.58). HIV-positive men who only had sex with men had a 29.77% (95% CI: 23.90, 36.40) prevalence of syphilis compared to a prevalence of 9.50% (95% CI: 2.56, 29.53) recorded by HIV-positive MSM who were attracted to mostly females. Participants who ever had receptive anal sex recorded a higher prevalence 26.79% (95% CI: 22.78, 31.23) than those who never had receptive anal sex 12.86% (95% CI: 8.02, 19.99). The odds of syphilis among HIV-positive MSM who never used condoms with regular sex partners in the last 6 months were 41.08 (aOR: 41.08 at 95% CI 1.24–136.42; p = 0.038).</p> Conclusion <p>There is a high prevalence of syphilis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Ghana, especially among those who engage in unprotected anal sex and have multiple sexual partners. Our findings underscore the dire need for targeted interventions to address the dual brunt of HIV and syphilis among the MSM population in Ghana.</p>","author":"Chris Guure","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f5254556bfa65c41ec68f52525203f5de8750624f5c56a660ee8d2bb6e3dc38d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
