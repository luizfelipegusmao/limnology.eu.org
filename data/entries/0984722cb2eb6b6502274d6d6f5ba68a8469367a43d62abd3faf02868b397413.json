{"title":"Prepare to Square the Circular Beam","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.382/7720506?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is technology that is developing into a mainstream technique for structural biology. The adoption of single particle as well as tomography techniques have been key driving forces. Pre-exposure of dose-sensitive specimens such as vitrified biological material to the beam lowers the attainable resolution. High-resolution cryo-TEM typically comes at the cost of a reduced field of view; therefore, a balance between the pixel size and the sample imaged in its biological context is required. Given that the illumination profile (which we call here 'beam' or 'beam profile' for simplicity) of TEMs is round, tiling across a large field of view encounters the circle packing problem, wherein circles cannot be perfectly tiled. Even with an ideal modern imaging set-up with fringe-free imaging (FFI) and a square sensor, the sensor will capture only about 69% of the area illuminated by the tightest possible round beam [<a href=\"#ozae044.382-B1\">1</a>]. The electron beam will damage the remaining illuminated but unimaged site, which will no longer contain high-resolution information when subsequently imaged.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0984722cb2eb6b6502274d6d6f5ba68a8469367a43d62abd3faf02868b397413","category":"Environment"}
