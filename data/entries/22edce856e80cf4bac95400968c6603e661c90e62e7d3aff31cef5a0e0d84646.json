{"title":"Sensory Properties, Redox Characteristics, and Impact on the Hemodynamics of the Flavanol-Rich Fraction Originated Grape and Blueberry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1398/v1","date":1711183122000,"content":"Several epidemiological studies and intervention trials have demonstrated that flavanols present in grapes and blueberries can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these compounds remain unclear due to their low bioavailability. A polyphenol-rich grape and blueberry extract (PEGB) contained about 16% flavanol, of which 11% was monomer and 4% was dimer. A sensory test investigated the oral perception of a PEGB. At concentrations where quercetin had almost no detectable taste, PEGB exhibited significant  astringency. Furthermore, in comparing the redox properties against O2･- using a luminescence method, PEGB acted as a prooxidant at low concentrations, promoting O2･-production and scavenging O2･-at high concentrations under pH conditions similar to oral cavity and intestine. In contrast, quercetin showed antioxidant activity at any concentration.  A single oral administration of PEGB to rats showed a significant increase in skeletal muscle arteriolar blood flow. According to these results, PEGB containing flavanols displays a potent astringent flavor, increases O2･-production at low concentrations in a neutral pH environment as well as oral and intestine, and considerably enhances blood flow to skeletal muscles after a single dose in rats. The results of this study indicate a need to investigate the causal relationship between oral perception, redox properties, and bioactivity of polyphenols.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22edce856e80cf4bac95400968c6603e661c90e62e7d3aff31cef5a0e0d84646","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
