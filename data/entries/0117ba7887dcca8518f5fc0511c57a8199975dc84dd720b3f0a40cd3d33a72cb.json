{"title":"Development of Foam Composites from Flax Gum-Filled Epoxy Resin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0089/v1","date":1717467353000,"content":"In the present work, an innovative range of foams, based on flax gum-filled epoxy resin was developed, reinforced or not by flax fibers. Foams and composites with different gum and epoxy resin contents were produced and characterized for mechanical and thermal performances. To enhance the organic flax gum filler's cross-linking, we exploited the oxidized components' reactivity with the amine hardener (isophorone diamine). We compared the materials obtained with those derived from the native components. Flax gum and fibers were primarily characterized by chemical analysis, NMR, and FTIR to evaluate the mild oxidation of native materials. The formation of chemical bonds between oxidized polymer chains, epoxy resin, and hardener has been evidenced by FTIR, and the materials were then studied by SEM, X-ray computed micro-tomography (CT), and submitted to mechanical and thermal tests. The relevance of oxidation treatment was highlighted, through a significant increase in density and mechanical performances (+36% and +81%, respectively for the 100% flax gum material). The positive effect of flax fibers on homogeneity evidenced through micro-CT analysis was also clearly addressed. This set of promising results paves the way for future development of fully flax-based insulation composite materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0117ba7887dcca8518f5fc0511c57a8199975dc84dd720b3f0a40cd3d33a72cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
