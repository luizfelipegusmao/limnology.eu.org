{"title":"Advanced Scale-Propeller Design Using a MATLAB Optimization Code","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1350/v1","date":1718847075000,"content":"This study investigated the efficiency of scale-propellers, typically used on small drones. A scale-propeller is accepted as having a diameter of 7 to 21 inches. The Ukraine War has demonstrated the utility of relatively small, low-cost first-person view (FPV) drones, which are attritable. This investigation outlines the development of a MATLAB optimisation code, based on minimum induced loss propeller theory, which calculates the optimal chord and twist distribution for a chosen propeller operating in known flight conditions. The MATLAB code includes a minimum Reynolds number functionality, which provides the option to alter the chord distribution to ensure the entire propeller is operating above a set threshold value of Reynolds (&amp;gt;100,000), as this has been found to be a transition point between low and high section lift-to-drag ratios. Additional functions allow plotting of torque and thrust distributions along the blade. The results have been validated on experimental data taken from an APC ‘Thin Electric’ 10” x 7” propeller, where it was found that both the chord and twist distributions were accurately modelled. The MATLAB code resulted in a 16% increase in the maximum propulsive efficiency. Further work will investigate a direct interface to SolidWorks to aid rapid propeller manufacturing capability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbc6332497934fe44067f4b97d60c17a530ce310e65bf24ea45bc07c1064cb89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
