{"title":"Influence of Various Rock Types on the Recovery of Heavy Hydrocarbons by Supercritical Carbon Dioxide","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1982/v1","date":1714470072000,"content":"This study explores pressure, miscibility, and pore medium effects on heavy hydrocarbon recovery up to 65 MPa from four rock types: sand, tight sandstone, cavernous limestone, and oil sand. Results reveal MMP at 50 MPa, with peak recovery at 93% (56 MPa). Interestingly, recovery trends counter traditional expectations, notably decreasing in tight sandstone (42-56 MPa) and oil sand (50-65 MPa). Varied recoveries in cavernous limestone (25-56 MPa) highlight porosity and vug influence. Higher pressures hinder recovery due to SC-CO2's density and viscosity, favoring the immiscible process for efficient heavy hydrocarbon extraction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"500b3f865cabd8daf21904e87fc4e617f6214b1b7b94d9fa57d33882c7b03e9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
