{"title":"A High-Speed Multichannel Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy System Using Broadband Multi-Sine Binary Perturbation for Retired Li-Ion Batteries of EVs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0791/v1","date":1712822685000,"content":"Retired Electric vehicles (EVs) batteries are reused in second life energy storage applications. However, the overall performance of repurposed energy storage system (ESS) is limited by the unevenness of individual batteries use in it. Therefore, battery grading is required for optimal performance of ESS. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) based evaluation of battery aging is a promising way to grade lithium-ion batteries. However, it is not practical to measure impedance of mass retired batteries due to high complexity and slowness. In this paper, a broadband multi-sine binary signal (MSBS) perturbation integrated with multichannel EIS system is presented to measure impedance spectra for high-speed aging evaluation of lithium-ion batteries or modules. The measurement speed is multi-times higher than conventional EIS with single-channel configuration. The broadband MSBS is validated with reference sinusoidal sweep perturbation and corresponding root-mean-square error (RMSE) analysis is performed. Moreover, the accuracy of the presented multichannel EIS system is validated by impedance spectra measurement of Samsung INR18650-29E batteries and comparing it with those measured with commercial EIS instrument. A chi-squared error under 0.641% is obtained for all 8-channels. Since the non-linearity of battery has significant impact on quality of impedance spectra. Therefore, Kronig-Kramer (KK) transform validation is also performed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a64090b90ec2029ab39260e28518feeb43d60e4b28970534b72a48d431c36d0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
