{"title":"Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analyses Reveal Neuroprotective Mechanisms of Phenolic compounds from Antiaris Africana against Parkinson&#039;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1423/v1","date":1724160755000,"content":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. Traditional treatments primarily manage symptoms rather than address the disease's root causes, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Natural phytochemicals, particularly phenolic compounds, have shown potential due to their neuroprotective effects. Antiaris africana is commonly used in traditional African medicines to treat several illnesses including neurodegenerative disorders. However, its neuroprotective mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to employ network pharmacology-based prediction to identify key targets and pathways through which A. africana exerts its effects on PD. Targets associated with Parkinsonism were identified and analyzed for interaction with compounds from A. africana. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and key hub genes were identified using Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted significant pathways involved in PD. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding affinities of the compounds to PD-related targets. Our results reveal that compounds such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, ellagic acid, epigallocatechin, gallic acid, isoquercitrin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercitrin, and rutin interact with key proteins implicated in PD, including APP, EGFR, CASP3, ESR1, AKT1, and MAPK8. Notably, rutin exhibited strong binding affinity for EGFR, and chlorogenic acid showed potential in modulating the APP pathway. These findings suggest that phenolic compounds in A. africana may exert neuroprotective effects through multiple molecular mechanisms, offering potential therapeutic strategies for PD. This study underscores the importance of integrating molecular docking and network pharmacology to elucidate the therapeutic potential of natural compounds in complex diseases like Parkinson's disease","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"feae444dec8c7a008547af4c6addba6cf4b37da2db9c4d08cb2a9c3176e3d9b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
