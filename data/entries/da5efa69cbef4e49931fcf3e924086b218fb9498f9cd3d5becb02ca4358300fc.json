{"title":"An Alternate Perspective on Cancer Immunology: The Protein-Homeostasis-System Hypothesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0695/v1","date":1720501201000,"content":"Cancer cells are believed to be recognized and controlled by the immune system of the host, especially the adaptive immune system. Cancers may be initiated by a single gene defect in stem cells or regenerating cells during the replacement of old or injured tissue cells, and additional gene defect(s) then occur. To compensate for missing proteins intracellular homeostasis systems, such as proteostasis, may work with activation of new genes. The risk or predisposing factors in cancers may be related to the number of tissue cell renewals (the turnover time) and the probability of gene defect(s). Oncological symptoms may be associated with substances that are derived from antigens expressed on cancer cells and those derived from damaged cancer cells with corresponding immune reactions. In patients with cancers or other conditions, inadequate immune components to control these substances may result in chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Cancer cells communicate with host cells, including the immune cells such as T cells, for survival and proliferation and may need assistance from immune cells against intracellular infections or physicochemical insults. T cell-based immune therapeutics have been developed and clinically used in some cancers, especially in advanced cancers. We further discuss the oncogenesis, pathophysiology of cancers, and unresolved issues in tumor immunology and reinterpret the effectiveness of T cell-based therapies under the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da5efa69cbef4e49931fcf3e924086b218fb9498f9cd3d5becb02ca4358300fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
