Common anti-acetylcholinesterase drugs such as Galantamine, Rivastigmine, Donepezil, and Tacrine have significant inhibition potential. Due to side effects and safety concerns, we aimed to investigate a wide range of phytochemicals and structural analogues of these compounds. Compounds similar to the established drugs, and phytochemicals were investigated as potential inhibitors for AChE in treating AD. A total of 2,270 compound libraries were generated for further analysis. Initial virtual screening was performed using Pyrx software, resulting in 638 molecules showing higher binding affinities compared to positive controls Tacrine (-9.0 kcal/mol), Donepezil (-7.3 kcal/mol), Galantamine (-8.3 kcal/mol), and Rivastigmine (-6.4 kcal/mol). Subsequently, ADME properties were assessed, including blood-brain barrier permeability and Lipinski’s rule of five violations, leading to 88 compounds passing the ADME analysis. Among the rivastigmine analogous, [3-(1-methylpiperidin-2-yl)phenyl] N,N-diethylcarbamate showed interaction with Tyr123, Tyr336, Tyr340, Phe337, Trp285 residues of AChE. Tacrine similar compounds, such as 4-amino-2-styrylquinoline, exhibited bindings with Tyr123, Phe337, Tyr336, Trp285, Trp85, Gly119, and Gly120 residues. A phytocompound (bisdemethoxycurcumin) showed interaction with Trp285, Tyr340, Trp85, Tyr71, and His446 residues of AChE with favourable binding. These findings underscore the potential of these compounds as novel inhibitors of AChE, offering insights into alternative therapeutic avenues for AD. A 100ns simulation analysis confirmed the stability of protein-ligand complex based on the RMSD, RMSF, ligand properties, PCA, DCCM and MMGBS parameters. The investigation suggested 3 ligands as a potent inhibitor of AChE which are [3-(1-methylpiperidin-2-yl)phenyl] N,N-diethylcarbamate, 4-Amino-2-styrylquinoline and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Furthermore, investigation, including <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> studies, is needed to validate the efficacy, safety profiles, and therapeutic potential of these compounds for AD treatment.","author":"Mahir Azmal","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e7fbdafa5499102429bdebfe11f457c3b972cc5ac0dca98a242553abcb224ff3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
