The structure and spatial arrangement of GBs is predominately determined by the dynamics of GBs during the materials fabrication, therefore understanding GB dynamics, especially the migration of GB, is crucial to the development of polycrystals with optimized properties. In the past few decades, in situ transmission electron microscopy plays a crucial role in understanding the GB dynamics and successfully identified disconnection (GB defect composed of step height and burgers vector) as the carrier of GB migration [<a href=\"#ozae044.697-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.697-B3\">3</a>]. However, the nature of disconnection and its impact on the general behaviour of GBs in polycrystals is still elusive. Here we applied <span>in situ</span> heating high angle annual dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) on the study of the GB migration in a Pt nanocrystalline thin film at high temperature. Via quantitative analysis on the GB migration and atomic displacement, we revealed shear strain induced by disconnection propagation and its consequence of grain rotation in the polycrystals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7c7ad8e58ed755df4979eee89dbb33aa5b375c8cd37e69f4f87a19fec5156dab","category":"Environment"}
