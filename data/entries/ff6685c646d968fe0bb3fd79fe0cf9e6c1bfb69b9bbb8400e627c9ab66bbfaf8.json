In this study, the water environment system of a watershed was deconstructed into three parts (source, source-sink, and runoff transport) to construct a pollutant transportation equilibrium model on a large time scale. A watershed with an annual source-sink accumulation of zero was defined as a completely transported watershed; therefore, we derived a completely transported equilibrium equation. The problem of seeking the land export coefficient was converted into a problem of seeking the optimal solution of linear programming, which can be estimated according to the variation in pollutant output processes. The feasibility of the solution can be analyzed using multi-year stochastic rainfall processes. The model was used to analyze the transport equilibrium of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) upstream of the monitored cross-sections in a watershed, which covered 3145.66 km<sup>2</sup>. The land export coefficients were calculated according to the model. The model calculations indicated that the watershed was completely transported during perennial years. The calculated export coefficients of COD, TN, and TP for farmland, primary vegetation, and urban land were within the range of general empirical values. The calculated maximum accumulations of COD, TN, and TP were 0.19 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 0.063 × 10<sup>7</sup>, and 0.049 × 10<sup>6</sup> kg, respectively, for perennial rainfall.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nA completely transported watershed was defined, and a model of pollutant transportation equilibrium with large time-scale was constructed.\nA problem of seeking the optimal solution of a linear programming was designed to estimate the land export coefficient of COD, TN, and TP.\nThe runoff transport and accumulation processes of COD, TN, and TP in a watershed was analyzed.\n</p>","author":"Min Yang, \nZemin Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"ff6685c646d968fe0bb3fd79fe0cf9e6c1bfb69b9bbb8400e627c9ab66bbfaf8","category":"Environment"}
