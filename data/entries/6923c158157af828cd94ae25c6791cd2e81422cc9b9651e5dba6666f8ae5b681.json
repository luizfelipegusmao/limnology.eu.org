{"title":"Fluorescence-Enhanced Photodynamic Assessments for Human Breast Cancer Cell Characterizations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1312/v1","date":1718769373000,"content":"Even with 100% certainty of a complete cure for breast cancer (BC), there is still a long way to go toward more efficient treatment. This requires sensitive and timely detection and accurate pre/post-clinical characterizations. Despite the availability of advanced diagnostic tools, many cancer patients lack access to efficient diagnostics that are both highly reliable and affordable. The fluorescence-based optical technique aims to make another significant leap forward in improving patient safety. It offers a convenient operation that reduces healthcare costs compared to visual examination tools (VETs). The primary and metastatic stages of BC consider different cancerous cell lines (MDAs), meaning the highest number of cells in this research (up to 300,000) represents the metastatic stages of BC, and 50,000 represents the primary level of BC developments have been studied based on fluorescence-enhanced photodynamic characterizations. The ability to characterize the fluorescence caused by MDA with 50,000 cells compared to the dominant radiation of MDA with 300,000 cells is emphatic proof of the high potential of fluorescence technique in timely BC detections, specifically before it spreads to the axillary lymph nodes. The specific cell numbers of 50,000 and 300,000 were chosen arbitrarily based on the cultivation of common biological limitations. Comparing the outcomes between 50,000 and 300,000 cells allows for evaluating the fluorescence technique’s diagnostic capability across various stages of breast cancer. This assessment provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the fluorescence-based characterizing approach in detecting cancerous cells at different stages of the disease. Here, we have assessed fluorescence’s spectral shift and intensity difference as a diagnostic approach to distinguish between cancerous and normal breast cells. This study also presents a two-way structure of the 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) prodrug and Fluorescein Sodium (FS) effect in BC cell characterization from the perspective of photodynamical procedures and the detection side. 5-ALA induces an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) photosensitizer through a biosynthetic pathway, leading to red radiation of fluorescence measurements depending on different factors, such as temperature, incubation time, added glucose of the culturing medium, as well as photosynthesis processes. The presence and progression of breast cancer can be indicated by elevated levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are associated with the production of PpIX in cells following the administration of 5-ALA. Also, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) fluorophores are recognized as the main factors for fluorescence emissions at around 420-580 nm emission intervals. Considering the MDA’s high metastatic potential, the impact of 5-ALA on MDA’s cellular morphology and viability has been investigated. The molecular fluorophores are the primary probes to MDA’s cellular photodynamic considerations, allowing this widespread pre/post-clinical approach. The fluorescence signal reduction due to decreased cell viability and increased MDA’s cellular death rate after 24 hours of the 5-ALA-induced staining corresponds to the changes in lipid metabolism enzymes of MDAs cultured at different doses, which could be known as a cell death inducer function. Furthermore, statistical concerns have been studied using PCA multivariate component analysis to differentiate MDA cell lines administrated by 5-ALA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6923c158157af828cd94ae25c6791cd2e81422cc9b9651e5dba6666f8ae5b681","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
