Male-specific fragments amplified in all phenotypic males across the markers. Phenotypic females were genetically identified as males using <i>sdY</i> (57%) and <i>sdY 227U</i> (4%), but no phenotypic females were identified as males using <i>OtY2m</i>. We conclude that <i>OtY2m</i> was the most reliable sex marker, followed closely by <i>sdY 227U</i>, among those tested in our study populations. Additional research is warranted to test the applicability of these markers in other populations and <i>Oncorhynchus</i> species.</p>","author":"Takuya K. Hosoki, \nNoël M.
