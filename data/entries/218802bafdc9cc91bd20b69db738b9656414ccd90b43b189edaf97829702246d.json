The identification of novel molecular subtypes and therapeutic targets is crucial for improving clinical outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p>In this study, we investigated the role of R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) in esophageal cancer and its association with mitochondrial metabolism. Using bioinformatics analysis of publicly available datasets, we identified a panel of RSPO2-related mitochondrial metabolism genes and their expression patterns in esophageal cancer. Based on these genes, we stratified esophageal cancer patients into distinct molecular subtypes with different survival rates, immune cell infiltration profiles, and drug sensitivities.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Our findings suggest that RSPO2-related mitochondrial metabolism genes may serve as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for esophageal cancer. These genes play an important role in the prognosis, immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity of esophageal cancer.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The identified molecular subtypes provide valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of esophageal cancer and could guide personalized treatment strategies in the future.</p>","author":"Quanzhou Peng, \nTianfeng Cao, \nXue Yang, \nZhujia Ye, \nJun Wang, \nShang Chen, \nYanqi Yu, \nYingdian Yu, \nWenyuan Xue, \nZhiwei Chen, \nJianbing Fan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"218802bafdc9cc91bd20b69db738b9656414ccd90b43b189edaf97829702246d","category":"Environment"}
