In practice, implementing the PPP raises a number of complex questions. In this article, I focus on one such key question, as interpreted by higher courts in India: how much should the polluter pay? I propose—and then apply—a three-part choice framework for analysing judicial interpretations of the PPP. Indian case law on the subject is often presumed to be relatively coherent and consistent. However, a methodical application of the aforementioned framework reveals three distinct strands in the approaches taken by Indian courts, thus contributing to a more in-depth and systematic understanding of the PPP jurisprudence. I also identify certain gaps and inconsistencies in these approaches, and suggest ways in which they can be resolved, making the application of the set principle more consistent, logical and effective.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Environmental Law Current Issue","siteHash":"d0caeee440a105ac55789e8609e0b01f5d84cefdaed670832b152a3f460f0e91","entryHash":"302563d9a8171308f8663de35e5db06f2b51b04813a6aa67a73ea398cd871534","category":"Environment"}
