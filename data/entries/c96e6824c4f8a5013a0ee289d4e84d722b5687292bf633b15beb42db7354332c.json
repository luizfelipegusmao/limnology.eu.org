{"title":"Telecoupling Cannot Be Ignored for the Forest-Based Carbon Market","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1765/v1","date":1714135914000,"content":"Telecoupling, interactions between social-ecological systems across large, often global, distances, drives negative impacts from the forest-based carbon market. Yet, these negative impacts have been underreported; and therefore, likely vastly underestimated. We identify how these unintended negative impacts may occur and provide recommendations for the forest-based carbon market to better account for externalities by prioritising positive social impact, expanding comprehensive ecological outcomes and improving transparency of investments. We call for a carbon market that is designed to account for its global interconnectedness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c96e6824c4f8a5013a0ee289d4e84d722b5687292bf633b15beb42db7354332c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
