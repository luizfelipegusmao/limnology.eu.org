{"title":"Influence of Mixing and Standing Times on the Rheological Properties and Performance of Coatings for Lost Foam Shell Casting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1043/v1","date":1720778687000,"content":"This study investigates lost foam shell casting coatings, focusing on the effects of mixing time and standing time on the viscosity and rheological properties of the coatings. The results show that the viscosity of the coating decreases with increasing mixing time and eventually stabilizes. Conversely, the viscosity initially increases and then decreases with prolonged standing time. To ensure optimal coating performance, this study determined that the mixing time should be no less than 50 minutes, and the standing time should not exceed 40 hours.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dda6dadf9d1b0394ae9ac3bb0bcf7705134596235a914ae5fd27d4e7827b45b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
