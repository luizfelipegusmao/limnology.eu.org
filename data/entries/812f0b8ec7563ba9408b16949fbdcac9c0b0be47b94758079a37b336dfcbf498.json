{"title":"Pedagogical Translanguaging in L2 Teaching for Adult Migrants: Assessing Feasibility and Emotional Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0730/v1","date":1725962701000,"content":"Pedagogical translanguaging (PTL) refers to the use of educational techniques which incorporate learners’ entire linguistic repertoire. Recent studies indicate that PTL is efficient in the teaching of morphological awareness to bilingual children. The question remains whether it can successfully be applied in the highly specific context of adult forced migrants' classrooms. This study describes a new protocol developed within the framework of PTL to teach derivational morphology to L2 French and Greek adults. We used questionnaires to assess quantitatively and qualitatively the feasibility of the protocol, teachers' and learners' attitudes, and learners' emotions in the PTL lesson. A total of 141 migrant learners (79 forced migrants) and 13 teachers were involved in 23 2-hour lessons. Teachers and learners gave overall high evaluations of the feasibility of the PTL protocol and of their pleasure to teach and learn using PTL tools. Learners’ ease to learn and learning benefits were positively influenced by their perception of the proximity between their L1 and L2. Learners reported higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions during the PTL lesson, while forced migrants showed globally higher hope and shame than voluntary migrants, as well as higher benefits from PTL on enjoyment. These findings suggest that the use of pedagogical translanguaging in migrants’ classrooms is feasible and develops positive attitudes and emotions, which are more pronounced in forced migrants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"812f0b8ec7563ba9408b16949fbdcac9c0b0be47b94758079a37b336dfcbf498","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
