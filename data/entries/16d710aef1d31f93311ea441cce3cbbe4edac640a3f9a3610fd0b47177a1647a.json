{"title":"PARP Inhibitors in Brain Metastases from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Through a Multimodal Patient Journey: Case Reports and Literature Review.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1688/v1","date":1719225616000,"content":"Background. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecological malignancy worldwide. Brain metastasis (BM) is quite an uncommon presentation. However, the likelihood of central nervous system (CNS) metastasization should be considered in the context of disseminated disease. The therapeutic management of BMs is an unmet clinical need, to date. Case presentation. We identified across different Cancer Centers six cases of both BRCA wild-type and BRCA-mutated EOC spreading to the CNS. They presented either with a single brain lesion or with multiple lesions and most of them had intracranial-only disease. All cases received Poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) maintenance, as by clinical practice, for a long time within a multimodal treatment approach. We also provide an insight into the available body of work regarding the management of this intriguing disease setting, with a glimpse of future therapeutic challenges. Conclusion. Despite the lack of unanimous guidelines, multimodal care pathways should be encouraged for optimal disease control of this unfortunate patientâ€™s subset. Albeit not being directly investigated in BM patients, the PARPi maintenance is deemed to have a valuable role in this setting. Prospective research, aimed to implement worthwhile strategies in the multimodal patient journey of BMs from EOC, is eagerly awaited.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16d710aef1d31f93311ea441cce3cbbe4edac640a3f9a3610fd0b47177a1647a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
