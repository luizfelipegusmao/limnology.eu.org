{"title":"Rediscovery, systematics and conservation of an enigmatic freshwater crayfish (Parastacidae) from the Australian monsoon tropics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4172?af=R","date":1718348917000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Freshwater wetlands are among the world's most valuable ecosystems, supporting diverse biota and critical ecological services, yet these habitats have suffered extensive and pervasive anthropogenic disturbance. Northern Australia represents a rare example of a relatively unmodified, vast wetland habitat. The freshwater crayfishes of the region are poorly documented, with one enigmatic species, the nutcracker yabby <i>Cherax nucifraga</i>, described from a single individual sampled opportunistically from the stomach of a predatory fish. Here we report on the rediscovery of <i>C. nucifraga</i> from a relatively limited distribution in semi-permanent coastal freshwater wetlands. Field studies were conducted to inform natural resource management and conservation. Genome skimming to recover mitogenomes, 18S–28S and histone sequences demonstrated a sister relationship with two congeners from the tropics, and moderate molecular genetic substructure was apparent within <i>C. nucifraga</i> between mainland and Melville Island locations. <i>Cherax nucifraga</i> is characterised by the presence of a strawberry-coloured soft patch on the outer margin of the claw, uniquely present in both mature males and females. Meristic and multivariate morphometric comparisons are made with the co-occurring redclaw <i>Cherax quadricarinatus</i> and the allopatric whiteclaw yabby <i>Cherax bicarinatus,</i> with a summary of diagnostic traits developed into a visual guide and key. Programs to further understand ecology, threats and traditional ecological knowledge will help to inform the future conservation management of the species in the face of increasing development and environmental change to northern Australian coastal freshwater wetlands. Specific conservation actions include identifying and protecting refuge habitats and preventing incursions by other <i>Cherax</i> species.</p>","author":"Michael P. Hammer, \nNick S.
