{"title":"Brevundimonas aurifodinae, sp. nov., an Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototroph Resistant to Metalloid Oxyanions Isolated from Gold Mine Tailings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1385/v1","date":1726794648000,"content":"A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out on the rod-shaped, orange pigmented strain C11T, isolated from gold mine tailings. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed relatedness to Brevundimonas, with 98.4 % and 98.2 % similarity to Brevundimonas bacteroides and Brevundimonas variabilis, respectively. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization with the closest phylogenetic neighbor of C11T indicates distinction at the species level, further confirmed by differences in physiology. C18:1 ω7c is the dominant cellular fatty acid. DNA G + C content is 68.3 mol %. The predominant ubiquinone is Q-10; 1,2-Di-O-acyl-3-O-α-D-glucopyranuronosyl glycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl glycerol and 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[D-glucopyranosyl-(1-&gt;4)-α-D-glucopyranuronosyl] glycerol are the major polar lipid constituents. This bacterium produces bacteriochlorophyll a and tolerates high concentrations of (μg/mL): tellurium (&gt;1500), selenium (1000 to &gt;5000), and vanadium (&amp;gt;5000) oxyanions. Data supports the inclusion of C11T into the genus Brevundimonas as a new species with the proposed name Brevundimonas aurifodinae sp. nov., (C11T = NRRL B-61758T; = DSM 118059T).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11c755c4eba7803143fa76dc78b5d246bf323597334de52f40f769e8a709bdd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
