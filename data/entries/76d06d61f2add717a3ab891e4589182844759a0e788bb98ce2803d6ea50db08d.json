{"title":"Polymers and their Use in Ecological Construction Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0804/v1","date":1720534869000,"content":"This study evaluates the efficiency of biodegradable polyurethane foams as thermal insulation materials compared to conventional materials like expanded polystyrene (EPS). Key parameters analyzed include thermal conductivity, energy savings, CO2 emission reductions, and investment payback periods. Biodegradable polyurethane foams demonstrated a thermal conductivity of 0.022 W/(m·K), significantly lower than EPS's 0.035 W/(m·K), leading to higher energy savings. Calculations reveal an annual energy saving of 443,820 kWh for polyurethane foams, compared to 441,330 kWh for EPS. Financially, polyurethane foams save approximately €53,258.4 annually, while EPS saves €52,959.6. In terms of environmental impact, polyurethane foams reduce CO2 emissions by 88,764 kg annually, versus 88,266 kg for EPS. Despite the higher initial cost of polyurethane foams (€50/m² compared to €30/m² for EPS), the payback period is remarkably short at 0.094 years (1.13 months) compared to EPS's 0.057 years (0.68 months). These findings highlight biodegradable polyurethane foams as a superior option for thermal insulation, offering significant energy, financial, and environmental benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76d06d61f2add717a3ab891e4589182844759a0e788bb98ce2803d6ea50db08d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
