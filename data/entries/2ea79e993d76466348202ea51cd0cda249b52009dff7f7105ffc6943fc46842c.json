{"title":"On Dynamic Recrystallization During Friction Stir Processing of Commercially Pure Ti and Its Influence on the Microstructure and the Mechanical Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0876/v1","date":1715610417000,"content":"Friction stir processing (FSP), a severe plastic deformation process, was applied on commercially pure Ti to obtain an improved microstructure. The process yielded a refined microstructure and higher mechanical properties at room temperature (RT). Yet the microstructure was found to contain bright bands demonstrating high hardness values of about 500 HV. High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) as well as electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) analysis indicated that these bands were composed of extra-fine equiaxed  α-Ti grains with an average radius of 1-2 microns. In addition, a retained β-phase was detected at the boundaries of these α-Ti grains, together with a small quantity of separate β grains.  The results of a fractography study conducted on broken tensile specimens showed that the FSP’ed material was free of defects and that the fracture started at these bands. It is proposed that these bright bands are due to excessive deformation occurring during the processing stage, leading to an accelerated dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process. In turn, these heavy deformation regions act as a strengthening constituent, making the material superior to the parent material as far as its mechanical RT properties are concerned. Consequently, this means that FSP of CP-Ti has the potential to serve as an industrial means of improving the mechanical properties of the material.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ea79e993d76466348202ea51cd0cda249b52009dff7f7105ffc6943fc46842c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
