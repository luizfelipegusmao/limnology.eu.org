This study proposed an adaptation of a phenological scale based on the basic Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt, and Chemical industry, associated with the thermal requirement to describe the phenological stages during the seedling phase of three forest species: <i>Cybistax antisyphilitica</i>, <i>Libidibia ferrea</i>, and <i>Platycyamus regnellii</i>. The phenological scale of <i>C. antisyphilitica</i> and <i>L. ferrea</i> was defined and described through 22 seedling development stages ranging from dry seed to 20th visible leaf emitted on the main stem (from 00 to 120) and <i>P. regnellii</i> for 12 leaf development stages, from dry seed to 10th visible leaf emitted on the main stem (from 00 to 110). In addition, the duration (days) and thermal time (°C day) were determined for each seedling development stage. <i>C. antisyphilitica</i> needs to accumulate more energy (and days) to finish the seedling phase (1551.9°C day or 261 days) compared to <i>L. ferrea</i> (1127°C day or 175 days) and <i>P. regnellii</i> (1109.7°C day or 193 days). However, the three forest species exhibit similar energy demands throughout most stages of seedling development, except code 09–12 for <i>C. antisyphilitica</i>. This study provides important information for optimizing silvicultural techniques, evaluating the response of temperature on phenological stages, and assessing the impacts of global warming on forest seedling development.</p>","author":"Fabrina Bolzan Martins, \nMábele de Cássia Ferreira, \nRafael Gonçalves Xavier, \nGabriela Taynara da Silva Ribeiro, \nFlávia Fernanda Azevedo Fagundes, \nFernando Yuri da Silva Reis, \nHaroldo Felipe da Costa, \nBruna Oliveira Borges","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"f18ab5ae79724c59ce3d185ee34905a8688138b87c3b528dac96c5e395a60661","category":"Environment"}
