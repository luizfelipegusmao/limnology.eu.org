{"title":"Taxonomic Status and Diffusion Trend Prediction Under the Effect of Host Plant of the Urban Oligophagous Pest Histia rhodope","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0503/v1","date":1728308102000,"content":"Histia rhodope is an oligophagous pest that only feeds on Bischofia polycarpa. Recently, frequent outbreaks of H. rhodope have greatly impacted the urban landscape and people’s life. The taxonomic status and diffusion trend of H. rhodope were studied based on its mitogenome sequence and the MaxEnt model. The mitogenome stucture of H. rhodope has certain conserved character. The species of lepidopteran moths in each superfamily and family were monophyletic. The genetic distance between H. rhodope and Eterusia aedea was the closest (0.09). By 2050, the suitable habitat area of H. rhodope is expected to increase (71.63 × 104 km2). The centroid changes of the distribution of H. rhodope shifted from Anhui to Hubei province (distance shifted: 255.71 km). Climate factor like annual mean temperature, mean temperature of driest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of coldest quarter affected the distribution of H. rhodope, and the suitable habitat of the host plant of biotic factor is the potential invasion area for its further spread. Our results revealed the taxonomic status of H. rhodope across lepidopteran moths, emphasized the risk of its spread and the important role of host plant, provided valuable molecular and ecological data for managing and monitoring H. rhodope.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9a004382dc6ca5622961c4c8a66a0dcc91b6e423c1b58b8a133a7e39468f5c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
