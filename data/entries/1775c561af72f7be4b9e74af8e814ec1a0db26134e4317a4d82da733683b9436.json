{"title":"Data-Driven Sustainable Growth and Continuous Experimentation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2054/v1","date":1727334826000,"content":"In todayâ€™s business landscape, customer retention has become a critical factor for sustainable growth. Many companies continue to focus on acquisition, which leads to high costs and constant customer turnover. This article highlights the importance of retention, proposing a shift in focus toward loyalty as the key to maximizing customer lifetime value (LTV). Improving retention not only increases LTV but also reduces acquisition costs, enhances virality, and provides financial stability. This paper introduces a scientific approach that allows companies to identify the underlying causes of low retention through observation, hypothesis formulation, and controlled experimentation. Using tools such as data analysis and A/B testing, companies can iteratively optimize their retention strategy, adjusting interventions in real-time based on the results obtained. Continuous experimentation emerges as an indispensable tool for navigating market complexity, enabling organizations to learn and adapt quickly. This data-driven approach not only improves retention but also drives long-term growth by building strong relationships with customers. In an increasingly competitive environment, companies that prioritize retention and experimentation are better positioned to achieve resilient and profitable growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1775c561af72f7be4b9e74af8e814ec1a0db26134e4317a4d82da733683b9436","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
