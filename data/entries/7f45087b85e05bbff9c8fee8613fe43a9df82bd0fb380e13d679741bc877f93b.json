{"title":"409 From Classroom to Careers: Using coursework to expand student career perspectives and preparedness in animal science","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/422/7757256?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Preparing students for careers in the animal science industry often requires a multifaceted approach and involves varying challenges depending on the resources available and student demographics of the academic program. Several factors that contribute to attrition from an animal science program or a lack of preparedness for employment in industry upon graduating include limited knowledge regarding career options, a resistance to learning about different career options, lack of confidence in their abilities, and misconceptions about different careers or skill requirements. The options available to address these issues will vary between academic programs depending on the programs size, financial support, degrees offered, and input from and access to industry partners. Despite diversity between programs, a shared approach to addressing gaps in career preparedness is through the incorporation of industry guided experiential learning practices in the classroom. By strategically integrating curriculum elements that highlight various sectors and specializations, educators can expose animal science students to a wide range of career paths, broaden their perspectives and encourage exploration of different pathways. The saying “you won’t know if it’s right until you try it”, can also apply to career choices. Many students do not have the opportunity to “try” different career options and will not be able to experience their chosen field until they graduate and begin working in industry. Incorporating case studies, guest lectures, related skill development, and industry presentations into coursework provides students with firsthand insights into the day-to-day responsibilities, skills required, challenges, and rewards associated with different career paths. Utilizing experiential learning aimed at career exploration and development not only enriches students’ educational experiences, but it can foster critical thinking and other attributes that are highly valued by industry employers. Furthermore, this coursework can be tailored to address emerging trends, evolving career opportunities, and current industry needs within the field of animal science. By bridging the gap between academic learning and real-world applications, industry centered experiential learning practices equip students with the skills, knowledge, and motivation needed to be successful and meet the needs of industry employers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7f45087b85e05bbff9c8fee8613fe43a9df82bd0fb380e13d679741bc877f93b","category":"Environment"}
