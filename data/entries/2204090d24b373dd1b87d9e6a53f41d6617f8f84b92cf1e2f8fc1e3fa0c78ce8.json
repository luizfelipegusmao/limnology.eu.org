{"title":"Equine Gait Analysis: New Techniques, Trials and Thinking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1195/v1","date":1724083694000,"content":"Veterinary science has benefitted from technological advancements in the past and will hopefully continue to do so, especially in the field of equine gait analysis. There is a need for rapid and easy to use technology that is accurate and portable, but at the same time is also readily interpretable. This manuscript presents two new approaches to equine gait analysis, both of which are commer-cial devices. The use of Acoustic MyoGraphy (AMG) has been proven in the field of muscle func-tion and performance as well as ligament health, but it can also provide details concerning gait when placed on the wall of the hoof of a horse. The TendibootTM system is a limb focused unit that can be easily attached, activated and used in a Veterinary clinic setting, rapidly providing gait details for equine diagnostic purposes. In conclusion this manuscript provides an insight into gait parameters from recent research trials that are novel and challenge current thinking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2204090d24b373dd1b87d9e6a53f41d6617f8f84b92cf1e2f8fc1e3fa0c78ce8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
