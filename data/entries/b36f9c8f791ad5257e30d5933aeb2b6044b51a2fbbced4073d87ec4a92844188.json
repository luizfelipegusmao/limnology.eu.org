{"title":"Unbreakable SU(3) Atoms of Vacuum Energy: A Solution for Cosmological Constant Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1534/v1","date":1716460951000,"content":"This paper addresses the cosmological constant problem, a significant discrepancy highlighted by \\cite{Weinberg:1988cp} that underlines a fundamental inconsistency between quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR). QFT examines matter dynamics within Lorentzian spacetime under standard model symmetry, while GR uses Riemannian geometry but adapts it to ensure local Lorentzian behavior in small regions. Despite the experimental successes of both theories, a major challenge exists in theoretical understanding. This letter seeks to clarify this critical misunderstanding. As the universe cools from its hot beginning, the \\(SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)\\) standard model gauge symmetry evolves. This symmetry breaks to \\(SU(3) \\times U(1)\\) upon cooling at the electroweak scale and ultimately to \\(SU(3)\\) alone as temperatures approach near-absolute zero kelvin, facilitated by the experimental Meissner effect. This suggests that \\(SU(3)\\) symmetry forms the foundational \"atoms\" of vacuum energy. Calculating the number of \\(SU(3)\\) vacuum atoms across the universe results in a value that perfectly aligns the theoretical predictions with the observed vacuum energy densities, thereby resolving the cosmological constant problem. Since \\(SU(3)\\) atoms account for the cosmological constant, they must be unbreakable. The third law of thermodynamics, which states that it is impossible to reach absolute zero Kelvin, provides the protection that prevents SU(3) atoms from breaking at zero Kelvin. This reveals the connection between the third law of thermodynamics and the quark confinement. This leads to the \\(SU(3)\\) atom creating a mass gap within the universe. This solution serves as a symmetric evidence of gauge-gravity duality as well as gravity-superconductor duality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b36f9c8f791ad5257e30d5933aeb2b6044b51a2fbbced4073d87ec4a92844188","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
