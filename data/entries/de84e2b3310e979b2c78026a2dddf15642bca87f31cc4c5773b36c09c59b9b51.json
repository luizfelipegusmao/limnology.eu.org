{"title":"Treatment of Psychological Symptoms in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0535/v1","date":1725613795000,"content":"The aim of the article is to identify and illustrate the most used psychological techniques in the field of cystic fibrosis (CF) and to help clinicians choosing the appropriate strategy among the various possibilities. The disease and its medical treatments can be difficult to tolerate and can cause anxiety about health status or feelings of hopelessness and stress.\nThe prevalence of depression and anxiety is 2.3 times higher in adults with CF than in community samples. A strong correlation has been identified between elevated psychological distress and unfavorable health outcomes, including, among others, impaired lung function, reduced BMI, an increased incidence of pulmonary exacerbations, and an elevated risk of transplantation. The use of psychological interventions is useful in addressing these common distress in CF patients.\nAware of the necessity to identify efficacious interventions for all levels of depression and anxiety in CF patients, this study presents an overview of the research on psychological interventions for patients with CF, in order to complement the treatments suggested by the international guidelines on mental health in CF cases. In fact, the aim of this study is to conduct a review and quantitative synthesis of the psychological intervention techniques that are currently available for individuals with CF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de84e2b3310e979b2c78026a2dddf15642bca87f31cc4c5773b36c09c59b9b51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
