{"title":"Socceromics: The Integration of Omics Technologies in Soccer to Enhance Performance and Health. A Comprehensive, Critical Review of the Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1705/v1","date":1729592890000,"content":"The integration of omics technologies, including genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and microbiomics, has transformed sports science, particularly in soccer, where these advancements have the potential to enhance player performance, injury prevention, and recovery. This review examines the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across key genes influencing various physiological traits crucial for elite soccer players. Genes related to the cardiovascular system (ACE, AGT, NOS3, VEGF), muscle structure and function (ACTN3, CKM, MLCK), neurotransmission (ADRA2A, ADRB2, BDNF, DRD1, DBH), connective tissue integrity (COL1A1, COL2A1, COL5A1, ELN, EMILIN1, TNC), energy metabolism (AMPD1, MCT1, UCP1/2/3), oxidative stress response (GSTM1, GSTP, GSTT), hormonal regulation (CYP2D6, HSD17B14), and growth factors (GDF-8, IGF2, HGF) are all highlighted for their roles in influencing soccer-specific traits like endurance, speed, and injury risk. Furthermore, the incorporation of omics data allows for personalized strategies in training, nutrition, and recovery, tailoring interventions to each player's genetic and biochemical profile. For example, genomic markers such as ACE I/D and ACTN3 R577X are linked to key athletic traits like endurance and muscle injury susceptibility, while proteomics sheds light on muscle repair mechanisms, and metabolomics provides real-time insights into energy metabolism and fatigue markers. Microbiomics explores the role of gut health in recovery and overall performance, revealing correlations between microbial diversity and enhanced athletic outcomes. This comprehensive approach, referred to as Socceromics, offers a more holistic understanding of an athleteâ€™s health and performance capabilities. Integrating these findings into real-world applications is essential for optimizing training regimens and reducing injury risk, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what athletes can achieve on the field. Future research should focus on expanding the scope of omics integration and improving the generalizability of findings across diverse populations and genders, thus advancing the field of precision sports medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad66a2b18fa61a297a78ebcf23c4d7a80890b45aa925f730043c5d414840c0b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
