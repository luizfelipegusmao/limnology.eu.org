Since the magnetic properties are strongly influenced by the local atomistic structures such as interfaces and defects, it is very important to fundamentally understand the relationships between atomic scale structure, chemistry and magnetic structures at the same local regions. Therefore, atomic-scale characterization techniques for magnetic materials are strongly demanded.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2537d1cb700f146b61fdea46a654164d2d5a77d38171a2b73411dd79579f4649","category":"Environment"}
