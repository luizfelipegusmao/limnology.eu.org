{"title":"Understanding the log file data from educational and psychological computer-based testing: A scoping review protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304109","date":1716472800000,"content":"<p>by Guanyu Chen, Yan Liu, Yue Mao</p>\r\n\r\nWith the advancement of computer-based testing, log file data has drawn considerable attention from researchers. Although emerging studies have begun to explore log file data, there is a gap in the exploitation of log file data for capturing and understanding participantsâ€™ cognitive processes. The debate on how to maximize insights from log file data has not yet reached a consensus. Therefore, we present this protocol for a scoping review that aims to characterize the application of log file data in current publications, including the data pre-processing techniques, analytical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks used by researchers. This review will also aim to illuminate how log file data can enhance psychological and educational assessments. Our findings will highlight the opportunities and challenges presented by log file data as an emerging and essential source of evidence for future advancements in psychological and educational assessment.","author":"Guanyu Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e7ba2edcd7f9857fec9fda111da3bd095c5ca60cd34fd2ab0f9491cdfd1b4e14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
