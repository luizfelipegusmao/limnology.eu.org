This phenomenon leads to capacity fading from substantial SEI loss and dead lithium formation, and safety hazards like short circuits [<a href=\"#ozae044.869-B1\">1</a>]. Despite extensive research aiming to modify lithium growth behaviors and enhance performance [<a href=\"#ozae044.869-B2\">2</a>], a lack of fundamental understanding regarding lithium growth mechanisms hampers innovative lithium metal battery development.
