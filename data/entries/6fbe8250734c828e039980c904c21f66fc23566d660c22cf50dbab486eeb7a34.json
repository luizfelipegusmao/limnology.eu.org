{"title":"Open-source Hardware Design of Modular Solar DC Nanogrid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0085/v1","date":1722549994000,"content":"The technical feasibility of solar photovoltaic (PV) direct current (DC) nanogrids are well-established, but the components of nanogrids are primarily commercially focused on alternating current (AC)-based systems. Thus, DC converter-based designs at the system level require personnel with high degree of technical knowledge and this results in high costs. To enable a democratization of the technology by reducing the costs this study provides a novel modular plug-and-play open source DC nanogrid. The system can be customized according to consumer requirements, enabling the supply of various voltage levels to accommodate different device voltage needs. The step-by-step design process of the converter, controller, data logger, and assembly of the complete system is provided. A time-domain simulation and stability analysis of the designed system were conducted in MATLAB/Simulink as well as experimental validation. The results show transforming the nanogrid from a distribution network to a device makes it suitable for various user-specific applications, such as remotely supplying power to campsites, emergency vehicles like ambulances, and small houses lacking grid electricity. The modular DC nanogrid includes all the features available in a DC distribution network as well as data logging, which enhances the user experience and promotes the use of solar-powered DC grid systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6fbe8250734c828e039980c904c21f66fc23566d660c22cf50dbab486eeb7a34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
