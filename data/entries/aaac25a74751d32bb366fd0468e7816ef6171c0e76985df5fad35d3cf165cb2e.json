{"title":"Young Consumers&rsquo; Price Perceptions in Purchasing Foods: Evidence from Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0539/v1","date":1715238947000,"content":"The recent consecutive economic and social crises impose sustainable “form farm to fork” food chain management to feed the global population. In this study we investigate young consumers (Gen Z) price perceptions in purchasing foods in Greece to find out the determinants ensuring sustainable, future food consumption. We used 8 overall price perceptions determinants, 5 with negative roles namely value &amp;amp; price consciousness, coupon &amp;amp; sales proneness, price mavenism and 3 with positive roles namely price-quality, price-value, and prestige-sensitivity for the formation of the study’s questionnaire. A total of 514 students (Gen Z by 85%) answered the questionnaire, promoted through the Google platform during September and October 2023. Data was analyzed with statistical tools, combining cross and chi-square tests. Between the negative determinants the “value consciousness” price perceptions (71.02%) were the most important parameters in purchasing food, followed by “price consciousness” (55.02%) parameters. “Coupon proneness” by 48.4% and “sales proneness” by 49% parameters were equally lower to the participants’ references, while “price mavenism” parameters were minimally preferred by only 26.4% by the participants. Participants exhibited major preference for “value to price” interconnection (66.7%) such as for good value for money, value exceeding its price, overvalued low priced foods, while their preference for “quality to price” interconnection was significantly lower (48.8%) such as for getting what you pay, more money for better quality, priced quality foods. The “prestige- sensitivity” price perception was out of their preference for food purchase (only 7.1%). Our findings indicate that young consumers (Gen Z) pay more attention to the value negative and positive parameters concerning price perceptions for food purchase rather than quality, coupons &amp;amp; sales, low price, and mavenism or even prestige of the foods. This means that value issues such as the perceived environmental impact (green value), the climate crisis, the social signaling potential and others are high in their concerns for their future including their price perceptions for food purchase.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaac25a74751d32bb366fd0468e7816ef6171c0e76985df5fad35d3cf165cb2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
