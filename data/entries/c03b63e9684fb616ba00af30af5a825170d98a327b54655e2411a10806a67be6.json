{"title":"Ambient air pollution as a time-varying covariate in the survival probability of childhood cancer patients in the upper Northern Thailand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303182","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Lalita Sathitsamitphong, Imjai Chitapanarux, Pimwarat Srikummoon, Natthapat Thongsak, Nawapon Nakharutai, Salinee Thumronglaohapun, Titaporn Supasri, Phonpat Hemwan, Patrinee Traisathit</p>\r\n\r\nThe objective of this study is to determine the possible association between exposure to air pollution and the risk of death from cancer during childhood in upper northern Thailand. Data were collected on children aged 0–15 years old diagnosed with cancer between January 2003 and December 2018 from the Chiang Mai Cancer Registry. Survival rates were determined by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate associations of potential risk factors with the time-varying air pollution level on the risk of death. Of the 540 children with hematologic cancer, 199 died from any cause (overall mortality rate = 5.3 per 100 Person-Years of Follow-Up (PYFU); 95%CI = 4.6–6.0). Those aged less than one year old (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.07; 95%CI = 1.25–3.45) or ten years old or more (aHR = 1.41; 95%CI = 1.04–1.91) at the time of diagnosis had a higher risk of death than those aged one to ten years old. Those diagnosed between 2003 and 2013 had an increased risk of death (aHR = 1.65; 95%CI = 1.13–2.42). Of the 499 children with solid tumors, 214 died from any cause (5.9 per 100 PYFU; 95%CI = 5.1–6.7). Only the cancer stage remained in the final model, with the metastatic cancer stage (HR = 2.26; 95%CI = 1.60–3.21) and the regional cancer stage (HR = 1.53; 95%CI = 1.07–2.19) both associated with an increased risk of death. No association was found between air pollution exposure and all-cause mortality for either type of cancer. A larger-scale analytical study might uncover such relationships.","author":"Lalita Sathitsamitphong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c03b63e9684fb616ba00af30af5a825170d98a327b54655e2411a10806a67be6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
