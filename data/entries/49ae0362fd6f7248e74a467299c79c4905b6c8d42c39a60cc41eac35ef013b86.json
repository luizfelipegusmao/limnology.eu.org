{"title":"Image steganography techniques for resisting statistical steganalysis attacks: A systematic literature review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308807","date":1726495200000,"content":"<p>by Richard Apau, Michael Asante, Frimpong Twum, James Ben Hayfron-Acquah, Kwame Ofosuhene Peasah</p>\r\n\r\nInformation hiding in images has gained popularity. As image steganography gains relevance, techniques for detecting hidden messages have emerged. Statistical steganalysis mechanisms detect the presence of hidden secret messages in images, rendering images a prime target for cyber-attacks. Also, studies examining image steganography techniques are limited. This paper aims to fill the existing gap in extant literature on image steganography schemes capable of resisting statistical steganalysis attacks, by providing a comprehensive systematic literature review. This will ensure image steganography researchers and data protection practitioners are updated on current trends in information security assurance mechanisms. The study sampled 125 articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, Science Direct, and Wiley. Using PRISMA, articles were synthesized and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. A comprehensive discussion on image steganography techniques in terms of their robustness against well-known universal statistical steganalysis attacks including Regular-Singular (RS) and Chi-Square (X<sup>2</sup>) are provided. Trends in publication, techniques and methods, performance evaluation metrics, and security impacts were discussed. Extensive comparisons were drawn among existing techniques to evaluate their merits and limitations. It was observed that Generative Adversarial Networks dominate image steganography techniques and have become the preferred method by scholars within the domain. Artificial intelligence-powered algorithms including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms are recently dominating image steganography research as they enhance security. The implication is that previously preferred traditional techniques such as LSB algorithms are receiving less attention. Future Research may consider emerging technologies like blockchain technology, artificial neural networks, and biometric and facial recognition technologies to improve the robustness and security capabilities of image steganography applications.","author":"Richard Apau","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"49ae0362fd6f7248e74a467299c79c4905b6c8d42c39a60cc41eac35ef013b86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
