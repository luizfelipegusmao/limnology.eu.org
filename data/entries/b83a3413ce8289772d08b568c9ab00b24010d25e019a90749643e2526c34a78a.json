{"title":"The Long-term Rate of Repeat Surgery After Optimal Excision Surgery of Endometriosis at a Single Tertiary Referral Center","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1485/v1","date":1726739855000,"content":"The primary purpose of this prospective cohort study was to determine if treating endometriosis with optimal excision surgery leads to lower rates of repeat surgery as compared to historical rates of repeat surgery by ablation. A secondary outcome was to examine whether the use of hormonal suppression differed before surgery, depending on the stage of endometriosis found at surgery. Optimal excision was defined as completely excising all areas of abnormal peritoneum, wherever found in the pelvis, having looked systematically with near contact laparoscopy. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon specializing in optimal excision at a tertiary referral center. The rate of repeat surgery after optimal excision surgery for endometriosis was remarkably low (2.5%, 15/620) as compared to historical rates of repeat surgery by ablation. Additionally, the lack of significant evidence between hormonal suppression use and progression of stage of endometriosis provides implicit evidence that hormonal suppression does not prevent progression of the disease. Further controlled studies are needed to verify these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b83a3413ce8289772d08b568c9ab00b24010d25e019a90749643e2526c34a78a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
