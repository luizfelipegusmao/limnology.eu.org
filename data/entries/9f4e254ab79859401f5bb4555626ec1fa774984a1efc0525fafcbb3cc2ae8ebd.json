{"title":"Don’t fear the reaper: Tracing the organized breakdown of dying cells in the lateral root cap","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/799/7492838?rss=1","date":1703289600000,"content":"<span>Is there life after death? The answer is a resounding yes for the developing Arabidopsis root cap. Although death might seem like the polar opposite of growth, the timely demise and subsequent removal of older cells at the lateral root cap (LRC) is an essential part of root growth and differentiation. When it is time to die, the terminally differentiated cell prepares itself by transcriptionally activating relevant genes. The transcription factor <span>SOMBRERO</span> controls programmed cell death (PCD) as a part of the LRC differentiation program to maintain proper root cap size (<a href=\"#koad321-B1\">Fendrych et al. 2014</a>). After preparation at the genetic level, a “death sentence” trigger initiates a cascade of events for the execution of PCD. Internal structures like the vacuole collapse, caustic enzymes are released, the cytosol acidifies, and the plasma membrane (PM) becomes more permeable. Finally, the leftover cellular debris is cleared to make room for differentiating cells (<a href=\"#koad321-B2\">Huysmans et al. 2017</a>). When older LRC cells that have served their purpose do not undergo PCD, they hinder developing cells from differentiating and alter LRC size (<a href=\"#koad321-B1\">Fendrych et al. 2014</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9f4e254ab79859401f5bb4555626ec1fa774984a1efc0525fafcbb3cc2ae8ebd","category":"Environment"}
