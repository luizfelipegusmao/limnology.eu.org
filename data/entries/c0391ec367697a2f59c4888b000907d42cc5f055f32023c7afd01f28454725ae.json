{"title":"DifferentialRegulation: a Bayesian hierarchical approach to identify differentially regulated genes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/4/1079/7695436?rss=1","date":1718582400000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Although transcriptomics data is typically used to analyze mature spliced mRNA, recent attention has focused on jointly investigating spliced and unspliced (or precursor-) mRNA, which can be used to study gene regulation and changes in gene expression production. Nonetheless, most methods for spliced/unspliced inference (such as RNA velocity tools) focus on individual samples, and rarely allow comparisons between groups of samples (e.g. healthy <span>vs.</span> diseased). Furthermore, this kind of inference is challenging, because spliced and unspliced mRNA abundance is characterized by a high degree of quantification uncertainty, due to the prevalence of multi-mapping reads, ie reads compatible with multiple transcripts (or genes), and/or with both their spliced and unspliced versions. Here, we present <span>DifferentialRegulation</span>, a Bayesian hierarchical method to discover changes between experimental conditions with respect to the relative abundance of unspliced mRNA (over the total mRNA). We model the quantification uncertainty via a latent variable approach, where reads are allocated to their gene/transcript of origin, and to the respective splice version. We designed several benchmarks where our approach shows good performance, in terms of sensitivity and error control, <span>vs.</span> state-of-the-art competitors. Importantly, our tool is flexible, and works with both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. <span>DifferentialRegulation</span> is distributed as a Bioconductor R package.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"c0391ec367697a2f59c4888b000907d42cc5f055f32023c7afd01f28454725ae","category":"Environment"}
