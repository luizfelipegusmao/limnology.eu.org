{"title":"Evidence of marine predation on silver New Zealand longfin eels, Anguilla dieffenbachii","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12695?af=R","date":1720969370000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The use of Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags (PSATs) has provided considerable new information about the behaviour of migrating (silver) eels (<i>Anguilla</i> spp.) at sea, with 9 of 19 recognised species or subspecies tagged to date. However, such studies often reported premature tag detachment and relatively high rates of predation. Since 2000, several PSAT-tagged New Zealand longfin eels, <i>Anguilla dieffenbachii</i>, were released to understand migratory behaviour and location of potential spawning grounds. Of 20 PSAT-tagged eels released in 2019, all tags detached prematurely, but 7 (58%) were likely eaten or injured by predators 1–81 days after release. Two eels were probably eaten by sperm whales, whereas other tagged eels were likely eaten by lamniform and non-lamniform sharks, and southern bluefin tuna. Because of the high rate of predation, we recommend that future releases should be from smaller catchments or offshore.</p>","author":"Donald Jellyman, \nPaul Franklin, \nKim Aarestrup, \nKim Birnie‐Gauvin, \nCindy Baker, \nPhillip Jellyman","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"04f3828b71c095fd6eceb8fb9fbe156dca776986cd201aefda3a5bb96f9e84ea","category":"Environment"}
