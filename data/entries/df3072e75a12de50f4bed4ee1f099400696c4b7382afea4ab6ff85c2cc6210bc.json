{"title":"Innovative Optimization of Darrieus Vertical Turbines Farms via Machine Learning and Meta-Heuristic Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0337/v1","date":1720044871000,"content":"This study optimizes the placement and farm layout of Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) using a neural fuzzy network, an advanced machine learning system, and meta-heuristic algorithms. The methodology introduces a novel approach to enhance turbine efficiency and overall farm performance. The objective is to determine the optimal configuration of vertical axis wind turbines using a neural-fuzzy system and meta-heuristic optimizers. Turbine efficiency and power generation rates are assessed through three-dimensional numerical simulations based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. This innovative design, featuring straight blades with bevel-angle vortex generators, represents a significant advancement over traditional straight-blade VAWTs. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the oblique configuration exhibits higher average output moment and power. A novel concept integrates the strengths of Darrieus VAWTs, enhancing efficiency through vortex generator integration. Simulation results are validated with empirical data, confirming the superior aerodynamic efficiency and increased power generation of the oblique configuration. Inspired by the optimal group movements of birds, this study recommends adopting the oblique arrangement for improved wind turbine performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df3072e75a12de50f4bed4ee1f099400696c4b7382afea4ab6ff85c2cc6210bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
