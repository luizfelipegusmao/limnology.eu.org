{"title":"Tracking Single Mouse Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Migration into Glioblastoma using a Photoconvertible Microcapsules","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1383/v1","date":1716285301000,"content":"To elucidate mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC)-tumor intricate and ambiguous interactions, the reliable cell labeling and tracking techniques are imperative. Traditional methods of cell labelling have limitations mostly relevant to need for genetic modification what demands the exploration for alternative strategies. Here, we propose using fluorescent photoconvertible microcapsules containing Rhodamine B (RhB) to study mMSC migration in brain tumors. These 3 Î¼m sized microcapsules are readily internalised by cells and undergo photoconversion under 561 nm laser exposure with fluorescence blue shift on demand. Optimal photoconversion was achieved with a laser irradiation duration of 0.4 ms, which provide a maximal brightness of photoconverted label without an excessive laser exposure on cells. Capsules modified with polyallylamine hydrochloride demonstrated the best potential for intracellular uptake without significantly affecting cell viability, motility, or proliferation. The optimal ratio of 20 capsules per mMSC was determined for labeling. Moreover, migration of individual mMSCs within 2D and 3D glioblastoma cell (EPNT-5) colonies over 2 days and in vivo tumor settings over 7 days was tracked. Our study unveils a robust platform for investigating MSC-tumor dynamics, offering insights into therapeutic strategies. Photoconvertible microcapsules could also become an indispensable tool for studying complex fundamental processes of cell-cell interactions for a wide range of problems in biology and medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"095ef669f1bc84420dc4de3d75756401d42a0893ae272db2a73623c7d6023e67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
