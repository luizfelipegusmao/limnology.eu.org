To characterize the role of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) in embryogenesis, a novel alternative splicing of <i>EcR</i> (<i>MnEcR</i>) was identified from the oriental river prawn <i>Macrobrachium nipponense</i>, and its spatio-temporal expression profile was examined during embryogenesis. The <i>MnEcR</i> cDNA is 2246 bp in length and encodes a protein with 487 amino acids. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the relative amount of <i>MnEcR</i> transcripts was low at cleavage stage, gradually increased from blastula stage, and reached at a peak at the metanauplius when the Y-organ appeared and, thereafter, dramatically decreased at the protozoea and back to a low level at the zoea. Such a dynamic expression profile of <i>MnEcR</i> mRNA is paralleled by fluctuation of ecdysteroids during morphogenesis in the prawn <i>M. rosenbergii</i> and <i>Palaemon serratus</i>. Hybridization in situ demonstrated <i>MnEcR</i> transcripts were localized to the epidermis of appendage rudiments in metanauplius and the cuticle membrane of the thoracic legs and telson in zoeas, suggesting a role for <i>MnEcR</i> in the development of appendages. These results indicated that <i>MnEcR</i> associated with ecdysteroids might be essential for morphogenesis during embryogenesis in the prawn.</p>","author":"Kun Xie, \nYing Chen, \nZheng‐Hua Zhang, \nGao‐Feng Qiu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"a4e14497bbea1aa690699000d75c108a09f4815c38c00397c917a46b2755065c","category":"Environment"}
