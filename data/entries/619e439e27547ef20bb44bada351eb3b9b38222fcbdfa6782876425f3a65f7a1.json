{"title":"Factors Affecting Hospital Provision of Health‚ÄêPromoting Services Transferred to the Provincial Administration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0701/v2","date":1721306190000,"content":"Following the transfer of hospital services to provincial government oversight, it is essential to understand how such changes impact service quality and efficiency. This study aims to identify the factors affecting hospital service quality post-transfer and evaluate the role of professional nurses in maintaining service standards under new governance.We conducted the study at sub-district health-promoting hospitals using a mixed-methods design based on the Global Fund-HSS framework (2012), which categorizes factors into accessibility, processes, productivity, and outcomes. We collected data from 340 nurses and 400 patients using structured questionnaires. We divided the questionnaires into seven sections, which captured a range of metrics such as the personal data of nurses, hospital service activities, and leadership qualities. We employed a Likert scale to gauge perceptions and expectations of service quality. We used paired t-tests to compare performance metrics before and after the administrative transfer, one-way ANOVA to assess variability among different service units, and binary logistic regression to identify key determinants of service quality in our statistical analysis. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the attitudes and competencies of healthcare teams and the levels of service quality. Notably, service units transferred less than 50% exhibited minimal changes, indicating that the degree of transfer significantly impacts service outcomes. Despite these variations, the fundamental mission of promoting health remained consistent. The study emphasizes the critical role of nurses and recommends further research to identify additional factors that could improve service quality in transferred healthcare facilities. This could contribute to improved healthcare delivery across restructured health systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"619e439e27547ef20bb44bada351eb3b9b38222fcbdfa6782876425f3a65f7a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
