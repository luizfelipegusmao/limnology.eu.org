One of the major difficulties is mainly associated with the lack of knowledge of the sample size in the direction of the incident electron beam (Z direction) as imaging is only performed in the Xâ€“Y plane. The determination of the thickness of samples often turns out to be an important aspect during both imaging with SEM and chemical analysis with EDS [<a href=\"#ozae044.082-B1\">1</a>]. Several accurate approaches for thickness measurement using X-ray microanalysis were developed [<a href=\"#ozae044.082-B2\">2-5</a>]. As these approaches were only tested on samples with a thickness ranging from few to hundreds of nanometers, their adaptability to micro-sized samples is not guaranteed. Another inconvenience that is worth mentioning is that most of the available thin-film programs dedicated to thickness measurement are not free [<a href=\"#ozae044.082-B6\">6-9</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b5b6dcd52d5a23ca98e9a32feeaff713f19485b858e90fa8dc00dbf849bfb735","category":"Environment"}
