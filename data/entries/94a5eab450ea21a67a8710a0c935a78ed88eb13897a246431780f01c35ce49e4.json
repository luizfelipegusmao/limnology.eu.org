{"title":"Effects of insulin resistance and β-cell function on diabetic complications in Korean diabetic patients","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312439","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Do Kyeong Song, Young Sun Hong, Yeon-Ah Sung, Hyejin Lee</p>\r\nBackground <p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and dysfunctional insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. However, little research has been conducted on the relationship between IR and β-cell function in relation to diabetic complications among Korean diabetic patients. This study aimed to examine the differential associations between IR and β-cell function and various diabetic complications among Korean diabetic patients.</p> Methods <p>The analysis employed a common data model (CDM). IR and β-cell function were quantified using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-β), respectively. Hazard ratios for diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events were calculated.</p> Results <p>The study cohort consisted of 2,034 diabetic patients aged over 20 years who visited EUMC between January 2001 and December 2019. Among diabetic patients in the highest quartile of HOMA-IR, the adjusted hazard ratio for total CVD events was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–2.57) compared with those in the lowest quartile of HOMA-IR (<i>P</i> = 0.004). In contrast, diabetic patients in the lowest quartile of HOMA-β exhibited an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.91 (95% CI, 1.80–8.49) for diabetic retinopathy compared to those in the highest quartile of HOMA-β (<i>P</i> = 0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Insulin resistance and β-cell function exhibited different associations with diabetic complications among Korean diabetic patients. Specifically, lower β-cell function was associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy, whereas higher IR was associated with an increased risk of CVD events. Individuals with pronounced IR should prioritize CVD prevention measures, and those with significant β-cell dysfunction may benefit from early, intensive surveillance for diabetic retinopathy.</p>","author":"Do Kyeong Song","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"94a5eab450ea21a67a8710a0c935a78ed88eb13897a246431780f01c35ce49e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
