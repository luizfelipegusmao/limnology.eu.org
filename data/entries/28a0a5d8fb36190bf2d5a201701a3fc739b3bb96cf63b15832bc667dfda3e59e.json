{"title":"Long-Read Sequencing Unlocks New Insights into the Amphidinium carterae Microbiome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1789/v1","date":1719319290000,"content":"Dinoflagellates are one of the largest groups of marine microalgae and exhibit diverse trophic strategies. Within these niches, dinoflagellates can produce secondary metabolites that are known to be toxic, which can lead to ecologically harmful blooms. Amphidinium carterae is one species of dinoflagellate that produces toxic compounds and is used as a model for dinoflagellate studies. The extent to which the microbiome surrounding A. carterae affects its growth and secondary metabolite synthesis is still being assessed, as well as the impact of bacterial data on sequencing and assembly. An antibiotic cocktail was previously shown to eliminate 16S amplification from the dinoflagellate culture. Even with drastically reduced bacterial numbers, bacterial populations are likely to be present. In this experiment we used novel Nanopore long-read sequencing techniques on A. carterae cultures to assemble 15 full bacterial genomes ranging from 2.9-6.0 Mb and found that the use of antibiotics decreased the percentage of reads mapping back to bacteria. We also identified shifts in the microbiome composition and identified a potentially deleterious bacterial species arising in the absence of the antibiotic-treatment. Multiple antibiotic-resistance genes were identified, as well as evidence that the bacterial population do not contribute to toxic secondary metabolite synthesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28a0a5d8fb36190bf2d5a201701a3fc739b3bb96cf63b15832bc667dfda3e59e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
