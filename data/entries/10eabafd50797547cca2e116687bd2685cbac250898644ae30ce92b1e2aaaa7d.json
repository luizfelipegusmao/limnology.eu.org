{"title":"Burr Hole Craniostomy Versus Craniotomy for Chronic Subdural Hematoma – A Multicenter Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1629/v1","date":1714027113000,"content":"Background and objective: Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical entities affecting mostly elderly patients. In this study, we aimed to provide detailed characteristics of surgically treated patients with cSDH and evaluate outcomes between the two conventional treatment methods. Materials and methods: Patients with cSDH surgically treated with burr hole craniostomy (BHC) and craniotomy (CO) in tertiary centers in Croatia and Serbia during 2017-2019 were included in the study. Characteristics and outcomes of these patients were prospectively collected. Results: In total, 155 patients (mean age 72.3±13.4) were included in the study. BHC group consisted of 124 (80 %) and CO group of 31 (20 %) patients. 32 (20.6 %) patients presented with bilateral cSDH, head trauma was documented in 92 (59.4 %), and anticoagulant therapy in 37 (23.9 %) individuals. The most common symptom was hemiparesis (n=85, 54.8 %). The two groups did not differ by age. CO group had higher Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the admission, with a significant decrease at discharge compared to admission (12.6±4.8 vs 14.4±1.7, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10eabafd50797547cca2e116687bd2685cbac250898644ae30ce92b1e2aaaa7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
