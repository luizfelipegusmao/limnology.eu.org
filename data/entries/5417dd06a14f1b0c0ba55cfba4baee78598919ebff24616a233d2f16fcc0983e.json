{"title":"TAFRO Syndrome on 18F-FDG-PET/CT: An Appealing Diagnostic Tool","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1483/v1","date":1713866298000,"content":"TAFRO syndrome (TS) is a rare variant of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease (iMCD) characterized by a confluence of symptoms: thrombocytopenia (T), anasarca (A), fever (F), reticulin myelofibrosis (R), and organomegaly (O). First described in Japan in 2010, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Due to its heterogeneous presentation and potential life-threatening delays in diagnosis, precise diagnosis is essential. According to the literature, no specific imaging modality has been recommended for the work-up of patients with suspected TS. Here, we report a case of TS and its management using 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging as an attractive complementary diagnostic tool.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5417dd06a14f1b0c0ba55cfba4baee78598919ebff24616a233d2f16fcc0983e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
