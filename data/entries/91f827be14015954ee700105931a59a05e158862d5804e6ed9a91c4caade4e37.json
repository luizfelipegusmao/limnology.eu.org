This is particularly the case to understand the durability of the catalysts as a function of cycling, which remains the main issue for the commercialization of these technologies. Ideally, the voltage cycling of membrane electrode assemblies would be performed in-operando within a TEM, but these experiments are highly challenging, since separate gas phase reactants need to be present simultaneously, in particular hydrogen and oxygen. Instead, a very close approximation to a true in-operando experiment is done via potential cycling in a half-cell in the presence of liquid electrolyte, as opposed to solid electrolyte in a single cell. This allows us to observe the exact same location before and after cycling through a technique called identical location TEM/STEM (IL-TEM/STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.857-B1\">1-3</a>]. In addition, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also performed to understand the corrosion behaviour of the carbon support</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"91f827be14015954ee700105931a59a05e158862d5804e6ed9a91c4caade4e37","category":"Environment"}
