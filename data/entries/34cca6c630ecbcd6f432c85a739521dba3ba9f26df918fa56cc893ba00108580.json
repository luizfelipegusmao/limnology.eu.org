{"title":"The Role of Catalysts in LCA Applied to Biogas Reforming","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0083/v1","date":1722511509000,"content":"The real implementation of biogas reforming at industrial scale to obtain interesting products, like hydrogen or syngas, is a developing research field where multidisciplinary teams are continuously adding improvements and innovative technologies. Thus, these works can contribute to the proliferation of green technologies where circular economy and sustainability are present. To assess the sustainability of these processes, there are different tools like life cycle assessment (LCA), which implies a complete procedure where even small details count to consider a certain technology sustainable or not. The aim of this work was to review works where LCA is applied to different aspects of biogas reforming, especially focusing on the role of catalysts, which are essential to improve the efficiency of a certain process, but also present a strong influence on its environmental impact. As a conclusion, catalysts have an influence on LCA through the improvement on the catalytic performance and the impact of their production, whereas other aspects related to biogas or methane reforming could equally influence on their durability or reusability, with the subsequent effect on LCA. Further research about this subject is required in a continuously changing technology with plenty of possibilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34cca6c630ecbcd6f432c85a739521dba3ba9f26df918fa56cc893ba00108580","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
