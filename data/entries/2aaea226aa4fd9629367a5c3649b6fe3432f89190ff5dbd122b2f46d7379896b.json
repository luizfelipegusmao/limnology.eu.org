{"title":"Synergies between Class Incremental Learning and Machine Unlearning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1992/v1","date":1727259595000,"content":"The convergence of Class Incremental Learning (CIL) and Machine Unlearning (MU) is a rapidly developing field in machine learning, especially relevant in adaptive and privacy-sensitive environments like finance. CIL enables models to learn new data classes over time without losing previously acquired knowledge, while MU focuses on selectively forgetting specific data to comply with privacy laws or mitigate security risks. In this paper, we examine the theoretical foundations and practical applications of both approaches, particularly in the financial domain. We explore how these two paradigms interact and complement each other, discuss key algorithms, and present examples to illustrate their applications in areas such as portfolio management, fraud detection, and data privacy. Finally, we explore challenges and potential future directions in achieving optimal synergy between CIL and MU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2aaea226aa4fd9629367a5c3649b6fe3432f89190ff5dbd122b2f46d7379896b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
