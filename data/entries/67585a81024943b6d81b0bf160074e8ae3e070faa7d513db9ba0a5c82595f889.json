These records—in the form of high-definition videos—extend the southern limit of the species' known range by 172 km, as well as provide additional evidence of group living and co-occurrence with the blue duiker (<i>Philantomba monticola</i>) and moustached guenon (<i>Cercopithecus cephus</i>). These findings suggest that <i>C. platycephalus</i> may be more widespread than previously thought in Gabon, and that a review of existing camera trap datasets could help determine its precise distribution and habitat requirements.</p>","author":"Johanna McQuade, \nFred Loïque Midonga Nguelet, \nMangama Koumba Lilian Brice, \nKatharine A.
