{"title":"The Annealing Kinetics of Defects in CVD Diamond Irradiated by Xe Ions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2017/v1","date":1714529159000,"content":"The radiation-induced optical absorption at 1.5-5.5 eV (up to the beginning of fundamental absorption) has been analyzed in CVD diamond disks exposed to 231-MeV 132Xe ions with four fluences from 1012 to 3.81013 cm-2. The 5-mm diameter samples (thickness 0.4 mm) were prepared by Diamond Materials, Freiburg (Germany), average grain size at growth site was around 80 m, the range of xenon ions was R= 11.5 m. The intensity of several bands grows with ion fluence thus confirming radiation-induced origin of the defects responsible for these bands. The recovery of radiation damage has been investigated via isochronal (stepwise) thermal annealing procedure up to 650Â°C, while all spectra were measured at room temperature. Based on these spectra, the annealing kinetics of several defects, in particular carbon vacancies (GR1 centers with a broad band 2 eV) and complementary C-interstitial-related defects ( 4 eV), as well as vacancies located nearby nitrogen substitutional atoms (narrow bands around 2.5 eV) have been constructed. The experimental kinetics have also been analyzed in terms of the diffusion-controlled bimolecular reactions. The migration energies of tentatively interstitial atoms (mobile components in recombination process) are obtained, their dependence on the irradiation fluences is discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5edc16fd77a68dfc82334bccaa8477a1ed963bb943ea83ef25e18ee4b931e1c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
