{"title":"Variation in defensive spines across juvenile instars of Daphnia magna","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/4/452/7713085?rss=1","date":1720828800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Various species of freshwater zooplankton feature defensive spines, spikes or spinules across a comparatively wide size range. Among those is <span>Daphnia magna</span>, which has previously been found to express an enhanced spinescence in response to the predatory tadpole shrimp <span>Triops cancriformis</span>. This involves an elongated tail-spine, further protruding fornices and elongated, as well as further spread spinules along its carapace margins. Of these, the predator-induced trait changes concerning the spinules of <span>D. magna</span> at the age of first reproduction are known. However, their morphological development throughout the juvenile instars, in comparison to the changes of the prominent tail spine during the same periods, has thus far been unclear. Our study shows that <span>D. magna</span> expresses spinules across all investigated juvenile instars. Furthermore, during ontogeny, the development of <span>D. magna</span>â€™s rather small spinescence traits, i.e. the dorsal and ventral mean spinule length, as well as the dorsal spinules bearing area, in response to predation pressure, differs distinctly from that of the prominent tail-spine. Thus, our study provides further insight into the connectedness of traits contributing to the overall defensively enhanced spinescence of <span>D. magna</span>, with possible implications for the functional benefit of the traits at certain developmental periods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"2c31c444554bdc029da260b5abbef27df231e4a4ebc17a7cb70d06db99ed0d02","category":"Environment"}
