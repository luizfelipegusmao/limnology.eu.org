Particularly, YTiO3 is a ferromagnetic Mott insulator with strong electron correlation effects and orbital ordering, so it is a good candidate for electronic applications. In this research, we investigate the structural, elastic, and electronic properties of Y1-xSrxTiO3 (x=0.01, 0.10, 0.50, 0.99) perovskites within the Pm3m space group using density functional theory (DFT) to improve mechanical properties while preserving electronic properties. Initial geometry optimizations were performed using the GGA-PBE functional with a 6×6×6 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. The study utilized the CASTEP code with ultrasoft pseudopotentials for DFT calculations. Complete structural relaxations were achieved, and the elastic constants which confirm the mechanical stability of the materials were determined using the finite strain theory. The electronic properties were analyzed through band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) calculations. Despite variations in band structures due to Sr doping, no bandgap was observed, indicating the metallic nature of the compounds. The study highlights that p and d orbitals are predominant in electronic states. The findings suggest that Sr doping significantly influences the elastic properties, making these materials potentially valuable for various applications requiring robust mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ffd1d90e24d5ef0bfe23e3d0241a45bbd585e893bf59a668fc069d1e6b14bda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
