{"title":"Information and Modular Evolution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1607/v1","date":1719211422000,"content":"The study is based on information as the property of matter and its evolution from chemical to digital information. Consequences of these forms of information include molecular, modular, cel-lular, non-human, and human individual interactions, as well as human-machine interaction, and the formation of corresponding modules through self-organizing selective processes. The function of modular structures is decision-making and is analogous to the behavior of an intelligent agent. The evolutionary modular model is proposed based on the interaction of evolutionary factors (matter, energy, information, self-organization, natural selection, and heritability) among themselves and with the arrow of time. In conclusion, we realize that the essence of the evolution of living organ-isms is modular evolution. Modules through which the survival and reproduction of living organ-isms is ensured, are formed by two basic molecular processes, which are molecular recognition or information and modular self-organization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66551b08e2e4acfd430d85f6565e973cb50130fb58238bca4c6fe8be407268ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
