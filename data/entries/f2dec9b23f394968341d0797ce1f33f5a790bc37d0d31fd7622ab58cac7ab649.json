{"title":"Features of adaptive phase correction of optical wave distortions under conditions of intensity fluctuations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1677/v1","date":1714041634000,"content":"An analysis of the features of measurements and correction of phase distortions in optical waves propagating in the atmosphere at various levels of turbulence was performed. It is shown that with increasing intensity fluctuations, the limiting capabilities of phase correction decrease, and the phase of an optical wave that has passed through a turbulence layer consists of two components: potential and vortex. It was found that even in the region of weak fluctuations there is an overlap of spectral filtering functions for intensity and phase fluctuations. Areas of turbulence inhomogeneities have been identified that will have mutual influence and negatively affect the operation of the phase meter. It is noted that correlation functions, both phase and intensity, are less susceptible to this compared to structural functions. The results of experimental studies of the reconstruction of the wavefront of  laser radiation distorted by atmospheric turbulence using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor during vignetting and central screening of the entrance pupil of the optical system are presented. Studies have been carried out on the propagation of laser radiation along a horizontal atmospheric path for various levels of turbulence. The results are analyzed in terms of Zernike polynomials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2dec9b23f394968341d0797ce1f33f5a790bc37d0d31fd7622ab58cac7ab649","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
