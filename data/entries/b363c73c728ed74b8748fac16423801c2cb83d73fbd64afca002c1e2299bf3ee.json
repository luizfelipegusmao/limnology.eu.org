{"title":"Revealing Hidden Genes in Botrytis cinerea: New Insights into Genes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Secondary Metabolites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0687/v1","date":1712726652000,"content":"Utilizing bioinformatics tools, this study expands our understanding of secondary metabolism in Botrytis cinerea, identifying novel genes within polyketide synthase (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), sesquiterpene cyclase (STC), diterpene cyclase (DTC), and dimethylal-lyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) families. These findings enrich the genetic framework associ-ated with B. cinerea's pathogenicity and ecological adaptation, offering insights into uncharted metabolic pathways. Significantly, the discovery of previously unannotated genes provides new molecular targets for developing targeted antifungal strategies, promising to enhance crop pro-tection and advance our understanding of fungal biochemistry. This research not only broadens the scope of known secondary metabolites but also opens avenues for future exploration into B. cinerea's biosynthetic capabilities, potentially leading to novel antifungal compounds. Our work underscores the importance of integrating bioinformatics and genomics for fungal research, paving the way for sustainable agricultural practices by pinpointing precise molecular interven-tions against B. cinerea. This study sets a foundation for further investigations into the fungus's secondary metabolism, with implications for biotechnology and crop disease management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b363c73c728ed74b8748fac16423801c2cb83d73fbd64afca002c1e2299bf3ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
