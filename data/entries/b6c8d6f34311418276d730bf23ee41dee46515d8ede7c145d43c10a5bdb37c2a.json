{"title":"Respiratory Trajectories and Correlation with Serum Biochemical Indices in Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0523/v1","date":1725621516000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The primary life-threatening complication in Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is ventilatory failure, which results from the weakening of the bulbar and respiratory muscles. However, systematic studies assessing respiratory function over the long-term have not been performed. The present study analyzes the longitudinal patterns of respiratory function tests over a follow-up of 11 years, aiming to identify any potential, sustained decline during this time. Furthermore, we explored possible correlations between respiratory function tests and clinical and biochemical serum indices.\nMethods: We collected data from 9 genetically confirmed SBMA patients and conducted spirometric measurements twice a year for eleven years. The spirometric data included maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC)]. Additionally, we measured serum biochemical indices and SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS) for clinical analysis. \nResults: All three respiratory function tests showed a descending trend. A major decrease was observed for MEP (52%) and MIP (42%), while this was minor for FVC (25%). SBMAFRS score correlated with the three pulmonary function tests. MIP and MEP correlated with creatine phosphokinase and creatinine levels, and FVC correlated with serum level of transaminases. \nConclusions: This longitudinal study shows a progressive decline of spirometric data throughout life in patients with SBMA. Spirometric measures relative to maximal strength of the respiratory muscles (MIP and MEP) may have a better predictive value for pulmonary and muscular decline than FVC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6c8d6f34311418276d730bf23ee41dee46515d8ede7c145d43c10a5bdb37c2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
