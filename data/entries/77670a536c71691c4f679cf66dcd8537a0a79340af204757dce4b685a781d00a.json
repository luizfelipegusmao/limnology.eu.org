However, little is known about its biology, particularly with respect to its parental SFB population. This study compared the salinity tolerances of Kenyan (KEN) population, their SFB progenitors and those of Great Salt Lake (GSL) populations. Growth and survival of these <i>A. franciscana</i> populations were evaluated under varying salinity levels in a laboratory set up. <i>A. franciscana</i> nauplii were cultured at a rate of 1 nauplii/mL in 36 Erlenmeyer flasks and fed microalgae (<i>Chaetoceros</i> sp.) at 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/animal/day for 8 days. Survival was evaluated daily and survivors were fixed in individual vials with Lugol solution. The total length of each fixed <i>A. franciscana</i> nauplii <i>specimen</i> was measured under a compound microscope. All populations were susceptible to salinities greater than 100 g/L. Compared with the parental SFB population, the KEN population exhibited significantly reduced survival and growth at 140 g/L, suggesting a narrower salinity tolerance range. These findings underscore the need for further studies focusing on other physiological parameters, abiotic factors and genetic characterization to confirm whether the KEN population is experiencing ecological adaptation. This will contribute to the optimization of <i>Artemia</i> practices in various salinity environments as a result of climate change.</p>","author":"Morine M. Ngarari, \nSheban M. Hinzano, \nMary A.
