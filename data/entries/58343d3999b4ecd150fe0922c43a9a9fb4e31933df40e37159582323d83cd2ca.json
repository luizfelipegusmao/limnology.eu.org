{"title":"Hemodynamic Evaluation of Coronary Artery Lesions After Kawasaki Disease: Comparison of FFR During Cardiac Catheterization With MFR During 13N-Ammonia PET","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1579/v1","date":1719218842000,"content":"Coronary artery lesions (CALs) after Kawasaki disease present complex coronary hemodynamics. We investigated the relationship between coronary fractional flow reserve (FFR), myocardial blood flow reserve (MFR), and myocardial blood flow volume fraction (MBF), and their clinical usefulness in CALs after Kawasaki disease. Nineteen patients (18 male, 1 female) who underwent cardiac catheterization and 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography, with 24 coronary artery branches, were included. Five branches had inconsistent FFR and MFR values, two had normal FFR but abnormal MFR, and three had abnormal FFR and normal MFR. The abnormal MFR group had significantly higher MBF at rest than the normal group (0.86±0.13 vs. 1.08±0.09, p=0.001). The abnormal FFR group had significantly lower MBF at adenosine loading than the normal group (2.23±0.23 vs. 1.88±0.29, p=0.021). The three branches with abnormal FFR only had stenotic lesions, but the MFR may have been normal because blood was supplied by collateral vessels. Combining FFR, MFR, and MBF will enable a more accurate assessment of peripheral coronary circulation and stenotic lesions in CALs and help determine treatment strategy and timing of intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58343d3999b4ecd150fe0922c43a9a9fb4e31933df40e37159582323d83cd2ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
