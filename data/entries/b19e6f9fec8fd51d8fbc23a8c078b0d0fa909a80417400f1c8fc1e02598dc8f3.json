{"title":"PSX-2 Productive performance of Raramuri Criollo, Angus x Raramuri Criollo and Hereford x Angus cows in a low-input cow-calf system in northern Mexico","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/456/7757623?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Raramuri Criollo cattle (RC), a local heritage breed in the Chihuahua state of Mexico, are highly rustic and well-adapted animals that can contribute to cow productivity in a low-input cow-calf production system. The aim was to evaluate traits related to productive performance of purebred RC, Angus x RC (AC) and Hereford x Angus (HA) cows. Each cow breed group was randomly assigned to one of three pastures within each of two mountains dominant exposures and evaluated during 2022 and 2023 at Rancho Teseachi (28<sup>◦</sup>48′ N, 107<sup>◦</sup>25′ W) belonging to Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua. The six grazing pastures ranged from 263 to 400 ha, with similar slope, altitude and water sources characteristics. The stocking rate was moderate (forage utilization &lt;50%). Forage biomass availability for the period of use was sampled in October, and stocking rate adjusted accordingly in March. RC cows were bred with RC bulls, and AC and HA with Angus bulls. The breeding season was from September to November, and pregnancy diagnosis at mid-January. Non-pregnant cows were replaced by pregnant cows from other pastures of the same farm. Feed supplementation was limited in 2022 and according to nutritional requirements in 2023. Evaluated variables included calf birth (BW) and weaning weight adjusted (WW) to the average age at weaning (190 d in 2022 and 165 d in 2023); body condition score (BCS 1 to 9), cow body weight (CBW) at the beginning of the breeding season, as well as body weight of calf weaned by unit of cow weight (WW/CBW), and pregnancy rate (PR). A general linear model with fixed effects of breed group, sex, dominant exposure of mountains, their interaction, cow age subclass (Young, 4 yr; Middle, 5 to 8 yr; Adult, &gt; 9 yr) and Julian date at calving as a covariate was adjusted using PROC GLM of SAS for continuous, normally distributed variables, and PROC CATMOD for pregnancy rate, leaving out sex and interaction effects. Means of BW and WW on calves from AC and HA cows were greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.5) than those from RC cows in both years (Table 1). In 2022, the mean CBW of HA was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.5) than for AC, and this greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.5) than for RC cows; BCS was greater for AC than for HA and RC, and PR lower (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.5) for HA than for AC and RC. In 2023, there was no difference in CBW between AC and HA; BCS was similar (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) among the three groups; and PR was the lowest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.5) for HA. The AC cows had the greatest WW/CBW mean (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.5) in both years. Overall, using AC cows resulted on a combination of traits that outperformed on general productivity in the evaluated production system.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b19e6f9fec8fd51d8fbc23a8c078b0d0fa909a80417400f1c8fc1e02598dc8f3","category":"Environment"}
