{"title":"Influence of proportion of Brahman genetics on productivity of Brahman–Angus cows at weaning","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae093/7688959?rss=1","date":1717632000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the association between the proportion of Brahman genetics and productivity of Brahman–Angus cows at weaning using a 31-yr dataset containing 6,312 cows and 5,405 pregnancies. Cows were contemporaneously reared and enrolled in yearly breeding seasons under subtropical conditions of North-Central Florida. They were evenly distributed in six-breed groups (G) according to the proportion of Brahman genetics: G0% to 19%, G21% to 34%, G38% (Brangus), G41% to 59%, G63% to 78%, and G81% to 100%. The proportion of cows calving (84.9%) did not differ across the six-breed groups. However, cows in the G81% to 100% weaned fewer calves (90.8%) than cows in the G0% to 19% and G21% to 34% (95.7%, each). The weaning rate of cows in the G38% (94.3%), G41% to 59% (94.2%), and G63% to 78% (93.0%) was intermediate between these three breed groups. The preweaning calf mortality was greater for cows in the G81% to 100% (9.2%) than cows in the G0% to 19% and G21% to 34% (4.3%, each), but intermediate for cows in the G38% (5.7%), G41% to 59% (5.8%), and G63% to 78% (7.0%). Cows in the G81% to 100% also weaned lighter calves (220.6 kg) than cows in the G0% to 19% (245.2 kg), G21% to 34% (250.2 kg), G38% (247.9 kg), G41% to 59% (252.5 kg), and G63% to 78% (245.2 kg). Cows in the G0% to 19% weaned lighter calves than cows with 21% to 78% of Brahman genetics. The 205-d adjusted weaning weight evidenced the less productive results of cows in G0% to 19% and G81% to 100% compared with other genetic groups, as they calved at the fastest and slowest rate, respectively. Thus, the 205-d adjusted weaning weight eliminated this bias. Additionally, younger cows weaned lighter calves; and male calves were heavier at weaning than female calves. Both parity order of cow and calf sex altered the magnitude of the described association between breed group of cows and calf weaning weights. Overall, after adjusting for weaning rate and age of calves at weaning, the number of kilograms produced per cow submitted to reproduction was less for cows in the G0% to 19% (191.1 kg) and G81% to 100 (181.8 kg) compared with cows in the G21% to 34 (197.0 kg), G38 (195.9 kg), G41% to 59 (199.7), and G63% to 78 (196.2). Cows in the G81% to 100% were the least productive. Thus, a proportion of Brahman genetics between 21% and 78% ensured superior productivity of Brahman–Angus cows subjected to subtropical conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"5ed0ed6f1fab2ae907ba41d81c6c202eefa219bdeae5b243e2072cdaad8abc8f","category":"Environment"}
