The results showed that under the condition of the optimal filling rate of 40%, the average removal rates of BOD<sub>5</sub>, COD, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, TN, and TP in the AA-MBBR system were 93.63%, 90.02%, 81.25%, 80.07%, and 74.51%, respectively, and the effluent COD was 143.05 mg/L and the effluent NH<sub>3</sub>-N was 37.03 mg/L; the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the AA-MBBR system with the optimal fill rate was 595, which was higher than 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50%, and it was also found that the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria (DNB) and polyphosphate bacteria (Paos) increased with the increase of biofilm fill rate, DNB increased by about 32.9% at TCL (fill rate) 40 compared to TCL10, Paos increased by about 21.6% at TCL30 compared to TCL10. the AA-MBBR system with a fill rate of 40% showed better pollutant removal than the other systems with other fill rates The bacterial diversity was higher than that of the systems with other filling rates.</p>","author":"Xianpai Peng, \nYongchen Zong, \nJunhao You, \nJun Wang, \nChunhui Fu, \nJiaao Ji, \nDongyan Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"08d39d4fd3a0b14a5c8a7b2e765790ae0a38bbdc966f35e59a8c23e663a175ed","category":"Environment"}
