Adequate oxygen supply is an essential prerequisite to keep OXPHOS operational. At least two spatially distinct mitochondrial subpopulations facilitate OXPHOS in cardiomyocytes, i.e. subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM). Their intracellular localization below the sarcolemma or buried deep between the sarcomeres suggests different oxygen availability. Here, we studied SSM and IFM isolated from piglet hearts and found significantly lower activities of electron transport chain enzymes and F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase in IFM, indicative for compromised energy metabolism. To test the contribution of oxygen availability to this outcome, we ventilated piglets under hyperbaric hyperoxic (HBO) conditions for 240â€…min. HBO treatment raised OXPHOS enzyme activities in IFM to the level of SSM. Complexome profiling analysis revealed that a high proportion of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase in the IFM was in a disassembled state prior to the HBO treatment. Upon increased oxygen availability, the enzyme was found to be largely assembled, which may account for the observed increase in OXPHOS complex activities. Although HBO also induced transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, a full proteome analysis revealed only minimal alterations, meaning that HBO-mediated tissue remodeling is an unlikely cause for the observed differences in OXPHOS. We conclude that a previously unrecognized oxygen-regulated mechanism endows cardiac OXPHOS with spatiotemporal plasticity that may underlie the enormous metabolic and contractile adaptability of the heart.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"8104a9028cb4b80a5571c5a392a35e1b566d466f646ca0b93b307ff9ffc73dca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
