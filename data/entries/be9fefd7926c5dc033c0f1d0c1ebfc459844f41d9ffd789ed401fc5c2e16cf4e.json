{"title":"A New Approach for the Circular Inversion in l1- Normed Spaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1453/v1","date":1716383522000,"content":"While there are well-known synthetic methods in the literature to find the image of a point under circular inversion in l2−normed geometry (Euclidean geometry), there is no similar synthetic method in Minkowski geometry, also known as the geometry of finite-dimensional Banach spaces. In this study, we have succeeded in giving a synthetic construction for the circular inversion in l1−normed spaces, which is one of the most fundamental examples of Minkowski geometry. Moreover, this synthetic construction has been given using the Euclidean circle, independently of the l1−norm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be9fefd7926c5dc033c0f1d0c1ebfc459844f41d9ffd789ed401fc5c2e16cf4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
