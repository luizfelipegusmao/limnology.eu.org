{"title":"Hasty generalizations and generics in medical research: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306749","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Uwe Peters, Henrik RÃ¸ed Sherling, Benjamin Chin-Yee</p>\r\n\r\nIt is unknown to what extent medical researchers generalize study findings beyond their samples when their sample size, sample diversity, or knowledge of conditions that support external validity do not warrant it. It is also unknown to what extent medical researchers describe their results with precise quantifications or unquantified generalizations, i.e., generics, that can obscure variations between individuals. We therefore systematically reviewed all prospective studies (<i>n</i> = 533) published in the top four highest ranking medical journals, <i>Lancet</i>, <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> (<i>NEJM</i>), <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA</i>), and the <i>British Medical Journal</i> (<i>BMJ</i>), from January 2022 to May 2023. We additionally reviewed all <i>NEJM Journal Watch</i> clinical research summaries (<i>n</i> = 143) published during the same time. Of all research articles reporting prospective studies, 52.5% included generalizations beyond specific national study populations, with the numbers of articles with generics varying significantly between journals (<i>JAMA</i> = 12%; <i>Lancet</i> = 77%) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>V</i> = 0.48). There was no evidence that articles containing broader generalizations or generics were correlated with larger or more nationally diverse samples. Moreover, only 10.2% of articles with generalizations beyond specific national populations reported external validity strengthening factors that could potentially support such extrapolations. There was no evidence that original research articles and <i>NEJM Journal Watch</i> summaries intended for practitioners differed in their use of broad generalizations, including generics. Finally, from the journal with the highest citation impact, articles containing broader conclusions were correlated with more citations. Since there was no evidence that studies with generalizations beyond specific national study populations or with generics were associated with larger, more nationally diverse samples, or with reports of population similarity that may permit extensions of conclusions, our findings suggest that the generalizations in many articles were insufficiently supported. Caution against overly broad generalizations in medical research is warranted.","author":"Uwe Peters","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7b5ceb8b4b0aef4189a58389e2327835f915ee9e38507f427a1726005cf99754","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
