{"title":"Assessment of the Effectiveness of Vibration Therapy and Passive Rest on the Recovery of Muscular Strength and Plasma Lactate Levels in the Upper Limbs After Intense Anaerobic Exercise in Elite Boxers and Kickboxers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1867/v1","date":1716893981000,"content":"Background/Objectives: High-intensity anaerobic physical training frequently results in muscle damage among boxers and kickboxers, which can impede performance and recovery. Vibrational therapy (VT) and passive rest (PR) have been employed as methods to enhance muscular recovery and performance. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these two recovery methods on upper limb muscle strength and lactate levels in plasma after high-intensity exertion. Methods: Eighteen elite boxers and kickboxers, aged 19-32 years, underwent tests employing VT and PR as recovery methods in a controlled, crossover study. Muscle performance was assessed via isokinetic dynamometry, and lactate levels were measured pre-exercise, post-exercise, and post-recovery. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the relevant bioethics committee. Results: The results showed that VT led to a faster recruitment of muscle fibers and improved muscle endurance as indicated by decreased fatigue work indices compared to PR. However, no significant differences were observed in peak torque or lactate levels between the two recovery methods. The VT group exhibited quicker recovery times in torque generation and better performance in fatigue resistance. Conclusions: VT appears to provide superior muscular recovery compared to PR following intense anaerobic effort, particularly in terms of muscle strength endurance and activation speed. These findings support the potential of VT in sports recovery protocols, although similar lactate response suggests that metabolic recovery rates are not significantly affected.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be71492136088ab84cd560a09f1f3852ddf1510fc1fb4f10a865f7bed5a9269a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
