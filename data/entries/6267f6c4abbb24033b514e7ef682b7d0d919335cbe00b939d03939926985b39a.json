{"title":"Organic Aquaculture Regulation, Production, and Marketing: Current Status, Issues, and Future Prospects—A Systematic Review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5521188?af=R","date":1727363104000,"content":"<p>The aquaculture industry will be crucial in helping the world’s food supply and keep up with the demand. Aquaculture, like agriculture, must expand and develop sustainably in all the countries to keep up with the rising demand for food. To this end, the aquaculture industry has forged new scientific and technological frontiers in pursuit of long-term food security. Among these is organic aquaculture, whose distinctive protocol has great potential to advance aquaculture. Organic aquaculture is being explored for multiple reasons, encompassing the aim to minimize environmental footprints, fulfill escalating consumer appetites for seafood, and contend within the industry this paper endeavors to address the gaps in current literature by offering an exhaustive overview of various aspects of organic aquaculture. This encompasses its regulation, production methods, food quality, environmental impact, economic viability, as well as socioeconomic and marketing aspects. It is necessary to acquire more knowledge about organic farming techniques before switching over to organic aquaculture on a large scale. Organic regulation, production, food quality, economic performance, and social and marketing issues are at the top. This review found that consumers lack understanding of organic principles, and regulations are inconsistently applied. However, organic aquaculture promotes social equality by protecting producers’ rights to work without discrimination based on gender, race, or sexual orientation factors that ultimately boost the industry’s popularity. Organic aquaculture viability varies depending on factors like feed costs, fixed expenses, and the premium pricing sensitivity, making it unfeasible for certain species. However, from both societal and economic standpoints, organic aquaculture appears most suitable for implementation in developing nations.</p>","author":"Mirza Masum Beg, \nSubha M.
