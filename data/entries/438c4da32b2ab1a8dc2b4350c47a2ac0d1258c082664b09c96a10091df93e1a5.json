{"title":"Epidemiological Characterization of Dengue Virus Serotypes in Mexico: Implications for Disease Severity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0992/v1","date":1710743243000,"content":"Dengue fever remains a persistent threat in Mexico, with cyclical outbreaks driven by the circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes. The sudden emergence of DENV-3 in 2023 raised questions about its epidemiological significance and potential implications for disease severity. This study aimed to characterize dengue virus serotypes by age and their association with disease severity, considering sex, time, and the origin of clinical samples. A retrospective analysis was conducted on dengue laboratory results obtained from the epidemiological surveillance system in Mexico during 2023. Descriptive statistics summarized the prevalence of dengue virus serotypes, while bivariate analysis utilized an adjusted Chi-squared test to assess associations with demographic variables. Multivariate analysis using unconditional logistic regression evaluated the relationship between dengue virus serotypes and disease severity, adjusting for potential confounders. Additionally, co-infections were identified and analyzed. Results revealed DENV-3 as the most prevalent serotype (63.9%), with co-infection involving two serotypes detected in 0.75% of cases. DENV-2 exhibited a higher median age compared to other serotypes. Pregnant women in their last trimester faced elevated risks of hospitalization and mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated a stronger association between DENV-2 and hospitalization. However, co-infection did not significantly influence disease severity. The unexpected predominance of DENV-3 underscores the dynamic nature of dengue virus circulation in Mexico. Despite its prevalence, DENV-2 demonstrated a stronger association with hospitalization, highlighting the importance of serotype-specific surveillance and management strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"438c4da32b2ab1a8dc2b4350c47a2ac0d1258c082664b09c96a10091df93e1a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
