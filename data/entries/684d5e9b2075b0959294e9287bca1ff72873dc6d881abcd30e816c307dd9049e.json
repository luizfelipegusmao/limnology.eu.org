{"title":"A review on Machine Learning Deployment Patterns and Key Features in the Prediction of Preeclampsia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0725/v1","date":1718107482000,"content":"Previous reviews have investigated machine learning (ML) models used to predict the risk of developing preeclampsia but have not described how the ML models are intended to be deployed throughout pregnancy or feature performance. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the existing ML models and their intended deployment patterns and performance along with identified features of high importance. This review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Engineering Village, and the Association for Computing Machinery were searched between January and February 2024. A total of 86 studies were found of which 14 were included. Out of 12 studies, eight showed the intent to use the ML model as a single-use, two intended a dual-use, and two intended multiple-use. A total of seven studies listed the features of the highest importance. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were listed along with mean arterial pressure to be of high importance. Out of four studies intending to use the ML model more than a single-use, three of them were conducted in the years 2023 and 2024, whereas the remaining study is from 2011. No ML model emerged as superior across the subgroups of PE. Utilizing body mass index and either mean arterial pressure or diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure may benefit the performance. The deployment patterns are mainly single use being within the gestation weeks 11+0 to 14+1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"684d5e9b2075b0959294e9287bca1ff72873dc6d881abcd30e816c307dd9049e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
