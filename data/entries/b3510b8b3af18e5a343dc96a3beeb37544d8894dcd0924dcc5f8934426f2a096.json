{"title":"Recent Advances in Numerical Simulation of Ejector Pumps for Vacuum Generation: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1616/v1","date":1721619729000,"content":"This review paper provides an overview of recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of ejector pumps for vacuum generation. It examines various turbulence models, multiphase flow approaches, and numerical techniques employed to capture complex flow phenomena like shock waves, mixing, phase transitions, and heat/mass transfer. Emphasis is placed on comprehensive assessment of flow characteristics within ejectors, including condensation effects such as nucleation, droplet growth, and non-equilibrium conditions. The review highlights efforts in optimizing ejector geometries and operating parameters to enhance the entrainment ratio, a crucial performance metric for ejectors. The studies reviewed encompass diverse working fluids, flow regimes, and geometric configurations, underscoring the significance of ejector technology across various industries. While substantial progress has been made in developing advanced simulation techniques, several challenges persist, including accurate modeling of real gas behavior, phase change kinetics, and coupled heat/mass transfer phenomena. Future research efforts should focus on developing robust multiphase models, implementing advanced turbulence modeling techniques, integrating machine learning based optimization methods, and exploring novel ejector configurations for emerging applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3510b8b3af18e5a343dc96a3beeb37544d8894dcd0924dcc5f8934426f2a096","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
