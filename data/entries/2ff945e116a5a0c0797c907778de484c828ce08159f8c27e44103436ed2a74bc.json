{"title":"NPCC4: Climate change and New York City's health risk","link":"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.15115?af=R","date":1719340411000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This chapter of the New York City Panel on Climate Change 4 (NPCC4) report considers climate health risks, vulnerabilities, and resilience strategies in New York City's unique urban context. It updates evidence since the last health assessment in 2015 as part of NPCC2 and addresses climate health risks and vulnerabilities that have emerged as especially salient to NYC since 2015. Climate health risks from heat and flooding are emphasized. In addition, other climate-sensitive exposures harmful to human health are considered, including outdoor and indoor air pollution, including aeroallergens; insect vectors of human illness; waterborne infectious and chemical contaminants; and compounding of climate health risks with other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-informed strategies for reducing future climate risks to health are considered.</p>","author":"Thomas Matte, \nKathryn Lane, \nJenna F.
