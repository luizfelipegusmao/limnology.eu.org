{"title":"73 Effects of blend of organic acids and monoglycerides on immune responses of weaned pigs experimentally infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F18","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/39/7664731?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our previous research implies that dietary supplementation of organic acids blend, monoglycerides blend, and the combination of both can mitigate diarrhea of weaned pigs infected with <span>Escherichia coli</span> (<span>E. coli</span>) F18. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with a blend of organic acids, a blend of monoglycerides, or the combination of both on immune responses of weaned pigs experimentally infected with E. coli F18. Forty pigs [average body weight (BW) = 7.81 ± 0.84 kg] were individually housed and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups with 10 replicate pigs per treatment. The four dietary treatments were: () Control: nursery basal diet, 2) Acids: basal diet supplemented with a blend of organic acids (formic acid, lactic acid, and sodium formate) at 0.3%, 3) Monoglycerides: basal diet supplemented with a blend of monoglycerides of fatty acids at 0.3%, or 4) Combination of acids and monoglycerides: basal diet added with the acids blend at 0.2% and the monoglycerides blend at 0.2%. The experiment lasted 28 d, with 7 d before and 21 d after the first inoculation (d 0). All pigs were orally inoculated with <span>E. coli</span> F18 (10<sup>10</sup> CFU/3 mL) for 3 consecutive days from d 0. Serum samples were collected on d 0, 2, 5, and 14 post-inoculation (PI) to measure the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin using ELISA. Porcine Cytokine/Chemokine13-Plex Discovery Assay (Eve Technology, Canada) was also conducted with serum samples from d 0, 5, and 14 PI. Data were analyzed by ANOVA using PROC MIXED of SAS with a randomized complete block design. The concentrations of serum CRP and haptoglobin were increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) on d 2 PI and then gradually decreased on d 5 and 14 PI. However, no differences were observed in serum CRP and haptoglobin concentrations among all treatment groups throughout the experiment. Pigs fed with monoglycerides tended (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) to have decreased serum granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1α), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentrations on d 0 PI compared with other treatments. Pigs supplemented with monoglycerides also tended (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) to have decreased GM-CSF on d 5 PI and less IL-1α on d 14 PI among all treatments. Supplementation of the combination tended (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) to have greater GM-CSF concentration on d 5 PI compared with other treatments. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of monoglycerides blend or the combination of organic acids and monoglycerides alleviates systemic inflammation of weaned pigs during <span>E. coli</span> F18 infection by modulating related cytokines. However, additional research is needed to understand the modulation mechanisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"382814b49903ff30ad3279f5dc79c0dc9766c82777f87a62e7772dd17396b877","category":"Environment"}
