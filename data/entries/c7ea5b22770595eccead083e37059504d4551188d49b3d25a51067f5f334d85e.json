{"title":"100 Impact of luteal blood perfusion and estrus expression on pregnancy rates of beef cows exposed to embryo transfer","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/267/7757289?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study aimed to evaluate the impact of luteal blood perfusion and estrus expression on pregnancy rates of beef cows exposed to fixed-timed embryo transfer (FTET). Postpartum beef cows (n = 763) from 22 locations were exposed to a 7-d Select Synch + controlled internal drug releasing (CIDR) and breeding indicator patches were affixed upon CIDR removal. Estrus expression was assessed twice daily for 72 h and a 100-µg injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone was administered to cows that failed to express estrus 72 h after CIDR removal. Brightness mode ultrasonography of the corpus luteum (CL) was conducted to select recipients for FTET 9 d after CIDR removal. Suitable recipients were assigned to receive a single fresh or frozen embryo derived from either in vitro (IVF) or in vivo (IVD) method. After embryo recipient selection, CL morphometries and blood perfusion (BP) were then assessed at the time of embryo transfer via transrectal ultrasonography. Embryo recipients were categorized according to CL area [small (&lt; 3 cm²), medium (3 to 4 cm²), or large (&gt; 4 cm²)] and based on the percentage of luteal area with blood perfusion signals [low (&lt; 25%), medium (25 to 45%), or high (&gt; 45%)]. Pregnancy diagnoses were performed between d 60 and 90 of gestation. Cows that failed to express estrus prior FTET had decreased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.02) luteal area, luteal diameter, and pregnancy rates compared with cows that expressed estrus. Luteal area category had no effect (<span>P</span> = 0.61) on pregnancy rates. Embryo recipients that expressed estrus had similar (<span>P</span> = 0.12) luteal blood perfusion compared with recipients that failed to express estrus. Embryo recipients with high (<span>P</span> = 0.02) and medium (<span>P</span> = 0.05) BP had greater pregnancy rates compared with embryo recipients with low BP. There was no interaction between estrus expression and luteal BP (<span>P</span> = 0.84). In summary, estrus expression and luteal BP positively impacted pregnancy rates to embryo transfer and may be used to facilitate embryo recipient selection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c7ea5b22770595eccead083e37059504d4551188d49b3d25a51067f5f334d85e","category":"Environment"}
