{"title":"Advancements in Imaging and Medical AI for the Management of Liver Disease ― Applications and Challenges in Personalized Care ―","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0215/v1","date":1727936415000,"content":"Liver disease can significantly impact life expectancy, making early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention critical challenges in medical care. Imaging diagnostics play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing liver diseases. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging analysis has become indispensable for healthcare. AI, trained on vast datasets of medical images, has sometimes demonstrated diagnostic accuracy that surpasses human experts. AI-assisted imaging diagnostics are expected to contribute significantly to the standardization of diagnostic quality. Furthermore, AI has the potential to identify image features imperceptible to humans, thereby playing an essential role in clinical decision-making. This capability enables physicians to formulate more accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Additionally, AI is anticipated to become a powerful tool in personalized medicine. By integrating individual patient imaging data with clinical information, AI can propose optimal treatment plans, making it an essential component in providing the most appropriate care for each patient. Current reports highlight the advantages of AI in managing liver diseases. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is expected to further advance personalized diagnostics and treatments, contributing to overall improvements in healthcare quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd773103e89949b770981ad348c6b7a7da95b534f0ffb46ec7d6232f372e1dec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
