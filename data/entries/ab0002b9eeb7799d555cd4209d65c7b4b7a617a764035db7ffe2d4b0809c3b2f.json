Mixed organic-inorganic particles possess distinctive physical and chemical properties that are not observed in pure particles, which depend sensitively on their composition and chemical mixing state [<a href=\"#ozae044.840-B1\">1</a>]. One of the most important properties is the hygroscopicity, which measures the ability for a particle to uptake moisture from the atmosphere. The presence of organic compounds can significantly affect the interaction between water vapor and inorganic salt [<a href=\"#ozae044.840-B2\">2</a>]. Prior studies have shown that mixed organic-inorganic aerosols can have either enhanced or decreased hygroscopicity, but the impact of mixing state on the water condensation process is not yet fully understood due to the lack of single particle experimental measurements with high spatial resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.840-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ab0002b9eeb7799d555cd4209d65c7b4b7a617a764035db7ffe2d4b0809c3b2f","category":"Environment"}
