{"title":"Immunomodulatory effect of different dietary ARA/EPA/DHA ratios in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) juveniles after infection with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16070?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The immunomodulatory effect of different dietary arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratios was evaluated in gilthead sea bream juveniles after intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with formalin-killed <i>Photobacterium damselae</i> subsp. <i>piscicida</i> (<i>Phdp</i>). Fish were fed with four isoproteic (47% crude protein) and isolipidic (18% crude lipids) diets with the following long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) ratios: Diet A (2.0% ARA: 0.2% EPA: 0.1% DHA); Diet B (1.0% ARA: 0.4% EPA: 0.4% DHA); Diet C (0% ARA: 0.6% EPA: 0.6% DHA); Diet D (0% ARA: 0.3% EPA: 1.5% DHA). After being fed for 56 days with the experimental diets, fish from each dietary treatment were randomly selected and i.p. injected with 0.2 ml of killed <i>Phdp</i> (1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU ml<sup>−1</sup>) or phosphate-buffered saline (control group). Four and twenty-four hours (i.e., twice) after the i.p., the haematological profile, plasma humoral innate immune parameters, and the intestine expression of immune-related genes were assessed. Results showed that fish fed diet D (high DHA content) had increased complement activity and higher intestinal expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (<i>cox</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>2</i>\n</sub>) and interleukin 1β (<i>il-1β</i>) at 4 and 24 hours after i.p., as well as increased intestinal tumour necrosis factor α (<i>tnfα</i>) expression at 4 hours. On the other hand, fish fed with diet A (high ARA content) showed higher plasma bactericidal activity against <i>Phdp</i> than fish fed with diet D. Overall, the results of this study suggest a positive modulatory effect of DHA in response to the pathogenic agent.</p>","author":"Rui Magalhães, \nFrancisco Abellán Guardiola, \nInês Guerreiro, \nFilipa Fontinha, \nSara Moutinho, \nCláudia Reis Serra, \nRolf Erik Olsen, \nHelena Peres, \nAires Oliva‐Teles","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"14992140d3219ce9bf7bf381cbf2195bd73732b32e63f7ba0b5410edcfc1be42","category":"Environment"}
