{"title":"A New Evidence Preservation Forensics Model Using Blockchain and Stenography Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0703/v1","date":1710687677000,"content":"The adoption of technology and digital tools across various user groups has brought about a heightened risk of cyber-attacks targeting devices and shared data. These elevated levels of cybercrime necessitate thorough investigations to address victimsâ€™ inquiries about the nature, causes, affected data, and impacted resources of the attack. Digital forensics serves as a crucial means to answer these queries. Additionally, it enables the formulation of strategies and delineation of roles essential for fortifying future defenses against such attacks. Within digital forensics, digital evidence holds pivotal importance in the investigative process as it serves as a cornerstone in legal proceedings to identify perpetrators. Numerous research endeavors focus on devising solutions to safeguard evidence, including centralized storage centers or cloud computing. These efforts aim to create frameworks integrating diverse security levels for sharing and preserving evidence effectively. In this paper, a new framework is proposed that seeks to amalgamate novel technologies with forensic practices to address challenges in the preservation phase of digital forensics. Strategies include segmenting evidence into smaller components, leveraging steganography to support preservation, and employing blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of collected evidence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2857dc8ebba2db72faf5ae9b594bcc13dcc775012450c5147fda0d8d3ddc1b8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
