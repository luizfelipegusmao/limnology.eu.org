{"title":"Poly-L-Lactic Acid Scaffolds Additivated with Rosmarinic Acid: A Multi-Analytical Approach to Assess the Morphology, Thermal Behavior, and Hydrophilicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1744/v1","date":1714284924000,"content":"This study aims to demonstrate the possibility of incorporating a natural antioxidant biomolecule, into polymeric porous scaffolds. To this end, Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) scaffolds were produced using the Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) technique and additivated with different amounts of Rosmarinic Acid (RA). The scaffolds, with a diameter of 4 mm and a thickness of 2 mm, were characterized with a multi-analytical approach. Specifically, Scanning Electron Mi-croscopy analyses demonstrated the presence of an interconnected porous network, character-ized by a layer of RA at the level of the pore’s surfaces. Moreover, the presence of RA biomole-cules increased the hydrophilic nature of the sample, as evidenced by the decrease in contact angle with water from 128° to 76°. This approach is cost-effective, and it could be customized with different biomolecules, offering the possibility of producing porous polymeric structures con-taining antioxidant molecules. These scaffolds meet the requirements of tissue engineering and could be offered a potential solution to reduce inflammation associated with scaffold implantation thus improving tissue regeneration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4049fb62cc82dcb661f64607c88a1bee84ef507cc8ea85fcf8a963426ebd2a7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
