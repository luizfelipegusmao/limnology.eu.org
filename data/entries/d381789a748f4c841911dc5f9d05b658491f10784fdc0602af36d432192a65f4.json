{"title":"The Switching of the Type of a ROS Signal from Mitochondria: The Role of Respiratory Substrates and Permeability Transition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0024/v1","date":1727937085000,"content":"Flashes of superoxide anion (SA) in mitochondria are generated spontaneously or during the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and a sudden change in the metabolic state of a cell. Under certain conditions, SA can leave the mitochondrial matrix and perform signaling functions beyond mitochondria. In this work, we studied the kinetics of the release of SA and H2O2 from isolated mitochondria upon PTP opening and the modulation of the metabolic state of mitochondria by the substrates of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. It was found that PTP opening leads to suppression of H2O2 emission and activation of SA burst. When the induction of PTP was blocked by its antagonists (cyclosporine A, ruthenium red, EGTA), the level of substrates of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and the selective inhibitors of complexes I and V determined the type of ROS emitted by mitochondria. It was concluded that upon complete and partial reduction and complete oxidation of redox centers of the respiratory chain, mitochondria emit H2O2, SA, and nothing, respectively. The results indicate that the PTP- and substrate-dependent switching of the type of ROS leaving mitochondria may be the basis for SA- and H2O2-selective redox signaling in a cell.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d381789a748f4c841911dc5f9d05b658491f10784fdc0602af36d432192a65f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
