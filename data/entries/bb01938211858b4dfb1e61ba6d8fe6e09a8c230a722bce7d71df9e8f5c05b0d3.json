{"title":"Large-Scale Group Decision-Making Method with Public Participation and Its Application in Urban Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1714/v1","date":1716808050000,"content":"Civic participation is of great significance to urban management decision-making. In order to facilitate citizens to participate in city management decision-making, this paper proposes a large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) method based on multi-granular probabilistic linguistic preference relations (MG-PLPRs). First, each decision maker selects a language terms set from the multi-granularity language terms set to represent individual preference relations and the MG-PLPRs are obtained by statistical calculation to represent sub-groupâ€™s preferences information. Then, an optimization model based on the expected consistency of PLPR and consensus measure of groups is established to achieving consensus reaching processes, which can ensure satisfactory individual consistency and group consensus. Finally, the validity and applicability of the proposed method is verified by a case of a city \"shared garden\" site selection with the participation of citizens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb01938211858b4dfb1e61ba6d8fe6e09a8c230a722bce7d71df9e8f5c05b0d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
