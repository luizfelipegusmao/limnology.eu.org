{"title":"Aflatoxin M1 Contamination in Dairy Milk in Kathmandu, Nepal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0591/v1","date":1725864151000,"content":"Aflatoxins (AF), secondary metabolites produced by fungi, pose significant health risks, especially to children and adults. In developing countries like Nepal, the tropical climate promotes fungal growth, leading to high levels of AF in animal feed and milk. In this study, we investigated the incidence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) contamination in 84 milk samples collected from the Kathmandu district using the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) technique. We also interviewed farmers to gather information on feeding and storage practices. . All the collected milk samples were contaminated with AFM1, with 97.6% of the samples exceeding the European Union (EU) maximum permissible limit of 50 ppt. The majority (98.5%) of the farms included paddy straw, and all farms (100%) included concentrate in their feed regimen. Only half (52%) of the farms had proper storage facilities. Straw was mostly stored in sacks outdoors or left open in a shed, while concentrates were stored in a closed room or shed. The study reports very high contamination levels of AFM1 in the milk samples, presenting a serious public health issue, and recommends comprehensive surveillance and further investigation across the country, especially given the limited research and literature available.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88cf9c53f68121d71c6d1013e58baaffa4a102d4c35f53c6bf03d32e59202b71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
