{"title":"Research on Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Human Behavior Recognition Method Incorporating Multi-Granularity Features","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1179/v1","date":1728985543000,"content":"Aiming at the problem that the existing human skeleton behavior recognition methods are insensitive to human local movements and have inaccurate recognition in distinguishing similar behaviors, a multi-scale spatio-temporal graph convolution method incorporating multi-granularity features is proposed for human behavior recognition.Firstly, a skeleton fine-grained division strategy is proposed, which initializes the skeleton data into data streams of different granularities.Using a normalized Gaussian function, an adaptive cross scale feature fusion layer is designed for feature fusion between different granularities, and fine-grained features guide the model to focus on discriminative feature expressions between similar behaviors. Secondly, a sparse multi-scale adjacency matrix is introduced to solve the bias weighting problem that amplifies the multi-scale spatial domain modeling process under multi granularity conditions. Finally, an end-to-end graph convolutional neural network is constructed to improve the feature expression ability of spatio-temporal receptive field information and enhance the robustness of recognition between similar behaviors. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was verified on the public behavior recognition dataset MSR Action 3D, with a recognition rate of 95.67%, which is superior to most existing behavior recognition methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e73cb46866d49794483dbcdfe973705414609b40d1ec9527fbb89f4155989e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
