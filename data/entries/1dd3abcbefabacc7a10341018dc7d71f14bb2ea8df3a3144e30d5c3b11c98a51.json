Animals and plants in seasonally dry tropical forests often exhibit adaptations to cope with seasonal resource limitation. However, whether these adaptations will facilitate drought tolerance or increase drought vulnerability is unclear. Here, we combine long-term individual-based data on phenology, morphometrics, and demographics to investigate how drought impacts the food resources, health, reproduction, and behavior of a population of Verreaux's sifaka (<i>Propithecus verreauxi</i>), a critically endangered lemur inhabiting dry deciduous forests in Madagascar. Between December 2010 and May 2023, the population experienced 3 years of severe drought (2016, 2017, 2022). During green periods in severe drought, the availability of high-quality sifaka foods (young leaves, fruit) was significantly reduced and fruit tree mortality increased. This reduced availability of fruit persisted in the year after a drought, despite typical rainfall. Yet surprisingly, we found no negative effects on body condition or commonly-used metrics for reproductive success during drought years or years following a drought. Instead, sifaka exhibited significantly higher levels of subcutaneous body fat during severe droughts. We observed little change in sifaka behavior between drought and non-drought periods. However, they were more likely to lick dew during severe drought, and spent significantly less time feeding on young and mature leaves. They also significantly increased their time feeding on flowers and fruits, despite the reduced abundance of fruit in the habitat. Together, our results suggest that increased consumption of water-rich fruit and flowers during severe droughts could facilitate physiological mechanisms that help sifaka cope with water scarcity, including fructose-mediated fat storage, metabolic water production, and water conservation. These results provide new insights into how critically endangered animals may respond to climate change, suggesting that behavioral and physiological adaptations to seasonal resource limitation may buffer some mammals from the effects of severe drought or other extreme weather events.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>全球变暖正在改变栖息地并影响生物多样性，预计还将加剧许多地区的干旱化。季节性干旱热带森林中的动植物通常会表现出适应性，以应对季节性资源限制。然而，这些适应性是否会促进耐旱性亦或是降低对干旱的防御性还不清楚。在本文中，我们结合了基于个体的物候学、形态计量学和种群统计学的长期数据，阐释了干旱如何影响马达加斯加干燥落叶林栖息地内的极度濒危狐猴——维氏冕狐猴（<i>Propithecus verreauxi</i>）种群的食物资源、健康、繁殖和行为。在2010 年12月至2023年5月期间，维氏冕狐猴种群在2016 年、2017 年和 2022 年分别经历了三次严重的干旱。在严重干旱的绿期，优质食物（嫩叶、果实）的供应量显著减少，果树的死亡率也不断增加。尽管降雨量达到通常水平，在干旱后的一年里，水果供应减少的情况依然存在。然而，令人惊讶的是，我们发现在干旱期间或干旱后的年份里，维氏冕狐猴的身体健康状况或常见的繁殖成功率指标并没有受到负面影响。相反地，在严重干旱期间，维氏冕狐猴的皮下脂肪含量表现出明显升高。进一步，我们观察到，在干旱和非干旱时期，维氏冕狐猴的行为几乎没有变化。这可能是因为在严重干旱期间，它们更有可能通过舔食露水，从而明显减少在嫩叶和成熟树叶上取食的时间。尽管栖息地中的果实数量减少，但它们取食花朵和果实的时间却明显增加。总之，我们的研究结果表明，在严重干旱期间增加对富含水分的果实和花朵的 取食，可能有助于促进维氏冕狐猴应对缺水的生理机制，包括果糖介导的脂肪储存、代谢产水和节水。这些结果为极度濒危动物如何应对气候变化提供了新的视角，表明对季节性资源限制的行为和生理适应可能会使一些哺乳动物免受严重干旱或其他极端天气事件的影响。【审阅:周聪】</p>","author":"Carrie C.
