{"title":"Modelling, Design, and Application of Analog Pre-Distortion for the Linearity and Efficiency Enhancement of a K-Band Power Amplifier","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1674/v1","date":1727084920000,"content":"This paper presents the theory, design, and application of a dual-branch series-diode analog pre-distortion (APD) linearizer to improve the linearity and efficiency of a K-band high power amplifier (HPA). A first-of-its-kind, frequency-dependent large-signal APD model is presented. This model is used to evaluate different phase relationships between the linear and nonlinear branches, suggesting independent gain, and phase expansion characteristics with this topology. This model is used to assess the impact of diode resistance, capacitance, and ideality factor on the APD characteristics. This feature is showcased with two similar GaAs diodes to find the best fit for the considered HPA. The selected diode is characterized and modeled between 1-26.5 GHz. A comprehensive APD design and simulation workflow is reported. Before fabrication, the simulated APD is evaluated with the measured HPA to verify linearity improvements. The APD prototype achieves a large signal bandwidth of 6 GHz with 3 dB gain expansion and 8âˆ˜ phase rotation. This linearizer is demonstrated with a 17-21 GHz GaN HPA with 41 dBm output power and 35 % efficiency. Using a wideband 750 MHz signal, this APD improves the noise power ratio (NPR) by 6.5-8.2 dB over the whole HPA bandwidth. Next, the HPA output power is swept to compare APD vs. power back off for the same NPR. APD improves the HPA output power by 1-2 W and efficiency by approximately 5-9 % at 19 GHz. This efficiency improvement decreases by only 1-2 % when including the APD post-amplifier consumption, thus suggesting overall efficiency and output power improvements with APD at K-band frequencies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37ce2f68fad18d3221dbae7b0b1bfd709428e4e358278e4407c7c244e61495d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
