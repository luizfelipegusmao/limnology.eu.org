{"title":"Utilisation of Palm Frond Waste as Fuel for Co-firing Coal and Biomass in Tangentially Pulverized Coal Boiler Using Computational Fluid Dynamic (Cfd) Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2488/v1","date":1722344338000,"content":"Indonesia possesses significant biomass potential, including palm oil plantations. The palm oil industry has experienced rapid expansion, with a 7.67% growth rate over the past decade and an 11.09% annual increase in palm oil production. Co-firing (HT-FRD) is a beneficial technology for reducing exhaust gas emissions generated by coal-burning power stations. By utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the study has modeled and evaluated co-firing palm frond residue (HT-FRD) with hydrothermal treatment into a 315 MWe boiler. In the simulation, six different HT-FRD co-firing ratios: 0%, 5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, and 50% were used to demonstrate the differences in combustion characteristics and emissions in the combustion chamber. The data indicates that HT-FRD co-firing can enhance temperature distribution, velocity, and unburned particles. All in all, co-firing conditions with 5% - 15% HT-FRD ratios appear to have the most favorable combustion temperature, velocity, and exhaust gas characteristics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"885c10023916feced20bfbe8c43a96be3f21725eb9d42e28bed3c6c903dead7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
