{"title":"Wetted Ramps Selectively Block Upstream Passage of Adult Sea Lamprey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1990/v1","date":1719569146000,"content":"Dams fragment stream habitat and fishways around dams typically serve few species that are strong swimmers or jumpers. We test a prototype wetted ramp designed to allow upstream passage of small-bodied fishes while blocking upstream movement of invasive sea lamprey in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We tested short, smooth ramps with 5-10 mm water depth in various combinations of ramp angle, water flow and swim channel width with the aim to selectively block adult migrating sea lamprey while passing sub-adult white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) and creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus). Sea lamprey easily passed a 0.75 ramp at 5 angle, but very few individuals passed a similar ramp at 10 angle and none passed a longer ramp at the 5 angle. Limiting the amplitude of tailbeats in a narrow channel did not hamper lamprey or the other species. Greater water flow, and thereby greater immersion depth on the ramp fostered passage for all species. Smaller-bodied individual of creek chubs and white suckers performed best on the ramp. We show that wetted ramps could be incorporated into fishways at low-head dams to aid passage of smaller-bodied fishes while also blocking the spawning migration of adult sea lamprey.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaad5d200a6eb3451ceb0adad1de98ff2d717e2bb86256c77c16636a9946ab6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
