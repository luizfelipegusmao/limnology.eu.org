Methods: We performed an observational prospective multicentre study. Participants were divided into 2 groups: I) Patients with a past history of COVID-19; II) Patients without a previous microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 361 patients (COVID-19 group, n=166, Control group; n=195) were assessed from January 2022 to March 2023. COVID-19 group patients were assessed 12 months after COVID-19 recovery; Control group patients were assessed within the same time window. The primary outcome measure was ED. A machine learning-based model including three algorithms (random forest, logistic regression and support vector machines [SVM]) was applied to perform the automatic selection of those features involved in the prediction of ED. The algorithm SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) was also executed. Results: The median age was 55 years in both groups. The final selection of variables in our model was: group, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status, hypertension, diabetes, beta blocker treatment, antiplatelet therapy and coffee intake. The algorithm SVM-RFE showed that a past history of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were both long-term ED predictors in our model. Conclusions: We developed a machine learning-based model for the prediction of long-term ED following COVID-19 recovery. A past history of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were both predictors in our model. The application of our predictive tool in a community setting could avoid the adverse effects of ED and the unfavourable economic impact associated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e71287c3e8e23175a614e3aebb3e2f2b40ba23616de4d751e80cd9bda166862","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
