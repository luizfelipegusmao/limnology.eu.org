{"title":"Exploring the antiparasitic and antimicrobial potential of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi essential oil against fish and shrimp pathogens","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14010?af=R","date":1724178197000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study aimed to perform in vitro antiparasitic and antimicrobial tests with the essential oil (EO) of <i>Schinus terebinthifolius</i> against of fish and shrimp. The chemical composition of the EO of <i>S. terebinthifolius</i> was determined by gas chromatography. For the antiparasitic test, the protozoan <i>Epistylis</i> sp. obtained from parasitized <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> was used, and exposed to different concentrations of EO (2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%), and control with 1% grain alcohol. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) test with EO of <i>S. terebinthifolius</i> evaluated the antimicrobial potential, with serial dilutions starting at 2% and control with 1% grain alcohol, using the strains of <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> (2.2 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU mL<sup>−1</sup>), <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i>, <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, <i>V. harveyi</i>, and <i>V. alginolyticus</i> (2.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU mL<sup>−1</sup>). Chemical analysis revealed that the major EO compounds of <i>S. terebinthifolius</i> were δ-3-Carene (56.00%) and α-Pinene (16.89%). In the antiparasitic test, the concentration of 2% EO showed 100% efficacy against <i>Epistylis</i> sp. within 5 min. In the antimicrobial tests, the concentration of 2% EO was effective against all bacteria tested. The EO of <i>S. terebinthifolius</i> demonstrated antiparasitic and antimicrobial activity at a concentration of 2%, standing out as an alternative to conventional antibiotics.</p>","author":"Jucimauro de Araújo Pereira Junior, \nGracienhe Gomes dos Santos, \nDomickson Silva Costa, \nGraziella Vivine Gonçalves de Matos Silva, \nPaola Capistrano dos Santos, \nGabriele Bueno dos Anjos, \nLuiz Felipe Kretzer de Moraes, \nClaudia Andrea Lima Cardoso, \nArlene Sobrinho Ventura, \nNatalino da Costa Sousa, \nMauricio Laterça Martins","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"72ce74c7cab57955da0f12ff0c4921aedaa06661a4c03c1452aa9bb44c31db1d","category":"Environment"}
