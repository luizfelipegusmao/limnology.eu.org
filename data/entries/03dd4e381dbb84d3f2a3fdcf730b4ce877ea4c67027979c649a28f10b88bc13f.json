{"title":"A National‐Scale Coastal Flood Hazard Assessment for the Atoll Nation of Tuvalu","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003924?af=R","date":1711976457000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Atoll nations such as Tuvalu are considered to be amongst those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Here we present a national-scale coastal flood hazard assessment for Tuvalu based on high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topography and bathymetry. We follow a fully probabilistic approach, considering sea level anomalies, tides, and extreme wave conditions from a mixed climate (i.e., from distant extra-tropical storms and local tropical cyclones). Nearshore processes such as wave setup and runup are also accounted for. Hazard maps were calculated for the present sea level, as well as for sea level rise projections corresponding to different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP2 4.5 and SSP5 8.5) and time horizons (2060 and 2100). With a mean elevation of 1.55 m above mean sea level (1.37 m above mean high water spring) &gt;25% of land area is inundated once every 5 years and &gt;50% of land area floods once every 100 years nationally. Results indicate that present day 1-in-50 years floods (&gt;45% of land area flooded) will occur more than once every 5 years by 2060 (annual exceedance probability &gt;20%), even under the moderate SSP2 4.5 sea level rise projections. Results of this study highlight the pressing need for ambitious and large-scale adaptation solutions which are commensurate with projected sea level rise and marine hazard impacts. The methodologies presented in this paper can easily be applied to other low-lying islands in the tropical Pacific, where mixed climates (i.e., regular and TC conditions) and non-linear nearshore processes dominate extreme water levels and flooding.</p>","author":"Moritz Wandres, \nAntonio Espejo, \nTomasi Sovea, \nSapolu Tetoa, \nFaatasi Malologa, \nArthur Webb, \nJames Lewis, \nGary Lee, \nHervé Damlamian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"03dd4e381dbb84d3f2a3fdcf730b4ce877ea4c67027979c649a28f10b88bc13f","category":"Environment"}
