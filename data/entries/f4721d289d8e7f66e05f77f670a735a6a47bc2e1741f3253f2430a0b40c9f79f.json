{"title":"Exceptionally crystalline nature of CrO3‐Cr2O3/Ppy nanocomposite as a prospective photoelectrode for efficient green hydrogen generation in the context of environmentally friendly water‐splitting reactions using sanitized water","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14455?af=R","date":1726641668000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This research introduces a novel technique for transforming wastewater into renewable hydrogen gas using an innovative photoelectrode composed of CrO<sub>3</sub>-Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/polypyrrole (Ppy), synthesized through a one-pot method. The photoelectrode is applied to split wastewater under different light conditions: darkness, white light, and monochromatic light. In the absence of light, the CrO<sub>3</sub>-Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ppy photoelectrode produces a photocurrent density (<i>J</i>\n<sub>ph</sub>) value of 0.54 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, which significantly increases to 0.78 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> under white light exposure. The <i>J</i>\n<sub>ph</sub> values range from 0.68 to 0.76 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at wavelengths between 730 and 340 nm, showcasing the photoelectrode's remarkable sensitivity. This sensitivity highlights the potential of the photoelectrode to efficiently capture light energy for applications in wastewater treatment and green hydrogen production. By utilizing wastewater as a renewable energy source and employing the CrO<sub>3</sub>-Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ppy photoelectrode, this approach addresses environmental concerns and energy needs concurrently. The proposed prototype for a three-electrode cell aims to directly produce hydrogen gas from wastewater, with the ultimate goal of generating hydrogen suitable for industrial applications. This innovative solution not only addresses wastewater treatment but also transforms it into a valuable source of green energy, emphasizing the potential for positive environmental and energy-related advancements.</p>","author":"Mohamed Rabia, \nEman Aldosari, \nAdbelrhaman Hamdeldein Ahmed Geneidy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"f4721d289d8e7f66e05f77f670a735a6a47bc2e1741f3253f2430a0b40c9f79f","category":"Environment"}
