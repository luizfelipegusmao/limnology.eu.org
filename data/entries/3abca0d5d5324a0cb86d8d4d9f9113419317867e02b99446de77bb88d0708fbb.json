{"title":"DesC1 and DesC2, Δ9 Fatty Acid Desaturases of Filamentous Cyanobacteria: Essentiality and Complementarity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/975/7499582?rss=1","date":1701907200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>DesC1 and DesC2, which are fatty acid desaturases found in cyanobacteria, are responsible for introducing a double bond at the Δ9 position of fatty-acyl chains, which are subsequently esterified to the <span>sn</span>-1 and <span>sn</span>-2 positions of the glycerol moiety, respectively. However, since the discovery of these two desaturases in the Antarctic cyanobacterium <span>Nostoc</span> sp. SO-36, no further research has been reported. This study presents a comprehensive characterization of DesC1 and DesC2 through targeted mutagenesis and transformation using two cyanobacteria strains: <span>Anabaena</span> sp. PCC 7120, comprising both desaturases, and <span>Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803, containing a single Δ9 desaturase (hereafter referred to as DesCs) sharing similarity with DesC1 in amino acid sequence. The results suggested that both DesC1 and DesC2 were essential in <span>Anabaena</span> sp. PCC 7120 and that DesC1, but not DesC2, complemented DesCs in <span>Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803. In addition, DesC2 from <span>Anabaena</span> sp. PCC 7120 desaturated fatty acids esterified to the <span>sn</span>-2 position of the glycerol moiety in <span>Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"3abca0d5d5324a0cb86d8d4d9f9113419317867e02b99446de77bb88d0708fbb","category":"Environment"}
