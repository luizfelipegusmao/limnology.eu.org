{"title":"Exploring Glucocorticoid Safety: Insights from pKCSM Predictions on Tolerability and Toxicity Profiles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0307/v1","date":1725431552000,"content":"This comprehensive analysis aims to offer valuable insights into the safety profiles of these glucocorticoids, facilitating the identification of compounds with potentially reduced adverse effects.  This study investigates the toxicity profiles of various glucocorticoids, utilizing predictions from the pKCSM Server. Among the glucocorticoids examined, Dexamethasone, Triamcinolone, Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, Paramethasone, Fluprednisolone, and Flumethasone emerge as potentially less toxic, displaying favorable scores across diverse parameters such as Max. Tolerated Dose (human, MRT), Oral Rat Acute Toxicity (LD50), and Oral Rat Chronic Toxicity (LOAEL). Notably, Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate and Triamcinolone stand out for their high tolerability capacity based on the Max. Tolerated Dose (human, MRT), suggesting enhanced safety profiles. These findings contribute insights into selecting glucocorticoids with optimal safety and tolerability for potential therapeutic applications.Further research and clinical investigations are warranted to validate and refine these findings, ensuring the responsible and effective use of glucocorticoids in medical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90da17b729bc90d7024a394f6481a60c17f343bd2cfa8b16b1883ebc4b352809","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
