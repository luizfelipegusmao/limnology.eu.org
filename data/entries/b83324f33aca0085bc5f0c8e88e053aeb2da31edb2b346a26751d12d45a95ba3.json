{"title":"Integration and Optimization of Multisource Electric Vehicles: A Critical Review of Hybrid Energy Systems, Topologies, and Control Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0386/v1","date":1722930617000,"content":"Electric vehicles (EVs) are pivotal in addressing the escalating environmental crisis. While EV drivetrains excel compared to those of vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE), their energy storage systems are hampered by limited range, lifespan, and lengthy charging times. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) present a viable current solution to these issues. This review thoroughly explores state-of-the-art in the emerging field of multisource EVs that utilize HESS, incorporating any combination of batteries (BTs), supercapacitors (SCs), flywheels (FWs), fuel cells (FCs), and/or transmotors. In addition, the paper systematically categorizes and evaluates different hybrid configurations, detailing potential topologies and their respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, the paper examines diverse control algorithms used to manage these complex systems, focusing on their effectiveness and operational efficiency. By identifying current research gaps and technological challenges, this study aims to delineate future research directions that could enhance the deployment and optimization of multisource EVs, thereby addressing critical challenges such as energy density, system reliability, and cost-effectiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b83324f33aca0085bc5f0c8e88e053aeb2da31edb2b346a26751d12d45a95ba3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
