{"title":"Mother-reliant or self-reliant: the germination strategy of seeds in a species-rich alpine meadow is associated with the existence of pericarps","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/3/485/7684919?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Some plants germinate their seeds enclosed by a pericarp, whereas others lack the outer packaging. As a maternal tissue, the pericarp might impart seeds with different germination strategies. Plants in a community with different flowering times might separately disperse and germinate their seeds; therefore, flowering time can be considered as one manifestation of maternal effects on the offspring. The mass of the seed is another important factor influencing germination and represents the intrinsic resource of the seed that supports germination. Using seeds from a species-rich alpine meadow located in the Hengduan Mountains of China, a global biodiversity hotspot, we aimed to illustrate whether and how the type of seed (with or without a pericarp) modulates the interaction of flowering time and seed mass with germination.<div>Methods</div>Seeds were germinated in generally favourable conditions, and the speed of germination [estimated by mean germination time (MGT)] was calculated. We quantified the maternal conditions by separation of flowering time for 67 species in the meadow, of which 31 produced seeds with pericarps and 36 yielded seeds without pericarps. We also weighed 100 seeds of each species to assess their mass.<div>Key Results</div>The MGT varied between the two types of seeds. For seeds with pericarps, MGT was associated with flowering time but not with seed mass. Plants with earlier flowering times in the meadow exhibited more rapid seed germination. For seeds without a pericarp, the MGT depended on seed mass, with smaller seeds germinating more rapidly than larger seeds.<div>Conclusions</div>The distinct responses of germination to flowering time and seed mass observed in seeds with and without a pericarp suggest that germination strategies might be mother-reliant for seeds protected by pericarps but self-reliant for those without such protection. This new finding improves our understanding of seed germination by integrating ecologically mediated maternal conditions and inherent genetic properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"4f450cbb47fcee6e313620c9fff5e99db94d329ff23493526487b8c23b8fc764","category":"Environment"}
