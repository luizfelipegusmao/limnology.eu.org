{"title":"The effects of major dietary patterns on patients with type 2 diabetes: Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306336","date":1719583200000,"content":"<p>by Hongyu Chen, Yuanyuan Wang, Song Ge, Wanyang Li, Jing Li, Wei Chen</p>\r\nBackground <p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a significant worldwide health issue, experiencing an increasing incidence rate. Effective dietary strategies are vital for T2DM management, but the optimal dietary patterns remain debated due to inconsistent research outcomes and single-outcome reporting. Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) provides a powerful approach for integrating data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), enabling a detailed evaluation of the impact of different dietary patterns. This document presents our strategy for a systematic review and network meta-analysis, aimed at assessing the influence of key dietary patterns on glycemic control, lipid profiles, and weight management in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).</p> Materials and methods <p>Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and network meta-analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, without language or date restrictions. Our objective is to assess the efficacy of various dietary interventions in managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). We used standardized mean differences for pairwise comparisons and a Bayesian framework for ranking interventions via Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA). Key analyses include heterogeneity, transitivity, and sensitivity assessments, along with quality and risk evaluations using the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.</p> Ethics and dissemination <p>This systematic review and network meta-analysis involve aggregate data from previous trials, obviating the need for additional ethical approval. The search strategy will be executed starting October 2023, with all searches completed by December 2023, to encompass the most current studies available. Findings will be shared through academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals focused on diabetes care and nutrition.</p> Trial registration <p>PROSPERO registration number CRD42023465791.</p>","author":"Hongyu Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"18430dfb009177785e9edf8a41e873a6cccab5f05480a278ec9508e64ea9d511","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
