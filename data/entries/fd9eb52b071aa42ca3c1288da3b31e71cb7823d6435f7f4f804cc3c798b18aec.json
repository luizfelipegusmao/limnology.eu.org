{"title":"Instruments to Assess Family Nurse&rsquo;s Workload: Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1670/v1","date":1716784101000,"content":"Background: The importance of knowing the workload of family nurses lies essentially in the possibility of improving health outcomes, care processes and the nurse’s professional life. There is a lack of studies that fully describe nursing workload in primary care, particularly, in the context of family health nursing, and the ideal metrics to be used remains unknown, making it impossible to characterize and therefor provide the necessary insight to acknowledge the different contributions of several aspects that embodies the global workload of family nurses. The objective of this scoping review was to map the known evidence and characterize the instruments used to assess the workload of family nurses. Methods: Scoping review, according the Joanna Briggs Institute proposed methodology for scoping reviews, consisting of 3 research stages: 1) initial research in Medline and CINHAL; 2) extended search, using keywords and search terms, in the following databases: JBI, CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, Cochrane and Scopus; 3) Search the reference list of the selected articles. No time limit was defined. Results: Fourteen studies referring to ten as-sessment instruments were included. Nine of them analyze workload as a dimension of a broader instrument, and two studies refer to an instrument that focuses exclusively on workload. Con-clusions: The diversity of professional competencies and contexts, the conceptual complexity of workload and the absence of an theoretical framework, makes it difficult to identify consensual instruments to assess the workload of family nurses.
