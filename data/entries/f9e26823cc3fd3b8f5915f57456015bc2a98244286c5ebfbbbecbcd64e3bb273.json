{"title":"Effects of spontaneous mutations on survival and reproduction of Drosophila serrata infected with Drosophila C virus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/10/1661/7700164?rss=1","date":1719446400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The impact of selection on host immune function genes has been widely documented. However, it remains essentially unknown how mutation influences the quantitative immune traits that selection acts on. Applying a classical mutation accumulation (MA) experimental design in <span>Drosophila serrata</span>, we found the mutational variation in susceptibility (median time of death, LT50) to Drosophila C virus (DCV) was of similar magnitude to that reported for intrinsic survival traits. Mean LT50 did not change as mutations accumulated, suggesting no directional bias in mutational effects. Maintenance of genetic variance in immune function is hypothesized to be influenced by pleiotropic effects on immunity and other traits that contribute to fitness. To investigate this, we assayed female reproductive output for a subset of MA lines with relatively long or short survival times under DCV infection. Longer survival time tended to be associated with lower reproductive output, suggesting that mutations affecting susceptibility to DCV had pleiotropic effects on investment in reproductive fitness. Further studies are needed to uncover the general patterns of mutational effect on immune responses and other fitness traits, and to determine how selection might typically act on new mutations via their direct and pleiotropic effects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"f9e26823cc3fd3b8f5915f57456015bc2a98244286c5ebfbbbecbcd64e3bb273","category":"Environment"}
