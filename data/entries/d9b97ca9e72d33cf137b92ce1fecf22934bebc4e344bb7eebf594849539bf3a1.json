{"title":"Improved Adaptive Feedforward Controller Based on Internal Model Principle with Disturbance Observer for Laser Beam Steering Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1517/v1","date":1713867119000,"content":"This study presents an effective control algorithm to improve the robustness of fast steering mirror (FSM)-based laser beam steering systems against dynamic disturbances such as repetitive disturbances resulting from operating conditions. A stable control system must be able to maintain the required high-precision control even when dynamic disturbances affect the FSM system. In this study, an improved control method is proposed using an internal model principle (IMP)-based nonlinear controller with a disturbance observer (DOB) for the FSM system. This IMP-based controller with DOB can attenuate the residual control error signal under dynamic disturbance conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9b97ca9e72d33cf137b92ce1fecf22934bebc4e344bb7eebf594849539bf3a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
