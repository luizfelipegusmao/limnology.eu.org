However, specimen damage has long been known to limit the information that can be obtained from a variety of electron beam sensitive materials. Damage can still be alleviated combining cryo-conditions and low-electron fluence illumination for some modes of EM operation. It has also been recognized that lower acceleration voltages (âˆ¼100 keV) increase the amount of information obtained per unit of damage at the thicknesses of typical specimens observed in cryo-EM [<a href=\"#ozae044.321-B1\">1</a>]. A large variety of 2D materials and structural information of biological proteins below 100 kDa [<a href=\"#ozae044.321-B2\">2</a>] would potentially provide higher contrast at the energy ranges commonly provided by scanning electron microscopes (SEM) (&lt;30 keV), with the additional benefits in terms of cost and ease of use. However, experimental confirmations of the expected trend of increasing information at these low energies &lt; 30 kV, by way of elastic and inelastic scattering cross-sections measurements, have until recently been limited by the availability of suitable detectors at these low energies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1cba74185ca0fded22c6b2be2b0d61ed7ae608d7705a7b80382655f4feb170c6","category":"Environment"}
