{"title":"Using Baseflow Ensembles for Hydrologic Hysteresis Characterization in Humid Basins of Southeastern China","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036195?af=R","date":1712223133000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Baseflow plays a vital role in protecting the environment and ensuring a stable water supply for farming. There are still gaps in the current understanding of baseflow convergence rates in the humid region due to the abundance of rainfall and the high-water table. Therefore, this study focused on the evolution and hysteresis characteristics of baseflow in humid basins of southeastern China. The baseflow ensemble simulation (BES) method was established to improve the reliability and applicability of baseflow simulation. We suggest a way of differentiating the wet and dry seasons based on the multi-year average monthly baseflow index (BFI) to determine the intra-annual distribution of water effectively and simply. The hydrological hysteresis effect of baseflow on precipitation is revealed by characterizing baseflow response to precipitation under precipitation events during wet and dry seasons. A methodology for assessing the performance of baseflow simulation was proposed from observations of streamflow and precipitation. We found that the BES method performed better in baseflow simulation than other single separation methods. Using the BES method, the lag time of baseflow to precipitation during the wet and dry seasons was found to be 3.09 and 4.04 days after utilizing the BFI to divide the hydrological situation into wet and dry seasons. Additionally, precipitation had nearly twice as much intensity influence on baseflow during the dry season compared to the wet season. These findings have significant ramifications for the use, management, and planning of water resources in humid areas of China.</p>","author":"Hao Chen, \nSaihua Huang, \nYue‐Ping Xu, \nRamesh S. V.
