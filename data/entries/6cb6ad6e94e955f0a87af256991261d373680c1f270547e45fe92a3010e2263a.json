{"title":"Brassinosteroid regulates stomatal development in etiolated Arabidopsis cotyledons via transcription factors BZR1 and BES1","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1382/7606713?rss=1","date":1707696000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are phytohormones that regulate stomatal development. In this study, we report that BR represses stomatal development in etiolated Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) cotyledons via transcription factors BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and <span>bri1</span>-EMS SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1), which directly target <span>MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 9</span> (<span>MKK9</span>) and <span>FAMA</span>, 2 important genes for stomatal development. BZR1/BES1 bind <span>MKK9</span> and <span>FAMA</span> promoters in vitro and in vivo, and mutation of the BZR1/BES1 binding motif in <span>MKK9/FAMA</span> promoters abolishes their transcription regulation by BZR1/BES1 in plants. Expression of a constitutively active MKK9 (MKK9<sup>DD</sup>) suppressed overproduction of stomata induced by BR deficiency, while expression of a constitutively inactive MKK9 (MKK9<sup>KR</sup>) induced high-density stomata in <span>bzr1-1D</span>. In addition, <span>bzr-h</span>, a sextuple mutant of the BZR1 family of proteins, produced overabundant stomata, and the dominant <span>bzr1-1D</span> and <span>bes1-D</span> mutants effectively suppressed the stomata-overproducing phenotype of <span>brassinosteroid insensitive 1-116</span> (<span>bri1-116</span>) and <span>brassinosteroid insensitive 2-1</span> (<span>bin2-1</span>). In conclusion, our results revealed important roles of BZR1/BES1 in stomatal development, and their transcriptional regulation of <span>MKK9</span> and <span>FAMA</span> expression may contribute to BR-regulated stomatal development in etiolated <span>Arabidopsis</span> cotyledons.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"6cb6ad6e94e955f0a87af256991261d373680c1f270547e45fe92a3010e2263a","category":"Environment"}
