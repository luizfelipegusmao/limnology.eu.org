{"title":"Structural Catalytic Core in Subtilisin-Like Proteins and its Comparison to Trypsin-Like Serine Proteases and Alpha/Beta-Hydrolases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0597/v1","date":1728387634000,"content":"Subtilisin-like proteins are serine proteases that use two types of catalytic triads: Ser-His-Asp and Ser-Glu-Asp. Here, we investigate the two known families of subtilisin-like proteins, the subtilases (Ser-His-Asp triad) and the serine-carboxyl proteinases (Ser-Glu-Asp triad), and describe local structural arrangements (cores) that govern the catalytic residues in these proteins. We show separation of the cores into conserved structural zones, which can be repeatedly found in different structures, and compare the structural cores in subtilisin-like proteins with those in trypsin-like serine proteases and alpha/beta-hydrolases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f939ba2719dd24e4f15ea542bc24140e0e547c6871e6fc1dd178cd3fde78c35b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
