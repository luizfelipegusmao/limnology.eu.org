On July 8th, 2022, a low hill was selected as the study area to collect soil arthropods were collected through trap. Leaf litter, vegetation type and distribution quantity were investigated at each sampling site while soil fauna were collected. Also, the soil physical and chemical parameters were measured simultaneously. The results of one-way ANOVA showed that there were significant differences (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44b4c54fe4f72b1d960ee0076283c7f0df72c6e36bc9d68e22c6982e1ed307af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
