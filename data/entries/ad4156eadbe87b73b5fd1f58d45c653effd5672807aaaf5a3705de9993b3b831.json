{"title":"The Fatty Acid Profile of the Deep‐Sea Gastropod Parvaplustrum wareni Indicates a Dominant Role of Chemosynthesis in the Nutrition of the Hydrothermal Vent Ecosystem (Piip Volcano)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12833?af=R","date":1723871000000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The gastropod <i>Parvaplustrum wareni</i> (Parvaplustridae) is an important faunal component in the ecosystem of deep-sea hydrothermal vents of the Piip submarine volcano, Bering Sea. To highlight trophic relationships in this ecosystem, the fatty acid (FA) composition of the hydrothermal gastropod <i>P. wareni</i> has been studied. This is one of the few studies analyzing FA compositions of gastropods in a hydrothermal vent ecosystem. The major polyunsaturated FAs of this mollusk are represented by n-3 and n-6 FAs: arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), docosatetraenoic acid (22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3). The low level of FA markers of phytoplankton suggests an insignificant role of organic matter created by photosynthesis in the nutrition of <i>P. wareni</i>. A high level of monounsaturated FAs (more than 70% of total FAs) dominated by palmitoleic (16:1n-7) and cis-vaccenic (18:1n-7) FAs indicates the bacterial nutrition of the mollusk. In general, the analysis of the <i>P. wareni</i> FA composition has allowed a conclusion that the organic matter created by chemosynthesis provides a favorable basis for the <i>P. wareni</i> population to thrive in the hydrothermal vents of the Piip volcano.</p>","author":"S. A.
