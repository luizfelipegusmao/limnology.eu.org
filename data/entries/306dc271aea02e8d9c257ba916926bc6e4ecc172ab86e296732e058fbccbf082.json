{"title":"The Effect of Indium Tin Oxide Nanoparticles (ITO NPs) Incorporated with ZnO NPs based on Structural, Optical and Flexible Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (FDSSCs) Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1781/v1","date":1716823727000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the impact of incorporating indium tin oxide (ITO) nan particles (NPs) with zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs into flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs). ZnO and ITO NPs were separately prepared using the sol-gel method, followed by hybridization of ZnO NP/ITO NP and characterization using techniques such as TEM, SEM, XRD, UV-Vis spectros-copy, PL spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). TEM analysis showed hexagonal struc-tures and small sphere-like nanoparticles with mean diameters of 15.22 ± 11 nm for ZnO NPs and 14.54 ± 16 nm for ZnO NPs/ITO NPs. SEM images revealed uniform dispersion and smooth surface morphology, while XRD confirmed the crystalline nature of both ZnO and hybrid NPs, indicating specific crystallographic planes with consistent sizes. UV-Vis spectroscopy demonstrated a redshift in wavelength upon adding ITO NPs, suggesting an impact on the bandgap of ZnO NPs. PL spectra exhibited a broad visible emission peak at 535 nm. These findings enhance our understanding of the optical behavior and interaction between ITO and ZnO NPs in hybrid nanostructures. The study concluded that the ITO NPs improve FDSSC performance by enhancing charge separation and transport, leading to increased photocurrent production, with the characterization techniques providing valuable insights for future research and applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"306dc271aea02e8d9c257ba916926bc6e4ecc172ab86e296732e058fbccbf082","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
