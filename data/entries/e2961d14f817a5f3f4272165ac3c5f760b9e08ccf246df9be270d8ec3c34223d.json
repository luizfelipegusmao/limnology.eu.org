{"title":"A Modeling Framework for the Thermoforming of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0052/v1","date":1717400899000,"content":"A comprehensive modeling framework for the thermoforming of polymer matrix woven laminate composite was developed. Two numerical indicators, the slip path length and traction magnitude, have been identified to be positively correlated to matrix smearing and wrinkling defects. The material model has been calibrated with picture-frame experimental results, and the prediction accuracy for intra-ply shear and thickness distribution were examined with measurements on the physically formed parts. Finally, a parametric study was conducted to determine the relationship between various process parameters and the quality of the formed part. For the trapezoidal part, orienting the laminate at 45-degrees to the mold axis reduces the likelihood of matrix smear and wrinkling defects. Although this laminate orientation yielded a greater spatial variation of part thickness, the thickness deviation is lower than that for the 0-degree orientation case. Higher forming rates were found to result in more defects due to increased slip path lengths and traction magnitudes. Optimal forming speeds should balance rapid shaping within the operating temperature window while avoiding tear. It was discovered that shallower molds benefit from faster ramp rates, while deeper molds require slower rates to manage extensive shearing, stretching, and bending. Faster forming rates lead to smaller thickness increases at high intra-ply shear regions, indicating a shift from intra-ply shear to out-of-plane bending due to the visco-plastic effect of the molten laminate, and can negatively impact part quality. Lastly, it was shown that a well-conceived strategy using darts could improve the part quality by reducing the magnitude of the defect indicators.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2961d14f817a5f3f4272165ac3c5f760b9e08ccf246df9be270d8ec3c34223d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
