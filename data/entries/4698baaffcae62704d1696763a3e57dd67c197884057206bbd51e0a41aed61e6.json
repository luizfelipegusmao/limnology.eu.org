{"title":"Steatotic liver disease and its newly proposed sub-classifications correlate with progression of the coronary artery calcium score","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301126","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Aryoung Kim, Danbee Kang, Sung Chul Choi, Juhee Cho, Dong Hyun Sinn, Geum-Youn Gwak</p>\r\nBackground &amp; aims <p>A new nomenclature, Steatotic Liver Disease (SLD), has been proposed by consensus with sub-classifications and requires evidence-based validation. We assessed whether the presence and severity of SLD, as well as its sub-classifications, are associated with the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.</p> Methods <p>This longitudinal cohort study included 13,811 adults who participated in repeated regular health screening examinations between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2021 that included assessments of their coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores. SLD was defined using abdominal ultrasonography and classified as metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and cryptogenic SLD. SLD severity was assessed using fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores. The progression of CAC scores was measured using multidetector CT scans.</p> Results <p>The average duration of follow-up was 5.8 years. During follow-up, the annual rate of CAC progression in participants with and without SLD was 18% (95% CI 17%–19%) and 14% (95% CI 13%–14%) (p &lt; 0.01), respectively. The multivariable ratios of progression rates when we compared participants with cryptogenic SLD, MASLD, or MetALD with those without SLD were 0.98 (95% CI 0.95–1.01), 1.03 (95% CI 1.03–1.04), and 1.07 (95% CI 1.04–1.09), respectively. The multivariable ratios of progression rates when we compared participants with SLD with FIB-4 score &lt;1.3 and SLD with FIB-4 score ≥1.3 with those without SLD were 1.03 (95% CI 1.02–1.04), and 1.05 (95% CI 1.04–1.06), respectively.</p> Conclusions <p>SLD was associated with a higher risk of coronary atherosclerosis, and the risk differed by sub-classifications and severity. These findings suggest that the newly proposed definition has clinical relevance in terms of stratifying cardiovascular disease risk.</p>","author":"Aryoung Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4698baaffcae62704d1696763a3e57dd67c197884057206bbd51e0a41aed61e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
