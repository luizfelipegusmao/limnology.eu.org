{"title":"Literacy in Artificial Intelligence as a Challenge for Teaching in Higher Education: A Case Study at Portalegre Polytechnic University","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0754/v1","date":1710310795000,"content":"The growing impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Humanity is unavoidable, and therefore, “AI literacy” is extremely important. In the field of education – AI in education (AIED) – this technology is having a huge impact on the educational community and on the education system itself. The present study seeks to assess the level of AI literacy of teachers at Portalegre Polytechnic University (PPU), aiming to identify gaps, find the main opportunities for innovation and development and seek the degree of relationship between the dimensions of AI literacy, as well as identifying the predictive variables in this matter. As a measuring instrument, a validated questionnaire based on three dimensions (AI Literacy, AI Self-Efficacy and AI Self-Management) was applied to a sample of 75 teachers in the various schools of PPU. This revealed an average level of AI literacy (3.28), highlighting that 62.4% of responses are at levels 3 and 4 (based on a Likert scale from 1 to 5). The results also demonstrate that the first dimension is highly significant for the total dimensions, i.e., for AI Literacy, and no factor characterizing the sample is a predictor, but finding a below-average result in the Learning factor indicates a pressing need to focus on developing these skills.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab580f862db5e815a4f76b0bf2e69f3080fbade20333a5782aed53f6bffa8a4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
