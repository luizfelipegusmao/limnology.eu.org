However, the detrimental effects of these salts on aquatic ecosystems, vegetation, lakes, ground and surface water, and soils have become a major concern in recent years. This review aims to discuss the adverse environmental impact of using de-icing salts on the environment and explore current conventional methods used for managing and treating runoff water. Additionally, desalination techniques in terms of their effectiveness and energy requirements have been discussed. By comparing energy costs and considering the salinity levels of runoff water containing de-icing salts, electrodialysis as a potential technique is introduced to be combined with conventional approaches for removing and recovering salt from runoff water loaded from road de-icing salt.</p>","author":"Mitra Ebrahimi Gardeshi, \nHamed Arab, \nAlae Benguit, \nPatrick Drogui","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"e985ead28611b956648534ce8f072a3d6f51cbbc51950f74c6232cb356bc29bd","category":"Environment"}
