{"title":"Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) in the Environment of Saudi Aquaculture as a New Class of Pollutants","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6761331?af=R","date":1700121600000,"content":"<p>Aquaculture is a productive sector that will be instrumental in addressing the challenges of the forthcoming generation, including the demand for proteins endorsing humans and environmental stewardship. Saudi Arabia (SA) economy heavily depends on aquaculture. However, aquaculture practices, which encompass applying antibiotics for both prophylaxis and treatment, impose a significant impact. Applying antibiotics in aquaculture causes the neighboring microorganisms in the water column, soil particles, and aquaculture-related bacterium species to become resistant to antibiotics. Bacteria can spread antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through gene transfer mechanisms, further distributing genetic determinants in aquatic habitats. SA is one of the nations with the highest projected relative growth in aquaculture antibiotic consumption. There have been reports of numerous antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in SA, but the majority of studies focused on isolates from human samples. Several ARGs developing resistance to aminoglycosides, carbapenems, tetracyclines, and beta-lactams were reported in clinical samples in SA; however, limited reviews about aquaculture-related antibiotic resistance genes (AARGs) have been published in SA. In this article, the main drivers of increasing the dissemination of AARGs were poor sanitation systems, human clinical antibiotic resistance (AR), antibiotic misuse, aquatic feed-containing antibiotics, and lack of awareness regarding antibiotics use in both clinical and (AR) aquaculture systems. Saudi national corporations are required to combat AARGs, including reiterating the threat of AR and looking for more cutting-edge knowhows or efficient administration choices to regulate it. It is necessary to educate the general population alongside organizations about AARG dissemination so as to increase understanding and alter the existing circumstances.</p>","author":"Amenah Saud Alotaibi, \nHamed Ghafarifarsani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"4ac4ddef1fc1b3b65016abb9c77114bf38a7f20446520957fb6829e91b07dcf0","category":"Environment"}
