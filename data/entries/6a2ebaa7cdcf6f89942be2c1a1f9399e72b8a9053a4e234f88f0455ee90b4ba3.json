{"title":"Effect of Pistacia Terebinthus (terebinth) resin extract on aggressive breast cancer cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae046/7634426?rss=1","date":1711238400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer causing high mortality rates among women worldwide. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of <span>Pistacia terebinthus</span> (terebinth) resin extract (TRE) on the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. In the study, the cytotoxic dose of the resin extract in MDA-MB-231 cells was evaluated by MTS analysis. The effect of TRE on apoptosis was examined by Hoechst staining. Caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 protein expressions were determined by western blot analysis. Based on the outcomes of our MTS analysis, the IC50 dose of TRE was calculated at 56.54 μg/mL during a 24-h application period. With Hoechst staining analysis, an increase was observed in cells that underwent apoptotic change at 10 and 100 μg/ml TRE concentrations compared to the control. At 25 and 50 μg/mL TRE concentrations, no apoptotic change was found in comparison to the control; however, a significant drop in the number of viable cells was observed because 200, 300, and 500 μg/mL TRE concentrations were above the toxic dose. The caspase-3 protein expression level was significantly higher in cells treated with 100 μg/ml TRE compared to the control group, while there was no significant change in cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. It was thought that <span>P. terebinthus</span> resin might cause cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells via caspase-independent apoptosis pathway or other cell death pathways, and it was concluded that it could be a supportive treatment for breast cancer treatment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"6a2ebaa7cdcf6f89942be2c1a1f9399e72b8a9053a4e234f88f0455ee90b4ba3","category":"Environment"}
