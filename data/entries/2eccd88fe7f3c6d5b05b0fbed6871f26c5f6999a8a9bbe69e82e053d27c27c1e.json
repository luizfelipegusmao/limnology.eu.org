{"title":"262 Modulation of vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous metabolism and immune response in pre- and post-weaning piglets under different vitamin D supplementation strategies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/153/7664747?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the impact of different vitamin D supplementation strategies to pre- and post-weaning piglets on vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous metabolism and immune status. Sixty piglets were selected at d 2 of age [body weight (BW) = 1.71 ± 0.03 kg] and orally supplemented with saline (CTR) or a solution of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> at d 2, d 8, and d 21 (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg, respectively) along with UVB exposure every second day from d1 4 up to d 21 (HD). From weaning (d 21) until d 42, CTR animals were supplemented with 2,000 UI of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/kg of feed and HD animals were supplemented with 2,000 UI 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>/kg. Piglets were sacrificed at d 21, d 28, and d 35 (n = 10/treatment/d) for the collection of blood, jejunum, liver, and kidney samples. Serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations were determined by HPLC and the mRNA expression of genes implicated in vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous metabolism and immune status were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Data were analyzed using a 2x3 factorial design. Serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations were 2.8, 3.6, and 2.2-fold greater in HD piglets at d 21, 28, and 35 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.01), respectively (Table 1). No treatment or treatment x time interaction was detected on the expression of genes related to vitamin D metabolism in the jejunum mucosa and liver (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.19). In kidney, HD piglets had greater expression of CYP27B1 (<span>P</span> = 0.09) and decreased expression of CYP24A1 (<span>P</span> = 0.06). Renal EGR1 expression was greater in HD piglets (<span>P</span> = 0.01). No treatment effect was detected on the expression of genes directly implicated in phosphate or calcium reabsorption (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.16). No treatment or treatment x time interaction was detected on the mRNA expression of selected genes related to immune response in the jejunum mucosa, liver, and kidney (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.14). Independently of vitamin D treatments, time effects were detected for gene expression. The mRNA expression of CYP27B1 increased and that of CYP24A1 decreased from d 28 to 35 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04) in kidney. Genes related to calcium (TRPV5) and phosphate (NPT2c) reabsorption in kidney had reduced mRNA expression on d 35 compared with d 21 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.01). Overall, the mRNA expression of genes related to immune response in all studied tissues was lower at d 35 compared with d 21 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.08). Bodyweight at slaughter was not affected by treatments at d 21, 28, and 35 (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.29). In conclusion, pre-weaning vitamin D supplementation enhanced vitamin D status at weaning and the use of dietary 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> supplementation was more effective in increasing the vitamin D status post-weaning. The mRNA expression results suggest that greater vitamin D status at weaning and during the first 2 wk post-weaning do not affect calcium and phosphate reabsorption in kidney and the immune defense of pre- and post-weaning piglets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2eccd88fe7f3c6d5b05b0fbed6871f26c5f6999a8a9bbe69e82e053d27c27c1e","category":"Environment"}
