Feeding behavior, captured by automated feeding systems, can be used to monitor the health and welfare status of individual pigs. Here, we present a framework for monitoring feeding behavior of grow-finish pigs in real time, using a low-frequency radio frequency identification (RFID) system. Using historical data, an autoregressive linear model for predicting daily time at the feeder was developed and utilized to detect anomalous decreases in feeding behavior associated with health status of the pig. A total of 2,826 pigs were individually monitored with our warning system over the entire grow-finish period, and health warnings were compared to caretaker diagnoses. The system detected 55.7% of the caretaker diagnoses, and on average these events were detected 2.8 d earlier than diagnosis by the caretaker. High numbers of potentially spurious health warnings, generated by the system, can be partly explained by the lack of a reliable and repeatable gold standard reference data set. Results from this work provide a solid basis for monitoring individual animals, but further improvements to the system are necessary for practical implementation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"ad3416ac6bba281490ebabcd1ed21dc9579100a9f885354f198c05775c76da89","category":"Environment"}
