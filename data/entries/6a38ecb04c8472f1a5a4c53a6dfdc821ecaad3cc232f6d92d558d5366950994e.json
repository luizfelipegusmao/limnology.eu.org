However, the global extent of this trend is uncertain. We conducted the first systematic global analysis and found that lianas are rising on average 17% per decade, with the fastest rise in older forests (20% per decade) likely driven by climate change. This trend raises questions about the future role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change, as lianas are less effective than trees at capturing carbon dioxide.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lianas profoundly affect tropical forests dynamics, reducing productivity and carbon storage, which underscores the importance of monitoring change in their abundance in projecting the future of the global terrestrial carbon store. While increasing liana populations are documented within the Neotropics, the global consistency of these patterns is questioned, and remains to be determined. To evaluate pantropical trends in liana abundance comprehensively and quantitatively, we conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. This approach allowed us to synthesize data from published longitudinal studies examining liana trends across the tropics. We calculated standardized effect sizes and standard errors, and applied a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analytic model to adjust for publication bias. Our analysis reveals an overall pan-tropical increase in lianas abundance, occurring at an average rate of 1.7 ± 0.7 SE% per year (~10% to 24% per decade). This upward trend, confirmed to be robust against publication bias, extends beyond Neotropical regions, indicating a widespread phenomenon. Although a global trend of increasing liana abundance is evident, significant local variation exist, attributable to differences in life cycle stages, abundance metrics, forest successional stages, and biogeographical realms. Notably, increases in stem density of saplings and biomass of canopy lianas, especially in old-growth forests, point to global climatic drivers and heightened turnover rates in tropical forests as factors promoting sustained liana growth in the canopy and clonal colonization in the understory. These trends suggest that the rise in liana abundance may not only persist but could also intensify under climate change. Considering both previous and current research on lianas, our findings confirm growing concerns about lianas' expanding impact on pan-tropical carbon storage, highlighting their significant potential effect on global carbon dynamics.</p>","author":"Manuela A.
