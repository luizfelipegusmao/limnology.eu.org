{"title":"‘Our project, your problem?’ A case study of the WHO’s mRNA technology transfer programme in South Africa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003173","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Matthew Herder, Ximena Benavides</p>\r\n\r\nIn June 2021 the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) launched an mRNA technology transfer programme. With a South African consortium serving as the hub, the programme aimed to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in view of the “vaccine apartheid” that was observed during COVID-19. Following Clarke’s “situational analysis,” the present study assessed whether the mRNA programme differs from the approach and practices that comprise current biopharmaceutical production. Numerous documentary sources, including legal agreements underpinning the programme, funding agreements, and patent filings, were reviewed. Semi-structured interviews with 35 individuals, ranging from the programme’s architects and university scientists to representatives from LMIC vaccine manufacturers taking part in the programme were also conducted. While the mRNA programme may improve the sharing of knowledge, other design features, in particular, weak conditionalities around product affordability, participants’ freedom to contract with third parties, and acceptance of market-based competition, are in line with the status quo. Further, WHO and MPP’s tight control over the programme evokes the dynamics that are often in play in global health, to the detriment of empowering LMIC-based manufacturers to generate mRNA products in response to local health needs.","author":"Matthew Herder","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"9a5e5270e2f7df2d1efd3d1c0262dd2a022a74981e95e83d6d2827f50e403777","category":"Environment"}
