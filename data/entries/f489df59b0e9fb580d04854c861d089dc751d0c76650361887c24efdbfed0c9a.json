{"title":"Investigation of the Potential of Concomitant Radiation Therapy and Gold Nanoparticles for Pancreatic Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1529/v1","date":1719194826000,"content":"The present work consisted of an exploratory study aiming to evaluate in vitro the potential of AuNPs during Radiation Therapy (RT) in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. AuNPs coated with hyaluronic and oleic acids (HAOA-AuNPs) or with bombesin peptides (BBN-AuNPs) were used. AuNPs were characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic Light Scattering. BxPC-3 tumour cells were irradiated with a 6 MV X-rays beam, in the absence or presence of AuNPs. AFM showed that HAOA-AuNPs and BBN-AuNPs are spherical with a mean size of 83+-20 nm and 49+-12 nm, respectively. For RT alone, a reduction in cell viability of up to 33+-12% was obtained compared to the control (p ≤ 0.0001). HAOA-AuNPs alone at 200 and 400 μM showed a reduction in cell viability of 20+-4% and 35+-4%, respectively, while for BBN-AuNPs, at 50 and 200 μM, a reduction in cell viability of 25+-3% and 37+-3% was obtained, respectively, compared to the control (p &lt; 0.0001). At 72 h post-irradiation, a decrease in cell viability of 26+-3% and 22+-2% between RT+HAOA-AuNPs at 400 μM and RT+BBN-AuNPs at 50 μM, compared to RT alone, was obtained (p &lt; 0.004). The combination of RT with AuNPs led to a significant decrease in  cell viability compared to the  control, or RT alone, thus representing an improved effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f489df59b0e9fb580d04854c861d089dc751d0c76650361887c24efdbfed0c9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
