{"title":"Ensemble Deep Learning-Based Image Classification for Breast Cancer Subtype and Invasiveness Diagnosis from Whole Slide Image Histopathology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0711/v1","date":1715352878000,"content":"Cancer diagnosis and classification are pivotal for effective patient management and treatment planning. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach utilizing ensemble deep learning techniques to analyze breast cancer histopathology images. Our datasets are based on two widely employed datasets from different centers for two different tasks: BACH and BreakHis. Within the BACH Dataset, we deployed an ensemble strategy incorporating VGG16 and ResNet50 architec-tures to achieve precise classification of breast cancer histopathology images. Introducing a novel image patching technique, to preprocess a high-resolution image, which facilitates focused analysis of localized regions of interest. The annotated BACH dataset encompasses 400 WSIs across four distinct classes: Normal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma. In addition, we employed the BreakHis dataset, utilizing VGG16, ResNet34, and ResNet50 models to classify mi-croscopic images into eight distinct categories (four benign and four malignant). For both models we leveraged a five-fold cross-validation approach for rigorous training and testing. Preliminary ex-perimental results indicate a Patch classification accuracy of 95.31% (on BACH dataset) and WSI image classification accuracy of 98.43% (BreakHis). This research significantly contributes to on-going endeavors in harnessing artificial intelligence to advance breast cancer diagnosis, potentially fostering improved patient outcomes and alleviating healthcare burdens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e96b61ed3b691324bca669327ce8ac2e277e08d43edd85033d41b134369db4dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
