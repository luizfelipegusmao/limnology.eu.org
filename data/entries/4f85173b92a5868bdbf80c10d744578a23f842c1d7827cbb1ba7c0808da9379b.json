{"title":"Analysis of Cell Immunity for Children Infected with COVID-19 and Those Vaccinated against COVID-19 Using T-SPOT&reg;.COVID","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1033/v1","date":1710811556000,"content":"To elucidate the cellular immune response to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among children, we assessed cellular immunity in 8 children post-vaccination for COVID-19 and 11 children after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, using the T-SPOT®.COVID assay for both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In the vaccinated group, the T-SPOT®.COVID assay for the S protein yielded positive results in all eight children. In contrast, in the post-infection group, the assay for the N protein was positive in 5 of 11 children, with 3 of these 5 children requiring hospital admission, including 2 who needed mechanical ventilation. Therefore, the T-SPOT®.COVID assay is valuable for assessing cellular immunity against COVID-19, and most children infected with COVID-19 may not develop such immunity unless the disease severity is significant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f85173b92a5868bdbf80c10d744578a23f842c1d7827cbb1ba7c0808da9379b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
