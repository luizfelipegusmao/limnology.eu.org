{"title":"Political Biases of ChatGPT in Different Languages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1224/v1","date":1718702303000,"content":"Given the widespread use of AI language models such as ChatGPT, there is an urgent need 1 to understand their political biases in different languages. This study aims to uncover such biases. To 2 investigate this issue, we applied IDRLabsâ€™ Political Coordinates Test to ChatGPT based on GPT-4 3 in four languages - English, French, German, and Italian. The results confirm previous studies that 4 identified a left-libertarian bias in ChatGPT. There was remarkable consistency in political orientation 5 across all four languages, although minor variations were found. Differences in ChatGPT response 6 distributions across languages could indicate culturally determined differences in interpretation 7 of political questions. The results highlight the need to diversify and optimize data collection and 8 model training methods to ensure greater fairness and neutrality and minimize the influence of bias. 9 Our study highlights the importance of cultural differences in the processing and interpretation of 10 political information by AI models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ebed118a0e33e6874cbc73768ec955d52ea316c27e24179332406ea0f6bef7b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
