{"title":"Enabling Passive Load-Holding Function and System Pressures Control in a One-Motor-One-Pump Motor-Controlled Hydraulic Cylinder: Simulation Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0809/v1","date":1712827588000,"content":"This paper is concerned with a hydraulic cylinder directly controlled by a variable speed fixed displacement pump. The considered configuration is referred to as a one-motor-one-pump (1M1P) motor-controlled hydraulic cylinder (MCC). A 1M1P MCC with a hydraulically driven passive load-holding function enabled by controlled system pressures is proposed. The proposed load-holding functionality works if there is a standstill command, a loss of power supply, or a hose rupture. Additionally, this paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the proposed system's operation and load-holding function across four quadrants. Simulation results demonstrate the four-quadrant operation and good load-holding performance under the aforementioned scenarios. In conclusion, the proposed 1M1P MCC can be successfully used on practical applications characterized by overrunning loads and four quadrant operation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ea696eefee2088a66bb19d522799f2590360202d678f6c0c3261adbca555a97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
