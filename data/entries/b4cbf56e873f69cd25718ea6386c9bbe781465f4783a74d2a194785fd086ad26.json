{"title":"Blood-Brain Barrier Conquest in Glioblastoma Nanomedicine: Strategies, Clinical Advances, and Emerging Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0186/v1","date":1725343602000,"content":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a prevalent type of malignancy within the central nervous system (CNS), associated with a poor prognosis. The standard treatment for GBM includes surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy; yet despite these interventions, overall treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of brain tissue under normal physiological conditions of the CNS,also poses a significant obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic agents to GBM. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that nanomedicine delivery systems (NDDS) offer promising results, demonstrating both effective GBM targeting and safety, thereby presenting a potential solution for targeted drug delivery. This review explores the various strategies employed in preclinical studies to overcome the BBB for drug delivery. Subsequently, the results of clinical translation of NDDS has been summarized, highlighting the progress made. Finally, we discuss potential strategies for advancing NDDS development and accelerating their translational research through well-designed clinical trials in GBM therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4cbf56e873f69cd25718ea6386c9bbe781465f4783a74d2a194785fd086ad26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
