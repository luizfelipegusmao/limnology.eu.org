{"title":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sleep, Drowsiness, and Stress in Dental Students: A Longitudinal Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1504/v1","date":1711454438000,"content":": The objetive of this study was to evaluated the quality of sleep, degree of drowsiness, and stress index of dentistry students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study was conducted among dentistry students from two universities, obtaining data at baseline and 10 months after the pandemic. The Pittsburgh questionnaire, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Cohen perceived stress scale were used to assess sleep quality, sleepiness index, and stress level, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using Generalized Estimating Equations, with binary, ordinal, and linear logistic regression. Results: Baseline sleep quality had a positive influence on sleep quality compared with the assessment after 10 months. Drowsiness is influenced by factors, such as the time of assessment, income of up to one salary, and physical activity. There was greater drowsiness 10 months after the pandemic. High stress levels were observed during both assessments. Female sex, deteriorated family relationships, and lack of physical activity increase the risk of stress. Conclusion: The quality of sleep was positively affected during the pandemic period, remaining high, and drowsiness increased.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"465fb6eb90bc21e1b9fc72e93c918b9c14a3e3d741057dcb948d7a4c098cc965","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
