One of the most striking features of EOS is the abundance of cytoplasmic granules that contain four major cytotoxic cationic proteins [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B1\">1</a>]. Upon stimulation or activation, EOS migrate through the vascular endothelium, invade targeted organs, and release the cytotoxic proteins from the granules, thereby participating in tissue damage, repair, and remodeling [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B2\">2</a>]. Among the major toxic, eosinophil major basic protein 1 (EMBP-1) is present in a crystalline core [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B1\">1</a>]. Several crystal structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B3\">3</a>] of purified EMBP-1 have been determined. It was reported that EMBP-1â€™s toxicity is regulated by its crystallization and aggregation [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B4\">4</a>]. In allergic individuals, high levels of cytokines regulating type 2 immunity have been observed and significant focus has centered on their downstream effector cells, including EOS [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B5\">5</a>]. It is suggested that interleukin 33 (IL-33) leads to the activation of mature EOS, triggering degranulation and release of cationic proteins [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B5\">5</a>]. EOS degranulation deposits intact membrane-bound EOS granules extracellularly, and cell-free granules may also respond to the cytokines, resulting in further secretion of cationic proteins [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B6\">6</a>]. While patient and animal studies suggest a pathogenic role for IL-33 on EOS in inflammatory airway diseases [<a href=\"#ozae044.348-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.348-B8\">8</a>], structural understanding of such processes is lacking.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f4ce97d59557d123a9c380226d0c43054b16b255bcab2ad13fbff2e991482934","category":"Environment"}
