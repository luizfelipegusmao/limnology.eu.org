{"title":"Thermodynamic Properties of Two Cinnamate Derivatives with Flavor and Fragrance Features","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1831/v1","date":1727162291000,"content":"The standard molar enthalpies of formation in the liquid phase for ethyl (E)-cinnamate and ethyl hydrocinnamate, two cinnamate derivatives with notable flavor and fragrance characteristics, were determined experimentally using combustion calorimetry in an oxygen atmosphere. To derive the gas-phase enthalpies of formation for these derivatives, their enthalpies of vaporization were measured using a high-temperature Calvet microcalorimeter and the vacuum drop micro-calorimetric technique. Additionally, a computational analysis employing the G3(MP2)//B3LYP composite method was conducted to calculate the gas-phase standard enthalpies of formation at T = 298.15 K for both compounds. \nThese findings enabled a detailed assessment and analysis of the structural and energetic effects of the vinyl and ethane moieties between the phenyl and carboxylic groups in the studied com-pounds. Considering the structural features of ethyl (E)-cinnamate and ethyl hydrocinnamate, a gas-phase enthalpy of hydrogenation analysis was conducted to explore their energetic profiles more thoroughly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9636c09ce86c64c375310980d4b324c7c3d797e13ff226eced485545b53f60c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
