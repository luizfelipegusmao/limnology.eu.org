{"title":"Copper metabolism and its implications for canine nutrition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad147/7505317?rss=1","date":1704240000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Canine copper nutrition has received increased attention due to recent reports of apparent copper-associated hepatitis in the USA and European Union. In order to properly address the need to modify the U.S. National Research Council and Association of American Feed Control Officials canine copper recommendations that will have implications for all dogs, it is important to understand the complexities of copper metabolism, confounding variables affecting copper status, and the available research on this topic in dogs. Recent trends in consumer preference for dog diets, supplements, and functional treats introduce another layer of complexity, as most ingredients used in these formulations provide vastly different proportions of essential nutrients, thus resulting in great variation in nutrient profiles available to the animal. Although controlled research addressing copper metabolism in dogs is limited, there are lessons to be learned from other monogastric species as well as canine case studies that can provide a base for increasing knowledge to address this issue. Copper metabolism and status in animals is affected by a multitude of factors including absorption, storage, excretion, and nutrient interactions. Given its vital role in many physiological processes, it is important that both nutritional deficiencies and toxicities be avoided. Additionally, another challenge for proper copper nutrition in dogs is the known genetic predispositions of some breeds for copper storage and excretion abnormalities. Therefore, it is imperative that veterinarians, nutritionists, and pet food manufacturers collaborate with the shared goal of providing dog food options that supply the essential nutrients at adequate concentrations to support an active and healthy life. Many questions remain regarding copper metabolism and proper diet formulation for dogs. Future research efforts should focus on discovering reliable, non-invasive methods for evaluating canine copper status, a deeper understanding of genetic predispositions of certain breeds, increased knowledge of copper contributions from various ingredients, and the role of unpredictable physiological stressors on copper metabolism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"e70995df9746e61ec77c9389c972cc28436ec53e81e0d33129c75a026b972de8","category":"Environment"}
