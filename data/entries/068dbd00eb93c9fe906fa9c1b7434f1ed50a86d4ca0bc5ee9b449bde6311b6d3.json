{"title":"Survey of Leafminers on American Chestnut and other Castanea spp. (Fagales: Fagaceae) on Long Island, NY","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/659/7690151?rss=1","date":1717804800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The effect of the 20th-century functional extinction of the American Chestnut (Fagaceae: <span>Castanea dentata</span> (Marshall) Borkh) on associated herbivorous insects is unknown. These insects include leafminers that spend at least part of their larval phase feeding between the epidermises of leaves. We surveyed leafminers on <span>C. dentata</span>, nonnative <span>Castanea</span> spp., and hybrids on Long Island, NY. We found 10 leafminer species feeding on <span>Castanea</span> spp. A first New York State record was documented for <span>Stigmella castaneaefoliella</span> (Chambers) (Lepidoptera: Nepticulidae). New host records are established for 6 lepidopterans, including a new host genus for <span>Phyllonorycter basistrigella</span> (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae). We found no significant differences in the mean intensity of <span>S. castaneaefoliella</span> leaf mines on native and nonnative <span>Castanea</span> spp.; however, our sample size was small. Thus, we guardedly conclude that nonnative <span>Castanea</span> spp. can serve as refugia for <span>C. dentata</span> leafminers native to North America while acknowledging that the extent to which nonnative species are utilized requires further investigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"068dbd00eb93c9fe906fa9c1b7434f1ed50a86d4ca0bc5ee9b449bde6311b6d3","category":"Environment"}
