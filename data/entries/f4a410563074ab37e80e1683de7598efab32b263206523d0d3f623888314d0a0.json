Previous studies have tried various stratigraphic classification methods but lack an effective combination of geophysical methods. Based on the analysis of rock strata and dating tests, combined with geophysical well-logging data, shallow seismic reflection, and paleomagnetic dating, the Quaternary strata of the deep-covered area in the Hebei Plain was divided into the Lower Pleistocene series, the Middle Pleistocene series, the Upper Pleistocene series, and the Holocene series. By observing the cores of the Quaternary borehole QHJ02, this paper focused on dividing its loose sediments into eight lithological sections, according to the lithology, sediment colour, sedimentary assemblage, and sedimentary environment. The geomagnetic polarity belt is divided according to the paleomagnetic inclination of the paleomagnetic sample in borehole QHJ02. The results of the paleomagnetic test show that the interval of 0â€“101.3 m is Brunhes normal polarity chron, the interval from 101.3 to 219.5 m is Matuyama reversed polarity chron, and the interval from 219.5 to 350 m is Gauss normal polarity chron. The amplitude of the geophysical logging curve shows a good correspondence with the lithology of the QHJ02 borehole. The lithology changes can be identified through the abrupt abnormal positions of logging curves such as gamma ray, resistivity, and magnetization to analyze the sedimentary environment combination and determine the formation boundary. According to the combination of paleomagnetic, shallow seismic reflection, and geophysical well logging methods, we can determine the bottom boundaries of the Quaternary and middle Pleistocene are 219.5 m and 101.3 m, respectively. According to the combination of geophysical well-logging, lithostratigraphic assessment, dating experiment of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry <sup>14</sup>C (AMS <sup>14</sup>C), and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), we can determine the bottom of the upper Pleistocene and the lower limit of Holocene to be at 45.4 m and 21.4 m, respectively. Based on a comprehensive analysis of rock stratigraphic characteristics and well-logging curves, this study investigated the paleoenvironmental characteristics of borehole QHJ02 at different ages. The Upper Neogene was characterized by branch channels and river floodplains, with localized occurrences of alluvial fans, avulsion fans, and inter-channel lowlands. During the Early Pleistocene, branch channels and inter-channel lowlands dominated, with localized river floodplains. The Middle Pleistocene witnessed alternating branch channels and river floodplains as the main paleoenvironments. In the Late Pleistocene, branch channels and inter-channel lowlands were prevalent. The Holocene saw a combination of natural levees and river flood-plain environments. These findings enhance our understanding of the geological evolution and paleoenvironmental changes in the North Hebei Plain.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"f4a410563074ab37e80e1683de7598efab32b263206523d0d3f623888314d0a0","category":"Environment"}
