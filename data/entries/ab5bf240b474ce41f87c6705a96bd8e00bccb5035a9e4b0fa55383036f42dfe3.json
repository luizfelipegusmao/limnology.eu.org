{"title":"Non Linear Asymptotic Analysis of Muscle Dynamics Using Diagnostic Electromyographic (D-EMG) Signal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0911/v1","date":1720666344000,"content":"Article explores participant specific study of muscle inherehit dynamics hidden inside the diognostic electromyography (D-EMG) signals during load pull exercises, aiming to uncover underlying patterns and nonlinear behaviors. Employing a multi-step analytical framework, the study first evaluates signal stationarity through Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot and surrogate data analyses, revealing insights into signal stability. Subsequent use of phase space reconstruction techniques exposes intrinsic dynamics within the EMG signals, visualized through Poincar´e maps, elucidating attractor geometry and system dynamics. Histogram analysis further dissects the Poincar´e maps, offering insights into signal behavior relative to physiological processes. Additionally, the study quantifies the largest Lyapunov exponent from the Poincar´e maps, providing a measure of dynamical complexity within the muscle EMG signals during load pull exercises. By integrating these methods, this research sheds light on the nuanced interplay between EMG signals and muscle activity during dynamic exercises, offering valuable insights for rehabilitation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab5bf240b474ce41f87c6705a96bd8e00bccb5035a9e4b0fa55383036f42dfe3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
