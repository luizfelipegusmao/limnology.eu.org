{"title":"Laboratory Cultivation of Coregonus ussuriensis Berg: A Comprehensive Study on Rearing from Egg to Adult Stage","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8867866?af=R","date":1697180400000,"content":"<p>Conservation aquaculture aids in restoring and rebuilding populations of endangered species through artificial breeding. The Ussuri cisco (<i>Coregonus ussuriensis</i> Berg) is a valuable fish species in China, known for its high nutritional value. However, its current yield heavily relies on fishing, leading to a rapid decline in wild populations. This study documents the successful artificial breeding of <i>C. ussuriensis</i> and provides a comprehensive description of its life cycle. We performed in situ gamete stripping followed by manual fertilization. Fertilized eggs were incubated at the Bohai cold-water fish experimental station in Mudanjiang, China, where seed breeding and parental fish farming were conducted. Under controlled conditions, we obtained around 110,000 fertilized eggs. After a 2-month incubation period, we obtained around 50,000 oviparous eggs with an eyed rate of 45.5%. Additionally, we observed over 30,000 larvae with a hatching rate of 60%. We produced 20,000 juvenile fish weighing 30 g after 1 year. This procedure facilitates the successful completion of the <i>C. ussuriensis</i> life cycle in aquaculture, aiding in the species’ recovery.</p>","author":"Enhui Liu, \nTianqing Huang, \nWei Gu, \nGaochao Wang, \nBing Liu, \nBingqian Wang, \nGefeng Xu, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"5615fc772eb904e725c3b9c85680cfb0387f575b94ff47f66cb9e5748283ba7a","category":"Environment"}
