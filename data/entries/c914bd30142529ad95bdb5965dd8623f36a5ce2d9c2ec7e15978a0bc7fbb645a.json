{"title":"Comprehensive Phylogenetic and Immunogenic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and Related Coronaviruses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0901/v1","date":1726061309000,"content":"The continues evolution of coronaviruses has gained considerable attention prior to the outbreak of COVID 19. Although, COVID-19 is currently not recognized as a global pandemic, the virus's ability to evolve and cause disease outbreaks in both humans and animals necessitates ongoing research into its genetic and structural characteristics. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin, rapid evolution, as were as the immunogenicity of coronaviruses is a critical step towards preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. This study aimed to uncover the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among the main viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Amino acid sequences of structural viral proteins spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein, and envelope protein were retrieved from the NCBI database for SARS-CoV-2 and 13 other coronaviruses. Here, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV, suggesting their potential role in the emergence of the virus. Additionally, we predicted novel epitopes, glycosylation sites, and cleavage sites, identifying three novel glycosylation sites (NATR, NXSN, and NGTK) and six new CTL epitopes (XSNQVAVLY, NSFTRGVYY, NATRFASVY, STQDLFLPF, NSASFSTFK, and ASFSTFKCY). Our comparative analysis revealed that BatCoV RaTG13 has the closest cleavage site to SARS-CoV-2, with significant similarities also observed with Pangolin-CoV. The study highlighted the unique features of SARS-CoV-2, including its furin cleavage site, which may account for its high infectivity during the pandemic. These findings contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its relationship with other coronaviruses, providing critical insights for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and antiviral therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c914bd30142529ad95bdb5965dd8623f36a5ce2d9c2ec7e15978a0bc7fbb645a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
