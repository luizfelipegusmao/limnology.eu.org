{"title":"Expansin SlExp1 and endoglucanase SlCel2 synergistically promote fruit softening and cell wall disassembly in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/709/7449576?rss=1","date":1700784000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fruit softening, an irreversible process that occurs during fruit ripening, can lead to losses and waste during postharvest transportation and storage. Cell wall disassembly is the main factor leading to loss of fruit firmness, and several ripening-associated cell wall genes have been targeted for genetic modification, particularly pectin modifiers. However, individual knockdown of most cell wall–related genes has had minimal influence on cell wall integrity and fruit firmness, with the notable exception of pectate lyase. Compared to pectin disassembly, studies of the cell wall matrix, the xyloglucan–cellulose framework, and underlying mechanisms during fruit softening are limited. Here, a tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) fruit ripening–associated <span>α</span>-expansin (<span>SlExpansin1</span>/<span>SlExp1</span>) and an endoglucanase (<span>SlCellulase2</span>/<span>SlCel2</span>), which function in the cell wall matrix, were knocked out individually and together using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9-mediated genome editing. Simultaneous knockout of <span>SlExp1</span> and <span>SlCel2</span> enhanced fruit firmness, reduced depolymerization of homogalacturonan-type pectin and xyloglucan, and increased cell adhesion. In contrast, single knockouts of either <span>SlExp1</span> or <span>SlCel2</span> did not substantially change fruit firmness, while simultaneous overexpression of <span>SlExp1</span> and <span>SlCel2</span> promoted early fruit softening. Collectively, our results demonstrate that <span>SlExp1</span> and <span>SlCel2</span> synergistically regulate cell wall disassembly and fruit softening in tomato.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"d776a47e558755fdcbd9088341ab2df3cd000bd79dbcc8f450f64a31e02ebbd5","category":"Environment"}
