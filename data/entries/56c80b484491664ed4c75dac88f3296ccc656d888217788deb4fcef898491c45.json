{"title":"Investigating the Secrets of Stonehenge with Raman Spectroscopy: Provenance of the Ancient Altar Stone","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/3/28/7687033?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In-field compositional analysis of large prehistoric relics, such as the Altar Stone at Stonehenge (England), is limited due to the size of the relics and difficulty in obtaining samples that can be analyzed in a laboratory. In this study, a portable Raman spectroscopy system was used to analyze the Altar Stone to help determine its origin and classification, which appears to differ from other bluestones at Stonehenge. While the study is ongoing and the definitive origin of the Altar Stone is not yet known, this study demonstrates the applicability of a portable Raman spectroscopy system in the compositional analysis of large samples in the field.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"56c80b484491664ed4c75dac88f3296ccc656d888217788deb4fcef898491c45","category":"Environment"}
