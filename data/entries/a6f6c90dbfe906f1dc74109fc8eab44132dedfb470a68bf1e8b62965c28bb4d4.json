{"title":"Harnessing Metabolites as Serum Biomarkers for Liver Graft Pathology Prediction Using Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1827/v1","date":1711709338000,"content":"Graft injury affects over 50% of liver transplant (LT) recipients, but non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose and guide treatment are currently limited. We aimed to develop a biomarker of graft injury by integrating serum metabolomic profiles with clinical variables. Serum from 55 LT recipients with biopsy confirmed metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and biliary complications was collected and processed using a combination of LC-MS/MS assay. The metabolomic profiles were integrated with clinical information using a multi-class Machine Learning (ML) classifier. The efficacy of the model was assessed through the evaluation of the Out-of-Bag (OOB) error estimate. Our ML model yielded an overall accuracy of 79.66% with an OOB estimate of the error rate at 19.75%. The model exhibited a maximum ability to distinguish MASH, with an OOB error estimate of 7.4% compared to 22.2% for biliary and 29.6% for TCMR. The metabolites serine and serotonin emerged as the topmost predictors. When predicting binary outcomes using 3 models: Biliary (biliary vs. rest), MASH (MASH vs. rest) and TCMR (TCMR vs. rest), the AUCs were 0.882, 0.972 and 0.96 respectively. Our ML tool integrating serum metabolites with clinical variables shows promise as a non-invasive, multi-class serum biomarker of graft pathology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6f6c90dbfe906f1dc74109fc8eab44132dedfb470a68bf1e8b62965c28bb4d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
