{"title":"Indolizidines from Actinomycetes: An Overview over Producers, Biosynthesis and Bioactivities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1365/v1","date":1718796088000,"content":"Indolizidines have long been recognized for their valuable bioactivities, their common feature being a bicyclic structure connected via a nitrogen atom. Traditionally, plants have been identified as the primary producers. However, recent discoveries have revealed that certain bacterial strains belonging to the genus of actinomycetes also possess the ability to synthesize various indolizidine-based compounds. Among these strains, Streptomyces sp. HNA39, Saccharopolyspora sp. RL78, and Streptomyces NCIB 11649 have been identified as producers of cyclizidines, characterized by their distinctive cyclopropyl moiety. Additionally, Streptomyces griseus OS-3601 synthesizes a unique class of indolizidine derivatives known as iminimycines, distinguished by their rare imine-cation structure. Protoplast fusion of a Streptomyces griseus strain with Streptomyces tenjimariensis resulted in a new indolizidine named in-dolizomycin. This review aims to provide an overview of known bacterial indolizidine producers, summarize current knowledge regarding the biosynthesis of cyclizidines and iminimycines, and assess their bioactivities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d28ea79efe87aecd0a21bbe3a92cbdf5664d54b44db5a5043a469a2fb97ba8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
