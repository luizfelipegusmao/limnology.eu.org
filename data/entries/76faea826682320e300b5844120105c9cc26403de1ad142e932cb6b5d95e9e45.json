{"title":"Hardware-Software Compatibility in Robotic Cyber-Physical Systems &ndash; an Application Based Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0117/v1","date":1727863174000,"content":"The sciences related to production engineering consider many aspects related to cyber physical systems (CPS), in particular robots, treating them as implementations of the Industry 4.0 con-cept. The construction of CPS remains the domain of various engineering disciplines - mechan-ics, control theory or computer science. The problem of communication occurring during the implementation of the control of a single robot understood as a CPS object may concern the ex-change of data within a CPS or between different CPSs. In this area, software and hardware compatibility problems arise. Therefore, the paper presents a modular application for the ex-change of process data between mechatronic devices such as robots, which solves this problem. The work is complemented by an example of the use of the presented application in communi-cation between a mobile wheeled robot with Macanum wheels and a quadruped robot based on a motion capture system. It was assumed that the control of the wheeled robot would be realized from the perspective of implementing the basic robotics task of driving to a target, while the quadruped robot, representing a moving target, together with the motion capture system, would constitute a CPS whose outputs are incompatible in a software and hardware sense. With this choice of example, main attention was focused on the particular importance of multidisci-plinary in the context of the communication problem and also provide an application that al-lows for a modular solution to the problem of software/hardware compatibility in the commu-nication problem. This, in turn, is of interest to researchers associated with various engineering disciplines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76faea826682320e300b5844120105c9cc26403de1ad142e932cb6b5d95e9e45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
