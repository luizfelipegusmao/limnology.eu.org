{"title":"Investigating The Applicability Of The Peak Density Thickness Parameter Over The Equatorial Region- A One-Day Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0037/v1","date":1722569954000,"content":"This research builds on the previously established Peak Density Thickness (PDT) concept for midlatitudes at Millstone Hill by examining its applicability at equatorial latitudes using data from the Jicamarca Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) in Lima, Peru. An 18-hour dataset was meticulously analyzed to capture the F2 layer's PDT parameter with high spatial resolution. This study aims to confirm the presence of the PDT phenomenon at equatorial latitudes, utilizing Jicamarca ISR and the co-located Digisonde station. The results indicate that the PDT parameter reaches its peak value around solar noon, consistent with observations at Millstone Hill and high latitudes. Additionally, the Nsumei et al. Vary-Chap topside model was employed to reconstruct the topside ionospheric profile, validating its utility across different latitudes. These findings suggest that incorporating the Peak Density Thickness Ï‡ into ionospheric models can enhance the accuracy of topside specifications derived from ground-based ionosonde measurements. This research highlights the significance of the PDT parameter in understanding ionospheric plasma dynamics and improving predictive models of ionospheric behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1bf1612abad2c28c5db87df182d60eeb116de4a562dec28e8d18799bfde9778f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
