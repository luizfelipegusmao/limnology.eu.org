{"title":"Coral reefs in transition: Temporal photoquadrat analyses and validation of underwater hyperspectral imaging for resource-efficient monitoring in Guam","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299523","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Matthew S.

Lafac Bay, a marine protected area in northeast Guam, served as a reference site for benthic communities typical of forereefs on the windward side of the island. The staghorn coral <i>Acropora abrotanoides</i> is a dominant and characteristic ecosystem engineer of forereef communities on exposed shorelines. Photoquadrat surveys were conducted in 2015, 2017, and 2019, and a diver-operated hyperspectral imager (i.e., DiveRay) was used to survey the same transects in 2019. Machine learning algorithms were used to develop an automated pipeline to assess the benthic cover of 10 biotic and abiotic categories in 2019 based on hyperspectral imagery. The cover of scleractinian corals did not differ between 2015 and 2017 despite being subjected to a series of environmental disturbances in these years. Surveys in 2019 documented the almost complete decline of the habitat-defining staghorn coral <i>Acropora abrotanoides</i> (a practically complete disappearance from about 10% cover), a significant decrease (~75%) in the cover of other scleractinian corals, and a significant increase (~55%) in the combined cover of bare substrate, turf algae, and cyanobacteria. The drastic change in community composition suggests that the reef at Lafac Bay is transitioning to a turf algae-dominated community. However, the capacity of this reef to recover from previous disturbances suggests that this transition could be reversed, making Lafac Bay an excellent candidate for long-term monitoring. Community analyses showed no significant difference between automatically classified benthic cover estimates derived from the hyperspectral scans in 2019 and those derived from photoquadrats. These findings suggest that underwater hyperspectral imagers can be efficient and effective tools for fast, frequent, and accurate monitoring of dynamic reef communities.","author":"Matthew S.
