This imaging method is traditionally done in scanning electron microscopes (SEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.066-B2\">2</a>] but has recently seen more frequent implementation in scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.066-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.066-B4\">4</a>], referred to STEM EBIC. STEM EBIC on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) specimens results in secondary electron (SE) emission, which is caused by the primary beam interaction with the specimen. Measurement of the positive current resulting from emission of SEs is known as secondary-electron-emission EBIC (SEEBIC) [<a href=\"#ozae044.066-B4\">4</a>]. STEM SEEBIC imaging delivers improved spatial resolution at the atomic scale [<a href=\"#ozae044.066-B5\">5</a>] because of the smaller interaction volume associated with the SE emission process (compared to electron-hole pair separation-based EBIC), with thin STEM specimens, and with higher beam energy. The potential of STEM EBIC in failure analysis of advanced semiconductor devices is significant with STEM SEEBICâ€™s capability of assessing connectivity and conductivity in devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.066-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.066-B5\">5</a>]. For successful STEM SEEBIC imaging of devices, specimen preparation is critical because the SE emission-based contrast is extremely surface sensitive and can be affected by surface topography and SE yield, both of which can be significantly impacted by artifacts of focused ion beam (FIB) preparation, especially when using conductive Ga<sup>+</sup> ions. In this work, we use STEM-EBIC to assess the surface quality of specimens prepared using the FIB system and that were prepared using the Ga FIB system followed by post-FIB Ar ion milling that removes FIB-induced artifacts [<a href=\"#ozae044.066-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"460a14982cc7ad4d589321520962fed1f91a49b2cb175025682cb7413ec2f793","category":"Environment"}
