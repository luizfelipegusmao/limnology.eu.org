In the western United States, no surveys have been published regarding the bacteria associated with unionid mussels. Herein, we examine locations of known mussel mortality events in the Chehalis River (Washington), in the Crooked River (Oregon), and Owyhee River (Oregon). Mussel populations considered healthy were sampled in the Skookumchuck River (Washington) for comparison. A variety of bacteria were isolated from these populations, and most notably, <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. were identified from 82% of moribund individuals of <i>Gonidea angulata</i> in the Owyhee River. Future work evaluating whether <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. are pathogenic to freshwater mussels could be valuable in unraveling the factors associated with these enigmatic mortality events.</p>","author":"Eric M.
