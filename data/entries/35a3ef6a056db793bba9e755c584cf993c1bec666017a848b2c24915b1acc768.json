Apple has not launched an ‌iPad‌ since, but it appears that Apple could be making this change on future iPads as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn January of this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/\">code discovered in iOS 17.4</a> suggested the next ‌iPad Pro‌ could adopt a similar design for the ‌FaceTime‌ camera. \"During ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>‌ setup, ‌iPad‌ needs to be in landscape with the camera at the top of the screen,\" read the code. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow, occasional leaker <a href=\"https://weibo.com/n/刹那数码\">Instant Digital</a> on the Chinese social platform Weibo has claimed that this change is also coming to the two rumored new versions of the ‌iPad Air‌, in both 10.9 and 12.9-inch sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHow Apple has achieved this switch to a landscape ‌FaceTime‌ camera on the new ‌iPad‌ models is unclear, since the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> connects to both the ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ using an inductive magnetic charger along the same side. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut with Apple rumored to be launching a new ‌Apple Pencil‌ alongside the updated iPads, Apple may have come up with a solution to the issue. Either way, we should find out soon. Both the new ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌OLED ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ models are expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/\">as soon as this month</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">Instant Digital</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">iPad Air and iPad Pro Could Both Feature Landscape FaceTime Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-could-both-feature-landscape-facetime-camera.2421402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35a3ef6a056db793bba9e755c584cf993c1bec666017a848b2c24915b1acc768","category":"Apple"}
