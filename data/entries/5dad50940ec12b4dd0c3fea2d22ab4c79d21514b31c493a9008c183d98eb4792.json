{"title":"The Second Critical Exponent for a Time Fractional Reaction-Diffusion Equation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2242/v1","date":1722244415000,"content":"In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem of a time fractional nonlinear diffusion equation. According to the Kaplanâ€™s first eigenvalue method, we first prove the blow-up of the solutions in finite time for some sufficient conditions. We next give sufficient conditions for the existence of global solutions by using the result of Zhang and Sun. In conclusions, we find the second critical exponent for the existence of global and non-global solutions via the decay rates of the initial data at spatial infinity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5dad50940ec12b4dd0c3fea2d22ab4c79d21514b31c493a9008c183d98eb4792","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
