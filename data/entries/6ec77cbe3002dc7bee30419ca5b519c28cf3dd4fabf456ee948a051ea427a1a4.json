{"title":"Integrated Analysis of Remdesivir and Paxlovid in COVID-19 Patients: A Personalized Approach to High-Risk Individuals for Severe Evolution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2223/v1","date":1727576605000,"content":"Background/Objectives: COVID-19 led to a pandemic that has brought misery to millions of people but more so to those with pre-existing conditions. For this infection, several antiviral drugs were employed, including remdesivir (R) and paxlovid [nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NR)]; Methods: The current study compared the effectiveness of remdesivir and paxlovid treatment for COVID-19 patients with comorbid conditions. Data from a cohort of 151 adult patients with COVID-19 who also had associated comorbidities were used in this study. These patients were treated with antivirals according to local guidelines. The subjects included 78 case-patients assigned to group R and 73 to group NR; Results: In group NR, a considerable improvement in oxygen saturation was seen in the first 24 hours of treatment (p=0.010), but the levels were significantly higher from the second day of treatment (p &amp;lt;0.001) in group R of patients. At the end of the 5 days of treatment, the oxygen saturation improved statistically significantly compared to the admission day, but only in the R group (95.11±1.80; 91.76±1.80; p&amp;lt;0.001); Conclusions: Both drugs can be considered a breakthrough in the current treatment approach to the COVID-19 disease since they provide readily available options that can alleviate the severity of the disease and, hence, the prognosis of patients. That is why their effectiveness relies on the correct administration time and choosing the patient with suitable characteristics regarding the presence of comorbidities and the likelihood of the critical further development of the process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ec77cbe3002dc7bee30419ca5b519c28cf3dd4fabf456ee948a051ea427a1a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
