{"title":"Sensors and Strategy for Anticollision Function dedicated to Augmented Electric Wheelchair","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0524/v1","date":1712563162000,"content":"Today, there are commercially available high-performance electric wheelchairs, capa-ble of responding to strong limitations. However, despite these advancements, there is a significant portion of the population with severe disabilities who cannot access this mobility solution due to safety reasons. Indeed, either due to motor issues preventing reliable control of the wheelchair's commands, or associated visual or cognitive pathologies, the use of an electric wheelchair by these individuals would put them at risk and could also constitute a danger to those around them. This is why our research team is working on the development of augmented wheelchairs that allow a greater autonomy. We are mainly developing a system compatible with all electric wheel-chairs on the market, capable of making them anti-collision and anti-fall on uneven ground (sidewalks, stairs, etc.). In this article, we present our solution regarding the anti-collision function, in particular the sensors used to do this, as well as the strategy. We will focus on the shortcomings and weaknesses of various types of sensors and demonstrate how, by combining them in a certain way, we can develop a collision avoidance device capable of managing the diversity of everyday life situations. The two types of sensors that will be combined here are an in-house developed special near infrared sensor from the laboratory and a commercially available ultrasonic sensor. We will present the internal operation of the sensors, their limitations, experimental tests involving integration with the wheelchair, and the structure of the complete device.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98650130a25cf73074598bdcb7f375f6d7a9263ca782366351e185b94563593f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
