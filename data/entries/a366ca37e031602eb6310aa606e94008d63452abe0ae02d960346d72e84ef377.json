{"title":"Association between rosacea and helicobacter pylori infection: A meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301703","date":1712239200000,"content":"<p>by Ying Gao, Xiao-jing Yang, Yun Zhu, Ming Yang, Fei Gu</p>\r\nBackground and objectives <p>The potential association between rosacea and a heightened prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection has been previously suggested. However, existing studies offer inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the relationship between rosacea and HP infection.</p> Methods <p>We conducted comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant observational studies for our investigation. We utilized the random-effects model to aggregate the data to address the potential influence of heterogeneity among the studies on the outcome.</p> Results <p>Our analysis incorporated twenty-five datasets from 23 case-control and cross-sectional studies, encompassing 51,054 rosacea patients and 4,709,074 controls without skin disease. The pooled results revealed a significantly higher prevalence of HP infection in individuals with rosacea compared to controls (odds ratio [OR]: 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17–1.95, p&lt;0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 79%). Subgroup analysis indicated an increased prevalence of HP infection in rosacea studies that utilized one (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.11–2.66, p = 0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 76%) or more tests for HP infection (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.29–3.98, p = 0.005; I<sup>2</sup> = 56%). However, this association was not observed in population-based studies that determined HP infection based on prescription records for HP eradication drugs (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.76–1.07, p = 0.024; I<sup>2</sup> = 54%).</p> Conclusion <p>Rosacea may be significantly associated with a higher prevalence of HP infection. High-quality prospective studies with delicately controlled confounding factors are needed to determine if HP infection is a risk factor for rosacea.</p>","author":"Ying Gao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a366ca37e031602eb6310aa606e94008d63452abe0ae02d960346d72e84ef377","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
