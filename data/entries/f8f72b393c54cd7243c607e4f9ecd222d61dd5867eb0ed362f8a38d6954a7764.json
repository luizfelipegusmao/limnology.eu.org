One reason is that telemedicine can be accurately evaluated and compared to its substitute only after the product has been adopted and experienced. As such, an intervention that increases the probability of a first experience can have lasting effects. This article reports the results of a randomized field experiment conducted in collaboration with a health insurance company. During the intervention, half of the households out of 3,469 in the sample received periodic e-mails with information about the available services. It effectively increased the take-up and demand for telemedicine. Within the first 8 months of the experiment, patients assigned to the treatment group were 6 percentage points more likely to have used the service at least once (and had about five times the odds of using telemedicine compared to those in the control group). Eight months after the start of the intervention, the number of virtual consultations by the treatment group was six times larger than that of the control group. These results, even if limited by the sample and context in which the intervention took place, provide additional evidence about how information interventions can increase technological take-up within the health sector and could serve as the stepping stone for evaluating the impact of telemedicine on health outcomes causally.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"f8f72b393c54cd7243c607e4f9ecd222d61dd5867eb0ed362f8a38d6954a7764","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
