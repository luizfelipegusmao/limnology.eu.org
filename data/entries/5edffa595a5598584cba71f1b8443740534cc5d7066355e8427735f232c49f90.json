{"title":"Understanding A&beta; Peptide Binding to Lipid Membranes. A Biophysical Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1947/v1","date":1714480476000,"content":"Aβ peptides are known to bind neural plasma membranes in a process leading to the deposit of Aβ-enriched plaques. These extracellular structures are characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, the major cause of late-age dementia. The mechanisms of Aβ plaque formation and deposition are far from being understood. A vast amount of literature describes the efforts to analyze those mechanisms, using a variety of tools. The present review focuses on biophysical studies, mostly carried out with model membranes, or with computational tools. The review starts by describing basic physical aspects of lipid phases, and commonly used model membranes (monolayers and bilayers). This is followed by a discussion of biophysical techniques applied to these systems, mainly but not exclusively Langmuir monolayers, isothermal calorimetry, density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and molecular dynamics. The methodological section is followed by the core of the review, a summary of important results obtained with each technique. The last section is devoted to an overall reflection and an effort in understanding Aβ-bilayer binding. Concepts such as Aβ peptide membrane binding, adsorption, and insertion are defined and differentiated. The roles of membrane lipid order, nanodomain formation, and electrostatic forces in Aβ-membrane interaction are separately identified and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5edffa595a5598584cba71f1b8443740534cc5d7066355e8427735f232c49f90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
