{"title":"A First Principles Study of Lithium Adsorption in Nanoporous Graphene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0146/v1","date":1725348829000,"content":"Nanoporous graphene structures have high accessible surface area for lithium-ion adsorption or intercalation. Here, we present theoretical investigations on lithium-ion adsorption mechanism in a graphene nanopore. Ab initio electronic structure calculations are performed based on density functional theory. We also study different lithium-ion distributions in graphene nanopores to determination multilayer lithium-nanoporous graphene structures for lithium-ion batteries.  We believe, these multilayer nanoporous graphene nanostructures with more pores opening can offer improved capacity and better rate performance for energy storage applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8487c6cf64f64d8102e007618a54fb274f3373dcb7732f4246c1a0a174855f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
