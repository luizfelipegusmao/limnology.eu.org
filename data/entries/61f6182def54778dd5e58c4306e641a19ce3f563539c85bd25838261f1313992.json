{"title":"Part-Prototypes Models in Medical Imaging: Applications and Current Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0771/v1","date":1725946550000,"content":"The last wave of Artificial Intelligence is dedicating particular emphasis to the line of \nexplainability research. The potential of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in producing \ntrustworthy computer-aided-diagnosis systems and its usage for knowledge discovery are collecting\ninterest in the Medical Imaging (MI) community to support the diagnostic process and the discovery\nof image biomarkers. Most of the existing XAI applications in MI were focused on interpreting \nthe predictions returned by deep neural networks, typically including attribution techniques with \nsaliency map approaches and other feature visualization methods. However, these are often criticized \nfor providing incorrect and incomplete representations of the black-box modelsâ€™ behaviour. This \nraises the attention in proposing models intentionally designed to be self-explanatory. In particular, \npart-prototype (PP) models are interpretable-by-design computer vision (CV) models that base their \ndecision process in learning and identifying representative prototypical parts from the input images, \nand they are collecting increasing interest and results in MI applications. This narrative review \nprovides a summary of existing PP networks, their application in MI analysis and current challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61f6182def54778dd5e58c4306e641a19ce3f563539c85bd25838261f1313992","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
