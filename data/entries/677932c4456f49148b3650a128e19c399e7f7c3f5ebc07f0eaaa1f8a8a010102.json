{"title":"Effect of forage quality and narasin inclusion on ruminal fermentation, nutrient intake, and total tract digestibility of Nellore steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae107/7714574?rss=1","date":1721088000000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>The study aimed to evaluate the effects of forage quality and narasin inclusion on intake, digestibility, and ruminal fermentation of Nellore steers. Twenty-eight rumen-cannulated Nellore steers (initial body weight [<strong>BW</strong>] = 350 ± 32.4 kg) were allocated to individual pens in a randomized complete block design, with 7 blocks, defined according to the fasting BW at the beginning of the experiment. The steers were randomly assigned within blocks to 1 of 4 experimental diets in 2 × 2 factorial arrangements, being the first-factor forage quality (<strong>MEDIUM</strong> = 81 g of CP/kg of dry matter [<strong>DM</strong>], and <strong>HIGH</strong> = 153 g of CP/kg of DM), and the second factor was the inclusion (<strong>N13</strong> = diet plus 13 mg/kg of DM of narasin) or not (<strong>N0</strong>) of narasin (Zimprova; Elanco Animal Health, São Paulo, Brazil). The experiment consisted of a 28-d period with 22 d for adaptation and the last 6 d for data collection. No haylage quality × narasin interaction (<span>P </span>≥ 0.68) was observed on DM and nutrient intake. Haylage quality affected (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.01) DM intake, with greater values observed for steers fed HIGH compared with MEDIUM haylage. There was an increase (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) in OM, NDF, hemicellulose, and CP intake for steers consuming HIGH vs. MEDIUM haylage. Including N13 did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.39) DM and nutrient intake of steers. No haylage quality × narasin interactions were detected (<span>P ≥ </span>0.60) for total tract nutrient digestibility. However, steers fed with HIGH haylage showed an increase (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.001) in DM and digestibility of all nutrients compared with MEDIUM. Steers fed a MEDIUM haylage had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) proportion of acetate compared with steers fed HIGH during all evaluated hours. Steers fed HIGH haylage had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) proportion of propionate at 0 h compared with steers consuming MEDIUM, whereas at 12 h, steers consuming MEDIUM hay had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) proportion of propionate vs. HIGH haylage. A haylage quality × narasin and haylage quality × time of collection interactions were detected (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.03) for rumen ammonia concentration, which was reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) in N13 vs. N0 steers consuming HIGH haylage. Collectively, high-quality haylage allows increased consumption and digestibility, with more energy-efficient ruminal fermentation. In addition, narasin might be an important nutritional tool in forage-based diets to enhance the ruminal fermentation parameters of <span>Bos indicus</span> Nellore steers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"677932c4456f49148b3650a128e19c399e7f7c3f5ebc07f0eaaa1f8a8a010102","category":"Environment"}
