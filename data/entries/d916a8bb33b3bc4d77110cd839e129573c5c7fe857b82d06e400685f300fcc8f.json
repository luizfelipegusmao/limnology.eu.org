{"title":"Morphology, morphogenesis and molecular phylogeny of two freshwater ciliates (Alveolata, Ciliophora), with description of Pseudosincirra binaria sp. nov. and redefinition of Pseudosincirra and Perisincirra","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1727/v1","date":1724408127000,"content":"Ciliated microeukaryotes are insufficiently integratively investigated despite their ubiquity and ecological significance. The morphology and ontogenesis of a new Stichotrichida species, Pseudosincirra binaria sp. nov., and the known Perisincirra paucicirrata Foissner et al., 2002, are here studied using live observations and protargol staining methods. The new species is characterized by having one buccal, one parabuccal and three frontal cirri, one frontoventral row extending to the posterior half of the cell, three left and two right marginal rows, three dorsal kineties with the left kinety conspicuously bipartite, along with one caudal cirrus at the rear end of each kinety. During morphogenesis, there exist five frontal-ventral cirral anlagen with anlagen IV and V forming frontoventral row in the proter, and four anlagen with anlage IV generating frontoventral row in the opisthe. The anlagen for marginal rows and dorsal kineties develop intrakinetally. The new population of Perisincirra paucicirrata corresponds well with other isolates regarding morphology and cell development. Phylogenetic analyses based on the small subunit ribosomal gene sequence data revealed that both Perisincirra and Pseudosincirra are deeply clustered in the clade consisting of species from the genera Deviata and Heterodeviata, supporting the placement of both genera into the family Deviatidae Foissner, 2016.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d916a8bb33b3bc4d77110cd839e129573c5c7fe857b82d06e400685f300fcc8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
