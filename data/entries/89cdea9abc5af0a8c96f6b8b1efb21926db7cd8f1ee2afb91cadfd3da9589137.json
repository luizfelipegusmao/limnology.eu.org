{"title":"Leaf hydraulic properties of Antarctic plants: effects of growth temperature and its coordination with photosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/2013/7510498?rss=1","date":1704326400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>One of the well-documented effects of regional warming in Antarctica is the impact on flora. Warmer conditions modify several leaf anatomical traits of Antarctic vascular plants, increasing photosynthesis and growth. Given that CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor partially share their diffusion pathways through the leaf, changes in leaf anatomy could also affect the hydraulic traits of Antarctic plants. We evaluated the effects of growth temperature on several anatomical and hydraulic parameters of Antarctic plants and assessed the trait co-variation between these parameters and photosynthetic performance. Warmer conditions promoted an increase in leaf and whole plant hydraulic conductivity, correlating with adjustments in carbon assimilation. These adjustments were consistent with changes in leaf vasculature, where Antarctic species displayed different strategies. At higher temperature, <span>Colobanthus quitensis</span> decreased the number of leaf xylem vessels, but increased their diameter. In contrast, in <span>Deschampsia antarctica</span> the diameter did not change, but the number of vessels increased. Despite this contrasting behavior, some traits such as a small leaf diameter of vessels and a high cell wall rigidity were maintained in both species, suggesting a water-conservation response associated with the ability of Antarctic plants to cope with harsh environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"89cdea9abc5af0a8c96f6b8b1efb21926db7cd8f1ee2afb91cadfd3da9589137","category":"Environment"}
