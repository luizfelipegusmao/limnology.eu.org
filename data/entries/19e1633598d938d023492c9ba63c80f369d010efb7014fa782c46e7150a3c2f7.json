{"title":"Mapping the Research Landscape of Conservation Agriculture as a Panacea for Achieving Soil Health and Sustainable Development Goals Using Scientometrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0612/v1","date":1720430396000,"content":"This work mapped the research chronology and conceptual trends on conservation agriculture-soil health-sustainable development goals nexus by analyzing data from related literature. This is the first-time different bibliometric methods such as VOSviewer, Flourish, as well as Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny models in RStudio were simultaneously used to investigate the research impacts and/or interactions between conservation agriculture (CA), soil health and sustainable development at global scale. On 20th February 2024, a search was launched on the web of science core collection using related search terms to extract relevant data. After the screening and elimination, the search produced 835 papers which were used in the bibliometric analysis. The revealed that USA (31%), India (27%), Australia (7%), England (6%), China (6%), Canada (5%), and other countries had below 5% of the published documents. Many of the papers covered zero hunger (38%), climate action (30%), life on land (26%), while other SDGs had relatively low coverage. The study found the adoption of no till, cover cropping, and organic amendments by the authors as the common CA practices. The hybrid bibliometric approach provided a clear roadmap in understanding the global research trajectory on CA-soil health and SDGs nexus, as well as the roles of countries, authors, institutions, publishing journals. This knowledge could support in championing future debates on CA potential for effective discussion and policies, especially in the developing countries where there have been low publications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19e1633598d938d023492c9ba63c80f369d010efb7014fa782c46e7150a3c2f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
