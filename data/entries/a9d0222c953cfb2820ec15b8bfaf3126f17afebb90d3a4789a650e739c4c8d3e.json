{"title":"It's gall relative: metabolic profiling of two morphologically distinct oak leaf galls induced by cynipid wasps","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/248/7585214?rss=1","date":1705881600000,"content":"<span>Plant galls are outgrowths on plant tissue induced by another organism. Galls benefit the inducer, which can come from a wide range of kingdoms, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes, plants, mites, and insects (<a href=\"#kiae032-B2\">Gatjens-Boniche 2019</a>, <a href=\"#kiae032-B3\">Harris and Pitzschke 2020</a>). Gall formation differs from regular plant development. They display a variety of forms depending on their inducer and the species and tissue of the host, and they are referred to as an extended phenotype of the inducer. Galls can be part of a mutualistic relationship with the host, such as in plant root nodules, but they are often parasitic (<a href=\"#kiae032-B3\">Harris and Pitzschke 2020</a>). These biotic interactions present a unique feat of bioengineering by the inducer, requiring genetic and structural reprogramming of the host.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a9d0222c953cfb2820ec15b8bfaf3126f17afebb90d3a4789a650e739c4c8d3e","category":"Environment"}
