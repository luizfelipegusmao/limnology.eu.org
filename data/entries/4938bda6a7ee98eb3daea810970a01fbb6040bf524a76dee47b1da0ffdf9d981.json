Results of an active surveillance adverse event reporting system for chiropractors and physiotherapists","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309069","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Katherine A.

Three content-validated questionnaires were used to collect AE information: two completed by the patient (pre-treatment [T<sub>0</sub>] and 2–7 days post-treatment [T<sub>2</sub>]) and one completed by the provider immediately post-treatment [T<sub>1</sub>]. Any new or worsened symptom was considered an AE and further classified as mild, moderate, severe or serious. From the 42 participating providers (31 chiropractors; 11 physiotherapists), 3819 patient visits had complete T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> assessments. The patients were on average 50±18 years of age and 62.5% females. Neck/back pain was the most common presenting condition (70.0%) with 24.3% of patients reporting no condition/preventative care. From the patients visits with a complete T<sub>2</sub> assessment (n = 2136 patient visits, 55.9%), 21.3% reported an AE, of which: 7.9% were mild, 6.2% moderate, 3.7% severe, 1.5% serious, and 2.0% had missing severity rating. The most common symptoms reported with moderate or higher severity were discomfort/pain, stiffness, difficulty walking and headache. This study provides valuable information for patients and providers regarding incidence and severity of AEs following patient visits in multiple community-based professions. These findings can be used to inform patients of what AEs may occur and future research opportunities can focus on mitigating common AEs.","author":"Katherine A.
