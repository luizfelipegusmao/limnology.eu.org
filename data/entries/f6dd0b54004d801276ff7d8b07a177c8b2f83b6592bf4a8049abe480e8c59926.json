{"title":"Review on the Axial Hydrokinetic Turbines. Field of Application and Efficiency Enhancement Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0520/v1","date":1715182929000,"content":"Along with the increasing industrialization of contries and population growth, the global. With the thougth of overcoming climate change and renducing greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, interest in alternative sloar, wind, water, geothermal, tidal and ocean wave energy has significantly increased. Hydropower is one of the most used inexhaustible sources of energy on a global scale. The efficiency of water turbines can be increased by optimizing the blade cascade and the casing. For this purpose, research is conducted on specialized laboratory benches. The purpose is to determine the influencing parameters which affecting the nature of the power and cavitaion curves This paper presents the results of numerical and laboratoty studies of axial hydrokinetic turbines. A detailed analysis of the influence of the geometric parameters of the blades on the operating curves is made. A mathematica model for synthesis of the blade cascade is derived. An assessment of water energy soures has been made and sites of high energy potential have been pointed. The present material can be used for development of a methodology for calculation of efficient axial hydrokinetic turbines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6dd0b54004d801276ff7d8b07a177c8b2f83b6592bf4a8049abe480e8c59926","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
