{"title":"Mitochondrial Control Region Database in Hungarian Fallow Deer (Dama dama) Populations for Forensic Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0161/v1","date":1717491404000,"content":"The evidential value of an mtDNA match between biological remains and its potential donor is determined by the random match probability of the haplotype. This probability is based on the haplotype’s population frequency estimate. Consequently, implementing a population study representative of the population relevant to the forensic case is vital to correctly evaluating the evidence. The emerging number of poaching cases and the limited availability of such data emphasizes the need for improved fallow deer mtDNA population databank for forensic purposes, including targeting the entire mitochondrial control region. By sequencing the whole mitochondrial control region in 138 animals from five populations in Hungary we found four different haplotypes, including one which has not yet been described. Our results, supplemented with data already available from previous research do not support the possibility of determining the population of origin, although some patterns of geographical separation can be distinguished. Estimates of molecular diversity indicate approximately similarly low mtDNA diversity (Hd=0.565 and π = 0.002), compared with data from other countries. The calculated random match probability of 0.547 shows a high probability of coincidence and, therefore, a limited capacity for exclusion. Consequently, it may be necessary to search for polymorphic sites on other mitochondrial gene sections or to sequence the entire mitogenome of fallow deer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2823537acda5a8ab9170c698d4f9efe4ea8f56881899ebaa2032920319e8764d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
