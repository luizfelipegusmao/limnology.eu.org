{"title":"A-optimal Designs of High-Order Mixture Central Polynomial Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2222/v1","date":1722324277000,"content":"This article systematically studied the A-optimal designs of a high-order mixture central polynomial model, which is an advancement of the research results for the A-optimal design of the most recent third-order mixture central polynomial model and a more accurate response surface model. This article is based on the simplex center design, obtaining measurement values at various design points, and verifying them through the A-optimal equivalence theorem. We also compare the A-efficiency of designs through examples, which can be applied to the A-optimal precise design of the fourth-order mixture model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a7fd25f9b7942a87de66c0ad02d5ea2ee41f280a736b0f97d70f1ea56d70bb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
