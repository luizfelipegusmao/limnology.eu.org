{"title":"Linguistic Secret Sharing via Ambiguous Token Selection for IoT Security","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0078/v1","date":1727849225000,"content":"The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant security challenges, including weak authentication, insufficient data protection, and firmware vulnerabilities. To address these issues, we propose a linguistic secret sharing scheme tailored for IoT applications. This scheme leverages neural networks to embed private data within texts transmitted by IoT devices, using an ambiguous token selection algorithm that maintains the textual integrity of the cover messages. Our approach eliminates the need to share additional information for accurate data extraction, while also enhancing security through a secret sharing mechanism. Experimental results indicate that the generated steganographic text effectively preserves the sentiment and semantic information of the cover text.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"189689e9201f1d03e411a2cfcf84d747839de63aebf5df4eab66c061c8e0b096","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
