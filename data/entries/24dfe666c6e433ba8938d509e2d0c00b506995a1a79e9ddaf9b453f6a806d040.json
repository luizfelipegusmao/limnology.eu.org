{"title":"From Blueprint to Reality: Confronting Carbon Roadblocks in Jordanian Apartments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1664/v1","date":1724364824000,"content":"Apartment buildings, which make up 83% of all structures in Jordan, play a crucial role in the country's construction sector. This study examines the main barriers that are preventing the implementation of low-carbon emission techniques in these buildings. It uses the Fuzzy Delphi Method to collect ideas from 14 housing investors. The results suggest that a major obstacle is the insufficient knowledge among end-users regarding environmental concerns, along with financial limitations, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm for low-carbon construction initiatives. Moreover, insufficient cooperation between consultants and contractors leads to subpar constructability, which is worsened by the prevailing conventional procurement method that prioritizes cost and schedule above environmental consequences. To further investigate, it is advisable to examine the utilization of contemporary procurement methods, such as Design-Build and Construction Management, in the housing industry of Jordan. These alternative methods have the potential to solve the current difficulties by promoting more effective and environmentally friendly building practices. This will help increase the use of low-carbon emission solutions and improve the overall sustainability of Jordan's construction sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24dfe666c6e433ba8938d509e2d0c00b506995a1a79e9ddaf9b453f6a806d040","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
