{"title":"Sustainable System Development and Strategic Framework for ESGI Enterprise Transformation in Large Multi-purposes Sports Venues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1132/v1","date":1710991869000,"content":"With the trend of public infrastructure becoming more sustainable, large multi-purpose sports venues (LMPSVs) have become one of the world's most complex architectural projects and one of the landmark buildings of an international city. LMPSVs will lead the world in sustainable design, construction and operational innovations, and play a crucial role in raising awareness of sustainability around the world. System Thinking (ST), System Dynamics (SD) and Sustainable System Development (SSD) theories are three interrelated concepts that together form a methodological framework for solving complex system problems and driving strategies. The purpose of this study is to examine how LMPSVs can implement environmental, social, governance, and innovation (ESGI) enterprise transformation strategy (ETS) based on a sustainable systems development (SSD) framework. In view of the current global environmental challenges and social responsibility requirements, the motivation of this study is to provide an integrated transformation pathway for LMPSVs to achieve the goal of sustainable development and to contribute to the field of related disciplines. The methodology of this research adopts a combination of literature review and case study analysis, and the theoretical basis is mainly drawn from cutting-edge research in the fields of sustainable development, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental management. Then, by analyzing successful transformation cases in China, we extract data and information to explore the application and effectiveness of these strategies in practice. The results of the study show that by implementing ESGI-based transformation strategy, LMPSVs can not only make significant progress in terms of environmental protection, social responsibility, and governance structure, but also drive long-term corporate growth and competitiveness through innovation. Specifically, these results are realized in terms of increased efficiency in energy use, improved waste management, community involvement and increased stakeholder satisfaction. The study concludes by emphasizing that the SSD-based ESGI Transformation Strategic framework provides a sustainable pathway for LMPSVs. In the future, the extension of this transformation strategy will help a wider range of industry sectors to achieve sustainable development goals, and has wide application potential and far-reaching social significance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9102a0a10733a7e6ee9ac36560e91380e628927d61e7f367a6ecd38c4d3bedcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
