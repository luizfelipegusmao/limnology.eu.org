One of the major challenges during TEM sample preparation using FIB-SEM system, however, is to precisely align FIB to sample surface to achieve a desired cut face and a uniform thickness after milling bulk material from the chip. A slight misalignment of FIB can produce an undesirable lamella by losing the structure of interest, including unwanted neighboring structures, or causing bending or warping of lamella during milling. The problem is more prominent in the latest silicon chips where patterned structures are closely packed often with a distance of a few nanometers only.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"25ceb5baf7ab3eca8c6f6d368a406782510adf4493213ca2ce9495174ed4a4b4","category":"Environment"}
