Influences on battery performance due to cycling rates or cycling iterations are now directly observable utilizing High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM), integrated Differential Phase Contrast Imaging (iDPC) [<a href=\"#ozae044.112-B1\">1</a>], a variety of electron diffraction approaches [<a href=\"#ozae044.112-B2\">2</a>], as well as Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS). Here, we demonstrate novel approaches to utilize and optimize these techniques for quantifying local Li content to better understand ion transport and charging mechanisms within battery electrodes and solid-state electrolytes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0950a0b8e2664ae8c132c5bc1962c98f7825a442ca8b6e39ed543894b1dadc26","category":"Environment"}
