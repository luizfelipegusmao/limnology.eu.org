{"title":"The Logistical Backbone of Visual Function: Complementary Function of Dietary Vitamin A Receptors and Rhodopsin Transporters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0848/v1","date":1710425286000,"content":"In this review, we outline our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the absorption, storage, and transport of dietary vitamin A to the eye, the trafficking of rod opsin protein to the photoreceptor outer segments, which encompasses the logistical backbone required for visual function. Two key mechanisms of this process are emphasized in this manuscript: Ocular and systemic vitamin A membrane transporters, and rhodopsin transporters. Understanding the complementary mechanisms responsible for the generation and proper transport of the retinylidene opsin to the photoreceptor outer segment will eventually shed light on the importance of genes encoded by these proteins, and their relationship on normal visual function and in the pathophysiology of retinal degenerative diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"accff45d522757ea67de4684fd5c77047c25f59c33c0336b70849ad029f58064","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
