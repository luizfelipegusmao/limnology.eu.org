{"title":"Are COVID-19 Polymorphisms in ACE and ACE2 Prognosis Predictors?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1646/v1","date":1716899664000,"content":"Regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic containment, it remains paramount to comprehensively understand its underlying mechanisms to mitigate potential future health and economic impacts, comparable to those experienced throughout the course of the pandemic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) provide anchorage for SARS-CoV-2 binding, thus implicating that ACE and ACE2 might contribute to the variability in infection severity. This study aimed to elucidate predisposing factors influencing the disease course among people infected by SARS-CoV-2, focusing on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 polymorphisms. Notably, despite similar demographics and comorbidities, COVID-19 patients exhibit substantial differences in prognosis. Genetic polymorphisms in ACE and ACE2 have been implicated in disease progression, prompting our investigation into their role in COVID-19 evolution. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed ACE and ACE2 genes in a sample group comprising six subjects infected by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings revealed a correlation between specific polymorphisms and COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, ACE and ACE2 intronic deletions were observed in all deceased patients, suggesting a potential association with mortality. These results highlight the significance of genetic factors in shaping the clinical course of COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of further research into the impact of genetic variations on COVID-19 severity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6ad239a6a15aafd3d71fb31dc960255beeadcc0a81cdfac285fade8ee8f186f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
