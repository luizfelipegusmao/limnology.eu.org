{"title":"Advanced Deep Learning Approach for Smart Home Appliance Identification Using Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1085/v1","date":1728908565000,"content":"This study presents the development of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for classifying smart home device data. Utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the study explored the processes of data gathering, loading, normalization, and model construction. The RNN, equipped with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was trained and evaluated, demonstrating significant improvements in training and validation accuracy over 10 epochs, culminating in a test accuracy of 83.25%, and only 35.4% loss. The evaluation of the model on the test set provides a test accuracy result, accompanied by an in-depth analysis of ROC curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores for multi-class classification, along with a confusion matrix. The AUC score of 0.9896 indicates outstanding performance in accurately classifying IoT device categories. These findings indicate that the RNN with LSTM exhibits superior learning efficiency and generalization capabilities, making it more suitable for IoT device classification tasks. \nThis article emphasizes the concept of IoT and reviews recent studies on the application of deep learning models across various IoT domains, including smart homes, industrial systems, and healthcare. Future research could focus on improving real-time processing capabilities, and scalability, and incorporating diverse IoT data types to enhance and broaden the model's practical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6998745b4d401ca1deabb4ab55af1d2ee0755938e902f70f0cb4cbcf66f5d13b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
