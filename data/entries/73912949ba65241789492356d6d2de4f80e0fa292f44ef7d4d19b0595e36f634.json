{"title":"The Importance of Green Investments in Developed Economies&mdash;MCDM Models for Achieving Adequate Green Investments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1654/v1","date":1716549503000,"content":"Green investments help to create less harmful alternatives and adequate funds that contribute to economic growth, sustainable development, and social well-being. The applied methods are empirical and analytical based on the study of literature, multi-criteria modelling, determination of weights, and ranking of criteria in deciding green investments mapping of indicators, and monitoring of progress towards green growth through official OECD data. The analysis uses official sources on indicators related to the green economy and the environment. Multi-criteria decision-models (MCDM) were used to select adequate green investments, where instead of indicators from the official OECD-database, investors use the areas in which the indicators are distributed. According to the findings of AHP, half of the investments in the green economy come from public sources (0.51), and the other half are private (0.25), and institutional investors (0.24). While, BWM reveals that the best criterion for the decision to invest in the green economy is the environmental and resource productivity of the economy, and the worst is the base of natural assets. This paper aims to enable decision-makers to use these results as weights for the overall assessment of green investments in ESG and to simplify the decision-making approach in future analyses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73912949ba65241789492356d6d2de4f80e0fa292f44ef7d4d19b0595e36f634","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
