{"title":"The Role of the Mediterranean Diet in Assisted Reproduction: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1924/v1","date":1719540380000,"content":"The Mediterranean Diet, characterized by high intake of plant foods and unsaturated fats, has been suggested to improve assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes. This literature review aimed to summarize the evidence from observational studies on the associations between preconception Mediterranean Diet and ART outcomes. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Seven observational studies (n=2,321 women on ART) were included. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaires with 6-195 items. Three studies found that higher Mediterranean Diet scores improved Clinical Pregnancy or Live Birth rates, while two studies showed a positive effect on ART eggs and embryos. However, two studies reported no significant associations with ultimate ART success, and four studies found no effects on oocyte and embryo number or quality. Evidence for the effects of greater adherence to the Mediterranean Diet on ART outcomes is limited but promising. Additional rigorous research is needed to clarify and weigh the degree of association between the Mediterranean Diet and ART success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ee165a3f5844a16d798917b5255e28458a9f8b736d17895f0fd1a3e7412fae2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
