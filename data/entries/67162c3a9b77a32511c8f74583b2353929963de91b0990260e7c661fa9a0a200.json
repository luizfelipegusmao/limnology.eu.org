{"title":"Health-Related Composition and Bioactivity of an Agave/Prickly Pear Juice Beverage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0687/v1","date":1715364113000,"content":"A beverage made from a combination of Agave sap (AS) and prickly pear juice (PPJ) was ana-lyzed for its nutrients, bioactive and potentially health-promoting compounds. The beverage was evaluated for its ability to act as an antioxidant, regulate glycemic properties, and undergo gut bacterial fermentation in vitro. The major mono- and oligosaccharides present in the beverage were galacturonic acid (217.74±13.46 mg/100 mL), rhamnose (227.00±1.58 mg/100 mL), and fructose (158.16±8.86 mg/mL). The main phenolic compounds identified were protocatechuic acid (440.31±3.06 mg/100 mL) and catechin (359.72±7.56 mg/100 mL). It was observed that the beverage had a low glycemic index (","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67162c3a9b77a32511c8f74583b2353929963de91b0990260e7c661fa9a0a200","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
