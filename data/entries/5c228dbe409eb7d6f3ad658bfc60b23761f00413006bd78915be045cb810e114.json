{"title":"The City and its Stream: Blue Urban Acupuncture as a Method for Neglected Spaces Regeneration in Lebanese Riversides: The Case of Beirut River","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0478/v1","date":1709890339000,"content":"Urban rivers and waterfronts play a vital role in the ecological, social, and economic fabric of cities, providing not only aesthetic value but also serving as important ecosystems that contribute to the overall well-being of urban environments. However, many urban rivers, including the Beirut River in Lebanon, face challenges such as pollution, neglect, and the loss of recreational and ecological value due to urbanization and industrialization. According to the Lebanese MOE (Ministry of Environment), almost 70% of Lebanese rivers are polluted due to untreated waste management systems and which leads to undrinkable water and possible flooding disasters if not treated. This study addresses the problem of abandoned and degraded spaces along the Beirut River riverside through the application of urban acupuncture, a strategic approach that targets specific points in the urban environment to stimulate positive change and regeneration. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of implementing small-scale ‘sensitive urban points’ known as urban acupuncture as the method for regenerating the Beirut River riverside, with the hypothesis that targeted interventions through Blue Urban Acupuncture or Aqua-puncture- can lead to significant improvements in the ecological, social, and economic aspects of the area that re-connect the people of Beirut with its river. The methodology involves a multidisciplinary approach that integrates urban design, and community engagement, and analysing similar examples of different approaches through creating a comparative table. Data collection includes environmental assessments of water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem health, as well as social surveys to understand community needs and perceptions. By applying urban acupuncture principles to the Beirut River riverside, this study seeks to demonstrate how strategic interventions can lead to the regeneration of abandoned spaces, improve the overall quality of the urban environment, and create sustainable and inclusive riverside landscapes that benefit both the environment and the community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c228dbe409eb7d6f3ad658bfc60b23761f00413006bd78915be045cb810e114","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
