{"title":"Clinical Usability Evaluation of Attachable Video Laryngoscope in the Simulated Tracheal Intubation Scenario: A Manikin Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0873/v1","date":1715612291000,"content":"To assess the usefulness of an attachable video laryngoscope (AVL) by attaching a camera and monitor to a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope (CML). Normal and tongue edema airway scenarios were simulated using a manikin. Twenty physicians performed tracheal intubations using CML, AVL, Pentax AWS® (AWS), and McGrath MAC® (MAC) in each scenario. Ten physicians with more than 10 cases of clinical experience with tracheal intubation using CML were included in the skilled group. Ten physicians with less than 10 cases of clinical experience with tracheal intubation using CML were included in the unskilled groups. The time required to intubate and the success rate were recorded. The degree of difficulty of use and glottic view assessment scored by participants. All 20 participants successfully completed the study. There was no difference in the success rate and time required for tracheal intubation in the normal airway scenarios. For the skilled group, in the tongue edema airway scenario, the AWS had the highest success rate (100%) followed by AVL (60%), MAC (60%), and CML (20%) (p = 0.001). The time required to intubate with the AWS was significantly shorter than with AVL (10.2 vs 22.3 s; p=0.002) or MAC (10.2 vs 23.7 s; p=0.001). There was no significant (p &amp;gt; 0.05) difference between AVL and MAC. The degree of Difficulty of Use for AVL was significantly lower than that for CML (7.8 vs 2.8; p &amp;lt; 0.001). There was no significant (p &amp;gt; 0.05) difference between AVL and other video laryngoscopes. AVL had a higher rate of successful tracheal intubation than CML in the tongue edema scenario. AVL showed a similar success rate and time of tracheal intubation to the MAC. Therefore, AVL may be a possible alternative video laryngoscope device.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18f0fd72fb5b84c67f02259238647cf47b5203e6893c7452a7b7946a5e3b83fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
