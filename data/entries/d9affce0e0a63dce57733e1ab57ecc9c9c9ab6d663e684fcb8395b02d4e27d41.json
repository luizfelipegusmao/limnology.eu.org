{"title":"The Muon g-2 in a Regularized Electrodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0161/v2","date":1729609470000,"content":"The present paper reports exact results for the muon self-energy and anomalous g-factor. A unique to the muon cut-off terms that remove the radial singularity in the system and regularize the corresponding electrodynamics are presented. Equations of motion and a transcendental equation satisfied by the muon anomalous g-factor are derived, with solution a_m=0.0011659201231(18). The obtained value matches the latest experimental one found in the literature to about 0.46 ppb ruling out a possible tension between theory and experiment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9affce0e0a63dce57733e1ab57ecc9c9c9ab6d663e684fcb8395b02d4e27d41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
