{"title":"Quantum densities in Curved Spacetime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1792/v3","date":1719910324000,"content":"Defining integrals over volume element in curved spacetime together with the mass and energy densities within that region of spacetime is apparently equivalent to the given energy and mass of that body or particle. With this in mind equations involving energies and masses can be rewritten in terms of their densities and the integral over the curved space-time volume element. The idea find its place in quantum mechanical frameworks systematically accounting for the effect of spacetime volume structures and gravity on dynamics of quantum systems. This article briefly explores these concepts and runs through various frameworks and equations relevant to this idea including the quantum stress energy tensor, and expressing Schrodingerâ€™s equation in ways that are tied to general relativity it also discusses the cosmological constant and the cosmological constant problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5793006dbf71d34bf98d0c23c5cf550209901f916b962a46a2c8f3130c2ef82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
