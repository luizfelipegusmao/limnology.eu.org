{"title":"HCI and Data: Interacting in a New Era of Virtualization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0508/v2","date":1719814321000,"content":"The rapid technological progress has ushered in a new era of human-computer interaction, where the distinction between the physical and virtual realms is becoming increasingly blurred. This research paper explores the profound and multifaceted intersection of Human-Data Interaction (HDI) and Data Virtualization (DV), examining how emerging technologies can significantly enhance the exploration, comprehension, and utilization of complex, multidimensional data sets. Informed by the insights gleaned from prior research in this domain , the present study delves into the potential of DV techniques to improve HDI, with a particular focus on three experimental investigations conducted within the realms of education, healthcare, and retail. The findings reveal the benefits and potential challenges associated with the implementation of DV in these diverse contexts, offering valuable guidance for the design and development of future HDI systems. Drawing upon a diverse array of authoritative sources, this paper presents a holistic, forward-looking perspective on the future of HDI, underscoring the critical role that DV will play in shaping the next generation of human-computer interfaces and facilitating a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the digital world. Furthermore, the paper presents a preliminary framework for integrating HDI principles into standard design practices. This framework outlines key considerations and guidelines to help designers and developers incorporate HDI techniques more effectively into the development of data-driven applications and interfaces.The proposed framework outlines key considerations for enhancing data accessibility and comprehension, empowering users to exercise greater control over their data, and cultivating transparent dialogues between data providers and end-users. By establishing this conceptual foundation, the paper aims to facilitate the seamless integration of HDI principles into standard design practices, ultimately leading to more intuitive, user-centric, and ethically-grounded approaches to data interaction and utilization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49b0edcfbe2015201e612625c24afd600958d16a62cc82d8ea31e49922b4c05f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
