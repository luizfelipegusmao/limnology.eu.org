{"title":"Draft Genome Sequence and SSR Data Mining of &ldquo;Pumpo&rdquo; (Bos taurus), a Top Bull From a Peruvian Genetic Nucleus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1085/v1","date":1718677973000,"content":"Pumpo is a Simmental breed and an essential livestock resource in the nucleus genetic cattle of Peru. This study provides a draft genome sequence of a top bull using a de novo assembly approach on the Illumina Novaseq X platform, yielding 208 GB of raw sequencing data with 150 bp paired-end reads. The final genome assembly resulted in a size of 2.06 Gb with an N50 contig length of 108 Mb and a completeness of 95.7% according to BUSCO analysis. A total of 973,925 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, with a predominance of mononucleotide repeats. The genome showed low heterozygosity (0.568%) and moderate repeatability (11.5%), aligning with other Bos taurus genomes. Reference-guided scaffolding improved the assembly quality significantly, producing an N50 scaffold value of 108 Mb. The SSR analysis of the Pumpo genome identified 973,925 SSRs with a frequency of 2,808 SSRs per kilobase, predominantly mononucleotide repeats, and 85,453 found in compound formations. Obtaining knowledge of the genome of a breeding Simmental bull is essential to optimize breeding programs and improve productivity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"785e806ec729790e92d2fe6a52afbc89aaecf42e51f2e79b13e919db47ee27e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
