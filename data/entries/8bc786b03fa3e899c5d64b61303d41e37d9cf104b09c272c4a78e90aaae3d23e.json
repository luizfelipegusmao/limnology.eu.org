{"title":"Optimization of Avocado Seed Starch Based Degradable Plastic Synthesis with Polylactic Acid (PLA) Blend using Response Surface Methodology (RSM)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1497/v1","date":1721381582000,"content":"The research improves the strength of plastic using avocado seed starch and PLA. The effect of blending avocado seed starch and PLA was optimized using the RSM approach by using two variables: water absorption and biodegradability. Mixing them using RSM gave the best result: 1.8 g of starch and 3 g of PLA. Degradable plastic has a (tensile strength of 10.1 MPa; elongation at break of 85.8%; young modulus of 190 MPa). Infrared spectroscopy showed that the plastic had a -OH bond at 3273.20 cm-1, 3502.73 cm-1, 3647.39 cm-1, a CH2 bond at 2953.52 cm-1, 2945.30 cm-1, 2902.87 cm-1, a C=C bond at 1631.78 cm-1, and a C-O bond at 1741.72 cm-1. The plastic decomposed in soil. It was organic and hydrophilic. Thermal tests, the plastic can withstand heat well, losing weight at 356.86°C to 413.64°C, forming crystals and plastic melts at 159.10°C—the same as PLA. Melt flow test, sample melts before measurement, therefore not measurable—process conditions that affect. Water absorption of 5.763% and biodegradation rate of 37.988% decomposed for 12 days. In morphology analysis, the starch and PLA fused to form a smooth surface. RSM found value was close to 1. RSM gave the best process parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8bc786b03fa3e899c5d64b61303d41e37d9cf104b09c272c4a78e90aaae3d23e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
