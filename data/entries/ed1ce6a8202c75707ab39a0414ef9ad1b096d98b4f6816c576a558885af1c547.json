{"title":"Effect of cinnamon essential oil/γ‐cyclodextrin inclusion complex on papaya quality and shelf‐life","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13443?af=R","date":1718692178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Papaya, a highly nutritious and economically significant fruit, is susceptible to infections caused by phytopathogenic fungi. Cinnamon essential oil, derived from <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i> (CC), shows promise in preserving papaya due to its antifungal properties. However, CC is volatile, sensitive to environmental factors, and carries a strong aroma. <i>γ</i>-Cyclodextrin (<i>γ</i>-CD) is known for encapsulating hydrophilic molecules, shielding them from environmental influences, reducing odor, and enabling controlled release due to its unique channel structure. This study aimed to tackle these challenges by preparing and characterizing an inclusion complex of CC with <i>γ</i>-CD (CC-<i>γ</i>-CD), and subsequently evaluating its efficacy in preserving papaya fruits.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Analyses, including Fourier-infrared, powder X-ray diffraction, thermal gravity analysis, differential scanning calorimeter, and scanning electron microscopy, revealed successful encapsulation of CC components within the <i>γ</i>-CD cavity. Evaluations of the CC-<i>γ</i>-CD complex's impact on papaya fruit shelf life and quality showed notable enhancements. Fruits treated with CC-<i>γ</i>-CD inclusion complex at a dose of 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> exhibited a 55% extension in shelf-life, evidenced by reduced disease severity index compared with untreated fruit in the same storage conditions. Detailed physicochemical and bromatological assessments highlighted significant improvements, particularly in fruit treated with CC-<i>γ</i>-CD inclusion complex at a dose of 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The application of CC-<i>γ</i>-CD inclusion complex at 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> extended the shelf-life of papaya fruit, significantly and markedly improved the overall quality. These findings underscore the potential of the CC-<i>γ</i>-CD inclusion complex as an effective preservative for papaya, offering a promising solution for its postharvest management and marketability. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chiuyen Phan, \nDinhthinh Tran, \nKhanh Le, \nVutruongson Le, \nNgocdat Trinh, \nThinga Pham","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ed1ce6a8202c75707ab39a0414ef9ad1b096d98b4f6816c576a558885af1c547","category":"Environment"}
