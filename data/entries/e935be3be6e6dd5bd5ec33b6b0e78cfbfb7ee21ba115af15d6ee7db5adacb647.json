{"title":"Pricing Rainbow Options Using PINNs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2226/v2","date":1728469290000,"content":"In this study, we consider the valuation of rainbow options using unsupervised machine learning methods. In particular, we consider the pricing of multi-asset (rainbow) European and American options, using Physics Informed Neural Net- works (PINNS). After developing the PINNS architecture, we benchmark the method by using it to price vanilla and exotic options with one and two un- derlying assets. We then use the methodology to price a multi-asset European option, followed by the pricing of the multi-asset American option by solving the linear complementarity problem. We compare our results to those obtained using preexisting numerical methods and note excellent agreement. Unlike con- ventional numerical methods, we note that this methodology does not suffer from the ’curse of dimensionality’. The time complexity of our method is con- siderably less than that of the conventional techniques. Thus PINNS may offer a faster more efficient solution to the pricing of rainbow options.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e935be3be6e6dd5bd5ec33b6b0e78cfbfb7ee21ba115af15d6ee7db5adacb647","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
