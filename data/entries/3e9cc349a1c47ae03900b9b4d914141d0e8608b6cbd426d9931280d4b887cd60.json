{"title":"Caveolae with GLP-1 and NMDA Receptors as Crossfire Points for the Innovative Treatment of Cognitive Dysfunction with Neurodegenerative Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1958/v1","date":1721814776000,"content":"Some of neurodegenerative diseases may be characterized by continuing behavioral and cognitive dysfunction that contains memory loss and/or apathy. Alzheimer's disease is the most typical type of such neurodegenerative disease characterized by deficit of cognition and alteration of behavior. Despite the huge efforts against Alzheimer's disease, there has been yet no successful treatment for this disease. Interestingly, several possible risk genes to cognitive dysfunction are frequently expressed within brain cells, which may also be linked to cholesterol metabolism, lipid transport, exosomes and/or caveolae formation, suggesting that caveolae may be a therapeutic target to consider cognitive dysfunctions. Interestingly, modulation of autophagy/mitophagy with the alteration of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors signaling may offer a novel approach to prevent and alleviate the cognitive dysfunction. A paradigm that both GLP-1 and NMDA receptors at caveolae sites is promising and crucial for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions has been presented here, which might also be able to modify the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This research direction may open the potential to move a clinical care toward disease-modifying treatment strategies with maximal benefits for patients without detrimental adverse events for neurodegenerative diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e9cc349a1c47ae03900b9b4d914141d0e8608b6cbd426d9931280d4b887cd60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
