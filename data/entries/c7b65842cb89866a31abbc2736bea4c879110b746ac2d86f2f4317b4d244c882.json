{"title":"Boundaryless Access: Lowering Barriers of Access to Advanced Microscopy Facilities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.434/7719714?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis (CEMAS) located at the Ohio State University is committed to being recognized as a world hub for advanced microscopy across all scientific disciplines. As a part of this vision, we look to provide boundaryless access to our equipment. This is critical as the price of purchasing and maintaining high-end TEMs, like cryoEMs, becomes out of reach for some institutions, even though investigators still need access to pursue their research goals. One solution that CEMAS has designed and implemented are remote microscopy stations. These stations allow users to operate the microscopes in our facility seamlessly even though the operator is at a different location. We currently have 6 stations in operation across the US.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c7b65842cb89866a31abbc2736bea4c879110b746ac2d86f2f4317b4d244c882","category":"Environment"}
