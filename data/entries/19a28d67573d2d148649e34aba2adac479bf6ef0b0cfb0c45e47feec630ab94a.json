Considering the pipe subjected to an arbitrary harmonic force either distributed or concentrated, an analytical solution is found using Green’s function method. The solution obtained of the closed form satisfies the differential equations in a classical sense. The presented method giving the exact solutions is more precise than the classical eigenfunction expansion or Galerkin’s method with no need to the eigenfunctions or eigenvalues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19a28d67573d2d148649e34aba2adac479bf6ef0b0cfb0c45e47feec630ab94a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
