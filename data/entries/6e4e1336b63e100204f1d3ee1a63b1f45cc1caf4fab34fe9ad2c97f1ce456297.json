{"title":"Analysis of the Rolling Phenomenon of a Reduced-Diameter Wheel for Freight Wagons, as a Function of Operating Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0896/v1","date":1723531709000,"content":"This paper shows the development of a numerical analysis model which enables the calculation of the life of a reduced-diameter wheel used for freight wagons as a function of its operating factors. Reduced-diameter wheels are being increasingly used for combined transport applications and they can be arranged in a wide range of bogies and operated very differently. Due to the uniqueness of this type of wheels, their life has hardly been analyzed so far. To properly construct the numerical analysis model, it has been necessary to study the rolling phenomenon in-depth, tackle the main problems arising in the vehicle â€“ track interaction and set the relations amongst them. Once the rail-wheel interaction model was built, it was used to calculate the life of an ordinary-diameter wheel, a medium-diameter wheel and a reduced-diameter wheels under the same conditions and compare them. In this way, it is possible to know how long the life of a reduced-diameter wheel is compared to that of an ordinary-diameter one and also the evolution of the life depending on the diameter. The root causes responsible for this evolution can be explained thanks to the comprehension of the rolling phenomenon provided by the full analytical work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e4e1336b63e100204f1d3ee1a63b1f45cc1caf4fab34fe9ad2c97f1ce456297","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
