Based on the Production-Living-Ecological (PLE) system, this study attempts to describe urban resilience by the combination system that contains with P,L,E subsystem. The integrated approach including FAHP-EM,GRA-TOPSIS, CCDM, and ODM is proposed to reveal the urban resilience level and seek out the key constraints’ indicators. Then, an empirical analysis of panel data of 18 cities in Sichuan Province from 2011 to 2021 was conducted to analyze the development process. The valuation results suggested that:(1)for urban resilience level, most cities at the moderate imbalance level and basically maintained at this level, only Chengdu is reaching the basic coordination level since in 2013.(2)The insufficient development of P,L,E subsystem is the reason for the moderate imbalance development, especially the key limiting factor is the P subsystem’s low development level.(3)the most prominent obstacle indicators are x1(per capita local financial expenditure on science and technology), x2(per capita of R&amp;D spending), x8(total export-import per capita), x14(number of people with basic medical insurance), x22(length of urban drainage pipeline), x23(number of public toilets per person) and the contribution values reach 7.56%,7.49%,11.02%, 9.14%,12.53%, 12.60% respectively. The detailed reference suggestions and effective measures put forwarded for policy makers and planners to promote urban resilience in Western China.","author":"Huan Shi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb08d3e5c8e5dec7b1a7f1b668e42b480aebdd524bd5e107480cc2551587692c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
