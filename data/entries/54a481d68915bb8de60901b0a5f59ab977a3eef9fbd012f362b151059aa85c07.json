{"title":"Valsa mali effector Vm_04797 interacts with adaptor protein MdAP-2β to manipulate host autophagy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/502/7577989?rss=1","date":1705622400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Apple <span>Valsa</span> canker, caused by the ascomycete fungus <span>Valsa mali</span>, employs virulence effectors to disturb host immunity and poses a substantial threat to the apple industry. However, our understanding of how <span>V. mali</span> effectors regulate host defense responses remains limited. Here, we identified the <span>V. mali</span> effector Vm_04797, which was upregulated during the early infection stage. Vm_04797, a secreted protein, suppressed Inverted formin 1 (INF1)-triggered cell death in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> and performed virulence functions inside plant cells. Vm_04797 deletion mutants showed substantially reduced virulence toward apple. The adaptor protein MdAP-2β positively regulated apple <span>Valsa</span> canker resistance and was targeted and degraded by Vm_04797 via the ubiquitination pathway. The in vitro analysis suggested that Vm_04797 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Further analysis revealed that MdAP-2β is involved in autophagy by interacting with Malus domestica autophagy protein 16 MdATG16 and promoting its accumulation. By degrading MdAP-2β, Vm_04797 inhibited autophagic flux, thereby disrupting the defense response mediated by autophagy. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms employed by the effectors of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in ascomycete fungi to regulate host immunity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"54a481d68915bb8de60901b0a5f59ab977a3eef9fbd012f362b151059aa85c07","category":"Environment"}
