{"title":"Phosphorylated transcription factor PuHB40 mediates ROS-dependent anthocyanin biosynthesis in pear exposed to high light","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3562/7688881?rss=1","date":1717632000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants are increasingly vulnerable to environmental stresses because of global warming and climate change. Stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation results in plant cell damage, even cell death. Anthocyanins are important antioxidants that scavenge ROS to maintain ROS homeostasis. However, the mechanism underlying ROS-induced anthocyanin accumulation is unclear. In this study, we determined that the HD-Zip I family member transcription factor PuHB40 mediates ROS-dependent anthocyanin biosynthesis under high-light stress in pear (<span>Pyrus ussuriensis</span>). Specifically, PuHB40 induces the <span>PuMYB123-like</span>â€“PubHLH3 transcription factor complex for anthocyanin biosynthesis. The PuHB40-mediated transcriptional activation depends on its phosphorylation level, which is regulated by protein phosphatase PP2A. Elevated ROS content maintains high PuHB40 phosphorylation levels while also enhancing the PuHB40-induced <span>PuMYB123-like</span> transcription by decreasing the <span>PuPP2AA2</span> expression, ultimately leading to increased anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our study reveals a pathway regulating the ROS-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in pears, further clarifying the mechanism underlying the abiotic stress-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, which may have implications for improving plant stress tolerance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a69b7c1d2cb8e46409940e0a1923ec1b4d6ab9499a24234ad40de4527697af77","category":"Environment"}
