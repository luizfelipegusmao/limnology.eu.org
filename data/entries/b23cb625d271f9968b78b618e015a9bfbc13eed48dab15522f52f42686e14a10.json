{"title":"Differential effects of four laboratory animal control diets on gut microbiota in mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13331?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The gut microbiota is intricate and susceptible to multiple factors, with diet being a major contributor. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of four commonly used laboratory animal control diets, namely Keao Xieli's maintenance diet (KX), HFK's 1025 (HF), Research Diets' D12450B (RD), and Lab Diet's 5CC4 (LD), on the gut microbiota of mice.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A total of 40 mice were randomly assigned to four groups, and each group was fed one of the four diets for a duration of 8 weeks. The assessment of gut microbiota was conducted using 16S rRNA sequencing both at the beginning of the study (week 0) and the end (week 8), which served as the baseline and endpoint samples, respectively. Following the 8-week feeding period, no significant differences were observed in physiological parameters, including body weight, visceral weight, and blood biochemical indices, across the four groups. Nonetheless, relative to the baseline, discernible alterations in the gut microbiota were observed in all groups, encompassing shifts in beta-diversity, hierarchical clustering, and key genera. Among the four diets, HF diet exhibited a significant influence on alpha-diversity, RD diet brought about notable changes in microbial composition at the phylum level, and LD diet demonstrated an interconnected co-occurrence network. Mantel analysis indicated no significant correlation between physiological parameters and gut microbiota in the four groups.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, our study demonstrated that the four control diets had a minimal impact on physiological parameters, while exerting a distinct influence on the gut microbiota after 8 weeks. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jingya Guo, \nYuhan Zhao, \nSeong‐Gook Kang, \nKunlun Huang, \nTao Tong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b23cb625d271f9968b78b618e015a9bfbc13eed48dab15522f52f42686e14a10","category":"Environment"}
