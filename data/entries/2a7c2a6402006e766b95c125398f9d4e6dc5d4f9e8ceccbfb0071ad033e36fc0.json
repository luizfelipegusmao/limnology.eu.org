{"title":"Branching paths: Unveiling functional divergence of PIF1 and PIF4 via promoter and protein variations","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2749/7679851?rss=1","date":1716336000000,"content":"<span>Plants use complex photoreceptors, including phytochromes, to detect and respond to light. Phytochromes detect red and far-red light, triggering light-dependent activities from seed germination to blooming. Phytochromes fluctuate between active (Pfr) and inactive (Pr) forms in response to red and far-red wavelengths, affecting gene expression and physiological reactions. Phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs) are basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors that play important roles in light signaling, growth, and development. They act as cellular signaling hubs, integrating external and internal signals in plants (<a href=\"#koae152-B4\">Krahmer and Fankhauser 2023</a>). PIFs regulate gene expression by binding to the promoter DNA of target genes. They play different functions in seedling growth, germination, and temperature response. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 8 PIFs (PIF1-8) based on the presence of an Active Phytochrome B binding (APB) motif; however, PIF1 and PIF3 also possess an Active Phytochrome A binding motif in addition to the APB (<a href=\"#koae152-B2\">Khanna et al. 2004</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"2a7c2a6402006e766b95c125398f9d4e6dc5d4f9e8ceccbfb0071ad033e36fc0","category":"Environment"}
