However, <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, an urban malaria vector formerly confined to South Asia and the Persian Gulf, was recently detected in Africa and may change the epidemiology of malaria across the continent. Little is known about the public health implications of <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i> in Africa. This study is designed to assess the relative importance of household exposure to <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i> and endemic malaria vectors for malaria risk in urban Sudan and Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>Case-control studies will be conducted in 3 urban settings (2 in Sudan, 1 in Ethiopia) to assess the association between presence of <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i> in and around households and malaria. Cases, defined as individuals positive for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and/or <i>P</i>. <i>vivax</i> by microscopy/rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and controls, defined as age-matched individuals negative for <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> and/or <i>P</i>. <i>vivax</i> by microscopy/RDT, will be recruited from public health facilities. Both household surveys and entomological surveillance for adult and immature mosquitoes will be conducted at participant homes within 48 hours of enrolment. Adult and immature mosquitoes will be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between presence of <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i> and malaria status, adjusted for co-occurrence of other malaria vectors and participant gender.</p> Conclusions <p>Findings from this study will provide evidence of the relative importance of <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i> for malaria burden in urban African settings, shedding light on the need for future intervention planning and policy development.</p>","author":"Temesgen Ashine","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0c732cd7ab27682276bd11cf2dbd1b2e75606599fa83d7c316ee3475d78eb92b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
