Yet, the effect of global land-use change on ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling remains unquantified despite that ecosystem N cycling plays a critical role in maintaining food security. Here, we analysed 2430 paired observations globally to show that converting natural to managed ecosystems increases ratios of autotrophic nitrification to ammonium immobilisation and nitrate to ammonium, but decreases soil immobilisation of mineral N, causing increased N losses via leaching and gaseous N emissions, such as nitrous oxide (e.g., via denitrification), resulting in a leaky N cycle. Changing land use from intensively managed to one that resembles natural ecosystems reversed N losses by 108% on average, resulting in a more conservative N cycle. Structural equation modelling revealed that changes in soil organic carbon, pH and carbon to N ratio were more important than changes in soil moisture content and temperature in predicting ecosystem N retention capacities following land-use conversion and its reversion. The hotspots of leaky N cycles were mostly in equatorial and tropical regions, as well as in Western Europe, the United States and China. Our results suggest that whether an ecosystem exhibits a conservative N cycle after land-use reversion depends on management practices.</p>","author":"Yves Uwiragiye, \nJing Wang, \nYuanyuan Huang, \nLiangping Wu, \nJiake Zhou, \nYanhui Zhang, \nMeiqi Chen, \nHang Jing, \nYinfei Qian, \nAhmed S.
