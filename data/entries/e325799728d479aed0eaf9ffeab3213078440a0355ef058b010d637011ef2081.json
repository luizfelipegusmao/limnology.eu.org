{"title":"A step towards sustainable environment in OECD countries: Do natural resource depletion, resource tax, institutional quality, and green innovation matter?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12515?af=R","date":1721101817000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Protecting and improving environmental quality is essential for sustainable development. This study considers natural resource depletion, resource tax, institutional quality, and green innovation, which are likely to impact environmental quality. These issues are addressed by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 12, and 18. The study aims to uncover the influence of the variables we have considered on environmental quality in a sample of 18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1994 to 2020. Before panel data analysis, we conducted preliminary tests to determine the most suitable techniques. The econometric procedure comprises four stages: unit root analysis, cointegration analysis, estimation of long-run coefficients using two different methods, and panel causality analysis. The empirical findings suggest that resource tax and green energy innovation positively impact environmental quality for the panel in the long run. Results based on the country show that institutional quality has a negative impact on environmental quality in Portugal but a positive impact in Luxembourg. Although resource taxes positively impact environmental quality in Portugal, they harm Luxembourg. Lastly, natural resource depletion negatively impacts environmental quality in Luxembourg. There are no statistically significant results for other countries. The study concludes with policy recommendations.</p>","author":"Harun Kılıçaslan, \nMucahit Aydin, \nVeysel Inal, \nEnes Teksan, \nMustafa Torusdag","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"e325799728d479aed0eaf9ffeab3213078440a0355ef058b010d637011ef2081","category":"Environment"}
