{"title":"Achilles Tendon Rupture Associated with Missed Bimalleolar Fracture: A Rare Case Report and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0362/v1","date":1715072079000,"content":"Abstract\n\nIntroduction: Although ankle fractures and Achilles tendon injuries are among the most common traumatic presentations when they occur individually, concomitant Achilles tendon rupture and ipsilateral ankle fractures are quite unusual. To our knowledge this is the first report of acute Achilles tendon rupture associated with missed ipsilateral closed bimalleolar ankle fracture.\nCase Presentation: A 34 years old male patient presented with a traumatic right Achilles tendon rupture after sustaining road traffic accident one day prior. There was an open wound over the tendon substance with absent active plantaflexion of the involved leg. After confirming complete Achilles tendon rupture with positive Thompson test, the patient was prepared for emergency debridement and possible tendon repair differing imaging studies, which missed ipsilateral closed bimalleolar ankle fracture.\nConclusion: Routine anteroposterior and lateral X-rays should be used in conjunction with a complete history and physical examination to detect any concomitant fracture with open Achilles tendon rupture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdc83758f064595a595062930a8c55913738a95a1f4dfc967652c9a814ba71d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
