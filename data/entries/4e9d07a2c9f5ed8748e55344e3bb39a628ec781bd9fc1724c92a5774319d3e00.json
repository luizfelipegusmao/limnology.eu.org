{"title":"In Search of Phytoremediation Candidates: Eu(III) Bioassociation and Root Exudation in Hydroponically Grown Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0359/v1","date":1720015999000,"content":"Lanthanides and actinides are emerging contaminants, but little is known about their uptake and distribution by plants and their interactions in the rhizosphere. To better understand the fate of these metals in plants, we assessed the bioassociation of 2, 20 and 200 µM Eu(III) by five hydroponically grown crops endemic to Europe. The metal’s concentration and its speciation was monitored by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy, whereas root exudation was investigated by chromatographic methods. It has been shown, that Eu(III) bioassociation is a two-stage process, involving rapid biosorption followed by accumulation in root tissue and distribution to the stem and leaves. Within 96 h of exposure time, the plant induces a change of Eu(III) speciation in the liquid medium, from a predominant Eu(III) aquo species, as calculated by thermodynamic modelling, to a species with longer luminescence lifetime. Root exudates such as citric, malic, and fumaric acid were identified in the cultivation medium and affect Eu(III) speciation in solution, as was shown by a change in the thermodynamic model. These results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the fate of lanthanides in the biosphere and provide a basis for further investigations with the chemical analogues Cm(III) and Am(III).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e9d07a2c9f5ed8748e55344e3bb39a628ec781bd9fc1724c92a5774319d3e00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
