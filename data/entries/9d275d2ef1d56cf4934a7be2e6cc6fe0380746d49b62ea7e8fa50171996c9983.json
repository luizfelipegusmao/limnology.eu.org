{"title":"Statistical Signatures of Quantum Contextuality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2176/v1","date":1717576094000,"content":"Quantum contextuality describes situations where the statistics observed in different measurement contexts cannot be explained by a measurement independent reality of the system. The most simple case is observed in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, with five different measurement contexts related to each other by shared measurement outcomes. The quantum formalism defines the relations between these contexts in terms of well-defined relations between operators, and these relations can be used to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from a finite set of measurement results. Here, I introduce a reconstruction method based on the relations between the five measurement contexts that can violate the bounds of non-contextual statistics. A complete description of an arbitrary quantum state requires only five of the eight elements of a Kirkwood-Dirac quasi probability, but only an overcomplete set of eleven elements provides an unbiased description of all five contexts. A set of five fundamental relations between the eleven elements reveals a deterministic structure that links the five contexts. As illustrated by a number of examples, these relations provide a consistent description of contextual realities for the measurement outcomes of all five contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d275d2ef1d56cf4934a7be2e6cc6fe0380746d49b62ea7e8fa50171996c9983","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
