{"title":"Effect of Copper Doping on the Structural, Electrical, and Magnetic Properties of Mg-Co Ferrites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1642/v1","date":1711517958000,"content":"This research paper focuses on the synthesis and characterization of Cu-doped Mg-Co ferrites with varying compositions (Mg0.6-xCo0.4CuxFe2O4, where x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) using a sol-id-state reaction method. This paper also investigates the structural, morphological, magnetic, and electrical characteristics of synthesized Mg0.6-xCo0.4CuxFe2O4, where x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique confirms the ferrites spinel structure in the Fd-3m space group, with average crystallite sizes ranging from 57.29 to 48.57 nm. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy verifies chemical and structural changes, while scanning electron microsco-py (SEM) reveals cubic crystal growth with an average grain size of 1 to 1.5 μm. DC electrical re-sistivity decreases with increasing temperature and Cu2+ substitution, ranging from 1.4 x 10^6 Ω-cm to 6.7 x 10^5 Ω-cm. The study suggests a correlation between resistivity and Cu2+ concen-tration. Magnetic behavior, studied using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), shows de-pendence on dopant concentration, with coercivity ranging from 157 Oe to 256 Oe. The results indicate potential applications in magnetic storage devices, antennas, transformers, and high-frequency electronics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68cce4e1542d879772e5c01e88ae45797f6fba626f677a8d859e16f95bb540a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
