{"title":"Disrupting cell wall integrity impacts endomembrane trafficking to promote secretion over endocytic trafficking","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/12/3731/7659234?rss=1","date":1714176000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The plant cell wall provides a strong yet flexible barrier to protect cells from the external environment. Modifications of the cell wall, either during development or under stress conditions, can induce cell wall integrity responses and ultimately lead to alterations in gene expression, hormone production, and cell wall composition. These changes in cell wall composition presumably require remodelling of the secretory pathway to facilitate synthesis and secretion of cell wall components and cell wall synthesis/remodelling enzymes from the Golgi apparatus. Here, we used a combination of live-cell confocal imaging and transmission electron microscopy to examine the short-term and constitutive impact of isoxaben, which reduces cellulose biosynthesis, and Driselase, a cocktail of cell-wall-degrading fungal enzymes, on cellular processes during cell wall integrity responses in Arabidopsis. We show that both treatments altered organelle morphology and triggered rebalancing of the secretory pathway to promote secretion while reducing endocytic trafficking. The actin cytoskeleton was less dynamic following cell wall modification, and organelle movement was reduced. These results demonstrate active remodelling of the endomembrane system and actin cytoskeleton following changes to the cell wall.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"b60b271f8b136f4adc85483780b230241164e60575ae925fe7ff82bbc64cdfcf","category":"Environment"}
