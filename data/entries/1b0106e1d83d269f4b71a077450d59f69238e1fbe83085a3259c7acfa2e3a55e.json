This study investigated the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial potential of an ethanol extract from <i>Astilbe chinensis</i> inflorescence (GA-13-6) as a prominent candidate for natural complex substances (NCS) with therapeutic potential. In LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, GA-13-6 significantly suppressed proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and nitric oxide (NO), surpassing purified astilbin, a known bioactive compound found in <i>A</i>. <i>chinensis</i>. Furthermore, GA-13-6 downregulated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade. Remarkably, GA-13-6 exhibited selective antibacterial activity against <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, <i>Streptococcus sanguinis</i>, and <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>, key players in dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. These findings suggest that complex GA-13-6 holds the potential for the treatment or prevention of periodontal and dental diseases, as well as various other inflammation-related conditions, while averting the induction of antibiotic resistance.","author":"Jong Min Han","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1b0106e1d83d269f4b71a077450d59f69238e1fbe83085a3259c7acfa2e3a55e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
