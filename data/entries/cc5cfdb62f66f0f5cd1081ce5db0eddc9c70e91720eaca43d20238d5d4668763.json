{"title":"Electron Ptychography for Deep Sub-angstrom Resolution Without an Aberration Corrector","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.911/7720032?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>We demonstrate sub-angstrom resolution electron ptychography of 2D materials in an uncorrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.911-B1\">1</a>]. Sub-angstrom resolution has long been limited to aberration-corrected electron microscopy, where it is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and chemistry of materials at the atomic scale. In our work, we achieve 0.44 angstrom spatial resolution without an aberration corrector, nearly quadrupling the resolution set by the microscope optics (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). This high resolution is enabled by using a high dynamic range detector for full-field ptychography, combined with reconstruction using mixed-states, which we believe account for effective losses of coherence resulting from the instrumental instabilities. Counterintuitively, we find that, rather than being detrimental, geometric aberrations can benefit electron ptychography because they produce structured beams that are more dose-efficient for ptychography than focused, aberration-free probes. Moreover, we demonstrate the power and flexibility of electron ptychography by showing that it can achieve sub-angstrom resolution across a broad range of convergence angles unlocking the ability to tailor illumination angles while maintaining atomic resolution. This work indicates new frontiers to advance electron ptychography by expanding the types of electron illumination that are compatible with sub-angstrom materials characterization. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that expensive aberration correctors are no longer required to achieve atom-by-atom imaging, a significant step towards broadening access to high-end electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.911-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cc5cfdb62f66f0f5cd1081ce5db0eddc9c70e91720eaca43d20238d5d4668763","category":"Environment"}
