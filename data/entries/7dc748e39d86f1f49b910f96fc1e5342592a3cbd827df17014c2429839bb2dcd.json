{"title":"Enhancing Regional Quasi-Geoid Refinement Precision: An Analytical Approach Employing ADS80 Tri-linear Array Stereoscopic Imagery for Aerial Triangulation Densification and GNSS Gravity-Potential Leveling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0077/v1","date":1719832070000,"content":"This research investigates precision enhancement in regional quasi-geoid refinement through ADS80 tri-linear array scanning stereoscopic imagery for aerial triangulation, coupled with GNSS gravity-potential modeling. Acquiring stereoscopic imagery and analyzing triangulation accuracy with the ADS80 camera, we performed this study over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's elevated, desolate terrain, collecting 593 GNSS points following high-precision stereoscopic imagery model. Utilizing 12 gravity satellite models, we computed geoid heights and China 1985 Yellow Sea elevations for 28 benchmarks and GNSS points, thereby refining the Qinghai Province Quasi-Geoid Model (QPQM) using geometric techniques. The findings reveal that POS-assisted ADS80 stereoscopic imagery yields high-precision triangulation with maximal horizontal and elevation accuracies of 0.083/0.116 cm and 0.053/0.09 cm, respectively, across five control point arrangements. The RMSE of normal heights for 1985, processed via these GNSS points, achieved decimeter precision. By applying error corrections from benchmarks to the 1985 elevation data from gravity satellites and performing weighted averaging, the precision of EGM2008, SGG-UGM-2, and SGG-UGM-1 models improved to 8.61 cm, 9.09 cm, and 9.38 cm, respectively, surpassing the QPQM by 9.22 cm to 9.99 cm. This research demonstrates that the proposed methods can significantly enhance the precision of regional quasi-geoid surfaces. Additionally, these methods offer a novel approach for rapidly establishing regional quasi-geoid models in the uninhabited areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7dc748e39d86f1f49b910f96fc1e5342592a3cbd827df17014c2429839bb2dcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
