{"title":"Optimal timing of return migration in Atlantic salmon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12816?af=R","date":1713242441000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In many populations of Atlantic salmon, individuals return to rivers months or even a year prior to spawning. This premature arrival in fresh water by far exceeds the time needed for upstream migrations to spawning areas. Leaving the ocean early means forgoing substantial growth and incurring high metabolic costs of fasting in freshwater. Differences in timing of return migration has been shown to have a genetic basis, and different sea age classes return to rivers at different times. Previously suggested explanations regarding the cause for this behaviour have included both environmental factors and life history trade-offs, but these hypotheses have not been tested. Here, we combine data on marine growth and mortality of Atlantic salmon with the calculations of energetic expenditures of fasting in freshwater to explore how timing of river entry affects the probability of survival and energy recourses available for spawning. Our results show that to maximize the product of survival until spawning and energy available at spawning, multi sea winter fish in general must enter rivers earlier than one sea winter fish. And that for a large range of sea survival rates, the optimum river entry date for multi sea winter fish is as early as possible. This strongly suggests that the phenomena of premature arrival in Atlantic salmon is adaptive behaviour.</p>","author":"Anders Foldvik, \nEva Marita Ulvan, \nTor NÃ¦sje","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3de509ad0f312c77d6dd4d37070c89263edb7695bf1d0e15e1eb17cfd4455e34","entryHash":"c5da0a67ffb2cc57d6fec6c3ab2c6b04e42fa41fa4d42f9414df6df912415fdc","category":"Environment"}
