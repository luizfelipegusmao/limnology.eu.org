{"title":"Qualitative Evaluation of a Garden-Based Healing and Learning Program for Youth with Intellectual Disabilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0815/v1","date":1728566450000,"content":"This study aimed to determine the impact of garden-based learning on youth with intellectual disabilities (YwID). As it is not easy for YwID to collect information, experience situations, and make decisions independently, this study needed to devise an approach that could help the participants properly utilize the garden’s resources. Accordingly, it developed and operated a customized learning program for YwID and analyzed its impact. The findings show that gar-den-based learning generates specific changes in the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of YwID, such as emotional healing to recover psychological stability, social healing through social rela-tionships, physical healing through new activities, and independent healing through individu-alized plans. Participants experienced sympathizing with others and maintaining positive rela-tionships and obtaining knowledge, skills, and attitudes for behaving responsibly through gar-dening. Garden-based learning utilizing flowers and plants enhanced physical and mental health, improved functioning, helped YwID adapt to the environment, and integrated YwID into society. This is a form of vocational training by which people with disabilities could become employable by learning gardening skills, promoting their participation in society, and upgrading their quality of life. Hence, garden-based learning may transform people’s perception of disability and help people with disabilities respond to challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"020a6fb93f9269d1e548556003ad1fda86f2ae2edc4a7dbb533874cbbd12bc2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
