However, the complicated SGD processes in salt marshes remain poorly understood. Here, we first report the phenomenon of numerous highly saline artesian springs found in a salt marsh system of East China. Multiple methods including time-series thermal monitoring, isotope signatures, and high-resolution electrical resistivity tomography were combined to determine their origin and trajectory. Strong evidence suggests that these springs keep discharging even during high tide and represent a long-term re-distribution process of the ancient marine water trapped in the unconfined aquifer. This new pattern of spring-derived groundwater flow indicates a hidden SGD pathway and has significant implications for studies concerning SGD-derived fluxes in similar multi-aquifer-aquitard coastal systems.</p>","author":"Lucheng Zhan, \nPei Xin, \nJiansheng Chen, \nXiaogang Chen, \nLing Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"091cad6ef05e39e2f9f65246269585a2445159a4dc3d1b272ae093b306d53447","category":"Environment"}
