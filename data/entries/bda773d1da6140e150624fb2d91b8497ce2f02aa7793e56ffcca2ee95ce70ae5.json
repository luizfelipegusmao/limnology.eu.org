{"title":"Combining Ability of Capsicum annuum Hybrid for Antioxi-Dant Activities, Polyphenol Content, &alpha;-Glucosidase Inhibitory, Yield, and Yield Components","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2151/v1","date":1725008205000,"content":"Type II diabetes is a major coronavirus disease comorbidity that can be prevented through a diet. Capsicum annuum (chili) consumption is often suggested, and using functional food cultivars is the most effective strategy. However, the general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), and heterotic effect of functional biochemicals (polyphenol content, antioxidant activities, and α-glucosidase inhibitory compounds) remain poorly known in C. annuum. This study aimed to estimate those parameters in C. annuum by using five different genotypes and their hybrid com-binations based on growth characteristics, yield, yield components, and fruit functional biochem-icals. The F1 and F1R progenies were obtained from crosses in a greenhouse and full diallel design. Each parent used in this study had a GCA advantage for each character. The hybrid combination of 074 x 005 and 435 x 367 displayed the best yield results. However, the results indicated the opposite regarding α-glucosidase inhibitory. The heterotic effect of functional biochemicals was observed for traits related to genotypes, polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, α-glucosidase inhibitory compounds, and similar properties related to yield and yield components, indicating their hybrid use in chili production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bda773d1da6140e150624fb2d91b8497ce2f02aa7793e56ffcca2ee95ce70ae5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
