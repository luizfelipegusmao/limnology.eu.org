{"title":"Cryogenic TEM for Soft-Hard and Liquid-Hard Interfaces in Nanotechnology and Energy Sciences","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1069/7720403?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>In the study of liquid-hard and soft-hard interfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.1069-B1\">1-3</a>], as well as the reaction interphases in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.1069-B4\">4-6</a>], cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoEM) emerges as an important technique, offering insights into the chemical and structural arrangements at the nano- and atomic scales. In this talk, I will discuss the applications and technical advancements of cryogenic TEM and its spectroscopies, highlighting their potential in understanding the complex phenomena underlying these interfaces/interphases. By navigating through the complexity of sample preparation, imaging conditions, and data interpretation, we will showcase how these cutting-edge cryoFIB, cryoEM, cryoEELS and cryoET techniques uncover native interfaces/interphases that are otherwise difficult to study, contributing significantly to advancements in nanotechnology and energy sciences. This talk will be presented from a unique perspective, reflecting on how the late Prof. Lena Fitting Kourkoutis profoundly influenced both my personal scientific journey and reshaped the field at large.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f1ad83d2b5308defc98cb3fa20ee667a1ab11ad564ab95ec173192e381bc839a","category":"Environment"}
