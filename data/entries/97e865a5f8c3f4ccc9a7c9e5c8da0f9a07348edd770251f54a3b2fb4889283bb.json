{"title":"Antibacterial and phytotoxicological properties assessment of Momordica charantia extract‐based ZnO nanoparticles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13176?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Utilizing the fruit extract of bitter melon (<i>Momordica charantia</i>), zinc nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were synthesized through a green approach, a novel endeavor in current literature. The primary objective was to evaluate the phytotoxic and growth-promoting effects of these ZnO-NPs on wheat, chosen as a test plant. Structural characterization using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO-NPs and identified spherical <i>M. charantia</i>-produced (MC)-ZnO-NPs ranging in size from 48 to 150 nm.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>At a concentration of 2000 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, both MC- and raw-ZnO-NPs augmented wheat germination percentages. Furthermore, raw-ZnO-NPs at 4000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> demonstrated the highest chlorophyll content. Despite the plant's increased accumulation of MC-ZnO-NPs, no statistically significant toxic effects were observed. The antibacterial efficacy of ZnO-NPs was assessed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. MC-ZnO-NPs exhibited a 67.9% inhibition zone against <i>Escherichia coli</i> at 0.04 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, while raw-ZnO-NPs exhibited 75.6% inhibition at the same concentration.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study suggests that ZnO-NPs synthesized from <i>M. charantia</i> exhibit both growth-promoting effects on wheat without significant phytotoxicity and potent antibacterial properties, particularly against <i>Escherichia coli</i>. However, further investigations are warranted to comprehensively understand the interactions between ZnO-NPs and plants. Future research should focus on <i>M. charantia</i>, exploring its enhanced effects on plant growth, development and antibacterial attributes. These findings hold promise for potential agricultural applications, emphasizing the need for detailed phytotoxicological assessments of ZnO-NPs. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zeynep Görkem Doğaroğlu, \nYağmur Uysal, \nZehranur Çaylalı, \nGökçen Karakoç","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"97e865a5f8c3f4ccc9a7c9e5c8da0f9a07348edd770251f54a3b2fb4889283bb","category":"Environment"}
