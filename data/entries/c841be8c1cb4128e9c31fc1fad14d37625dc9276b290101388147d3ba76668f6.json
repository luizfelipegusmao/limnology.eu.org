The high latent heat (LH) values, noninflammable nature, and low cost make them a preferred material in solar TES. The drying of crops is an essential process for preserving agricultural crops that serves for several agricultural sectors. Solar drying is comparatively inexpensive yet an effective method to dry agricultural products. In this study, the potential of organic paraffin wax as PCM in a movable solar dryer has been investigated. In this experiment, heat-storage materials, organic paraffin wax PCM were used. The use of a PCM-packed floor in a traditional solar dryer used to decrease the drying period of vegetable crops is novel in this work. The work contrasts the drying presentation of chili among direct open solar drying without and with 200â€‰g of microencapsulated and macro encapsulated PCM. Furthermore, the quality and texture of dried chili produced by solar dryers are better to those produced by open sun drying. Chili dried with micro PCM can dried faster when compared with macro PCM with solar dryer. The solar dryer without PCM can take more drying time when compared with solar dryer with micro and macro PCM. Also, the amount of PCM increased the drying time decreases.</p>","author":"Gopinath Govindan Radhakrishnan, \nMuthuvel Sattanathan, \nRajesh Kanna Govindhan Radhakrishnan, \nSaravana Kumar Selvam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"c841be8c1cb4128e9c31fc1fad14d37625dc9276b290101388147d3ba76668f6","category":"Environment"}
