{"title":"Alloying and Segregation in PdRe/Al2O3 Bimetallic Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Furfural","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1918/v1","date":1721806774000,"content":"X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed hydride decomposition (TPHD) were employed to elucidate the structures of a series of PdRe/Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation of furfural.  TPR evidenced low-temperature Re reduction in the bimetallic catalysts consistent with migration of [ReO4]- (perrhenate) species to hydrogen-covered Pd nanoparticles on highly hydroxylated  Al2O3. TPHD revealed strong suppression of β-PdHx formation in the reduced catalysts prepared by (i) co-impregnation and (ii) [HReO4] impregnation of reduced Pd/Al2O3 indicating formation of Pd-rich alloy nanoparticles; however, reduced catalysts prepared by (iii) [Pd(NH3)4]2+ impregnation of calcined Re/Al2O3 and subsequent re-calcination did not.  Re LIII X-ray absorption edge shifts were used to determine average Re oxidation states after reduction at 400°C.  XAFS spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that a reduced 5 wt.% Re/Al2O3 catalyst contained small Re clusters and nanoparticles comprising Re atoms in low positive oxidation states (~1.5+) and incompletely reduced Re species (primarily Re4+).  XAFS spectroscopy of the bimetallic catalysts evidenced Pd-Re bonding consistent with Pd-rich alloy formation.  Pd and Re total first-shell coordination numbers suggest that either Re is segregated to the surface (and Pd to the core) of alloy nanoparticles and/or segregated Pd nanoparticles are larger than Re nanoparticles (or clusters). The Cowley short-range order parameters are strongly positive indicating a high degree of heterogeneity (clustering or segregation of metal atoms) in these bimetallic catalysts.  Catalysts prepared using the Pd(NH3)4[ReO4]2 double complex salt (DCS) exhibit greater Pd-Re intermixing but remain heterogeneous on the atomic scale.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"961941e7a08892bfb3c3ebefb0ac407e33c2b81274ae0e8ee244a01da417354d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
