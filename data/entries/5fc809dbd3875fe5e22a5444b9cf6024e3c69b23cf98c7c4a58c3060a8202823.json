{"title":"The Role of Postbiotics in Allergic Asthma Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0006/v1","date":1719818322000,"content":"Recent years have been abundant in research concerning human microbiome and its impact on the host’s health. Studies have shown, that not only the commensal bacteria itself, but also postbiotics, understood as unalived microorganisms, possibly with the presence of their components, may have themselves effect on various elements of human physiology. In this article we take a closer look on the specific ways in which postbiotics can alter immune response in allergic asthma, which is one of the most prevalent allergic diseases in today’s world being a serious subject of concern. Through altering patients’ immune response, not only to allergens but also to pathogens, postbiotics could have a significant role in lowering the number of asthma exacerbations. We suggest that more profound research should be undertaken in order to launch postbiotics into clinical standards of asthma treatment, given greatly promising findings in the field of their immunomodulating potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fc809dbd3875fe5e22a5444b9cf6024e3c69b23cf98c7c4a58c3060a8202823","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
