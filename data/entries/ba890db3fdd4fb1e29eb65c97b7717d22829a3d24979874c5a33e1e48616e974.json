{"title":"Hydrogen: Prospects and Criticalities for Future Development and Analysis of Present EU and National Regulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0560/v1","date":1723113348000,"content":"Hydrogen is in the spotlight in the energy world, and it will remain so for the next years. In Europe, the necessity to integrate ever growing amounts of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in order to implement the ambitious European decarbonization policy (package Fit-for-55) and to preserve the security of energy supply (package Repower-EU) are feeding the interest in hydrogen. The paper will provide a thorough analysis of prospects and criticalities for the development of hydrogen both as a carrier and as a feedstock and, in definitive, as a key element for the implementation of the European decarbonization policies. First, the present regulatory framework will be highlighted, taking European Union as a main reference since it has presently one of the most advanced hy-drogen legislations in the world. Then, both hydrogen offer (technologies and) and demand (both as a feedstock and as an energy carrier) will be dealt with in detail. Two additional sections will take care to illustrate, respectively, the interactions between hydrogen and the electricity grid and the issues related to the creation of a liquid hydrogen market. Finally, a conclusion section will wrap up and summarize the most urgent issues to be tackled to create a well-functioning hydrogen economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba890db3fdd4fb1e29eb65c97b7717d22829a3d24979874c5a33e1e48616e974","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
