{"title":"Positive Carbon Building Methodology in Co-Design with Residents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0804/v1","date":1728608950000,"content":"The present article outlines the Positive Carbon Building certification's pioneering approach, aiming to establish a clear and rigorous methodology for buildings that are not only neutral in their environmental impact but are net positive. This certification challenges the industry by setting a higher bar â€” achieving net positivity. The approach does not just mitigate harm but actively contributes to environmental regeneration, thereby pushing the construction and real estate sectors towards innovative practices and collaborations. It calls for a reevaluation of how buildings are designed, constructed, and operated, encouraging the incorporation of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient designs, and materials with lower embodied carbon. This ambition signifies a move towards structures that produce more energy than they consume annually, thereby offering a surplus to the energy grid and reducing their carbon footprint comprehensively. This certification intends to work in conjunction with existing green building certifications, emphasizing net-positive energy production and ensuring alignment with both European and national legislations concerning nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) [1]. Traditionally, the focus has been on minimizing the negative environmental impacts of buildings, but the methodology for Positive Building Certification will mark a significant shift in the conceptualization of green building standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c41ca40f3308db061031a7a474d557709acfc57679823a468dc96ba0603dbbf8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
