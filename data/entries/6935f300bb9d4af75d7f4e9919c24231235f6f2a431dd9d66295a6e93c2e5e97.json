{"title":"Population Structure and Genetic Diversity of Ajuga Arabica in Saudi Arabia: A Comparative Analysis of DNA and Gene Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0614/v1","date":1710151353000,"content":"Ajuga arabica is an essential medicinal plant found naturally in Saudi Arabia, recognized for its therapeutic characteristics. Nevertheless, research on the genetic diversity and population arrangement of this species in Saudi Arabia is deficient. In this study, we conducted a comparative examination of DNA and gene sequences to evaluate the genetic diversity and population configuration of Ajuga arabica in Saudi Arabia. Our findings demonstrate that there are high levels of genetic diversity within populations, but low levels of genetic differentiation among populations. Moreover, we discovered proof of gene flow among populations, suggesting that there are no significant genetic barriers to gene flow. Our results offer valuable insights into the genetic diversity and population structure of Ajuga arabica in Saudi Arabia, which can support conservation efforts and promote the sustainable use of this valuable medicinal plant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6935f300bb9d4af75d7f4e9919c24231235f6f2a431dd9d66295a6e93c2e5e97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
