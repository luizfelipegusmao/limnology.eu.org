{"title":"Advanced Voltametric Characterization of Polyphenols in Wine Using a Modified Carbon Paste Electrode with TiO2 Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1059/v1","date":1713275113000,"content":"Polyphenols are the most common organic compounds in wine. They improve both the sensory aspects of wine and human health by activating antioxidant systems. Therefore, there is a great need for a simple, fast and accessible method to determine the polyphenol content of wine. The aim of this study is to characterize polyphenolic compounds in natural wine samples using an electrochemical method and a modified carbon paste electrode with TiO2 nanoparticles. This work is motivated by the promising improvement of the sensing properties of a TiO2 nanoparticle-modified carbon paste electrode observed in the electrooxidation of different polyphenols. Since the voltammetric response of wine is largely irreversible, another motivation was the possibility of improving the processing of voltammograms to obtain data indicative of wine polyphenols, based on the approach described in the seminal work by Espinoza et al. The modified electrode studied provides an improved and reproducible voltammetric response of gallic acid in wine samples and provides a good basis for further development of an integrated sensor/data system with the possibility of wider application for the quantification of gallic acid as a flavor and visually relevant parameter in winemaking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d84c1b390d4a7e4b110d86629968548091775553ac77917e6ca821dc8dc7b9c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
