{"title":"Preparing the Future Public Health Workforce: Integrating Relational Employability to Foster Critical Global Citizenship","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1359/v1","date":1724148553000,"content":"A well-prepared public health workforce is essential for reducing disease burdens and improving population health, requiring an education that addresses global and complex challenges. This paper examines the integration of the relational employability framework in public health education to cultivate critical global citizenship among students and graduates. Our research, conducted at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, involved two case studies using qualitative interviews. Case Study 1, drawn from Cook’s doctoral research, explored student experiences with the relational employability framework within an undergraduate capstone unit. Case Study 2, a school-funded project, gathered graduate perspectives to inform ongoing curriculum development. The findings indicate that the relational employability framework enhances global competencies among students and graduates, through research skills development and critical reflective practice. Students reported improved awareness of their learning needs, self-confidence, and an increased ability to engage with diverse perspectives and societal challenges. Graduates highlighted the framework’s role in understanding ethical standards, conducting rigorous research and applying evidence-based practices in professional settings. Additionally, the framework supported the development of a reflective mindset, enabling graduates to make informed, value-based career decisions and advance their professional growth. The study suggests that adopting a relational employability approach can effectively prepare globally competent and reflective public health professionals. We advocate for the broader implementation of this framework in health education and higher education, offering practical recommendations for curriculum transformation. Such an approach will equip future professionals to contribute meaningfully to public health debates and embody the principles of global citizenship in their practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"829ef1248a1e4638f2852e1f61580a18b378d71751457c58f2ffe18a0120333e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
