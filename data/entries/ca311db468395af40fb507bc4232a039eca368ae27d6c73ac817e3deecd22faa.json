{"title":"Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) pupal success and adult eclosion across variable soil type and moisture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/511/7680092?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Helicoverpa zea</span> Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an important pest in many crops in the southern United States. Upon reaching the final larval instar, <span>H. zea</span> quests for a pupation site in the soil. Pupae are vulnerable to mortality since their movement is limited. Soil type and moisture can influence <span>H. zea</span> emergence, but the interaction of these factors has not been demonstrated. We compared sandy and clay soils in greenhouse and laboratory experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluated the preference of larvae to choose either sandy or clay soil for pupation. In a second experiment, we set the sandy soils at different moisture levels and observed prepupae pupation preference in a choice scenario. In a third experiment, we observed prepupae pupation in different moisture levels in a no-choice scenario. In a 4th experiment, we evaluated adult emergence following pupation when we increased moisture or kept it constant. In a final experiment, we evaluated pupation behavior in sandy or clay soils with a webcam and a glass arena. We found that larvae preferred to pupate in sandy soils over clay soils and that pupal success was highest at intermediate moisture levels. In addition, elevated soil moisture levels did not impact the emergence of <span>H. zea</span> between sandy or clay soil. Finally, <span>H. zea</span> did not take longer to burrow in either sandy or clay soil, but the tunnels of the pupal burrow were larger in sandy soil compared to clay soil. Our results clarify <span>H. zea</span> behavior across soil moisture and soil type.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"ca311db468395af40fb507bc4232a039eca368ae27d6c73ac817e3deecd22faa","category":"Environment"}
