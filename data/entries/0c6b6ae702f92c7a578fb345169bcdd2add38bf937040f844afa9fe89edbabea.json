{"title":"Effective pretreatment of microwave combined with acetic acid soaking on oil absorption and quality of fried potato chips","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13939?af=R","date":1728389363000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study applied a combined pretreatment method involving microwave and acetic acid (AA) soaking to monitor oil absorption of fried potato chips based on texture and microstructure characteristics.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Results demonstrated that medium–low microwave combined with 4 h of AA soaking significantly improved the texture profile of potato chips, and reduced oil content by approximately 53.25%. Higher microwave intensity led to greater surface roughness of samples, whereas AA soaking for 1–4 h effectively reduced surface roughness. The decrease in Fm and Nwr, along with the increase in Fwr and Wc with prolonged AA soaking time for 1–4 h indicated that medium–low microwave intensity combined with AA pretreatment enhanced hardness and brittleness of samples. Microscopic examination of cell structure revealed that this combined pretreatment facilitated pectin gelation between the cell walls of potato chips, resulting in a more intact cell structure with fewer gaps. Additionally, the color of pretreated potato chips became brighter.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The combination of medium–low microwave intensity and AA soaking pretreatment resulted in a decrease in the oil content and improved the texture profile of fried potato chips. This study provides new strategies and insights for producing low-fat potato chips based on low-cost pretreatment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Simeng Wang, \nShuli Zhao, \nNan Wang, \nYing Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"0c6b6ae702f92c7a578fb345169bcdd2add38bf937040f844afa9fe89edbabea","category":"Environment"}
