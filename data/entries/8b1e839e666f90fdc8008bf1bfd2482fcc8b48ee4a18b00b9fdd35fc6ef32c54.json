{"title":"The MBD–ACD DNA methylation reader complex recruits MICRORCHIDIA6 to regulate ribosomal RNA gene expression in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/1098/7471972?rss=1","date":1702425600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark implicated in selective rRNA gene expression, but the DNA methylation readers and effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report a protein complex that reads DNA methylation to regulate variant-specific <span>45S</span> ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene expression in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). The complex, consisting of METHYL-CpG-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN5 (MBD5), MBD6, ALPHA-CRYSTALLIN DOMAIN PROTEIN15.5 (ACD15.5), and ACD21.4, directly binds to <span>45S</span> rDNA. While MBD5 and MBD6 function redundantly, ACD15.5 and ACD21.4 are indispensable for variant-specific rRNA gene expression. These 4 proteins undergo phase separation in vitro and in vivo and are interdependent for their phase separation. The α-crystallin domain of ACD15.5 and ACD21.4, which is essential for their function, enables phase separation of the complex, likely by mediating multivalent protein interactions. The effector MICRORCHIDIA6 directly interacts with ACD15.5 and ACD21.4, but not with MBD5 and MBD6, and is recruited to <span>45S</span> rDNA by the MBD–ACD complex to regulate variant-specific <span>45S</span> rRNA expression. Our study reveals a pathway in Arabidopsis through which certain <span>45S</span> rRNA gene variants are silenced, while others are activated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"8b1e839e666f90fdc8008bf1bfd2482fcc8b48ee4a18b00b9fdd35fc6ef32c54","category":"Environment"}
