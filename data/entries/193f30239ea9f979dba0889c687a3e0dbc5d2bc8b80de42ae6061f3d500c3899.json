{"title":"Fermented Bamboo Powder Affects Dwarf Yellow-Feathered Broilers' Growth, Blood Biochemistry, Antioxidant Status, Intestinal Morphology, and Nutrient Transporter Gene Expression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0265/v1","date":1728266497000,"content":"The incorporation of unconventional feed ingredients in animal husbandry aims to improve nutritional efficiency and animal health. Bamboo, known for its rich mineral, antioxidant, and dietary fiber content, represents a potential alternative feed ingredient. This study explores the effects of fermented bamboo powder (FBP) on growth performance, antioxidant status, intestinal morphology, and expression of nutrient transporter genes in broiler chickens. 600 healthy 1-day-old chicks were randomly divided into two groups, each with 10 replicates of 30 chicks. The control group was provided with a basal diet. The experimental group was given the basal diet with supplemented 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg FBP for two different stages: phase Ⅰ (1-22 days) and phase Ⅱ (23-45 days). The results indicated a significant improvement in growth performance of the group fed with fermented bamboo powder compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). More-over, there was a significant effect on the weight of organs and muscles when compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant effect on triglyceride levels (P &lt; 0.05), with a positive effect on urea and creatinine levels (P &lt; 0.05), as well as a significant improvement in the levels of antioxidant enzymes (MDA, SOD, and CAT) compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, fermented bamboo powder significantly enhanced the surface area available for nutrient absorption in the intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) by increasing the villus height, intestinal lumen depth, and villus area (P &lt; 0.01). FBP increased the expression levels of genes involved in the transport of nutrients from the intestinal regions (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) namely GLUT1, GLUT2, CAT1, CAT2, PEPT1, PEPT2, and LAT1, compared to control. The upregulation of nutrient transporter genes further facilitated nutrient absorption, contributing to the observed improvements in growth and body weight. These findings endorse FBP as a viable feed additive in broiler diets to enhance health and performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"193f30239ea9f979dba0889c687a3e0dbc5d2bc8b80de42ae6061f3d500c3899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
