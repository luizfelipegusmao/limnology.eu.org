{"title":"Metallogenic targets detection by improved joint gravity and magnetic 3d euler deconvolution methodsâ€”a case study in luzong ore concentrating area","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11600-023-01248-5","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Euler deconvolution is used to interpret gravity and magnetic anomalies, which is closely related to the determination of depth in gravity and magnetic, so the findings obtained are very important to describe the depth of anomalies. Herein, we developed a crosscorrelation-based method to constrain Joint Gravity and Magnetic Euler Deconvolution (JGMED). Based on the source effects of the target body, we used an improved correlation coefficient (gravity and magnetic correlation parameter) as a filter condition for Euler deconvolution to determine the ore-bearing body. Further, we estimated the metallogenic targets in the Luzong ore cluster area, Anhui Province. The inversion results suggested the presence of three regions, namely Tangchuanhe, Luohe, and Jiangjunmiao, with high magnetic and density fields. The geological setting, petrophysical property, and lithological distribution characteristics demonstrated that these three high-gravity anomaly regions with high-magnetic anomalies in the volcanic basin may be attributed to mineralisation. Luohe and Jiangjunmiao are newly discovered iron ore deposits with great economic value. Based on previous studies, we speculate that the Tangchuanhe mafic unit has a good prospecting potential. Overall, with the developed JGMED method, we have further expanded the potential of the porphyry copper and iron ore deposits beneath the volcanic rock layers in the northern Luzong volcanic basin.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"a96b0fa86cc624761e5902c823d3a394701b1140c5064387b01a7bc9d9cead0a","category":"Environment"}
