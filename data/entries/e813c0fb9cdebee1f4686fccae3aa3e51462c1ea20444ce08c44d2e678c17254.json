In many cases, the temperature of the sample changes, either from the direct heating, or light absorption, Joule heating, as the result of a chemical reaction. In some cases, the actual temperature of the specimen is not known, whereas in other, the temperature of the entire TEM grid is detected. But the local temperature may significantly deviate from that of the reading, for example, during the laser heating of samples at room temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.698-B1\">1</a>]. Therefore, a precise and accurate method for the local temperature determination is required.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e813c0fb9cdebee1f4686fccae3aa3e51462c1ea20444ce08c44d2e678c17254","category":"Environment"}
