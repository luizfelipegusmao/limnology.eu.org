{"title":"General Direct Anticancer Effects of Growing Antler Extract in Several Tumour Cell Lines, and Immune System-Mediated Effects in Xenograft Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1477/v1","date":1711361972000,"content":"Antler is the fastest growing tissue. Because is based on proto-oncogenes, to avoid the risk of cancer, antlers evolved strong anticancer mechanisms, and thus its extract (DVA) is effective also against the few human tumours studied so far. We assessed whether DVA is a general anticancer compound testing direct effects in cells of different tumours: glioblastoma (GBM), colorectal and breast cancer, and leukaemia. DVA reduced viability of tumour but not healthy cells. Mobility decreased at least at the longest test (72 h). Intraperitoneal/oral 200 mg DVA/kg administration in GBM xenograft mice for 28 d reduced tumour weight 66.3% and 61.4% respectively, and also spleen weight. In addition, tumours treated with DVA showed symptoms of liquefactive necrosis. Serum cytokines showed DVA up-regulated factors related with tumour fighting and down-regulated those related with inducing immune tolerance to the tumour. DVA shows general anticancer effects in the lines tested and, in GBM mice, also strong indirect effects apparently mediated by the immune system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"998db5e223d39f9af0b16c44eada55282a5503c1eb2447411ce1833019b8ab02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
