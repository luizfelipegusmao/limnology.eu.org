{"title":"Open Data and Sustainable Mobility in Slovenia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0091/v1","date":1717466098000,"content":"The open data market is growing, driven by laws requiring governments to make data publicly available. However, the true value of this market lies in the products and services derived from open data. In Slovenia, the open data market has been growing since 2015, especially in the field of mobility. Platforms such as Avtolog.si facilitate the retrieval of vehicle data via vehicle identification numbers, while tocen.si, ojpp.si, and brezavta.si aggregate mobility data, focusing on sustainable and micromobile public transportation services. These platforms use open government data and private sector open data, and are freely accessible. This study examines the use of open data in the Slovenian mobility applications and similar solutions developed in other countries. By mapping these applications, we gain valuable insights into potential advances in the field, and provide a useful resource for future developers worldwide. By focusing on the socio-economic impact of these innovations, the study identifies methods for evaluating such applications. This approach highlights how transforming open data into user-friendly products and services can deepen our understanding of their broader societal and economic benefits. While open data is valuable in its own right, its full transformative potential is realized through innovative products that support sustainable lifestyles and promote environmentally conscious behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c99e9b752331dc182abcfa25df7eca2ae04588822d44c5b95cd2fe97a58d387","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
