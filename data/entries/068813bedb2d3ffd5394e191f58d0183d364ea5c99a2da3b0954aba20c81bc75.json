{"title":"TEOS-10 Equations for the Lifted Condensation Level (LCL) and Climatic Feedback of Marine Clouds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1171/v1","date":1710918324000,"content":"At an energy flux imbalance of about 1 W m–2, the ocean is storing 90 % of the heat accumulating by global warming. However, neither the causes nor the responsible geophysical processes are sufficiently well understood. More detailed investigations of the different phenomena contributing to the oceanic energy balance are warranted. Here, the role of low-level marine clouds in the air-sea interaction is analysed. TEOS-10, the International Thermodynamic Equation of State of Seawater – 2010, is exploited for a rigorous thermodynamic description of the climatic trend of the Lifted Condensation Level (LCL) of the marine troposphere. Rising Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) at constant Relative Humidity (RH) is elevating marine clouds, cooling the cloud base and reducing the downward thermal radiation. This LCL feedback effect is negative and counteracting ocean warming. At the current global SST of about 292 K, the net radiative heat flux from the ocean surface to the LCL cloud base is estimated to 24 W m–2. Per degree of SST increase, this net flux is expected to be enhanced by almost 0.5 W m–2. The climatic LCL feedback effect is relevant for the ocean’s energy balance and may thermodynamically rigorously be modelled in terms of TEOS-10 equations. LCL height may serve as a remotely measured, sensitive estimate for sea surface relative fugacity, or conventional relative humidity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"068813bedb2d3ffd5394e191f58d0183d364ea5c99a2da3b0954aba20c81bc75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
