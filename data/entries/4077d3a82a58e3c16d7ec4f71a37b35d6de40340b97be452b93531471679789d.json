Legume roots possess specialized organs, nodules where symbiotic rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for plants, and, in turn, rhizobia receives carbon, the photosynthetic product from plants (<a href=\"#kiae264-B5\">Tiwari et al. 2021</a>). How do the legumes control nodule numbers? Conserved autoregulation of nodulation (AON) signaling is found in legumes, which maintains the optimal nodule number by following root-to-shoot and back-to-root circuit (<a href=\"#kiae264-B4\">Roy and MÃ¼ller 2022</a>). Disruption of the AON pathway leads to the aberrant formation of nodules, disturbing the metabolic exchange between legumes and rhizobia (<a href=\"#kiae264-B2\">Gautrat et al. 2019</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4077d3a82a58e3c16d7ec4f71a37b35d6de40340b97be452b93531471679789d","category":"Environment"}
