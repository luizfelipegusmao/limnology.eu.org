{"title":"Prediction models for intradialytic hypotension in hemodialysis patients: A protocol for systematic review and critical appraisal","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310191","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Zifeng Li, Luhuan Yang, Zuyang Xi, Wen Yi, Xiaoqian Zeng, Dongling Ma, Yunhong Lei</p>\r\n\r\nIntradialytic hypotension (IDH) is common in hemodialysis patients and can lead to several complications. Risk factors for IDH include demographic characteristics, comorbidities, dialysis procedure factors, and so on. Clinical studies on predictive models for dialysis-induced hypotension have shown inconsistent results. This systematic review aims to evaluate published prediction models for IDH, analyzing their characteristics, predictors, efficacy, and the methodological quality and applicability. The protocol has been prepared using the Preferred Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The systematic review protocol for IDH prediction in hemodialysis patients has been registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY2023110081, DOI: 10.37766/inplasy2023.11.0081). A comprehensive search across five major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang) will be conducted for studies on prediction models of IDH among hemodialysis patients. Two researchers will independently screen literature, extract data, and evaluate the bias risk and applicability of included studies using prediction modelling study tools. This systematic review will provide critical insights into the efficacy and quality of reporting of the IDH model in hemodialysis patients. This will guide clinical staff in selecting the most appropriate IDH prediction model and inform future research endeavors in IDH prediction.","author":"Zifeng Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8931975a2bf54b49d90885fa293c58b11a5f3b024ed58e5b1eb62aae473d92dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
