However, many super-resolution techniques require high-level expertise and specific sample preparation protocols limiting the kind of fluorophore that can be used and consequently the applications. CrestOptics DeepSIM supports researchers deploying standard sample preparation protocols used for confocal microscopy while offering staggering resolution, the possibility of doing live cell imaging, and the ability to image deep into tissues. DeepSIM also allows staining with commonly used fluorescent markers, making it compatible with a large variety of samples and applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"38189c8292d69983440d98b71faf614f099b65110bb82beccacfbabcde3c0d46","category":"Environment"}
