{"title":"Designing Personalized Learning Paths for Foreign Language Acquisition Using Big Data: Theoretical and Empirical Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1381/v1","date":1726652260000,"content":"This study introduces the Data-Driven Personalized Learning Model (DDPLM), a sophisticated framework designed to enhance foreign language acquisition through the integration of big data analytics. Implemented within the educational platforms Edmodo and Duolingo, DDPLM utilizes real-time data processing to tailor learning paths and content dynamically to individual learner needs. Our findings indicate significant improvements in language learning efficiency, engagement, and retention. The model's adaptability across different digital environments showcases its potential scalability and effectiveness in various educational contexts. Additionally, the research addresses the critical role of personalized feedback and adaptive challenges in maintaining learner motivation and promoting deeper linguistic comprehension. The outcomes suggest that DDPLM significantly transforms traditional language education, making it more personalized, efficient, and aligned with individual learning preferences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aea6cde3b7355abf8f0b5d6e38cc80460d0bf32da26896820f3b00f02b414474","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
