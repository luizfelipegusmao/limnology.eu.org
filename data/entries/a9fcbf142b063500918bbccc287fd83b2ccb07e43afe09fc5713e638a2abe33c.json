{"title":"High Resolution Building Indicator Mapping Using Airborne LiDAR Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1040/v1","date":1728895251000,"content":"Urban indicators characterize a specific urban space through calculated values, such as building coverage, building height, floor area ratio, and many others. Urban indicators established in spatial development plans should ensure the preservation of spatial order when introducing new construction investments. They should also harmonize with the existing urban structure, and even modernize it towards sustainable development. When determining these indicators, surrounding space is analyzed. Conventionally, building indicators in the existing space are determined based on available documents, usually 2D spatial data such as large-scale maps or cadastral maps. The aim of this research is to investigate the method of calculating building indicators using 3D urban building models that will be created from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) measurements. In the discussion of the results, indicators calculated based on LiDAR data are compared with calculated from 2D cadastral data. The calculated 3D indicators correlate with the classically calculated indicators. The accuracy of computed building area, volume, and other indicators depends on the LiDAR point cloud density and accuracy. The indicators calculated from 3D data align with new trends in defining Building Morphology Indicators (BMI).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9fcbf142b063500918bbccc287fd83b2ccb07e43afe09fc5713e638a2abe33c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
