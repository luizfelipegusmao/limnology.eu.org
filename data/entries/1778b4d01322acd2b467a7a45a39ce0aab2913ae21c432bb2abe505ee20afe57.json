{"title":"Implementation of Distributed Database Replication in Student Performance Assessment System to Improve Effectiveness and Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0091/v1","date":1719886402000,"content":"This research focuses on developing a Student Performance Evaluation System to enhance effectiveness and oversight in higher education. The system aims to address challenges faced by instructors in evaluating student performance using a distributed system approach. Agile methodology is employed in development, and database replication techniques are applied for data synchronization. System features include registration, assessment form creation, assessment submission, statistical visualization, and access to assessment history. The system is designed to improve efficiency and transparency in the assessment process. Key features of the system include registration process, assessment form creation, assessment submission, statistical visualization, and access to assessment history. Its goal is to enhance efficiency and transparency throughout the assessment process. The article details the system workflow and the roles played by Admins, Instructors, and students in system usage. Additionally, it discusses the back-end development model and pathways, as well as the performance testing results. Performance testing indicates that the system achieves high throughput of up to 21.55 requests per second, with an average response time of only 34 milliseconds and an error rate of zero percent. These results affirm that the system efficiently handles user loads and nearly instantaneously responds to requests, providing an optimal user experience in the context of student performance evaluation in higher education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1778b4d01322acd2b467a7a45a39ce0aab2913ae21c432bb2abe505ee20afe57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
