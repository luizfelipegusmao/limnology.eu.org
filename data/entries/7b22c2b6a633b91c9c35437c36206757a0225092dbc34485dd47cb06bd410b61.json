These multicellular bacteria present a sophisticated developmental cycle and play a key role in soil ecology. Little is known about the impact of <i>Streptomyces</i> phage on bacterial physiology. In this study, we investigated the conditions governing the expression and production of “Samy”, a prophage found in <i>Streptomyces ambofaciens</i> ATCC 23877. This siphoprophage is produced simultaneously with the activation of other mobile genetic elements. Remarkably, the presence and production of Samy increases bacterial dispersal under <i>in vitro</i> stress conditions. Altogether, this study unveiled a new property of a bacteriophage infection in the context of multicellular aggregate dynamics.","author":"Hoda Jaffal","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"7b22c2b6a633b91c9c35437c36206757a0225092dbc34485dd47cb06bd410b61","category":"Environment"}
