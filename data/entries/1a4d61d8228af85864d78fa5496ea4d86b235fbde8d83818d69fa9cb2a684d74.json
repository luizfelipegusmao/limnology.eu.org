{"title":"Time budget and behavioral synchrony of humpback whale mother‐calf pairs on a breeding ground in the southwestern Indian Ocean","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13129?af=R","date":1713171561000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding the activity budget of mother-young pairs can inform how energy is allocated and its relation to the development of young. Using suction cup tag data collected off Sainte Marie, Madagascar, during the calving season, we compared the time budgets of mothers and their calves in capital-breeding humpback whales, investigated the changes with age, and assessed mother-calf behavioral synchrony based on their swimming speed. We found that mothers and calves allocated much of their time to low-level activities (i.e., static/quasi-static or swimming at low speed). Young calves engaged more in slow swimming than older calves and mothers. Mothers with younger calves tended to stay static or quasi-static less than mothers with older ones. Calves displayed some degree of independence in activities but were also observed synchronizing their activities with their mothers. Depending on the nature of the activity, the initiation of it was driven by either the calf or the mother. Our study provides additional knowledge for understanding the behavioral dynamics and interactions within humpback whale mother-calf pairs. It provides data that can support the implementation of conservation measures.</p>","author":"Maevatiana N.
