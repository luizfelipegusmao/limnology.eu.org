{"title":"Hybrid multicriteria decision‐making model for process selection for drinking water treatment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14390?af=R","date":1722427964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The overuse of pesticides in agriculture poses significant threats to human health and the environment. This study addresses the issue by proposing a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, utilizing the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), to select the most suitable pesticide removal method for drinking water treatment. Focusing on the priority and selection of treatment options for specific pesticide groups, such as diuron and cypermethrin, based on toxicity and physicochemical properties, the study concludes that nanofiltration is best option for diuron removal, while granular activated carbon adsorption is effective for cypermethrin. The innovative hybrid MCDM (AHP + TOPSIS and AHP + VIKOR) approach, unprecedented in assessing pesticide removal methods for drinking water treatment, proves promising in ranking treatment processes for pesticides. The study emphasizes the serious consequences of excessive pesticide use, highlights treatment solutions like NF and GAC adsorption, and introduces cutting-edge hybrid MCDM techniques for selection treatment process that meet technical, economical, and environmental requirements. All of these factors combine to provide a novel approach not only used to select the best option from alternatives, but also to prioritize alternative processes in drinking water treatment at pesticide removal practices.</p>","author":"Cihan Ozgur, \nDeniz Baris, \nSehnaz Sule Kaplan Bekaroglu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"d29431960e410d458dd376ca0001321520bb24e8b6c19488d66f686087484245","category":"Environment"}
