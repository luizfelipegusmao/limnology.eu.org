{"title":"Characterization of HPMC and PEG 400 Mucoadhesive Film Loaded With Retinol for Intravaginal Administration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0071/v1","date":1722564233000,"content":"Intravaginal drug administration offers several advantages over other administration routes, primarily by bypassing the initial stages of metabolism. Additionally, this route has demonstrated both local and systemic effects. To prevent the disintegration of molecules in the mucous barriers of wet cavities, mucoadhesive polymeric systems can be utilized. In this study, the performance and characteristics of a mucoadhesive film composed of HPMC-PEG 400 containing retinol molecules was determined using various techniques. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to determine the porous structure of the film. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was conducted at different temperatures to assess thermal stability. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyzed the functional groups and the intermolecular interactions between the film and the drug. Swelling and weight loss tests indicated that the film disintegrated within 3-4 days. For drug delivery evaluation based on the Higuchi equation, UV-VIS spectroscopy was used. Additionally, the surface wetting properties were assessed through contact angle measurements. The biocompatibility of the system was confirmed using the MTT assay. Finally, adhesion and glide tests demonstrated the film's interaction with porcine uterine tissue. This study shows that the HPMC-PEG 400 film containing retinol molecules interacts effectively with tissue and could be considered a novel tool for treating damaged epithelial tissues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"707d2a4275f13aa189811f4279656a512627a3e950d0983bdc430533de63222c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
