{"title":"Coastal Sea Ice Concentration Derived from Marine Radar Images: A Case Study from Utqiaġvik, Alaska","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0387/v1","date":1722918052000,"content":"We apply the Canny Edge algorithm to the Utqiaġvik coastal sea ice radar system (CSIRS) to quantify open water and sea ice (landfast or drifting) concentration. The radar-derived sea ice concentration is compared against the 25-km resolution NSIDC Climate Data Record (CDR, one pixel closest to the radar field of view) and the 1-km merged MODIS-AMSR2 sea ice concentrations in the ∼11 km field of view for the year 2022-2023, when improved image contrast was first implemented. The algorithm was first optimized using sea ice concentration from 14 different images and 10 ice analysts (140 analysis in total) covering a wide range of ice condition with landfast ice, drifting ice and open water. The algorithm is also validated quantitatively against high-resolution MODIS-Terra in the visible range. Results show a correlation coefficient and mean bias error between the optimized algorithm, the CDR and MODIS-AMSR2 daily SIC of 0.18 and 0.54, and ∼ -1 and 0.9%, respectively, with an averaged inter-analyst error of ± 3%. In general, the CDR captures the melt period correctly and overestimates the SIC during the winter and freeze-up period, while the merged MODIS-AMSR2 better captures the punctual break-out events in winter including those during the freeze-up events (reduction of in SIC). Remnant issues with the detection algorithm include the false detection of sea ice in the presence, fog or precipitation (up to 20%), quantified from the summer reconstruction with known open water conditions. Coastal marine radars provide prove very useful in bridging the gap between (lower) resolution satellite-derived and in-situ (visual) sea ice conditions, and to quantify land contamination from lower resolution satellite-derived SIC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7eaf1314b223410200d811546e88519c01024afef1b02715407ee4e36a8a7148","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
