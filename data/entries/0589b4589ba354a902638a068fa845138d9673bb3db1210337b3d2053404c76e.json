Due to massive interest in this methodology across all fields of structural biology, there has been a surge of interest in gaining expertise in all aspects of cryo-EM structure determination. Here, we present the outcomes of intensive cryo-EM courses conducted at various institutes worldwide, including a notable 2-week program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. These courses encompass comprehensive training in the theory, practice, and application of single particle cryo-EM techniques to diverse biological targets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0589b4589ba354a902638a068fa845138d9673bb3db1210337b3d2053404c76e","category":"Environment"}
