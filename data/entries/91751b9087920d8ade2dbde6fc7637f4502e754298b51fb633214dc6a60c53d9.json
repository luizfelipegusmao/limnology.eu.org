Nonetheless, imaging these membranes is challenging due to their extreme beam sensitivity and inherent low contrast. Traditional TEM methods rely on heavy-element stains or ion-exchange for contrast enhancement in polymers, which may introduce artifacts due to incomplete or non-specific staining or swelling behavior [<a href=\"#ozae044.860-B1\">1</a>]. Here, we demonstrate the use of cryogenic-STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) for direct identification and quantitative analysis of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic microphase separation within polymer membranes in their unaltered form, a characteristic believed to enhance their ionic conductivity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"91751b9087920d8ade2dbde6fc7637f4502e754298b51fb633214dc6a60c53d9","category":"Environment"}
