{"title":"Experimental Investigation on Atmospheric Microwave Plasma-Driven Nitrogen Fixation Using Metal-Organic Frameworks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1475/v1","date":1729243069000,"content":"Microwave plasma-driven nitrogen fixation can occur at atmospheric pressure without greenhouse gas emissions. However, this method still faces the challenge of high energy consumption and low production. Plasma-catalyst combined systems are widely used to increase production and reduce energy consumption in nitrogen fixation. However, the efficacy of current catalysts remains limited. In this paper, the metal-organic framework materials CuBTC and ZIF-8 are combined with the atmospheric microwave plasma for nitrogen fixation. The experimental results show their better catalytic effect than the ordinary catalyst ZSM-5. The maximum nitrogen oxide concentration reaches 33400 ppm, and the lowest energy consumption is 2.05 MJ/mol. Compared to no catalyst, the nitrogen oxide production can be increased by 17.1%, and the energy consumption can be reduced by 14.6%. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalysts reveal obvious differences in the catalyst particle sizes. Notably, catalysts with smaller particle sizes attain higher NOx concentrations compared to their larger counterparts. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first effort to study the synergistic effects of atmospheric microwave plasma and metal-organic framework materials on nitrogen fixation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac11f231bef077497d06c9260470b41f9f1b13b011b0ed8b4ec1b2968a7ea682","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
