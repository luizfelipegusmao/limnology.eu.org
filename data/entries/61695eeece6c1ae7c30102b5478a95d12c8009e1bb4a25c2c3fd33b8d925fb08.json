{"title":"The forgotten <i>p</i>-versine and <i>p</i>-coversine family of functions revisited","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308529","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Ali Hamzah Alibrahim, Saptarshi Das</p>\r\n\r\nThis study delves into special class of generalized <i>p</i>-trigonometric functions, examining their connection to the established counterparts like <i>p</i>-cosine and <i>p</i>-sine functions. We here explore the new class of functions called the <i>p</i>-versine, <i>p</i>-coversine, <i>p</i>-haversine, and <i>p</i>-hacovercosine, by providing comprehensive definitions and properties. Grounded in the characteristics of <i>p</i>-cosine and <i>p</i>-sine functions, the newly proposed functions offer unique mathematical insights. Our work contributes towards a thorough understanding of these new special functions, showcasing their potential applications in diverse scientific domains, from mathematical analysis to physics and engineering. This paper contributes as a valuable resource for future applied mathematics researchers, engaging with these new mathematical functions, enhancing the ability to model complex patterns from diverse real-world applications.","author":"Ali Hamzah Alibrahim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"61695eeece6c1ae7c30102b5478a95d12c8009e1bb4a25c2c3fd33b8d925fb08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
