{"title":"Changes of Periodontal Parameters and Microbiome Composition of Tooth Pocket in Patients with Chronic Inflammatory Diseases Receiving Targeted Anti-Cytokine Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1518/v1","date":1711447432000,"content":"Abstract \nBackground: Periodontitis is associated with systemic chronic inflammatory diseases. There is limited evidence on the influence of anti-cytokine therapies on the periodontal condition and microbiome in the tooth pocket of such patients, so the aim of this study was to elucidate this issue.\nMethods: In this observational trial, the periodontal status and the gingival crevicular fluid of 13 patients with different chronic inflammatory diseases were obtained before initiation of anti-cytokine treatment and 14 weeks after. Gingival crevicular fluid was collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing from a clinically healthy tooth and the deepest measured pocket. \nResults: In participants with advanced attachment loss at baseline, the clinical attachment level significantly decreased from 2.9 (2.3-3.4) to 2.4 (1.3-3.0) mm (p = 0.04), and the bleeding- on-probing index dropped from 19.4 (10.0-21.0) to 7.3 (6.9-9.9) mm (p = 0.02) without any further periodontal treatment. Shannonâ€™s diversity index significantly increased in the deepest pockets of patients (p = 0.039).\nConclusion: The data showed alterations in diversity of the subgingival microbiome and improvement of periodontal parameters over the course of the study, implying a shift towards a healthier condition after starting anti-cytokine therapy. Additional investigations are needed to analyze whether the administration of selective biologicals can improve periodontal conditions in patients with or without chronic inflammatory diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af3128eb74c548c7f96b105b98d621985431e983406c2be3bed50662888b9a70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
