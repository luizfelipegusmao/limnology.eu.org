Parallel detection provides to observe multiple soft X-ray spectra simultaneously with high energy resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio and good reproducibility. In particular, chemical bonding information, including the valence band, can be performed by laboratory-scale microscopic observations [<a href=\"#ozae044.151-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"869d18a204d507cb11bfcd286fbc24e1c41f91067bc4057e595f468ca109177f","category":"Environment"}
