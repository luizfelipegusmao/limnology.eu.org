{"title":"Temperature-dependent action of pepper mildew resistance locus O 1 in inducing pathogen immunity and thermotolerance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/2064/7452183?rss=1","date":1701043200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant diseases tend to be more serious under conditions of high-temperature/high-humidity (HTHH) than under moderate conditions, and hence disease resistance under HTHH is an important determinant for plant survival. However, how plants cope with diseases under HTHH remains poorly understood. In this study, we used the pathosystem consisting of pepper (<span>Capsicum annuum</span>) and <span>Ralstonia solanacearum</span> (bacterial wilt) as a model to examine the functions of the protein mildew resistance locus O 1 (CaMLO1) and U-box domain-containing protein 21 (CaPUB21) under conditions of 80% humidity and either 28 °C or 37 °C. Expression profiling, loss- and gain-of-function assays involving virus-induced gene-silencing and overexpression in pepper plants, and protein–protein interaction assays were conducted, and the results showed that CaMLO1 acted negatively in pepper immunity against <span>R. solanacearum</span> at 28 °C but positively at 37 °C. In contrast, CaPUB21 acted positively in immunity at 28 °C but negatively at 37 °C. Importantly, CaPUB21 interacted with CaMLO1 under all of the tested conditions, but only the interaction in response to <span>R. solanacearum</span> at 37 °C or to exposure to 37 °C alone led to CaMLO1 degradation, thereby turning off defence responses against <span>R. solanacearum</span> at 37 °C and under high-temperature stress to conserve resources. Thus, we show that CaMLO1 and CaPUB21 interact with each other and function distinctly in pepper immunity against <span>R. solanacearum</span> in an environment-dependent manner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"903f561b88c3f1f380c3eb4e20a14f15fd7bd772b2146d022834c95b77956f79","category":"Environment"}
