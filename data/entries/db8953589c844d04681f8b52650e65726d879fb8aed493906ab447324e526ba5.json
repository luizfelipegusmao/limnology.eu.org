{"title":"Lead Detection with Sentinel-1 in the Beaufort Gyre using Google Earth Engine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0284/v1","date":1714983126000,"content":"The increasing concern regarding climate change continues to motivate research in the Arctic. Within the delicate cycle of the cryosphere, leads are an important kinematic feature that regulates heat balances and gaseous exchanges in the Arctic. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the genesis of leads over time to identify when and where changes are occurring. The use of learning techniques is one such tool that is used to identify the characteristics of seasonal ice variability. This paper utilizes the Sentinel-1 RADAR imagery with a support vector machine learning scheme through Google Earth Engine to classify lead types in the Beaufort Sea.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db8953589c844d04681f8b52650e65726d879fb8aed493906ab447324e526ba5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
