{"title":"Achieving Sustainable Development through Electrification: An Empirical Analysis of Electrification and Health Vulnerability in Developing Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0745/v1","date":1725980821000,"content":"Reliable access to electricity has become a necessity worldwide, and without it, no country can operate health systems and achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, while developed countries have been successfully electrified for many decades, most developing countries have fallen short, contributing to significant impacts, particularly the health sector. The present study explores the relationship between electrification and health vulnerability in developing countries between 1990 and 2020 using the Feasible Generalized Least Square (FGLS) approach. The varied electrification across countries motivates the use of non-linear associations between electrification and health vulnerability. We demonstrate that electrification and health vulnerability have an inverted U-shaped association. Further analysis indicates that most developing countries have achieved a mature level of an inverted U-shaped curve, showing a reduction in health vulnerability with increasing electrification. There are few developing countries, mainly African countries, struggling to reach maturity. The results of this study indicate the need for increased access to electrification, in combination with a reduction in the use of biomass and fossil fuel feedstocks, to mitigate health vulnerability in developing countries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d30e80123debc5f2edd6d8788ac58bb53082971694332313669b98f57df20dab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
