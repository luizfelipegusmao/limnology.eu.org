{"title":"A commitment for life: Decades of unraveling the molecular mechanisms behind seed dormancy and germination","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1358/7517793?rss=1","date":1705017600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Seeds are unique time capsules that can switch between 2 complex and highly interlinked stages: seed dormancy and germination. Dormancy contributes to the survival of plants because it allows to delay germination to optimal conditions. The switch between dormancy and germination occurs in response to developmental and environmental cues. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of studies that have helped to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying dormancy and germination over the last decades. Genetic and physiological studies provided a strong foundation for this field of research and revealed the critical role of the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins in the regulation of dormancy and germination, and later natural variation studies together with quantitative genetics identified previously unknown genetic components that control these processes. Omics technologies like transcriptome, proteome, and translatomics analysis allowed us to mechanistically dissect these processes and identify new components in the regulation of seed dormancy and germination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1e37eaf15e72747a6c0d0e979607f7de7138f1c7e4b1759d4a1406aed8bfacf1","category":"Environment"}
