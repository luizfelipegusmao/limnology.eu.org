Traditional imaging techniques in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), such as annular dark-field (ADF) and annular bright-field (ABF) imaging, have been widely employed to obtain structural information in a broad range of materials even at atomic resolution. Nevertheless, the high flux or fluence of electron beam required for high-resolution imaging in these techniques limits the characterization of various beam sensitive materials, due to beam damage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1d8f4d1cb196e0840acb2f673811c72b5e658352e71897df3766dc26e982661d","category":"Environment"}
