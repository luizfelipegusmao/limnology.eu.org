{"title":"Holographic Simulation of the Electric Field of a 6KA Rare Earth Molten Salt Electrolytic Cell","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0791/v1","date":1725953840000,"content":"Molten salt electrolysis stands as an indispensable technique for the production of rare earth metals, where the judicious distribution of the electric field within the electrolytic cell is paramount for ensuring the seamless operation of the electrolysis process. This study introduces a pioneering approach by integrating the Nernst-Planck equation with the Butler-Volmer equation, thereby devising a holographic electric field model tailored for the electrolysis of the NdF3-LiF molten salt system. The paper presents pioneering experimental measurements concerning the potential distribution and voltage drop characteristics within a 6kA rare earth electrolytic cell, elucidating the interplay between decomposition voltage and current density, which substantiates the model's precision. Our findings unveil that, under operational conditions of 4010 amperes, the 6kA electrolytic cell incurs a total voltage drop of 6.3 volts, delineating a melt voltage drop of 4.43 volts, an ohmic voltage drop of 0.248 volts, and an interfacial voltage drop of 1.622 volts at the electrode-electrolyte junction. The discrepancy in error is confined to within 0.3% of the actual measured voltage of 6.28 volts.The simulation outcomes from the holographic electric field model have been confirmed to precisely and comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the electric field distribution during the rare earth molten salt electrolysis process, offering valuable theoretical insights for practical manufacturing applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99770275d15070ad7022e905066453599aaff029e668a8ce3a73d05c0964de45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
