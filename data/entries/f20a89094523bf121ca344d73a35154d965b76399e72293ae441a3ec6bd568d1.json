{"title":"Association of Gut Microbiome and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 in Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Rapid Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1079/v1","date":1728910386000,"content":"Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are characterized by dysregulated immune responses and chronic tissue inflammation. In the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and gut microorganisms have been proved to interplay, potentially influenced by dietary factors. This rapid review aimed to study the DPP4-gut microbiome link in IBD.\nA literature search across five databases and two other sources identified seven relevant studies reporting data on DPP4 and gut microbiome, in patients with IBD-related IMIDs or in vitro or in vivo models: one cross-sectional, one in vitro, and five in vivo studies.\nThe findings revealed a significant impact of DPP4 and its substrates, i.e. glucagon-like pep-tide-1/2 (GLP-1/2), on the composition of gut microbiome and on the development of dysbiosis. Increased DPP4 activity is associated with decreased GLP-1/2, increased pathogenic bacteria from Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deferribacteres, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla, and decreased ÔÅ°-diversity of beneficial gut microbes, including Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae families and short-chain fatty ac-id-producing bacteria like Odoribacter and Butryvibrio spp., with exacerbation of intestinal in-flammation.\nThis overview revealed that understanding the DPP4-gut microbiome association is critical for the development of DPP4-targeted therapeutic strategies to guarantee gut microbiome balance and modulation of immune response in IBD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f20a89094523bf121ca344d73a35154d965b76399e72293ae441a3ec6bd568d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
