{"title":"Effects of Light Spectrum on Survival, Growth, Physiological, and Biochemical Indices of Redclaw Crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) Juveniles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/8897473?af=R","date":1712559600000,"content":"<p>The spectrum is a key environmental factor, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can influence the growth and development of crustaceans by altering the composition of the spectrum. This study conducted a 30-day experiment to investigate the effects of five LED spectra (red, yellow, blue, green, and white light) on the growth, antioxidant and immune enzyme activities, stress hormone levels, and the expression of <i>α</i>-amylase (<i>α-AMY</i>), ecdysone receptor (<i>EcR</i>) and retinoid X receptor (<i>RXR</i>) genes in juvenile redclaw crayfish (<i>Cherax quadricarinatus</i>). The results show that the survival rate of juveniles is markedly higher in the yellow and red-light groups than in the other three groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The green light group exhibits the lowest survival rate, yet it demonstrates the highest weight gain rate and specific growth rate. Regarding enzyme activity and hormone levels, the yellow light group shows the lowest malondialdehyde content, with higher superoxide dismutase and acid phosphatase activity than the other groups; no significant differences are observed in lysozyme activity among the groups (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). The melatonin content in the green and blue light groups is significantly higher than that in the other three groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). In terms of growth gene expression, the expression of <i>α-AMY</i>, <i>EcR</i>, and <i>RXR</i> in juvenile <i>C. quadricarinatus</i> is regulated by the spectrum. In conclusion, when raised under the yellow light spectrum, juvenile <i>C. quadricarinatus</i> displays elevated survival rates, rapid growth, and robust antioxidant and immune defenses. This study provides important technical parameters for optimizing and enhancing the industrial cultivation of juvenile <i>C. quadricarinatus</i>.</p>","author":"Cuixue Huang, \nXiangxing Nie, \nJie Wei, \nYakun Wang, \nKunhao Hong, \nXidong Mu, \nChao Liu, \nZhangjie Chu, \nXinping Zhu, \nLingyun Yu, \nLiqiao Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"6fb784a05b7c4a9cd7e44d86f6fd90ea3c8e7d2cc0e36add264ec3556f9211ab","category":"Environment"}
