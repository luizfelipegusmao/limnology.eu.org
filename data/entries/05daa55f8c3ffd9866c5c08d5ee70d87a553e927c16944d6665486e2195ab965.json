{"title":"Deep learning for identifying bee species from images of wings and pinned specimens","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303383","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Brian J.

Recent advances in the application of deep learning and computer vision have shown promise for identifying large bumble bee (<i>Bombus</i>) species. However, most bees, such as sweat bees in the genus <i>Lasioglossum</i>, are much smaller and can be difficult, even for trained taxonomists, to identify. For this reason, the great majority of bees are poorly represented in the crowdsourced image datasets often used to train computer vision models. But even larger bees, such as bumble bees from the <i>B</i>. <i>vagans</i> complex, can be difficult to separate morphologically. Using images of specimens from our research collections, we assessed how deep learning classification models perform on these more challenging taxa, qualitatively comparing models trained on images of whole pinned specimens or on images of bee forewings. The pinned specimen and wing image datasets represent 20 and 18 species from 6 and 4 genera, respectively, and were used to train the EfficientNetV2L convolutional neural network. Mean test precision was 94.9% and 98.1% for pinned and wing images respectively. Results show that computer vision holds great promise for classifying smaller, more difficult to identify bees that are poorly represented in crowdsourced datasets. Images from research and museum collections will be valuable for expanding classification models to include additional species, which will be essential for large scale conservation monitoring efforts.","author":"Brian J.
