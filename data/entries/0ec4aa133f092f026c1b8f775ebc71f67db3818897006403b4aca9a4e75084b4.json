Raman mapping/imaging is typically combined with optical microscopy to provide correlated information on samples. Sometimes, optical imaging provides less contrast for mineralogical samples compared to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. However, combined SEM Raman instruments are relatively uncommon and often require the sample to be moved within the SEM chamber to a different analysis position. This movement makes it challenging to ensure the SEM and Raman measurements are accurately co-localized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0ec4aa133f092f026c1b8f775ebc71f67db3818897006403b4aca9a4e75084b4","category":"Environment"}
