{"title":"The Impact of Continuous Education on Healthcare Workers' Attitudes Toward Old people Nutrition: A Cross-sectional Study in Italian Nursing Homes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1754/v1","date":1729607694000,"content":"Background: Malnutrition is a widespread issue among old people, significantly impacting health outcomes. Nutritional interventions can improve health, but their success often depends on the attitudes and knowledge of healthcare workers. This study examines the influence of continuing education on healthcare workers' attitudes and practices toward old people's nutrition.\nAim: The study assesses healthcare workers' attitudes toward old people's nutrition using the validated Italian version of the SANN-G questionnaire, focusing on staff in nursing homes in Northern Italy.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,789 healthcare workers from 41 facilities. The SANN-G questionnaire measured attitudes across five dimensions: nutritional norms, habits, assessment, intervention, and individualization. Data were collected online and on paper, with descriptive and inferential statistical analyses (chi-square and ANOVA) performed using R software.\nResults: Most respondents were female (68.59%) and aged 41â€“50 (33.31%), with nursing assistants comprising 35.83%. Only 23.48% scored positively on the SANN-G scale, with most displaying neutral or negative attitudes. Education on malnutrition significantly improved attitudes, particularly in assessment, intervention, and individualization. Younger respondents and nurses were more likely to have positive attitudes after educational interventions, while older respondents and physicians tended to show neutral or negative attitudes.\nConclusion: Continuing education on malnutrition is crucial for fostering positive attitudes among healthcare workers. Specialized education leads to more proactive approaches, highlighting the need for targeted educational programs to improve old people's nutritional care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92617713135e445a5cc289f181567a97e01975b8905ca188b626aebddacf9979","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
