{"title":"Adobe Bricks of Champagne Region (France): Characterization of a Chalky Raw Earth Construction Material","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1069/v1","date":1713268641000,"content":"Raw earth bricks made from the soil of the Chalky Champagne region (France) have been used for at least two millennia in construction, a promising heritage in the context of reducing the carbon emissions of buildings. The present experimental study aims at measuring the physical, mechanical, thermal, and hydric properties of adobes collected from a local village barn. Results show a high chalk content estimated at 71%, and a clay content, acting as binder, at 14%. Despite limited load-bearing capacity, these lightweight adobes are suitable for current single-story constructions, while their hydrothermal properties classify them as excellent moisture regulators for occupants. In association with other bio-sourced materials such as starch-beet pulp bricks, Chalky Champagne adobes yield promising insulating properties, and meet the criteria defined by current energy standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8921d9b47702000ae217eaf31974040b2dba8b01f8c62cdfd7ab4fa7308065cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
