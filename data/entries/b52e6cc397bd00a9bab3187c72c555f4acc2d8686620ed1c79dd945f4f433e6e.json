{"title":"One-X Property Conjecture, Stochastic Orders and Implied Volatility Surface Construction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1533/v1","date":1726769595000,"content":"In this work, we explore Conjecture 1 proposed in the newly released pioneering paper “Volatility transformers: an optimal transport-inspired approach to arbitrage-free shaping of implied volatility surfaces” by Zetocha Valer, which posits that the “One-X” property is both a necessary and sufficient condition for convex order between non-negative continuous strictly increasing distributions with the same mean. We provide a counterexample demonstrating that the conjecture, as originally stated, does not hold. By examining stochastic orders, particularly the increasing convex order, and the “One-X” property, we propose an enhanced version of the conjecture which is shown to be valid. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings in the context of equity implied volatility fitting and the construction of implied volatility surfaces, highlighting the challenges posed by real-market conditions. In the end, we propose several applications in implied volatility surface construction or simulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b52e6cc397bd00a9bab3187c72c555f4acc2d8686620ed1c79dd945f4f433e6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
