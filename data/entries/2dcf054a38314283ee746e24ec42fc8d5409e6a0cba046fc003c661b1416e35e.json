{"title":"Bovine Parainfluenza Virus 3 and Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Dominant Viral Players in Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex among Serbian Cattle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1412/v1","date":1713783309000,"content":"Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex, a complex respiratory ailment in cattle, results from a combination of viral and bacterial factors, compounded by environmental stressors such as overcrowding, transportation, and adverse weather conditions. Its impact extends beyond mere health concerns, posing significant economic threats to the cattle industry. This study presents an extensive investigation into viral pathogens associated with BRDC in Serbian cattle, utilizing serum samples and nasal swabs. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2024 across 65 randomly selected dairy farms in Serbia, excluding vaccinated farms. Farms were categorized by livestock count: small (â‰¤50 animals), medium-sized (51-200 animals), and large (&amp;gt;200 animals). Serum samples from adult cattle older than 24 months were tested for antibodies against BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV, and BPIV3. Nasal swab samples from animals with respiratory signs were tested using PCR for viral genome detection. Results showed seropositivity for all four viruses across all farms, with BPIV3 exhibiting universal seropositivity. Medium-sized and large farms demonstrated higher seropositivity for BRSV and BHV-1 compared to small farms (p&amp;lt;.05). True seroprevalence estimates at the animal level were 84.29% for BRSV, 54.08% for BVDV, 90.61% for BHV-1, and 84.59% for BPIV3. PCR analysis of nasal swabs revealed positive detections for BRSV (20%), BHV-1 (1.7%), BVDV (8%), and BPIV3 (10.9%). Influenza D virus was not found in any of samples. This study provides critical insights into the prevalence and circulation of viral pathogens associated with BRDC in Serbian cattle, emphasizing the importance of surveillance and control measures to mitigate the impact of respiratory diseases in cattle populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dcf054a38314283ee746e24ec42fc8d5409e6a0cba046fc003c661b1416e35e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
