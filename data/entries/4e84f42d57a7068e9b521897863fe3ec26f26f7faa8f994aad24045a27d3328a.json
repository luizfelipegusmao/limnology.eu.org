{"title":"Numerical Analysis of the Effect of Different Nose Shapes on Train Aerodynamic Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2258/v1","date":1722323733000,"content":"This study investigated the aerodynamic performances of various trains with different nose shapes, using as design variables two angles α,β for the heads shape and the bluntness angle γ, without crosswind. The effect on aerodynamic performances, such as the train drag coefficient, pressure distribution along the train surface, flow structures around the train and the wake, head pressure pulse, were analyzed. The results indicate that the increase of the train nose length for flat shapes decreases the CD values by 21.47% and 19.11%, decreasing the high-pressure region in the leading head. The duck-nose configuration emerges as a compromise between drag reduction and nose length. Increasing the angle γ a further drag reduction of 8.5% is featured. Drag formation along the train is also analyzed. The steeper the variation of the geometry, the higher the peak intensity and the slope of the curve. Regarding the flow features around the train, two-main counter-rotating vortices are captured in the wake. Moreover, the higher the nose length and the higher the bluntness angle γ, the weaker and narrower the wake. Again, a longer nose shape yields to a softer jump in terms of pressure difference, crucial for train homologation and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e84f42d57a7068e9b521897863fe3ec26f26f7faa8f994aad24045a27d3328a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
