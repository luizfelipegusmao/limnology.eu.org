{"title":"Challenges in Metal Additive Manufacturing: Examining the technical and economic challenges associated with metal additive manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0654/v1","date":1723198423000,"content":"Metal additive manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing with metals, is an innovative technology with significant potential to transform industries such as aerospace, automotive, and healthcare. Despite its promise, the field faces several challenges that impact both its technical feasibility and economic viability. This paper explores the primary technical challenges, including material properties and processing complexities, such as the need for precise control of thermal gradients and the mitigation of defects like porosity and residual stresses. Additionally, it addresses the economic barriers, including high initial equipment costs, the need for specialized knowledge, and the relatively slow build speeds compared to traditional manufacturing methods. By examining these challenges, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of metal additive manufacturing and suggest potential pathways for overcoming these obstacles to facilitate wider adoption and technological advancement in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74c50e0724addf3866ee1161d8c08342555879c5b75a70f34ae0feb8958f6750","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
