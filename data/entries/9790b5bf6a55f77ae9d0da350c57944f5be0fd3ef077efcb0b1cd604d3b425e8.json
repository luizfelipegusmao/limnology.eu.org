{"title":"Buckling Behavior of Innovative Low-Cost Bamboo Composite (LCBC) Structural Columns: Experimental Method and Numerical Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1614/v1","date":1721617643000,"content":"This paper investigates, experimentally and numerically, the buckling behavior of innovative sustainable Low-Cost Bamboo Composite (LCBC) structural columns under compressive loading. The LCBC columns are manufactured from bamboo culms in combination with bio-based resins to form composite structural columns. Different LCBC cross-sectional configurations are investigated in this study including the Russian doll (RD), Big Russian doll (BRD), Hawser (HAW), and Scrimber (SCR). Extra-large, large, medium, and small sizes of bamboo are employed to form the proposed configurations. Two bio-based resins including one bio-epoxy and one furan-based resin, in addition to a soft bio-based filler and a synthetic epoxy resin are applied. The bamboo species used as the cast-in-place giant bamboo for all configurations include Moso, Guadua, and Tali. In addition to experimental testing of the slender LCBC short columns, finite element analysis (FEA) software ABAQUS is applied to model the composite columns and predict their behavior. A buckling analysis using static Riks method is carried out to determine the LBCBâ€™s response to axial compressive loading. A model is calibrated using test results with various imperfections, accounting for the variable behavior of each bamboo specimen, to accurately predict the behavior of LCBC columns with different resin contents. Slender LCBC columns showed maximum stress at buckling up to 60 MPa, highlighting the potential of bio-based resins for structural applications. The study found that the samples with bio-epoxy resin (BE2) exhibited enhanced material stiffness when compared to with synthetic epoxy (EPX) and furan-based resin (PF1), while PF1 specimens demonstrated increased ductility. The BE2 samples showed strain hardening in their stress-strain behavior, and the PF1 samples exhibited a long plateau phase before reaching the maximum load. Among the specimens with Moso bamboo and BE2 resin, those with SCR and HAW configurations achieved the highest compressive strengths.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9790b5bf6a55f77ae9d0da350c57944f5be0fd3ef077efcb0b1cd604d3b425e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
