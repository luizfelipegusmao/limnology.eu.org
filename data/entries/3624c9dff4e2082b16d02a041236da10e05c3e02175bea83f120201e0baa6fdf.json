{"title":"A potyvirus provides an efficient viral vector for gene expression and functional studies in Asteraceae plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/842/7698907?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant virus-derived vectors are rapid and cost-effective for protein expression and gene functional studies in plants, particularly for species that are difficult to genetically transform. However, few efficient viral vectors are available for functional studies in Asteraceae plants. Here, we identified a potyvirus named zinnia mild mottle virus (ZiMMV) from common zinnia (<span>Zinnia elegans</span> Jacq.) through next-generation sequencing. Using a yeast homologous recombination strategy, we established a full-length infectious cDNA clone of ZiMMV under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Furthermore, we developed an efficient expression vector based on ZiMMV for the persistent and abundant expression of foreign proteins in the leaf, stem, root, and flower tissues with mild symptoms during viral infection in common zinnia. We showed that the ZiMMV-based vector can express <span>ZeMYB9</span>, which encodes a transcript factor inducing dark red speckles in leaves and flowers. Additionally, the expression of a gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis gene from the ZiMMV vector substantially accelerated plant height growth, offering a rapid and cost-effective method. In summary, our work provides a powerful tool for gene expression, functional studies, and genetic improvement of horticultural traits in Asteraceae plant hosts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3624c9dff4e2082b16d02a041236da10e05c3e02175bea83f120201e0baa6fdf","category":"Environment"}
