{"title":"Secure by Design Real-Time IoMT Architecture for e-Health Population Monitoring (RTPM)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0403/v1","date":1718015266000,"content":"The healthcare sector has undergone a profound transformation, owing to the influential role played by IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) technology. However, there are substantial concerns over these devices' security and privacy-preserving nature. Current literature on IoMT tends to focus on specific security features like data confidentiality or data integrity or data availability or access control and most solutions are simulated and not tested in a real-world live network. This paper proposes a smart secure by design solution that safeguards user’s data during health and wellbeing monitoring of patients locally (home, care-home, and hospital) and remotely. The proposed innovative solution is known as Secure by Design Real Time IoMT Architecture for e-Health Population Monitoring (RTPM) for smart hospitals and any healthcare monitoring management. In this system, keys can also be generated by the patient monitoring system independent to maintain high privacy standard and trust during the monitoring process and to enable the IoMT devices run independently even if the server is compromised and are made safe from external exploits to the client nodes. However, the session keys are controlled by the trusted IoMT server to lighten the IoMT devices overheads and the session keys are securely exchanged between the client system and the monitoring server. The proposed RTPM focuses on addressing the major security requirements for an IoMT system: confidentiality, integrity, availability, conducts authentication, protect from DoS attacks and prevent from non-repudiation attack of patient medical data and the devices in a real time, sensory data communication environment for live e-health monitoring. A secure communication is tested by capturing the live network traffic and the system’s performance analysis of RTPM using different security algorithms with different key sizes of RSA, AES, and SHA shows that resource constraint low powered system can also successfully integrate with high-end state-of-the-art secure parameters and features and have the potential to support real time secure interaction. A stress test is also conducted to ensure that the system can withstand huge key sizes and different data types including multi-media information.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3aa74d16f1ab00b8c3a0e2cb69a02a7ef5351fcb2988b83bc4bf135981bfd3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
