The chemical diversity of plant cells has developed and been maintained through evolution and metabolic regulation, and plays a crucial role in plant physiology, development, and adaption to changing environmental situations. Metabolomics, when combined with genomics and proteomics, has opened up unprecedented opportunities to address the biological importance of metabolic diversity. It has also provided an avenue for metabolic engineering to produce a particular compound of interest to meet societal and economical demands, an important effort to achieve sustainable development. This Special Issue therefore focuses on current trends in plant metabolomics research, providing examples in the development of analytical technologies, the functional study of plant metabolism, and applications to synthetic and engineering biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"95c8be2c7f0d06b29f692083320ee48a43525cf95205f0eb2ecf27aedf94f2e5","category":"Environment"}
