A reliable track pump is a vital pre-ride tool that ensures optimal tyre pressure, reducing rolling resistance and enhancing ride performance. Not only that, riding at the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\" target=\"_blank\"> right pressure</a> for your bike and weight will make your ride far more comfortable and efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best track pumps will offer a blend of durability, accuracy and user-friendly features. A classic track pump will have a sturdy base and ergonomic handle, with efficient air pressure barrel for quickly re-inflating tyres. Unlike<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-mini-pump\" target=\"_blank\"> mini bike pumps</a> where you’re pumping blind, track pumps allow you to inflate a tyre to an exact pressure thanks to the inclusion of a gauge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this comprehensive guide, we will evaluate the top track pump contenders, assessing their pumping efficiency, build quality, ergonomic design and compatibility with various valve types. Each pump will be tested on its performance inflating a 28mm<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\" target=\"_blank\"> road bike tyre</a> to 90psi and 40mm<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\"> gravel bike tyre</a> to 45psi. To fairly compare each pump, their accuracy will be tested against a benchmark Truflo gauge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jump straight to the pumps <a href=\"#trackpumps\">here</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\">Bike tyre pressure guide: How to choose the best pressure</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-mini-pump\">Best mini pumps 2023 reviewed and rated</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-science-what-pressure-are-my-tyres-really-at\">Cycling science: What pressure are my tyres really at?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>What features should you look for in a track pump?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Topeak Joeblow Sport III track pump\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/topeak-joeblow-sport-III-review-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A stable base is essential for track pumps. A wide and sturdy base prevents tipping and provides better stability while pumping. Some pumps will have anti-slip materials on the underside of the base to provide extra grip on various surfaces. If you tend to step on the base for purchase as you pump, consider also whether the placement of the gauge and hose will inhibit this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ergonomics</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Silca Terra track pump\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/silca-terra-review-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially if you’re pumping multiple tyres at a time, you’re going to want a pump that’s easy and comfortable to use. An ergonomically shaped handle that doesn’t dig in will reduce strain on your hands. A stable base and reasonable height will allow for a balanced stance and better power transfer each pump, while a functional pump head and good valve connection will translate to a quicker, more efficient inflation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pressure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A track pump will normally have a gauge that measures pressure in psi and bar. Psi is the imperial unit of measure for pressure and refers to pounds per square inch, while bar is the metric unit of measure for pressure. One bar is slightly less than the current atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most pumps are designed to handle pressures far higher than are suitable/recommended for road and gravel bikes, tending to top out around 160psi. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gauge accuracy and readability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Birzman The Pump with Helix track pump\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/birzman-the-pump-with-helix-review-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The gauge on a track pump is a round dial or digital readout that typically measures pressure in both psi and bar. Above all, a gauge should be accurate and easy to read. Some gauges will have a moveable dial that you can swivel to point at your desired pressure, making it easier to pump to a precise pressure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gauge attaches to the barrel of the pump, either at the bottom, middle or top. Those higher up are easier to see but generally smaller, while those located at the foot of the pump are potentially more exposed to being stepped on, but can be larger in size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pump head or chuck</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-970x659.jpg\" alt=\"Lezyne Classic Floor Drive track pump\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-970x659.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-300x204.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-768x521.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-1536x1043.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-750x509.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5-1140x774.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/lezyne-classic-floor-drive-review-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The head of the pump hose has a mechanism called a chuck, which is the part that attaches to the tyre valve, forming an airtight seal. This part of the pump is crucial as only once it’s airtight will you be able to pump air efficiently into your tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A chuck will either be screw-on, also known as threaded, or have a locking lever. A screw-on chuck can be more fiddly as you must line up the thread to secure it, while a lever is typically much quicker and easier to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most pump heads will also be compatible with different valves. Some locking lever pumps will have a dual head for different valves, others are screw-on as mentioned, and some have small bungs that can be taken out and flipped around to pump a different valve type. The latter can prove to be a bit of a pain if you often need to switch between pumping different valve types.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Valve types: Presta vs Schrader</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"valves\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/02171958/valves.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main valve types used on bicycles: Presta and Schrader. Road and gravel bike tyres and their inner tubes almost exclusively use Presta valves. They’re slender with a threaded exterior and require a smaller valve hole. Meanwhile, Schrader valves are more commonly seen on off-road bikes. These are similar to those used in car tyres, being wider and shorter with a spring-loaded pin for inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also hear mention of Dunlop valves. These are much less common than the above-mentioned two, but you may see them on some commuter bikes. Dunlop has a similar profile to Schrader, but you should still be able to pump them with a Presta valve adapter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some pumps will also have a pressure release valve. This is normally a tiny button that lets out increments of air so that you can really fine-tune your tyre pressure, without having to detach your pump and recommencing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Size and weight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best size and weight for a track pump will vary depending on the user’s height and needs. For general usability, an ideal size ranges between 600mm to 800mm in height. This ensures comfortable pumping without causing strain. As for weight, a reasonable range lies between 1.5kg to 2.5kg, striking a balance between portability and stability. Lightweight pumps are more portable, while slightly heavier ones generally offer better stability during inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Serviceability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The serviceability of a track pump is a key consideration for its longevity. Good quality pumps are designed with easily replaceable parts, making them simple and affordable to maintain. Others may come with a servicing kit and care instructions for the pump. It’s also worth considering whether a pump brand offers customer support and a repair service.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tubeless features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you often ride tubeless, then you’ll want a track pump that facilitates easy tubeless tyre installation. Larger than your average pump, tubeless-compatible pumps are equipped with an air chamber that can store larger volumes of air for rapid bead seating. Some will have an integrated pressure tank, which allows for a continuous flow of air during inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Six of the best track pumps on the market</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Birzman The Pump with Helix: RRP £89.99 – <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evanscycles.com%2Fbrand%2Fbirzman%2Fthe-pump-w%2F-helix-presta%2Fsch%2Fdun-839510\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Evans Cycles for £89.99</a></strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lezyne Classic Floor Drive: RRP £75 – <a href=\"https://fave.co/3FZ1ZPC\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Swinnerton Cycles for £63.75</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>LifeLine Essential Track Pump: RRP £17.99 – <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/49BDAgv\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Chain Reaction Cycles for £12.49</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Silca Terra Floor Pump: RRP £180 – <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/49Odszl\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Wiggle for £149</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Topeak JoeBlow Sport III: RRP £46.99 – <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3SDrvBq\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Cyclestore for £43.19</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Truflo Supertrax: RRP £49.99 – <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/47ybyAy\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Cyclestore for £39.99</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep reading for full track pump reviews and detailed buying advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test and why you should trust us</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-970x546.png\" alt=\"how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-970x546.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-300x169.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-768x432.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-750x422.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot-1140x641.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/07102512/how_to_repair_a_tubeless_tyre_with_a_plug_pro_tips_for_fast_and_mess-free_repairs_on_the_go_2-41_screenshot.png 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at <em>Cyclist</em>, we eat, live and breathe cycling.
