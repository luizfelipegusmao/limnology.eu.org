{"title":"An miR164-resistant mutation in the transcription factor gene CpCUC2B enhances carpel arrest and ectopic boundary specification in Cucurbita pepo flower development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1948/7464041?rss=1","date":1701993600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The sex determination process in cucurbits involves the control of stamen or carpel development during the specification of male or female flowers from a bisexual floral meristem, a function coordinated by ethylene. A gain-of-function mutation in the <span>miR164</span>-binding site of <span>CpCUC2B</span>, ortholog of the Arabidopsis transcription factor gene <span>CUC2</span>, not only produced ectopic floral meristems and organs, but also suppressed the development of carpels and promoted the development of stamens. The <span>cuc2b</span> mutation induced the transcription of <span>CpCUC2B</span> in the apical shoots of plants after female flowering but repressed other <span>CUC</span> genes regulated by <span>miR164</span>, suggesting a conserved functional redundancy of these genes in the development of squash flowers. The synergistic androecious phenotype of the double mutant between <span>cuc2b</span> and <span>etr2b</span>, an ethylene-insensitive mutation that enhances the production of male flowers, demonstrated that <span>CpCUC2B</span> arrests the development of carpels independently of ethylene and <span>CpWIP1B</span>. The transcriptional regulation of <span>CpCUC1</span>, <span>CpCUC2</span>, and ethylene genes in <span>cuc2b</span> and ethylene mutants also confirms this conclusion. However, the epistasis of <span>cuc2b</span> over <span>aco1a</span>, a mutation that suppresses stamen arrest in female flowers, and the down-regulation of <span>CpACS27A</span> in <span>cuc2b</span> female apical shoots, indicated that <span>CpCUC2B</span> promotes stamen development by suppressing the late ethylene production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"f740e3c2e11ef72dd9da5e4a5219ee0ed1beeb192b84c63f57fd8604bc9f2852","category":"Environment"}
