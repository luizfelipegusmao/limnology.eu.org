This approach addresses the challenge of finding all possible solutions for such equations, which often lack uniqueness. The proposed method utilizes physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate generalized solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7275f421426fd11b7f41ce16ae1e6764a17fb3131365d2a08d5cdb00a56f589f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
