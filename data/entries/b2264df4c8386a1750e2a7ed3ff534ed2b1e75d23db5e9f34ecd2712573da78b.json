{"title":"Assessment of the Correlation between Unipolar and Bipolar Depression, Calcium Levels, Thyroid Function, and Inflammatory Markers: A Pilot Prospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0521/v1","date":1725613131000,"content":"Recent mental health research has highlighted inflammation's critical role in conditions like depression and bipolar disorder, examining correlations with markers such as calcium levels, thyroid function, and inflammatory markers. The study aims to compare unipolar and bipolar d depression samples in terms of socio-demographic and clinical features. Prospective enrollment of patients hospitalized at the University of Insubria Psychiatric Unit. Patients were administered psychometric questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory-II, Mental Pain Questionnaire, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale, and Reasons for Living Inventory). Thirty-six patients (17 males, 19 females) were enrolled. A statistically significant association emerged between calcium levels and bipolar depression (Pearson Chi square=0.050) and between CRP and bipolar depression (Pearson Chi-square=0.017). Additionally, a statistically significant association was observed between the unipolar and bipolar depression subgroups and current substance abuse (p=0.0275) A statistically significant difference between the BRLF scores and UDD subgroup emerged (p=0.0126). The results of the pilot study revealed significant associations between calcium/CRP levels with depressive symptoms, particularly in bipolar depression. Further research on inflammatory markers is needed to refine diagnostic subtypes and therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2264df4c8386a1750e2a7ed3ff534ed2b1e75d23db5e9f34ecd2712573da78b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
