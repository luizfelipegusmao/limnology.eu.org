{"title":"Development of E-Tourism to Achieve Excellence and Sustainable Development in Tourism: Ha&rsquo;il Region Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1264/v1","date":1716192327000,"content":"E-tourism is one of the most important modern services to achieve the development of the tourism sector while relying on sophisticated communication technologies. Certainly, these innovations in the field of tourism have disrupted this sector with new and different dimensions of tourism development. This has led various regions and countries to accelerate the search for the tools that are necessary to achieve excellence and sustainable development in tourism. This research aims to study the development factors of e-tourism to achieve excellence and sustainable development in the tourism of the Ha’il region. Therefore, we applied two analyses: in the first one, we used a statistical analysis based on the survey sent to employees from tourism companies. The objective of this analysis is to determine the main factors of e-tourism to achieve excellence in tourism in the Ha’il region. The results of the statistical analysis have given us the following elements: There are only four main factors that allow authorities to achieve excellence in tourism in the Ha’il region, namely ST, CP, HRS, and SC factors. Then we proceed with a second analysis, to determine the main factors of excellence in tourism that drive the achievement of sustainable development in tourism in the Ha’il region. For this reason, we applied an artificial intelligence method based on the unsupervised machine learning technique. The results obtained from the machine learning technique show that five factors determine the excellence in tourism and reveal the sustainable development of Ha’il’s tourism. These factors are ST, CP, FP, HRS, and GC. Consequently, we consider that all the factors found in both analyses are important to realise excellence in tourism and sustainable development in tourism. However, to achieve sustainable development in tourism in Ha’il, Saudi authorities must develop the three common factors found in the two analyses, namely ST, CP, and HRS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2651d0f9ce8cc2f00ba7e16dba2f4be59715334eaab6bbdb1c9c3837ba4ba382","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
