{"title":"Quality of Life before &amp; after Genitourinary Fistula Repair &ndash; Insights from WHOQOL-BREF","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0167/v1","date":1725342897000,"content":"Objective \nWe aim to assess the quality of life for women with genitourinary fistulas before and after surgery, utilizing the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire to contrast the preoperative and postoperative results.\nMaterials and Methods:\nThis quasi-experimental study was conducted at the Department of Urology, SIUT, Karachi, Pakistan, from January to December 2023. We used the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire to assess the quality of life. Participants completed the questionnaire both before the surgical intervention and three months after successful fistula repair. The collected data were entered and analysed using IBM SPSS v26, with a significance level set at pâ‰¤ 0.05.\nResults \nThe participants had a mean age of 35.50 years, with a standard deviation of 8.87 years. Before undergoing genitourinary fistula repair, the average WHOQOL-BREF score was 12.17 with a standard deviation of 5.77. Following the repair, the mean score showed a significant improvement, rising to 96.67 with a standard deviation of 11.86. This marked improvement was statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0001.\nConclusion \nThis study concludes that genitourinary fistula repair at our tertiary care hospital significantly and positively impacts patients' quality of life. The findings emphasize the critical role of timely and appropriate surgical intervention in improving overall well-being. Continued comprehensive care and support are vital for these patients' holistic recovery and long-term health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d58a1fe5bd67dab09b65f76eabf6bf7debabf07d2064b6de1228d32f49743fc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
