{"title":"New Geological and Ecological Insights on the Lake Faro Global Geosite Within the Messina Strait Framework (Italy)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0459/v1","date":1728294720000,"content":"The Lake Faro brackish basin (Sicily, Italy) was established Global Geosite as key locality of tectonic coastal lakes, but few were the research devoted this rare geological and ecological framework. To fill this gap, the main stratigraphical, sedimentological, ecological, morpho-bathymetric, and structural features were reported here first, linking geodiversity with biodiversity. In Lake Faro a shallow platform develops alongside a deep funnel–like shaped basin, reaching a maximum depth of 29 m. A NNW-SSE trending steep cliff, representing the abrupt transition from the platform to the basin, was interpreted as a dextral transtensive fault (Faro Lake Fault), presumably active since the late Pleistocene. The switches of the steep cliff NW-wards, acquiring a E-W trend, was interpreted as due to the occurrence of the Mortelle normal Fault, cut by the Faro Lake Fault. Abiotic bottom deposits consisted of coarse- to fine-grained quartzo–lithic rich sediments deriving from high grade metamorphic and igneous rocks, whereas the biotic component mainly consisted of bioclasts de-riving from clam farming actives for some centuries since today. The Quaternary shallow platform, from top to base includes: i) soft cover composed of coarse abiotic and prevalent biotic deposits; ii) hard conglomerates cemented by carbonates; iii) siliciclastic coarse deposits of the Messina Fm. In the deep basin, siliciclastic silty loams with minor amounts of biotic coarse deposits prevailed in the soft cover. The lake, exploited since the prehistoric age because of its high biodiversity and productivity, maintains some evidence of millennial relationships with the resident human cul-tures, there attracted by the favorable geomorphological and ecological peculiarities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01394c7dc4bec4359da8f62b118e26596e4708e96c9d6fa77071ca74d6db2631","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
