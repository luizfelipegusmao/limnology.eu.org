{"title":"Socio-Demographic Determinants and Psychosocial Factors Influencing Mobility Limitations in Aging: Insights from a National Health Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1661/v1","date":1716790543000,"content":"This study utilizes data from the fourth National Health Survey conducted in 2019. in the Republic of Serbia, aiming to contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the mobility of the elderly population. It examines the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with functional limitations in older adults. By analyzing variables such as age, gender, marital status, education, income, social support, and mental health, the study seeks to explain their impact on the prevalence of walking limitations.Questionnaires were employed as a research instrument in line with the methodology of the European Health Survey (EHIS). The analysis is based on a sample of 3,705 participants aged 65 and above. Statistical significance between variables was assessed using the Chi-square test. Post-hoc comparisons were performed using pairwise z-tests. Univariate logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of walking difficulties. Additionally, multivariable logistic regression was conducted to further explore predictors while adjusting for potential confounding variables, with odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals estimated.Women exhibit significantly higher prevalence of walking difficulties compared to men (p &lt; 0.001). There is a significant variation in the prevalence of walking difficulties among different age groups. Individuals aged 75-84 show the highest prevalence in all categories of walking difficulties, with particular significance in the categories of \"no difficulty,\" \"some difficulty,\" and \"unable to walk at all\" (p &lt; 0.001). Higher levels of education generally correlate with lower prevalence of walking difficulties. Married or partnered individuals have 0.522 times lower odds of reporting difficulties in walking compared to singles (p &lt; 0.05). Individuals with lower wealth index (1-Least affluent) have significantly higher prevalence of walking difficulties.This knowledge can inform targeted interventions to enhance mobility and improve the overall well-being of older individuals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9206fd1344b8630a451d5ae8804a6dc8a96bc8ee5dfc4f26ba57be1c1e3629e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
