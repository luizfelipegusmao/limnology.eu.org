This work aims at assessing the effectiveness of PINNs to solve a set of partial differential equations for which this method has never been considered, namely the augmented shallow water equations (SWEs) with topography. Differently from traditional SWEs, the bed elevation is considered as an additional conserved variable, and therefore one more equation expressing the fixed-bed condition is included in the system. This approach allows the PINN model to leverage automatic differentiation to compute the bed slopes by learning the topographical information during training. PINNs are here tested for different one-dimensional cases with non-flat topography, and results are compared with analytical solutions. Though some limitations can be highlighted, PINNs show a good accuracy for the depth and velocity predictions even in the presence of non-horizontal bottom. The solution of the augmented system of SWEs can therefore be regarded as a suitable alternative strategy to deal with flows over complex topography using PINNs, also in view of future extensions to realistic problems.</p>","author":"Susanna Dazzi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"6d3f5f3f40c94cb482d6ad46f4dc73a872a2020547db1a6dcc6063356d8e4c45","category":"Environment"}
