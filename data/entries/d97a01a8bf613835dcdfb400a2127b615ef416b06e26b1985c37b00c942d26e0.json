{"title":"Landscape, Environmental, and Socioeconomic Impacts of an Invasive Bird Species: The Yellow-Legged Gull (Larus michahellis) in the Natural Park Salinas De San Pedro Del Pinatar (Murcia, Southeastern Spain)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1060/v1","date":1715822855000,"content":"Larus michahellis increased its population throughout the 20th century in its worldwide distribution area. The increase in the Salinas de San Pedro del Pinatar has produced changes in the habitats due to the contribution of guano, predation on birds, incidents with workers, and the production of salt. The objective is to analyze the impacts of L. michahellis on the landscape, habitats, waterfowl, salt production, and workers, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of control activities. Censuses of wintering L. michahellis have been carried out between 1990-2021, of nesting aquatic birds between 1994-2021, and nests and eggs of L. michahellis have been eliminated between 2000-2021. The result has been a decrease in pairs of L. michahellis, recovery of waterfowl populations, colonization of others, absence of incidents with workers, and reduction of damage to salt production. However, to reach a definitive solution, measures should be adopted to prevent L. michahellis from accessing the main sources of human food: urban solid waste dumps, aquaculture farms, and fish discards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d97a01a8bf613835dcdfb400a2127b615ef416b06e26b1985c37b00c942d26e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
