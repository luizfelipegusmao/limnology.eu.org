In the North Sea, &gt;€90 billion will be needed for decommissioning by 2060. However, the influence of O&amp;G platforms on fish communities is poorly understood. This challenges predictions of possible fisheries scenarios associated with different decommissioning options. Here, we examined the role that North Sea platforms played on fish communities. We explored patterns of fish abundance and body size variation along transects from O&amp;G platforms comparing catch per unit effort data. Fish abundance was positively associated with O&amp;G platforms. Atlantic cod, plaice, saithe, and mackerel were most abundant near platforms. Similarly, larger Atlantic cod were near the O&amp;G platforms. Our study provided information for decision-making regarding platform decommissioning scenarios by evidencing O&amp;G platform habitat provisioning for various commercial fish species.</p>","author":"Bruno Ibanez‐Erquiaga, \nHenrik Baktoft, \nTim Wilms, \nTobias Karl Mildenberger, \nJon Christian Svendsen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"5c5b7d3b271bf6a7ec73e62ba5064d7527f84411f90279c9002511f19805b642","category":"Environment"}
