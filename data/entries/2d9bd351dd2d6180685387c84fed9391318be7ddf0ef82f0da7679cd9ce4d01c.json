{"title":"Implementation of the mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Technology in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1187/v1","date":1718691453000,"content":"Background: The study was conducted to investigate if the mRNA vaccine technology could be adapted for the ectothermic vertebrate Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology has been developed and optimized for mRNA vaccines in mammals, stabilizing mRNA and facilitating delivery into cells. However, its utility at the temperature and specific biological environment in ectotherms remains unclear. In addition, it is unknown if modified mRNA containing non-canonical nucleotides can correctly translate in salmonid cells. Methods: We used an mRNA transcript coding for enhanced green fluorescence protein, flanked by the untranslated regions of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene of infectious salmon anemia virus, and a 120-base-long poly(A) tail. The mRNA was generated by in vitro transcription where uridine residues were replaced with N1-methyl-pseudouridines, and then encapsulated in LNPs. Results: When transfected into the salmonid cell line CHH-1, the mRNA-LNP construct induced expression of EGFP. Furthermore, when mRNA-LNPs were injected intramuscularly into salmon, in vivo protein expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. EGFP was observed in cells infiltrating the space between the muscle cells in a focal inflammatory response. Conclusion: The results indicate that the N1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encapsulated in LNPs can be used to express antigens of interest in salmonid fish.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d9bd351dd2d6180685387c84fed9391318be7ddf0ef82f0da7679cd9ce4d01c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
