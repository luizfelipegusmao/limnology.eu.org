{"title":"Probabilistic Forecast of Multiphase Transport Under Viscous and Buoyancy Forces in Heterogeneous Porous Media","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034449?af=R","date":1709194745000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We develop a probabilistic approach to map parametric uncertainty to output state uncertainty in first-order hyperbolic conservation laws. We analyze this problem for nonlinear immiscible two-phase transport in heterogeneous porous media in the presence of a stochastic velocity field. The uncertainty in the velocity field can arise from incomplete descriptions of either porosity field, injection flux, or both. This uncertainty leads to spatiotemporal uncertainty in the saturation field. Given information about spatial/temporal statistics of spatially correlated heterogeneity, we leverage the method of distributions to derive deterministic equations that govern the evolution of pointwise cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of saturation for a vertical reservoir, while handling the manipulation of multiple shocks arising due to buoyancy forces. Unlike the Buckley-Leverett equation, the equation describing the fine-grained CDF is linear in space and time. Ensemble averaging of the fine-grained CDF results in the CDF of saturation. Thus, we give routes to circumventing the computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations (MCS), while obtaining a pointwise description of the saturation field. We conduct a set of numerical experiments for one-dimensional transport, and compare the obtained saturation CDFs, against those obtained using MCS as our reference solution, and the statistical moment equation method. This comparison demonstrates that the CDF equations remain accurate over a wide range of statistical properties, that is, standard deviation and correlation length of the underlying random fields, whereas the corresponding low-order statistical moment equations significantly deviate from the MCS results, except for very small values of standard deviation and correlation length.</p>","author":"Farzaneh Rajabi, \nHamdi A.
