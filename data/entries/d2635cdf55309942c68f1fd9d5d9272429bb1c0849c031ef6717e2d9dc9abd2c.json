{"title":"Dynamics of hemoglobins during nodule development, nitrate response, and dark stress in Lotus japonicus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1547/7425531?rss=1","date":1700179200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Legume nodules express multiple leghemoglobins (Lbs) and non-symbiotic hemoglobins (Glbs), but how they are regulated is unclear. Here, we study the regulation of all Lbs and Glbs of <span>Lotus japonicus</span> in different physiologically relevant conditions and mutant backgrounds. We quantified hemoglobin expression, localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in nodules, and deployed mutants deficient in Lbs and in the transcription factors NLP4 (associated with nitrate sensitivity) and NAC094 (associated with senescence). Expression of Lbs and class 2 Glbs was suppressed by nitrate, whereas expression of class 1 and 3 Glbs was positively correlated with external nitrate concentrations. Nitrate-responsive elements were found in the promoters of several hemoglobin genes. Mutant nodules without Lbs showed accumulation of ROS and NO and alterations of antioxidants and senescence markers. NO accumulation occurred by a nitrate-independent pathway, probably due to the virtual disappearance of Glb1-1 and the deficiency of Lbs. We conclude that hemoglobins are regulated in a gene-specific manner during nodule development and in response to nitrate and dark stress. Mutant analyses reveal that nodules lacking Lbs experience nitro-oxidative stress and that there is compensation of expression between Lb1 and Lb2. They also show modulation of hemoglobin expression by NLP4 and NAC094.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"d2635cdf55309942c68f1fd9d5d9272429bb1c0849c031ef6717e2d9dc9abd2c","category":"Environment"}
