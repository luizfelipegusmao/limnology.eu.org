{"title":"Optimizing Solar Potential Analysis in Cuba: A Methodology for High-Resolution Regional Mapping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1615/v1","date":1724299240000,"content":"The development of solar energy on a regional scale necessitates a thorough understanding of available resources. Cuba, facing prolonged economic, environmental, and energy crises, urgently needs to enhance its sustainability through solar energy. While solar resource mapping is widespread, Cuba lacks extensive field measurements, often relying on models that may not be ideally suited for large regions like Matanzas province. Spanning over 12,000 kmÂ² with nearly 150 km between its northern and southern extremes, Matanzas presents challenges for high-resolution solar mapping. This study introduces a methodology that integrates various methods and databases to achieve maximum resolution in the resulting solar map. The approach is designed for large areas where conventional high-resolution models fall short. By optimizing calculation times and parameterizing the entire surface latitudinally, a high-resolution solar resource map for Matanzas has been developed. This map significantly enhances the understanding of solar resources in Cuba and proposes new methodologies for analyzing solar potential in similarly large regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c21c15c8c35eb6f21d1338a8933d606ce0cfa48a1c9b74461d63cdb320bb1b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
