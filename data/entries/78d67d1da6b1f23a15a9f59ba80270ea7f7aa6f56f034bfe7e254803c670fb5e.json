Maponga</p>\r\n\r\nProcurement and supply chain management [PSM] systems remain a critical pillar for the implementation of Directly Observed Therapy [DOTS] for tuberculosis [TB] and achievement of disease related aspirations such as ‘ending TB by 2030’. We conducted a scoping review of literature using the Arksey and O’Malley [2005] framework to summarize and disseminate the results of available evidence in relation to TB commodities supply chain performance in the WHO African Region. We searched three electronic databases complemented by google search using relevant terms and identified 1,586 sources. Twenty-five studies published between 2009 and 2023 met the eligibility criteria, inclusive of 21 peer reviewed publications and four reports. The strengths we found included the existence of pooled procurement mechanisms [PPM], availability of funding through external sources, existence of logistics management information systems [LMIS] and integration of PSM systems into primary health care. The main challenge was frequent stock outs which mainly affected medicines for treating TB in children and those for preventing TB. Stock outs were found to follow a poverty gradient and pervasively inequitable since they disproportionately affected structurally disadvantaged populations and communities. Countries that rely on domestic mechanisms for procurement tend to be more vulnerable to stock outs due to inadequate and unpredictable financing, delayed disbursements of funds, longer procurement lead times and poor supplier management. We concluded that stock outs remain one of the foremost challenges to ending TB by 2030. We recommend leveraging existing performance-enhancing platforms such as PPMs, including utilization of such mechanisms by countries that utilize domestic resources to procure commodities. We recommend the design of people centric supply chains that are sensitive to the differentiated needs of the population to ensure that composite improvements in PSM performance do not mask underlying disparities. Context-relevant research is needed to inform future strategies for improving PSM performance.","author":"Alison T.
