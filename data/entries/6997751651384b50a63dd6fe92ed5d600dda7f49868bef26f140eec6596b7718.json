{"title":"A Streaming Algorithm for a Fast, Robust, and Memoryless Median Estimation on Sensor Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1859/v1","date":1714379090000,"content":"We propose a novel moving median estimator specifically designed for online detection of threshold crossings in multi-channel signals, such as extracellular neural recordings. This estimator offers two key advantages: a reduced sensitivity to outliers and the elimination of memory requirements for storing arrival times. Furthermore, its design facilitates parallel implementation on FPGAs, making it ideal for real-time processing of multi-channel recordings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6997751651384b50a63dd6fe92ed5d600dda7f49868bef26f140eec6596b7718","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
