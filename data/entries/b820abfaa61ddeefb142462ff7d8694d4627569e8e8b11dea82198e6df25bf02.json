{"title":"Multiplex PCR assay for the accurate and rapid detection and differentiation of Lactococcus garvieae and L. petauri","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14004?af=R","date":1728927761000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lactococcosis is a common bacterial fish disease caused by <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>L. petauri and L. formosensis</i>. Although there are different PCR-based techniques to identify the etiological agent, none of these can differentiate these two bacteria without sequencing PCR-amplified fragments. In the present study, we developed a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of <i>L. garvieae</i> and <i>L. petauri</i>. The specificity of the primers was validated against the bacterial DNA of the targeted and non-targeted bacteria. The sizes of the PCR amplicons were obtained as 204 bp for the DUF1430 domain-containing protein gene of <i>L. garvieae</i>, 465 bp for the Lichenan permease IIC component gene of <i>L. petauri</i>, and 302 bp for the teichoic acid biosynthesis protein F gene of both <i>L. garvieae</i> and <i>L. petauri</i>. The PCR amplicons were clearly separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The multiplex PCR assay did not produce any amplification products with the DNA of the non-targeted bacteria. The multiplex PCR detection limits for <i>L. garvieae</i> and <i>L. petauri</i> were 5 and 4 CFU in pure culture and 50 and 40 CFU/g in spiked tissue samples, respectively. It takes less than 2 h from plate-cultured bacteria and 3 h from tissue samples to get results. In conclusion, the developed multiplex PCR assay is a rapid, specific, accurate, and cost-effective method for the detection and differentiation of <i>L. garvieae</i> and <i>L. petauri</i> and is suitable to be used for routine laboratory diagnosis of <i>L. garvieae</i> and <i>L. petauri</i>.</p>","author":"Dilek Ustaoglu, \nRafet Çağrı Öztürk, \nMustafa Ture, \nSilvia Colussi, \nPaolo Pastorino, \nAna Isabel Vela, \nCharalampos Kotzamanidis, \nDonatella Volpatti, \nPier Luigi Acutis, \nIlhan Altinok","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"b820abfaa61ddeefb142462ff7d8694d4627569e8e8b11dea82198e6df25bf02","category":"Environment"}
