{"title":"Nano-Enhanced High-Efficiency Microstrip Patch Antenna for 6G THz Applications Using Graphene (2D) Conductors and Hexagonal Boron Nitride Dielectrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0849/v1","date":1723499887000,"content":"The need for integrated high-frequency systems has increased significantly, leading to the development of efficient antennas operating in the 0.1-10 terahertz (THz) range. Using graphene as the conducting 2D material and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as the dielectric substrate, this research effort examines the design and performance evaluation of a THz band antenna functioning on supporting nanotechnology. The researchers contrasted the systemâ€™s performance with the 6G wireless network requirements after analyzing the antenna performance, radiation patterns, and impedance matching. According to this research, graphene, along with hBN can enhance antenna performance overall in the THz band and open pathways for advanced communication. The application of the designed antenna in a 6G wireless network will be tested through um MIMO configuration to achieve a higher data rate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b70ae711e448e37c1f1f22b0072c5d8f1a078180e3f1124d76b80b88071e9af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
