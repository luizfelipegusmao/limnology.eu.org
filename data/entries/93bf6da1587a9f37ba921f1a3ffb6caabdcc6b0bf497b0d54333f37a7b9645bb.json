{"title":"Conserved Biological Processes in Partial Cellular Reprogramming: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0122/v1","date":1727863169000,"content":"Partial or transient cellular reprogramming is defined by the limited induction of pluripotency factors without fully de-differentiating cells into a pluripotent state. Comparing in vitro and in vivo mouse studies, and in vitro studies in humans, supported by visualizations of the interconnections among the data, we show consistent patterns in how such reprogramming modulates key biological processes. Generally, it leads to enhanced chromatin accessibility, upregulation of chromatin modifiers, and improved mitochondrial activity. These changes are accompanied by shifts in stress response programs, such as inflammation, autophagy, and cellular senescence, as well as dysregulation of extracellular matrix pathways.  We also underscore the challenges in evaluating complex processes like aging and cellular senescence, given the variability in biomarkers used across studies. Overall, we highlight biological processes consistently influenced by reprogramming while noting that some effects are context-dependent, varying according to cell type, species, sex, and the reprogramming method employed. These insights inform future research and therapeutic applications in aging and regenerative medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93bf6da1587a9f37ba921f1a3ffb6caabdcc6b0bf497b0d54333f37a7b9645bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
