{"title":"Exposure to second-hand smoke and risk of lung cancer among Iranian population: A multicenter case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306517","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Fereshte Lotfi, Hamideh Rashidian, Maryam Hadji, Elham Mohebbi, Maryam Marzban, Ahmad Naghibzadeh-Tahami, Eero Pukkala, Paolo Boffetta, Arash Etemadi, Kazem Zendehdel</p>\r\nObjective <p>Despite the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) program in Iran, the regulation of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure—an often-overlooked hazard—, still requires improvement. We employed a multi-center case-control study to investigate the association between exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) from various tobacco products (cigarettes, water-pipes, pipes, and chopogh), opium use, and the risk of lung cancer.</p> Method <p>We included 627 lung cancer cases and 3477 controls. Exposure to SHS tobacco and SHS opium was collected through a questionnaire. We used mixed-model logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).</p> Result <p>Among the overall population exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHTS), the odds ratio (OR) compared to those never exposed was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08–1.71). Never smokers who were ever exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHTS) had 1.69-fold risk of lung cancer compared to those who were never exposed (95% CI: 1.13–2.52). Exposure to SHTS between 2–3 per day (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.13–4.53) and more than three hours per day (OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.20–4.37) can increase the risk of lung cancer compared with the no exposure group (P-trend &lt;0.01). We did not observe any association between exposure to second-hand opium smoke (SHOS) and the risk of lung cancer, either in the overall population or among never-smokers.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study estimates the impact of second-hand tobacco smoke (SHTS) on lung cancer risk in both the overall population and never-smokers. Additional studies are required to evaluate the association between exposure to second-hand smoke from opium and other type of tobacco, including water-pipe and the risk of lung cancer.</p>","author":"Fereshte Lotfi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b1d1c90e3699d16d02fd56b37d1c455e55c47e2d6e962b9e6a9ed48304410f32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
