{"title":"The Ripple Effect: Quality of Life and Mental Health of Parents of children with ADHD in Saudi Arabia a Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1543/v1","date":1711450362000,"content":"Introduction: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition in children in Saudi Arabia based on the results of the national mental health survey. ADHD significantly impacts the child and their family dynamics, particularly causing increased stress and diminished life quality for parents. In Saudi Arabia, there is a research gap regarding the quality of life and coping mechanisms of parents managing children with ADHD. This study assesses levels of depression and anxiety, quality of life, and coping strategies used by parents of children diagnosed with ADHD. \n\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with 151 parents of ADHD-diagnosed children, utilizing the WHOQOL-BREF for life quality, the brief-COPE for coping strategies, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ): depression (PHQ9-9 items) and generalized anxiety (GAD7-7 items) modules. \n\nResults: Among the parents surveyed, 36% reported moderate to severe depression, while 39.1% experienced moderate to high anxiety levels. Quality of life positively correlated significantly with higher household monthly income (HHI), employment status, sibling count, and effective coping strategies. Conversely, a parent's age, educational level, and particularly maternal status were inversely related to anxiety levels, with fathers displaying higher maladaptive coping scores.\n\nConclusion: The study sheds light on the considerable anxiety and depression experienced by parents of children with ADHD, significantly affecting their quality of life. Lower parents' quality of life is associated with high levels of depression, anxiety, and ineffective coping strategies. These insights highlight the critical need for interventions to aid parental mental health, thereby improving their overall quality of life amidst ADHD challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d3097741c0c4fbd93753bfd393469b85289119b06c259dff80001ebc054ab40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
