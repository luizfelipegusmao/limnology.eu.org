{"title":"Exploring the role of HPV - from Sexually Transmitted Infection to Oropharyngeal Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1092/v3","date":1719457315000,"content":"Human papillomavirus (HPV), a DNA virus, causes one the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI), spreading through direct sexual contact to the anogenital and oropharyngeal regions. Although most infected individuals may be asymptomatic and naturally undergo viral clearance, in some individuals HPV causes carcinogenesis of the infected epithelia. HPV now accounts for over 70% of oropharyngeal carcinomas (OPC). More than 90% of these OPC are associated with HPV 16, one of the 14 high-risk subtypes. In recent years, HPV positive (HPV+) OPC has been one of the most rapidly rising cancers, by new cancer incidence rates, especially among men. The HPV driven OPCs present some unique infection driven cellular and molecular features, constituting distinct preventive, therapeutic and prognostic strategies, in contrast to HPV negative (HPV-) OPC. In this manuscript, we drive through the role of HPV, from a sexually transmitted infection to malignancy transformation landscape, while parsing through the significant immune response environment. In this comprehensive review we collate key literature around transmission and epidemiology of HPV, while addressing the current state of clinical management, diagnosis, prevention and screening strategies, that can help shed light on this critical area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ec5d3261200710b6df3a9fe1a2116be7d26db289db0a44551af7eaf9a2ebe10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
