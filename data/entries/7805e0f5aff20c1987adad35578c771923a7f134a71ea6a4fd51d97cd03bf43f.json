This impacts microbial residues (i.e., amino sugars), a major component of soil organic carbon (SOC). Previous studies in forests have so far focused on the impact of understory N addition on microbes and microbial residues, but the effect of N deposition through plant canopy, the major pathway of N deposition in nature, has not been explicitly explored. In this study, we investigated whether and how the quantities (25 and 50 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>) and modes (canopy and understory) of N addition affect soil microbial residues in a temperate broadleaf forest under 10-year N additions. Our results showed that N addition enhanced the concentrations of soil amino sugars and microbial residual C (MRC) but not their relative contributions to SOC, and this effect on amino sugars and MRC was closely related to the quantities and modes of N addition. In the topsoil, high-N addition significantly increased the concentrations of amino sugars and MRC, regardless of the N addition mode. In the subsoil, only canopy N addition positively affected amino sugars and MRC, implying that the indirect pathway via plants plays a more important role. Neither canopy nor understory N addition significantly affected soil microbial biomass (as represented by phospholipid fatty acids), community composition and activity, suggesting that enhanced microbial residues under N deposition likely stem from increased microbial turnover. These findings indicate that understory N addition may underestimate the impact of N deposition on microbial residues and SOC, highlighting that the processes of canopy N uptake and plant-derived C availability to microbes should be taken into consideration when predicting the impact of N deposition on the C sequestration in temperate forests.</p>","author":"Yuanqi Chen, \nYu Zhang, \nXu Zhang, \nCarly Stevens, \nShenglei Fu, \nTeng Feng, \nXiaowei Li, \nQuan Chen, \nShirong Liu, \nShuijin Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"7805e0f5aff20c1987adad35578c771923a7f134a71ea6a4fd51d97cd03bf43f","category":"Environment"}
