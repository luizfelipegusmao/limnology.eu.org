{"title":"Harnessing Biopolymer Gels for Theranostic Applications: Imaging Agent Integration and Real-Time Monitoring of Drug Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2107/v2","date":1720520968000,"content":"Biopolymer gels have gained tremendous potential for therapeutic applications due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to adsorb and bind biological fluids, making them attractive for drug delivery and therapy. The versatility of biopolymer gels in theranostic backgrounds, with a focus on integrating imaging features and facilitating real-time monitoring of drug delivery. Different methods of delivery are explored imaging agents into biopolymer gels, including encapsulation, surface functionalization, nanoparticle encapsulation and layer-by-layer assembly techniques. Integration of Agents and Real-Time Monitoring Drug Delivery We summarize the synthesis methods, general properties, and mechanisms of biopolymer gels functionality, demonstrating their broad applications as multimodal systems for imaging-based therapeutics. These techniques not only enable multiple imaging but also provide signal enhancement and imaging a targeted facilitates, increasing the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. In addition, current techniques for incorporating imaging agents into biopolymer gels are discussed, and their role in precise drug delivery and monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48c44b9ded8821143385cd62dc6640aa91d4a825f6f866d588e71969153a000b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
