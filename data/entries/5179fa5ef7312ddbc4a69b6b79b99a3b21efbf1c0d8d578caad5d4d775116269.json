{"title":"Exploring Supplier Relationship Management in the Context of E-commerce","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0471/v1","date":1720099414000,"content":"This qualitative study explores the transformative role of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) in the context of e-commerce, focusing on the integration of digital technologies and evolving supplier interactions. As digital advancements such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) reshape traditional SRM practices, e-commerce companies are experiencing significant improvements in efficiency, transparency, and collaboration. This research employs semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and case studies to examine the impact of these technologies on SRM, identify key collaborative practices, and assess risk management strategies. Findings indicate that digital integration enhances decision-making, streamlines operations, and fosters deeper, trust-based supplier relationships. AI facilitates predictive analytics and automates processes, while blockchain provides transparency and reduces fraud. Data analytics supports informed sourcing decisions and risk mitigation, and cloud platforms improve real-time collaboration. IoT enhances supply chain visibility, allowing for better inventory management. Despite these benefits, challenges such as high implementation costs, integration difficulties, data privacy concerns, and security risks remain significant barriers. Collaboration practices, including joint development, shared resources, and coordinated marketing, contribute to innovation and mutual growth, emphasizing the need for effective communication and trust. Risk management strategies, such as scenario planning and supplier diversification, are crucial for maintaining supply chain resilience. Strategic alignment between e-commerce companies and suppliers, including goal congruence and capability matching, is essential for seamless coordination and competitive advantage. The study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to SRM, integrating technology, collaboration, risk management, and strategic alignment to navigate the complexities of supplier relationships in the digital age. These insights provide a framework for e-commerce companies to optimize their SRM practices and achieve sustainable growth in a dynamic marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5179fa5ef7312ddbc4a69b6b79b99a3b21efbf1c0d8d578caad5d4d775116269","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
