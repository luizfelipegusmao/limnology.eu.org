{"title":"Three DoF Cable Driven Parallel Manipulator with Self Sensing Nitinol Actuators","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2015/v1","date":1717050413000,"content":"This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel ma-nipulator equipped with self-sensing Ni-Ti (Nitinol) actuators. The manipulator's architecture and mechanical design are elucidated, emphasizing the integration of Nitinol actuators. The self-sensing technique implemented in a previous work was extended to a 20 mm actuator length, and the actuator was used to design the 3 DOF manipulator. Kinematic analyses were conducted to eval-uate the manipulator's performance under various operating conditions. A dynamic model was implemented for the dynamic dimensioning of the actuators, which work synergistically with a bias spring. The manipulator was realized, and a control strategy was implemented. Experimental tests, although documenting some positioning accuracy issues, show the efficacy and potential applica-tions of the proposed manipulator in robotics and automation systems, highlighting the advantages of self-sensing Nitinol actuators in small parallel manipulator designs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"083155629678373ae075f6625c8c0c841a411bfe9a4f8794d45ca7d1f38f75ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
