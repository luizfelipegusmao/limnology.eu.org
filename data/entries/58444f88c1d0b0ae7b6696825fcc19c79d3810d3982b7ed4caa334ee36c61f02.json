{"title":"Seasonal abundance, lipid storage, and energy density of Calanus finmarchicus and other copepod preyfields along the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/3/282/7664135?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Calanus finmarchicus</span> is an abundant calanoid copepod in the New York Bight (NYB) that has energy-dense lipid stores. This study measured <span>C. finmarchicus</span> abundance, lipid storage and energy density and compared it to two other abundant calanoid species in the region. We compared the NYB <span>C. finmarchicus</span> preyfield characteristics with data from two other NW Atlantic coastal ecosystems, the Gulf of Maine (GoM) and Cape Cod Bay (CCB). Copepods from net tows were identified, enumerated, photographed and measured. These data were used to calculate animal biovolume and lipid content as well as the volumetric energy density of the copepod preyfield. <span>C. finmarchicus</span> were most abundant in spring and summer and the mean lipid storage of <span>C. finmarchicus</span> remained largely constant regardless of season and location within the NYB. <span>Centropages typicus</span> were abundant enough in the winter to be more energy-rich than <span>C. finmarchicus. Temora longicornis,</span> while also abundant, never surpassed the energy density of <span>C. finmarchicus</span>. <span>C. finmarchicus</span> in the NYB were comparably lipid-rich to those from the GoM and CCB. <span>C. finmarchicus</span> in the NYB can be a reliable energy source for local predators due to their high spring and summer abundances and year-round storage of high-energy wax esters.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"58444f88c1d0b0ae7b6696825fcc19c79d3810d3982b7ed4caa334ee36c61f02","category":"Environment"}
