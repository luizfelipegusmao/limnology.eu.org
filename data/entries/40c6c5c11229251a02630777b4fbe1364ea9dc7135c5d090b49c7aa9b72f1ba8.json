{"title":"Advances in Protein Dynamics: Unraveling the Molecular Motions Underlying Biological Functions and Therapeutic Innovations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0272/v1","date":1722912273000,"content":"Protein dynamics play a crucial role in biological function, encompassing motions ranging from atomic vibrations to large-scale conformational changes. Recent advancements in experimental techniques, computational methods, and artificial intelligence have revolutionized our understanding of protein dynamics. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides atomic-resolution insights, while molecular dynamics simulations offer detailed trajectories of protein motions. The integration of machine learning, exemplified by AlphaFold2, has accelerated structure prediction and dynamics analysis. These approaches have revealed the importance of protein dynamics in allosteric regulation, enzyme catalysis, and intrinsically disordered proteins. The shift towards ensemble representations of protein structures and the application of single-molecule techniques have further enhanced our ability to capture the dynamic nature of proteins. Understanding protein dynamics is essential for elucidating biological mechanisms, designing drugs, and developing novel biocatalysts, marking a significant paradigm shift in structural biology and drug discovery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40c6c5c11229251a02630777b4fbe1364ea9dc7135c5d090b49c7aa9b72f1ba8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
