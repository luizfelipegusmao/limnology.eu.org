{"title":"The development status and future trends of lubricant additives technology: Based on patents analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304888","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Mianqing Wang, Hua He, Xi Fang, Hui Li</p>\r\n\r\nIn order to reveal the current status and future trends of lubricant additives, this study analyzes the structured and unstructured data of 77701 lubricant additive patents recorded by Patsnap. The results show that China is the country with the largest number of patents in this field, and the United States is the main exporting country of international technology flow; the current research and development of lubricant additives is dominated by multifunctional composite additives; environmentally friendly additive compositions are the current research hotspot; and more environmentally friendly and economically degradable additives have more development potential in the future. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the research and application of lubricant additives and contributes to the future development of the lubricant industry.","author":"Mianqing Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7caf37f266d5208bcc3c3279da0789d5520881a0b6484a2f90e64ff522b44c64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
