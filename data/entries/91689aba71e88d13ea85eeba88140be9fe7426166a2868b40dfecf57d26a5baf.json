{"title":"Stripe rust effector Pst03724 modulates host immunity by inhibiting NAD kinase activation by a calmodulin","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1624/7619220?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Puccinia striiformis</span> f. sp. <span>tritici</span> (<span>Pst</span>) secretes effector proteins that enter plant cells to manipulate host immune processes. In this report, we present an important <span>Pst</span> effector, Pst03724, whose mRNA expression level increases during <span>Pst</span> infection of wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span>). Silencing of <span>Pst03724</span> reduced the growth and development of <span>Pst</span>. Pst03724 targeted the wheat calmodulin TaCaM3-2B, a positive regulator of wheat immunity. Subsequent investigations revealed that Pst03724 interferes with the TaCaM3-2B–NAD kinase (NADK) TaNADK2 association and thus inhibits the enzyme activity of TaNADK2 activated by TaCaM3-2B. Knocking down <span>TaNADK2</span> expression by virus-mediated gene silencing significantly increased fungal growth and development, suggesting a decrease in resistance against <span>Pst</span> infection. In conclusion, our findings indicate that <span>Pst</span> effector Pst03724 inhibits the activity of NADK by interfering with the TaCaM3-2B–TaNADK2 association, thereby facilitating <span>Pst</span> infection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"91689aba71e88d13ea85eeba88140be9fe7426166a2868b40dfecf57d26a5baf","category":"Environment"}
