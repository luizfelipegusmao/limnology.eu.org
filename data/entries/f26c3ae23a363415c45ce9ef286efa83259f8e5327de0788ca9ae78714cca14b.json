Despite being declared endemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to pose a significant risk, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, highlighting the need for a more sensitive and specific detection. Reverse transcription digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) possesses a sensitive and absolute quantification compared to the gold standard. This study is the first to optimize RT-ddPCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens using a commercially available RT-qPCR kit. Optimization involved the assessment of the RT-ddPCR reaction mixture, annealing temperature adjustments, and validation using 40 stored saliva specimens. RT-qPCR was used as a reference method in this study. Compatibility assessment revealed that ddPCR Supermix for Probes (no dUTP) was preferable with an optimal annealing temperature of 57.6Â°C. Although a 25% higher primer/probe concentration provides a higher amplitude in droplet separation of positive control, the number of copy numbers decreased. An inverse correlation between Ct value and copy number concentration was displayed, presenting that the lower the Ct value, the higher the concentration, for the N and E genes with r<sup>2</sup> values of 0.98 and 0.85, respectively. However, ORF1ab was poorly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> of 0.34). The sensitivity of targeted and E genes was 100% and 93.3%, respectively; as for the specificity, the percentage ranged from 80.8% to 91.3%. This study implicates the applicability of a modified method in the ddPCR platform for similar types of pathogens using saliva specimens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"f26c3ae23a363415c45ce9ef286efa83259f8e5327de0788ca9ae78714cca14b","category":"Environment"}
