{"title":"With or without you: gut microbiota does not predict aggregation behavior in European earwig females","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae022/7637315?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The reasons why some individuals are solitary, and others gregarious are the subject of ongoing debate as we seek to understand the emergence of sociality. Recent studies suggest that the expression of aggregation behaviors may be linked to the gut microbiota of the host. Here, we tested this hypothesis in females of the European earwig. This insect is ideal for addressing this question, as adults both naturally vary in the degree to which they live in groups and show interindividual variation in their gut microbial communities. We video-tracked 320 field-sampled females to quantify their natural variation in aggregation and then tested whether the most and least gregarious females had different gut microbiota. We also compared the general activity, boldness, body size, and body condition of these females and examined the association between each of these traits and the gut microbiota. Contrary to our predictions, we found no difference in the gut microbiota between the most and least gregarious females. There was also no difference in activity, boldness, and body condition between these two types of females. Independent of aggregation, gut microbiota was overall associated with female body condition, but not with any of our other measurements. Overall, these results demonstrate that a hostâ€™s gut microbiota is not necessarily a major driver or a consequence of aggregation behavior in species with inter-individual variation in group living and call for future studies to investigate the determinants and role of gut microbiota in earwigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"5e328be88ff4b6087bed5aa2ebb63f1be79dcc5e68a5fbe1f4e7a8e622c50a11","category":"Environment"}
