Migraine affects especially the working age population. The objective of this retrospective observational register-based study was to analyze the use of healthcare services and associated costs in Finnish migraine patients. Study was based on aggregate data from January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2021, from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare’s national registries. Patients were grouped into nine patient groups according to medication prescriptions and diagnoses. Healthcare resource utilization in specialty, primary, and occupational healthcare was assessed and analyzed separately for all-cause and migraine related healthcare contacts from a one-year period. The total number of patients was 175 711, and most (45%) of the patients belonged to a group that had used only one triptan. Migraine related total healthcare resource utilization was greater for patients that had used two or more triptans compared to those that had used only one. The patients with three or more preventive medications had the highest total migraine related healthcare resource utilization of the studied patient cohorts. Of the total annual healthcare costs 11.5% (50.6 million €) was associated to be migraine related costs. Total per patient per year healthcare costs were highest with patients that had used three or more preventive medications (5 626 €) and lowest in those with only one triptan (2 257 €). Our findings are in line with the recent European Headache Federation consensus statement regarding the unmet need in patients who have had inadequate response to two or more triptans. When assessing the patient access and cost-effectiveness of novel treatments for the treatment of migraine within different healthcare systems, a holistic analysis of the current disease burden along with potential gains for patients and healthcare service providers are essential information in guiding decision-making.","author":"Mikko Kosunen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8135cb0269826706707d39a14ea96eb5e145f150a0d4572d1bffa77d9e2548a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
