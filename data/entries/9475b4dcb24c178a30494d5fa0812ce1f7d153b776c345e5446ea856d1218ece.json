{"title":"Therapeutic Potential of a Biodynamic Supplement on Skin Pressure Ulcers: A Clinical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1955/v1","date":1714448509000,"content":"Pressure Ulcers (PU) are a debilitating and often painful condition. They are localized lesions on the skin and/or underlying tissues and are common in the elderly, immobile people, diabetics and vascular disease or malnutrition, as well as in those requiring intensive or palliative care. Prevention and treatment of PU involve strategies to optimize hydration, circulation and nutrition. Nutrition plays a key role in pressure ulcer care because wounds require macronutrients and micronutrients to heal. Reports relating to the effectiveness of \"Complementary Enzyme Therapy\" also in the vulnological field led us to this study, the aim of which was to test the activity of a biodynamic nutritional supplement (Citozym®), characterized by a marked antioxidant activity, administered topically and/or systemically, in patients suffering from PU. The treatment showed a marked reduction in bedsores and in many cases their complete healing. Furthermore, it was possible to observe a lower incidence of side effects compared to conventional therapies. The results obtained, confirmed by various tests, and recognized by the scientific community, allow us to conclude that treatment with Citozym® could represent a new and effective strategy for the treatment of PU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9475b4dcb24c178a30494d5fa0812ce1f7d153b776c345e5446ea856d1218ece","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
