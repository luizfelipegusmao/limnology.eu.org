{"title":"A Dual-Phase Framework for Enhanced Churn Prediction in Motor Insurance using Cave-Degree and Magnetic Force Perturbation Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1820/v1","date":1727129932000,"content":"This study presents a novel predictive model to address the churn problem in the motor insurance sector using a dual-phase framework. The first phase employs a cave-degree perturbation technique for effective feature selection, while the second phase applies the Magnetic Force Perturbation Technique (MFPT) to optimize the search process and avoid local optima traps. Two metaheuristics are proposed: the Adaptive Random Forest-Assisted Large Neighborhood Feature Optimizer (ARALFO) and the Adaptive Random Forest Particle Swarm Optimizer (ARFPSO) to enhance churn prediction accuracy. The model was evaluated on two real-world motor insurance datasets, achieving a 95% accuracy rate and outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. An ablation study confirmed the significant impact of the cave-degree and MFPT techniques in boosting predictive performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce2b7567dbde33608e541326904142aaf3a5dd7c334d8a05f2295a6c95a37291","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
