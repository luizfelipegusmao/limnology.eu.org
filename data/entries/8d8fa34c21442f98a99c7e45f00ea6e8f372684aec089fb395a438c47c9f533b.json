{"title":"Development of a Capsule-Type Inspection Robot Customized for the Ondol Pipeline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2230/v1","date":1722323301000,"content":"Ondol, a heating system unique to Korean homes, raises indoor temperatures by supplying hot water through pipes embedded in the floor slab. Known for its comfort and sustained heat advantages, Ondol has garnered international interest in countries requiring efficient heating solutions. Given the inherent challenges during installation and operation, timely inspection is crucial due to difficulties in detecting and pinpointing defects in the buried concrete pipes, often leading to costly rework and removal. Yet, specialized inspection systems tailored for Ondol pipes remain underexplored. Therefore, this study proposes a robotic inspection system capable of assessing the condition of Ondol pipelines. We analyzed the characteristics of Ondol piping to establish the system requirements and developed a prototype of a compact capsule-shaped inspection robot tailored for Ondol pipe inspection. Subsequent laboratory testing validated its performance and usability, confirming its capability for field application through tests on curvature maneuverability and image reception quality. This research aims to motivate advancements in Ondol-specific system implementation and performance validation, potentially contributing to the smartification of Ondol maintenance practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d8fa34c21442f98a99c7e45f00ea6e8f372684aec089fb395a438c47c9f533b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
