{"title":"Unravelling the Link between the Gut Microbiome and Autoimmune and Inflammatory Kidney Diseases: A Potential New Therapeutic Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1450/v1","date":1711352537000,"content":"Autoimmune kidney diseases arise from a loss of tolerance to antigens, often with unclear triggers. In this review we explore the role of the gut microbiome and how disease, diet and therapy can alter the gut microbiota consortium. Perturbations in the gut microbiota may induce the translocation of microbiota-derived inflammatory molecules such as liposaccharide (LPS) and other toxins systemically by penetrating the gut epithelial barrier. Once in the blood stream these pro-inflammatory mediators activate immune cells which release pro-inflammatory molecules many of which are antigens in autoimmune diseases. The ratio of gut bacteria Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes is associated with worse outcomes in multiple autoimmune kidney diseases including Lupus nephritis, MPO-ANCA vasculitis and Goodpastureâ€™s syndrome. Therapies which enhance short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in the gut have powerful therapeutic potential. Dietary fibre is fermented by gut bacteria which in turn release SCFAs which protect the gut barrier as well as modulate immune responses towards a tolerogenic anti-inflammatory state. Herein, we describe where the current field of research is and the strategies to harness the gut microbiome as potential therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1282f68a5520dc76a1712c457fb93653d1d2c0a5de2d9807ac6c00472b5f7cce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
