{"title":"Towards Air Quality Protection in an Urban Area&mdash;Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2031/v1","date":1721957080000,"content":"Warsaw is among European cities with the worst atmospheric air quality, mainly due to very high pollution emitted by the residential sector and road traffic. This results in high concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, often exceeding WHO standards. The paper discusses the current and expected effects of actions taken by the Warsaw authorities, to significantly improve air quality in the city. The Clean Air Program currently implemented mainly involves the reduction, and ultimately the total elimination, of coal combustion in all heat sources of the municipal sector, which is identified in numerous publications as the main source of air quality degradation in cities. The program's goal, which timeframe covers the years 2018-2029, is a definite reduction in particulate pollution. The second part of the remedial activities, covering the years 2024-2034, mainly concerns the reduction of nitrogen oxide pollution, the main source of which is urban road traffic. In the latter case, the expected effects of introducing Low-Emission Zone (launched July 2024) in the city center are considered. According to the project, the zone's implementation will consist of five two-year stages, in which the car emission limits will gradually tighten. The paper compares the effectiveness of two being considered versions, differing in size zones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a990e80b780694a3d0259223745fe91f3010800a6e86ac5b1c270824a044e2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
