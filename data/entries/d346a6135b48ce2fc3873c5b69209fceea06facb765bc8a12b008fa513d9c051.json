{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Tools and the Future of Librarians","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0414/v1","date":1712290771000,"content":"The recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools has had a pervasive effect on every sphere of human existence. Libraries and information centres are not immune to these technological advances. These disruptive technologies have transformed the traditional face of libraries and their operations. There are many available AI tools, for example, chatbots, literature review tools, plagiarism detection tools, and several other developments in the field that have perhaps made the functioning of libraries easier. However, there is growing concern and uncertainty among both traditional library and modern professionals regarding the possible job loss and security issues related to these new technologies, which the professionals must deal with. Librarians and information professionals must be ready to handle the unforeseen situation. However, it is to be observed how libraries cope with these uncertainties, and threats to the integrity, availability of data, and normal library housekeeping functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d346a6135b48ce2fc3873c5b69209fceea06facb765bc8a12b008fa513d9c051","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
