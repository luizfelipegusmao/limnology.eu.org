{"title":"Study on Hydration Heat Effect and Pipe Cooling System of the Mass Concrete Pile Caps","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0606/v1","date":1720425777000,"content":"Under the action of cement hydration heat, construction environment, thermal insulation measures, and pipe cooling system, the mass concrete pile cap produces a complex temperature field inside the structure, which makes it difficult to control the internal surface temperature difference, the maximum adiabatic temperature rise and the surface temperature of the structure. In this paper, the mass concrete pile cap of a super large bridge (the length, width, and height are 26.40mï¼Œ20.90m, and 5.00m, respectively, and the central pier pile cap is constructed with concrete with a strength of C40) is taken as the research support project. The controlling factors affecting the temperature field of the mass concrete pile cap are found by comparing the temperature monitoring of the pile cap with the calculated value of finite element software simulation analysis. Through the finite element software Midas Civil and Midas FEA, the control factors affecting the temperature field of the main pier cap (concrete mold temperature, concrete surface convection coefficient, ambient temperature, and pipe cooling system parameters, etc.) are numerically analyzed, and the influence law and influence degree of the control factors are found out.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb97dc64b6177754509f676f104f0063423f00c04e77c58449b7f99499fa63ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
