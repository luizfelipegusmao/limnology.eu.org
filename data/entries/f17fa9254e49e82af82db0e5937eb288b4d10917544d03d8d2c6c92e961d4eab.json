Because the functionality of NPs is highly dependent on their sizes, shape, surface, and material, the accurate characterization of particles is essential to their specific applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.233-B3\">3</a>]. In this work, we studied the feasibility of NPs characterization in terms of topography and material composition by FusionScope<sup>TM</sup>, a novel correlative microscope platform that seamless combines a wide range of Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) measurement techniques with the benefits of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f17fa9254e49e82af82db0e5937eb288b4d10917544d03d8d2c6c92e961d4eab","category":"Environment"}
