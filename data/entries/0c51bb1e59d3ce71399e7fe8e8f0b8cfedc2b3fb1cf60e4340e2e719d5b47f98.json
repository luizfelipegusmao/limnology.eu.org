{"title":"Bioaerosol Disinfection by a Cold Plasma Ionizer Coupled with an Electrostatic Precipitator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2577/v1","date":1722419612000,"content":"Despite the best efforts in air-purification, airborne infectious diseases do and will continue to spread due to continuous emission of bioaerosols by the host/infected person. To tackle the rapid spread of airborne infectious diseases, a shift in focus from air-purification to bioaerosol disinfection/ decontamination is urgently needed. In this work, we studied a cold plasma ionizer (CPI) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP)-coupled CPI (CPI-ESP) for disinfection and cleaning of bioaerosols. Using porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and E. coli in a testing chamber, we demonstrated that CPI coupled with ESP is an effective technology for inactivating aerosolized microorganisms and microorganisms spread on surfaces. In addition, we have demonstrated the efficiency of a CPI-ESP coupled device for disinfection of naturally occurring airborne microbials in a few indoor settings (i.e., an living room, a discussion room, a schoolroom and an office) to determine the treatment duration- and human activity-dependent efficacy. To understand the disinfection mechanism, we conduced fluorescence microscopy study to reveal different degree of bacteria cell membrane damage under CPI treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c51bb1e59d3ce71399e7fe8e8f0b8cfedc2b3fb1cf60e4340e2e719d5b47f98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
