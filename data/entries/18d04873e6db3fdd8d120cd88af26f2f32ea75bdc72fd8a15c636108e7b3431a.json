{"title":"Correlation Analysis of Tunnel Deformation and Internal Force in the Earthquake Based on Tunnel Inclination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0163/v1","date":1712040790000,"content":"Dynamic time history analysis is a powerful and effective method to study the seismic response of tunnels, the dynamic time history to analyze the seismic response of the tunnel in the typical subway in this paper. The analysis results show that the overall levelling of the tunnel will not affect the tunnel too much, and the seismic response of the tunnel is mainly related to the relative displacement of the ground around the tunnel. The analysis results show that the internal force of the tunnel and the tunnel inclination have a good linear relationship, and the tunnel inclination can be used to measure the magnitude of the seismic response of the tunnel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18d04873e6db3fdd8d120cd88af26f2f32ea75bdc72fd8a15c636108e7b3431a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
