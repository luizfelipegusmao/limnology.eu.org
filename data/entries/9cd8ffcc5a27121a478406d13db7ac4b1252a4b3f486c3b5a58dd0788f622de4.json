{"title":"Neural Dynamics of Processing Inflectional Morphology: An fMRI Study on Korean Inflected Verbs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1890/v1","date":1719404158000,"content":"The present study aimed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning the visual recognition of morphologically complex verbs in Korean, a morphologically rich, agglutinative language with inherent polymorphemic characteristics. In an fMRI experiment with a lexical decision paradigm, we investigated whether verb inflection types (base, regular, and irregular) are processed through separate mechanisms or a single system. Furthermore, we explored the semantic influence in processing inflectional morphology by manipulating semantic ambiguity (homonymous vs. unambiguous) of inflected verbs. The results showed equivalent activation levels in the left inferior frontal gyrus for both regular and irregular verbs, challenging the dichotomy. Graded effects of verb regularity were observed in the occipitotemporal regions, with regular inflections eliciting increased activation in the fusiform and lingual gyri. In the middle occipital gyrus, homonyms showed decreased activation relative to unambiguous words, specifically for base and irregular forms. Furthermore, the angular gyrus exhibited significant modulation by all verb types, indicating a semantic influence during morphological processing. These findings support single-system theories and the connectionist framework, challenging the assumptions of purely orthographic morphological decomposition and dual-mechanism accounts. Furthermore, they provided evidence for a semantic influence during morphological processing, with differential reliance on semantic activation for regular and irregular inflections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9cd8ffcc5a27121a478406d13db7ac4b1252a4b3f486c3b5a58dd0788f622de4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
