{"title":"Phytochemical, Molecular Docking and Expressing the ALAD Gene Protected via Moringa Extract Against Nano Lead in Rat Blood","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-57054-4_15","date":1735689600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This study aimed to determine whether Moringa oleifera extract might protect white Wistar rats from lead poisoning brought on by pulsed laser ablation (L) and commercial lead nanoparticles (C). Forty-one phytochemical compounds of Moringa extract were analyzed by molecular docking after GC/MS analysis. Six groups of seven rats each were formed with the following attributes: (1) 160 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> of Moringa seed extract (M.); (2) 5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> of commercial lead nanoparticles (C); (3) 5.8 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> of nanoscale lead; (4) Moringa seed extract plus produced lead nanoparticles (C. M.); and (6) a control (Con.). Blood was taken from the animals 45 days following exposure, and the genetic alterations in their ALAD gene were examined. Ten of the 41 compounds showed the best potency as ALAD drug candidate protectors. The binding affinity with the strongest bond value was –6.018 (kcal/mol) observed in the NAMPT bond with cis-Isoeugenol. Therefore, it can be used for further optimization to acquire molecular potencies targeting the Pb-toxicity. Moringa seed extract (160 mg Kg<sup>–1</sup>) provided 1.073725, which was more effective than the control of 1, and nanoscale lead X Moringa seed extract (5.8 × 160 mg Kg<sup>–1</sup>) produced 0.421775. To remove the variance caused by treatments on ALAD gene expression, principal component analysis, spider (radar), and circular analysis were employed.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"d2f8133767a59d1d40147f9ca5c3ad47f3aa99213aaec9c611dc6ff096a72c53","category":"Environment"}
