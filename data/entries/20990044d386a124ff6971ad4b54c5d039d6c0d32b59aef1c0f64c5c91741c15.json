{"title":"Schistura sonarengaensis, a new species of cave‐dwelling loach (Teleostei: Nemacheilidae) from Meghalaya, northeast India","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15856?af=R","date":1728396900000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A new species of nemacheilid loach, <i>Schistura sonarengaensis</i> sp. nov., is described from three cave-dwelling populations (Barak–Surma–Meghna drainage) in the South Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, India. The new species possesses prominent eyes but is easily distinguished from all the congeners of the genus <i>Schistura</i> from Barak–Surma–Meghna and adjacent rivers drainages of northeast Indian (except <i>S. syngkai</i>) in having 13–26 vertically elongated to circular mid-lateral black blotches (brownish in life) overlayered on a grayish-black mid-lateral stripe on a dull white or pale-beige (golden brown in life) body. However, it can be easily distinguished from <i>S. syngkai</i> in having a complete (vs. incomplete) lateral line with more 72–89 (vs. 19–42) lateral-line pored scales, greater pre-dorsal length (48.5–53.1 vs. 41.9–44.1 %SL), a wider body at dorsal-fin origin (11.3–16.7 vs. 9.4–10.3 %SL), greater dorsal (18.1–21.1 vs. 15.1–17.0 %SL) and lateral (20.9–24.1 vs. 17.4–18.9 %SL) head length, a wider head (14.5–18.5 vs. 11.6–13.3 %SL), and moderately forked (vs. emarginated) caudal fin. Further, molecular analysis confirms the distinctiveness of <i>S</i>. <i>sonarengaensis</i> sp. nov. from its congeners found in northeast India by significant divergences with uncorrected genetic distance ranging from 3.7% to 17.3% in the mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit I (COI) gene dataset. The phylogenetic position of the new species with its sister species was evaluated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis. The species delimitation approaches assemble species by automatic partitioning (ASAP) and Poisson tree processes (PTP) utilized for testing species assignments consistently identified our test group as a distinct species from its sister species. Although the new species lacks typical morphological adaptations usually associated with a subterranean life, such as complete absence (or vestigial presence) of eyes and pigmentation, it exhibits a reduction of pigmentation when compared to the epigean congeners.</p>","author":"Dran Khlur B.
