{"title":"Nutritional Epigenomics: Bioactive Dietary Compounds in the Epigenetic Regulation of Osteoarthritis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0100/v1","date":1722594799000,"content":"Nutritional epigenomics is exceptionally important because describes the complex interactions among food compounds and epigenome modifications. A healthy diet can improve the quality of life and, alleviate the progression and symptomatology of many complex diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). Phytonutrients or bioactive compounds, which are secondary metabolites of plants, can protect against OA by suppressing the expression of inflammatory and catabolic mediators, and modulating epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, histone or chromatin remodelling of key inflammatory genes and noncoding RNAs. The combination of natural epigenetic modulators is crucial because their additive and synergistic effects, safety and therapeutic efficacy, and lower adverse effects than conventional pharmacology in the treatment of OA. In this review, we have summarised the chondroprotective properties of bioactive compounds and nutraceuticals for the management, treatment, or prevention of OA in both human and animal [1]studies. Some of them have been considered as natural epigenetic modulators that can modify the activity of various epigenetic factors and, alter the expression of genes related to inflammation and cartilage destruction. However, this complex pathology with inflammatory mediators has been little studied at the nutriepigenomic level. Further research is needed towards bioactive compounds as epigenetic modulators in OA, likewise, determine their potential value for future clinical applications in OA patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65e56c948be39ea9f1c243350804d4abd3c600eb03a04c6fbc9736246cec4527","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
