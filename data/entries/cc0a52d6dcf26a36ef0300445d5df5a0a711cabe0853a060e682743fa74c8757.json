{"title":"Growing older, growing more diverse: Sea turtles and epibiotic cyanobacteria","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13511?af=R","date":1729591208000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cyanobacteria are known for forming associations with various animals, including sea turtles, yet our understanding of cyanobacteria associated with sea turtles remains limited. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the diversity of cyanobacteria in biofilm samples from loggerhead sea turtle carapaces, utilizing a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach. The predominant cyanobacterial order identified was Nodosilineales, with the genus <i>Rhodoploca</i> having the highest relative abundance. Our results suggest that cyanobacterial communities become more diverse as sea turtles age, as we observed a positive correlation between community diversity and the length of a sea turtle's carapace. Since larger and older turtles predominantly utilize neritic habitats, the shift to a more diverse cyanobacterial community aligned with a change in loggerhead habitat. Our research provides detailed insights into the cyanobacterial communities associated with loggerhead sea turtles, establishing a foundation for future studies delving into this fascinating ecological relationship and its potential implications for sea turtle conservation.</p>","author":"Lucija Kanjer, \nKlara Filek, \nMaja Mucko, \nMateja Zekan Lupić, \nMaša Frleta‐Valić, \nRomana Gračan, \nSunčica Bosak","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"cc0a52d6dcf26a36ef0300445d5df5a0a711cabe0853a060e682743fa74c8757","category":"Environment"}
