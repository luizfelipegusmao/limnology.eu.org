{"title":"Standardizing and Classifying Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: International Multicenter Study Using a Mobile Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1700/v1","date":1729588584000,"content":"This international multicenter study is aimed to assess the effectiveness of the Pivot-Shift Meter (PSM) mobile application in diagnosing and classifying anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, with emphasis in the need for standardization in ACL injury assessment to improve diagnostic precision and enhance treatment outcomes. Methods: The study included over 600 ACL evaluations from five Latin American countries (Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico) performed by eight experienced orthopedic surgeons. The PSM app, using smartphone gyroscopes and accelerometers, was employed to standardize the pivot-shift test, and the data was analyzed using MATLAB software. Tests were classified into eight classes, and a neural network model was developed to categorize the injury grades. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated significant differences between standardized and control tests, supporting the standardization's effectiveness. The neural network model exhibited high classification accuracy (94.7%), with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 90%. Additionally, the model demonstrated an ability to reliably grade ACL injuries with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, indicating high diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions: The PSM mobile application, combined with standardized pivot-shift techniques, proved to be a reliable tool for diagnosing and classifying ACL injuries. The neural network model showed high performance in predicting injury grades, making this method a valuable tool in clinical practice for improving diagnostic precision and treatment planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce7f803e5c023401819c4eec0732b2eae04a85b2d03542eb872f4a67e7cb8b93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
