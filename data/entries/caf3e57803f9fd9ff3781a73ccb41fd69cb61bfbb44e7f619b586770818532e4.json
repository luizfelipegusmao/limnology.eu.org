{"title":"See the Unseen: Grid-Wise DA Detection Dataset and Network using LiDAR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1668/v1","date":1727075206000,"content":"Drivable area (DA) detection is crucial for autonomous driving. Camera-based methods heavily rely on lighting conditions and often fail to capture accurate 3D information, while LiDAR-based methods offer accurate 3D data and are less susceptible to lighting conditions. However, existing LiDAR-based methods focus on point-wise detection, prone to occlusion and limited by point cloud sparsity, leading to decreased performance in motion planning and localization. We propose Argoverse-grid, a grid-wise DA detection dataset derived from Argoverse 1, comprising over 13K frames with fine-grained BEV DA labels across various scenarios. We also introduce Grid-DATrNet, a first grid-wise DA detection model utilizing global attention through transformers. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of Grid-DATrNet over various methods, including both LiDAR and camera-based approaches, in detecting grid-wise DA in the proposed Argoverse-grid dataset. We show that Grid-DATrNet can detect grids even in occluded and unmeasured areas by leveraging contextual and semantic information through global attention, unlike CNN-based DA detection methods. The preprocessing code for Argoverse-grid, experiment code, Grid-DATrNet implementation, and result visualization code will be made available at https://github.com/kaist-avelab/grid-wise-DA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"caf3e57803f9fd9ff3781a73ccb41fd69cb61bfbb44e7f619b586770818532e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
