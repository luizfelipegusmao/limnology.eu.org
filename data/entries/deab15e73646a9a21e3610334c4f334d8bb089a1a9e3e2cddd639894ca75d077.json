{"title":"Rheology of Suspensions Thickened by Cellulose Nanocrystals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0203/v1","date":1717502871000,"content":"The steady rheological behavior of suspensions of solid particles thickened by cellulose nanocrystals is investigated. Two different types and sizes of particles are used in the preparation of suspensions, namely TG hollow spheres of Sauter mean diameter of 69 µm and Solospheres S-32 of Sauter mean diameter of 14 µm. The nanocrystal concentration varies from 0 to 3.5 wt% and the particle concentration varies from 0 to 57.2 vol%. The influence of salt (NaCl) concentration and pH on the rheology of suspensions is also investigated. The suspensions generally exhibit shear-thinning behavior. The degree of shear-thinning is stronger in suspensions of smaller size particles. The experimental viscosity data are adequately described by a power-law model. The variations of power-law parameters (consistency index and flow behavior index) under different conditions are determined and discussed in detail.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"deab15e73646a9a21e3610334c4f334d8bb089a1a9e3e2cddd639894ca75d077","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
