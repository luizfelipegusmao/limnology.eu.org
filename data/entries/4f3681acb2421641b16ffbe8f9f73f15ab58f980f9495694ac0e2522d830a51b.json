{"title":"111 First Kiko Buck Performance Test in Mississippi","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/103/7618030?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Kiko is a meat breed of goats originating from New Zealand, they are recognized for their hardiness and parasite resistance. There is a lack of information on economically important traits for this breed in the US, particularly in the Southeast. The Kiko buck performance test allows producers to make educated breeding decisions through impartial data. These tests have occurred in the United States for years; however, this is the first buck test performed on commercial farm grazing conditions in Mississippi (MS). A goat that performs well in a test in another state may not perform well in high temperatures, humidity, ground moisture, and availability of parasites in MS. The objective of the test was to collect data on the performance of weaned Kiko bucks grazing under commercial farm conditions in south MS from July to October of 2023 (IACUC-23-138). Forty-five farmers from 14 different states (KY, OK, FL, NC, MS, AL, IN, IL, GA, TN, AR, VA, MO, and WV) consigned 88 Kiko bucks. Every 2 wk measurements were taken on the goats including body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), FAMACHA, and fecal count of nematode eggs (FEC expressed as eggs per gram of feces – EPG), also at the start and end of the test loin eye area (LEA) was measured through ultrasound. Forage samples were collected for quality analysis, the average values starting the test were 13% CP and 47.4 TDN. Upon arrival, the bucks were dewormed using a combination of drugs, and after 2 wk of confinement went out with only grazing to start the 10 wk of test. During the test bucks were dewormed using the following parameters: &gt;2,500 EPG and FAMACHA 4 or 5 or BCS &lt; 1.5, any goat falling in these criteria was not considered for the final ranking. Bucks were separated into two groups: those born on or before February 8<sup>th,</sup> 2023 (group 1-G1, n = 44) and those born after (group 2-G2 n = 34). Ratios of the average daily gain (ADG), nematode FEC, and the ratio of LEA/BW were used in the final index. As all values are considered of equal economic importance, they all contributed the same to the final index. For G1 ADG, FEC, LEA/BW was 60 g/d (SD 20), 832.75 EPG (SD = 504.32), and 0.88 cm²/kg (SD = 0.20), respectively. For G2 ADG, FEC, and LEA/BW was 50 g/d (SD = 40), 907.86 EPG (SD = 492.61), and 0.81 cm²/kg (SD = 0.19), respectively. Bucks were ranked by highest index value in the group, for G1 the 1<sup>st</sup> place buck was from MS with ADG, FEC, LEA/BW of 90 g/d, 175 EPG, and 1.41 cm²/kg, respectively. For G2 the 1<sup>st</sup> place buck was from IN with ADG, FEC, and LEA/BW of 140 g/d, 116.67 EPG, and 1.00 cm²/kg, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4f3681acb2421641b16ffbe8f9f73f15ab58f980f9495694ac0e2522d830a51b","category":"Environment"}
