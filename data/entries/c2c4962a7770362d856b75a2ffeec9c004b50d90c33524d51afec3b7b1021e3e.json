{"title":"Ethnic and national identification of minority youth in China: The mediating role of intergroup orientation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305169","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Ning Luo, Lei Wang, Tao Guan</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examined the mediating role of intergroup orientation in the relationship between ethnic and national identification. Our participants were 1320 Yi minority youths from a secondary school located in the Yi ethnic autonomous prefecture of southwest China. The participants completed three self-report questionnaires measuring ethnic and national identification, and intergroup orientation, respectively. Structural equation modeling was employed to determine the relationships between ethnic and national identification and intergroup orientation, and to explore the mechanism underlying the association between ethnic and national identification. The results showed that Yi minority youths with a stronger sense of ethnic identity had a stronger sense of national identity. The results further indicated that stronger ethnic identity led to a more positive intergroup orientation, which in turn predicted a stronger national identity. Our findings may facilitate the cultivation of positive attitudes between national subgroups in multiethnic countries and help ethnic minority youth develop a stronger awareness of national identity while retaining their ethnic identity.","author":"Ning Luo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c2c4962a7770362d856b75a2ffeec9c004b50d90c33524d51afec3b7b1021e3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
