{"title":"Climate adaptation depends on rebalancing flexibility and rigidity in US fisheries management","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/2/252/7459506?rss=1","date":1701820800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fisheries face unprecedented environmental change. An important aspect of resilience to this change is the adaptive capacity of managers and stakeholders to respond to new conditions. A growing academic literature has demonstrated the value of fostering this adaptive capacity and highlighted key elements of fisheries social-ecological systems that can promote it. However, it is unclear to what extent these abstract academic ideas around adaptive capacity are relevant and valuable to on-the-ground resource managers, and if so, whether there are aspects of the literature that particularly resonate with their needs. Here, we compare academic concepts of adaptive capacity to the ways that management practitioners conceptualize and implement these ideas in practice, elicited through interviews with key professionals in United States federal fishery management bodies. Practitioners overwhelmingly cited flexibility to respond to change as the most consistently important element of adaptive capacity. Yet, they also detailed how the U.S. fishery management system routinely limits and constrains the flexibility of managers and stakeholders. Seeking out opportunities that enhance flexibility without jeopardizing other key aspects of adaptive capacity could increase managementâ€™s adaptive capacity to global change in the USA and elsewhere.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"325c3e90704a32606b6d5c4d57ac1a8e22538a665ab85edcc040134f651f7622","category":"Environment"}
