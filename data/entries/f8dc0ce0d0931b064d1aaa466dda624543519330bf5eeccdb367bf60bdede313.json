{"title":"The Impact of Positive Reinforcement on AI Decision-Making Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1031/v1","date":1728957319000,"content":"Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the core frameworks in Artificial Intelligence (AI) used for decision-making tasks. In particular, positive reinforcement rewards desirable actions, which helps an AI agent optimize its policy by maximizing the cumulative reward over time. This paper critically reviews how positive reinforcement affects decision-making in AI models. We explore the mechanisms, limitations, and potential biases introduced by positive reinforcement in AI systems and provide insights into real-world applications and ethical considerations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8dc0ce0d0931b064d1aaa466dda624543519330bf5eeccdb367bf60bdede313","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
