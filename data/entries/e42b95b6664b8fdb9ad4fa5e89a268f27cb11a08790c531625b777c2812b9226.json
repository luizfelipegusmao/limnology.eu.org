This study aimed to determine the effect that Fastrack probiotic had on the yield and milk quality measures of lactating dairy cows. To accomplish this goal, lactating Holstein cows (n = 80) were equally divided into two treatment groups: one supplemented with a probiotic (PRO) and one that did not receive the probiotic supplement (CON). The cows remained in their treatment groups for the duration of the 120-d study and were given ad libitum access to a total mixed ration consisting of 35% corn silage, 30% rolled corn, 10.5% soybean meal, 23% DDGS, and 1.5% mineral supplement. Cows on the PRO treatment were given 1 kg of DDGS once a day at milking that had the probiotic mixed in while the CON treatment were given 1 kg of the same DDGS that did not have the probiotic included. Preliminary results of this study show a decrease in individual treatment records for cows on the PRO treatment and an increase of 2 kg of milk yield per day.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e42b95b6664b8fdb9ad4fa5e89a268f27cb11a08790c531625b777c2812b9226","category":"Environment"}
