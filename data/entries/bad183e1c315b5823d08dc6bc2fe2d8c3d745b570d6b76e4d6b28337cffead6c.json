{"title":"Direct Synthesis of Benzhydryl-Functionalized 3,4-Dihydropyridin-2-Ones from 2-Pyridones and Their Use in the Formation of Bridged -Lactams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0534/v1","date":1728375632000,"content":"A method for the synthesis of C4-benzhydryl functionalized 3,4-dihydropyridin-2-ones using complementary addition of benzhydryllithium and/or benzhydrylmagnesiate reagents to 2-pyridones, with high regioselectivity triggered by substituents, is described. A partially stereoselective cyclization was successfully demonstrated using TfOH and/or TIPSOTf as Brønsted and Lewis acids, respectively, leading to C6-phenyl functionalized 7,8-benzomorphanones. It is also shown that the use of functionalized -enelactams obtained with an active methoxy-substituted benzyl group at C3, enabled the preparation of a new C3-C6 bridged system within -lactam framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bad183e1c315b5823d08dc6bc2fe2d8c3d745b570d6b76e4d6b28337cffead6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
