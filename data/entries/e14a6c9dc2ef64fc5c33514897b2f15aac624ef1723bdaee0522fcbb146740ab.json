{"title":"Study on the High-spin Level Structure of 192Tl","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0102/v1","date":1717415539000,"content":"High-spin states of 192Tl are populated by the heavy ion fusion-evaporation reaction 181Ta(16O, 5n)192Tl at 97 MeV beam energy. A new level scheme with eight new levels is constructed and the level spins are tentatively assigned. The negative-parity yrast band is extended up to 23^{-}\\hbar. Subsequently, the systematics of signature splitting and signature inversion are discussed for the negative-parity yrast band of odd-odd Tl isotopes including 192Tl, 194Tl, 196Tl, and 198Tl. With the increase of neutron number signature inversion is found in 196,198Tl at high-spin state in these four Tl isotopes. The reason may be due to the competition between neutron-proton interaction and Coriolis force.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e14a6c9dc2ef64fc5c33514897b2f15aac624ef1723bdaee0522fcbb146740ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
