{"title":"Two-week Computerized Cognitive Training Aﬀects Resting-State Electroencephalographic Rhythms in Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Patients with Cognitive Deﬁcits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0939/v1","date":1713166844000,"content":"The present exploratory study tested the hypothesis that computerized cognitive training (CCT) in home telemonitoring may beneficially affect eyes-closed resting-state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms in Parkinson's disease patients with cognitive deficits (PDCD). \nA Eurasian database provided clinical-demographic-rsEEG datasets in 40 PDCD patients, 29 PD patients without cognitive deficits (PDNCD), 40 Alzheimer’s disease patients with cognitive deficits (ADCD), and 40 cognitively normal older adults (Healthy). Sixteen of the 40 PDCD patients completed a cross-over unsupervised CCT program of simple, serious video games (versus a sham program) consisting of 14 daily sessions of approximately 20 minutes each in the patients' homes.\nCompared to the Healthy, PDNCD, and ADCD groups, the PDCD group was characterized by greater diffuse rsEEG delta (about 2-4 Hz) and theta (about 4-7 Hz) source activity. The PDCD patients who underwent the CCT program showed an improvement in video game performance and a reduction in these delta-theta source activities after this program compared to the control condition.\nIn conclusion, these results suggest that the 2-week CCT program in home telemonitoring may mitigate the abnormal “slowing” of rsEEG rhythms in PDCD patients, possibly enhancing the regulation of brain arousal and quiet vigilance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5313df9e85053437f6b1c67b346fae32951196713920549f7e7a9d2856f0189","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
