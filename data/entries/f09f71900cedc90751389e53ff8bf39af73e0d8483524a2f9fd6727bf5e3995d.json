Typically, when used in an SEM, EBIC is very useful to map the quality of solar cell devices (e.g. measuring the density of defects) as the beam scans the local beam-induced electron-hole creation cross-section across the sample [<a href=\"#ozae044.067-B1\">1</a>]. In the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), secondary electron (SE) EBIC (SEEBIC) imaging is applied to study diverse electronic materials, such as mapping the electron density in 2D materials or visualizing the formation of conducting paths in resistive switching devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.067-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.067-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f09f71900cedc90751389e53ff8bf39af73e0d8483524a2f9fd6727bf5e3995d","category":"Environment"}
