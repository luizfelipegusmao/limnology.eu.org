Nickel is an earth-abundant metal that has shown promise as a replacement for Cr-based systems. We find that stoichiometric Ni doping of CeO<sub>2</sub> aerogel beneficially impacts catalytic conversion of CO into H<sub>2</sub> with suppressed methanol production up to 5 %<sub>at</sub> Ni in the WGS reaction. However, the exact catalytic pathways caused by atomically-dispersed Ni are not known but can be attributed to both the highly-porous, covalently-bonded CeO<sub>2</sub> aerogel structure and its prevention of aggregation and oxidation of elemental Ni into the less-catalytically-desirable NiO<sub>x</sub> species. Using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) on Ni-doped CeO<sub>2</sub>, or Ni­<sub>x</sub>Ce­<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, aerogels, we identify ∼ 1nm Ni-rich regions within a homogenously-dispersed Ni-containing background and probe related oxidation states of the Ni-rich site-specific regions by comparison to undoped CeO<sub>2</sub> aerogel.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"92cf918391e2aefa4676e389b979ccdf47eede403d41b9bca945347e24b91d05","category":"Environment"}
