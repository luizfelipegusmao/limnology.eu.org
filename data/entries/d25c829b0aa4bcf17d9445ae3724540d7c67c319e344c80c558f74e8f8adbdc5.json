{"title":"Fixed-time Consensus-based Attitude Control of Large Telescope On-orbit Construction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0929/v1","date":1715676356000,"content":"This study investigates the fixed-time consensus-based attitude control problem for large telescope on-orbit construction subject to discrete-time communication, unknown tiny disturbance torque, model uncertainty, and actuator saturation under an undirected communication graph. Motivated by the need to save wireless communication resources, the communication scheme was designed to exploit interference, which can save communication resources in proportion to the number of modular unit mirrors. Then, a fixed-time observer with discrete-time communication was proposed, which also handles the unknown channel attenuation problem when exploiting information interference. Moreover, based on the backstepping procedure and the suitably defined adaptive compensation law, the fixed-time attitude consensus control law was proposed to handle unknown tiny disturbance torque, model uncertainty, and actuator saturation. Finally, comparative simulation results were provided to verify the effectiveness of the fixed-time observer and proposed fixed-time control law.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d25c829b0aa4bcf17d9445ae3724540d7c67c319e344c80c558f74e8f8adbdc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
