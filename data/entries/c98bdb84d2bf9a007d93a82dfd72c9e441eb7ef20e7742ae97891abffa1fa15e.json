{"title":"Assessing malnutrition in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Diagnostic protocol for the development and validation of a new nutritional assessment tool","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300067","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Pengpeng Wang, Kim Lam Soh, Salimah Binti Japar, Huzwah binti Khazaai, Jinlian Liao, Yanping Ying, Chuanyi Ning, Li Xue, Xiao Pan</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>There is currently no gold standard or specific nutritional assessment tool to assess malnutrition in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Our study aims to develop a new nutritional assessment tool for NPC patients.</p> Methods and analysis <p>NPC patients will be required to complete a risk factor questionnaire after obtaining their informed consent. The risk factor questionnaire will be used to collect potential risk factors for malnutrition. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses will be used to identify risk factors for malnutrition. A new nutritional assessment tool will be developed based on risk factors. The new toolâ€™s performance will be assessed by calibration and discrimination. The bootstrapping will be used for internal validation of the new tool. In addition, external validation will be performed by recruiting NPC patients from another hospital.</p> Discussion <p>If the new tool is validated to be effective, it will potentially save medical staff time in assessing malnutrition and improve their work efficiency. Additionally, it may reduce the incidence of malnutrition and its adverse consequences.</p> Strengths and limitations of this study <p>The study will comprehensively analyze demographic data, disease status, physical examination, and blood sampling to identify risk factors for malnutrition. Furthermore, the new tool will be systematically evaluated, and validated to determine their effectiveness. However, the restricted geographical range may limit the generalizability of the results to other ethnicities. Additionally, the study does not analyze subjective indicators such as psychology.</p> Ethics and dissemination <p>The ethical approval was granted by the Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (NO. 2022-KT-GUI WEI-005) and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (NO. 2022-KY-0752).</p> Clinical trial registration number <p>ChiCTR2300071550.</p>","author":"Pengpeng Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c98bdb84d2bf9a007d93a82dfd72c9e441eb7ef20e7742ae97891abffa1fa15e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
