The Syilx Okanagan Nation Alliance (SONA) has led voices of concern regarding the impacts of diminishing Sockeye Salmon numbers on the ecosystem health of the sq,$$ \\overset{,}{\\mathrm{q}} $$awsitkʷ|Okanagan River (s|OR), a tributary of the CR. In the early 2000s efforts commenced to rehabilitate the s|OR Sockeye population. These efforts have seen the population rise from a running average of 40,000 to 200,000. However, the contemporary spawning capacity of the s|OR is unknown, and this metric is critical to guide the conservation and restoration of this keystone species. We employed a spawning capacity model relating fish length and gravel size to spawning potential. We collected substrate data at 49 sites throughout our 37-km study area, and used fish length and egg numbers from <i>n</i> = 269 Sockeye Salmon to establish s|OR specific fecundity metrics. The model estimated the s|OR has the capacity to support 147,687 (±33,346) Sockeye spawners, in its current condition. Whilst our model has limitations, we suggest a minimum escapement of 147,687 Sockeye spawners ought to be passed to the s|OR per annum. These fish will have broad ecosystem benefits and will be culturally beneficial to SONA peoples. Finally, continued restoration of s|OR habitat should enhance opportunities for Sockeye Salmon to continue their remarkable recovery.</p>","author":"Antóin M. O'Sullivan, \nKarilyn I.
