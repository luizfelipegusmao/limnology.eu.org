For electrons to transmit the frozen biological sample, the thickness of the sample must be a few hundred nanometers [<a href=\"#ozae044.371-B1\">1</a>]. Focused ion beam with a cryo-stage (cryo-FIB) has been utilized to produce the thin samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.371-B2\">2</a>]. Generally, the plunge- or high-pressure frozen samples are imaged at first by a fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooling stage to determine regions for lamella-milling. Then, the sample is transferred to the cryo-FIB (typically combined with scanning electron microscope column). The areas determined with the fluorescence microscope are identified with the SEM and milled with the FIB. After producing lamellae, a TEM grid with the lamellae is transferred to the cryo-TEM, and imaging the lamellae are performed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fc29fed9a4aa8a645f6a2ee03e875341e1559508545f6480109a12ed9d358f08","category":"Environment"}
