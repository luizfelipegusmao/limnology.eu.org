The data collection methods were: questionnaires and focus groups conducted from September 2021 to February 2022. A path analysis model analyzed factors influencing wildlife tourists' decisions. This study proposed four wildlife tourist groups: true wildlife, researchers, generalists, and tag-along. Tourists' wildlife tourism programs and models have been proposed to respond to the needs of each wildlife tourist with mindfulness and conservation as the focus. The results indicated that the wildlife tourism development in this area must use value-creation with conservative wildlife activities and attractions. Based on these results concerning tourism development, wildlife tourist types should be considered significant concerns of wildlife tourist activities. For effective tourism development, priority should be given to developing facilities and providing quality services.</p>","author":"Nongluck Manowaluilou, \nThanakrit Sangchoey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"4e92ad413bf408e371e9b295bd29289ba53543e1f768347a201bf3309dab102e","category":"Environment"}
