{"title":"Physical Activity and Executive Functioning in Children and Adolescents with Congenital Heart Defects: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0296/v1","date":1722846485000,"content":"Children and adolescents (C&amp;A) with congenital heart defects (CHD) have decreased functional capacity and executive functioning (EF) due to brain abnormalities and decreased oxygen saturation. Exercise may improve EF via increased cognitive demands and cerebral blood supply. The purpose of this review was to identify current evidence describing the impact of physical activity (PA) interventions on EF in C&amp;A with CHD. The following databases were searched from 2014-present: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, CENTRAL, and PsycInfo. Article inclusion criteria consisted of participants from birth to 18 years with CHD, interventions related to PA, and EF as an outcome. Articles were excluded if: adults were included, translation to English was impossible, and full access was unavailable. As a result of the review, 431 studies were screened. Three articles underwent full analyzation and only one met all criteria and this study found that with exercise there were significant improvements on self-reported cognitive functioning and parent-reported social functioning. Despite theoretical benefits, only one published study has investigated the role that PA interventions have on EF in C&amp;A with CHD. Further investigation of the effect PA interventions have on EF in C&amp;A with CHD is needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19842174b5a0cbe33b253bbd954ccc8730da441bc1aaff5961869adde8d4d212","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
