{"title":"Exploring End-of-Life Care for Patients with Breast Cancer, Dementia or Heart Failure: A Register-Based Study of Individual and Institutional Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1388/v1","date":1711122815000,"content":"Objective: To examine variations in end-of-life care for breast cancer, heart failure, and dementia patients. Data and methods: Data from four Norwegian health registries were linked using a personal identification number. Longitudinal trends over 365 days and the type of care on the final day of life were analyzed using descriptive techniques and logistic regression analysis. Results: Patients with dementia were most commonly placed in nursing homes, while patients with heart failure and breast cancer were more frequently hospitalized. Breast cancer and heart failure patients had a higher likelihood of dying at home. The presence of general practitioners increased the probability of home-based end-of-life care for cancer patients, while non-physician healthcare workers increased the likelihood of home-based care for the other patient groups. Conclusion: Diagnoses, individual characteristics, and service availability are all associated with the place of death in end-of-life care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b021202e939a8024d764ed7cf1838cffdbee1e6ea4694575b6cd10079013b616","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
