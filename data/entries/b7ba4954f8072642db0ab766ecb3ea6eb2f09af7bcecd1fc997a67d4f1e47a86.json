{"title":"Urban Green Infrastructures as Tools for Urban Interconnection: The Case of San Bartolomeo District in Cagliari, Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1955/v1","date":1729777247000,"content":"Contemporary urban areas are often characterized by various forms of enclaves, isolated from their surrounding geographical context. Urban Green Infrastructures provide an opportunity to open these enclaves, establishing physical and functional connections with the broader city, while also contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study examines the district of San Bartolomeo in the Italian city of Cagliari as an example of urban enclave and employs a participatory planning process to design a project that transforms it into a hub open to the wider city community. The result is a neighborhood shaped by its community, where social, economic, and environmental needs are balanced, fostering constant interaction between residents and the city as a whole.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7ba4954f8072642db0ab766ecb3ea6eb2f09af7bcecd1fc997a67d4f1e47a86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
