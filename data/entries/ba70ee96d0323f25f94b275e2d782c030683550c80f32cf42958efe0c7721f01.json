{"title":"Key factors for BIM Implementation in the Context of ESG and SDGs Integration: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1536/v1","date":1726744807000,"content":"Driven by global sustainability trends, Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology is in-creasingly becoming a key tool in the construction industry to improve efficiency and sustaina-bility.This study aims to identify the key factors affecting BIM implementation in the context of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to construct a theoretical framework for BIM implementation based on these factors.To achieve this objective, this study used a systematic literature review (SLR) method to systematically review the relevant literature between 2009 and 2024, and identified 16 key factors from the selected 406 studies through keyword co-occurrence analysis (using VOSviewer) and data coding.These key factors include:Top Management Support for ESG and SDGs,Alignment of SDGs,ESG Integra-tion,Technical Support,BIM Software,BIM Hardware,Structural Adjustment &amp; Collabora-tion,Capacity Building,Change Management,Skill and Attitude,Educational Training and Devel-opment,Incentive Mechanism,Roles &amp; Responsibilities,Sustainable Construction Practic-es,Policies and Regulations,Resource Efficiency.This study categorises these factors under the STOPE framework (Strategy, Technology, Organisation, People, Environment) and proposes a theoretical implementation framework for BIM accordingly. The findings not only provide a practical guiding framework for the sustainable development of construction companies in the context of ESG and SDG integration, but also lay a solid theoretical foundation for future empiri-cal research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba70ee96d0323f25f94b275e2d782c030683550c80f32cf42958efe0c7721f01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
