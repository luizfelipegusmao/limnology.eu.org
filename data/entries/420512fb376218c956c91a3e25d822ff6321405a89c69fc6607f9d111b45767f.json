{"title":"A trick for a treat: False smut pathogen manipulates plant defense to gain access to rice flower","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1598/7608879?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span>Once a minor disease, rice false smut, caused by <span>Ustilaginoidea virens</span>, has recently become one of the most important diseases in rice-growing areas of the world. In India, yield loss due to false smut reaches up to 49%, while in China, the average yield loss accounts for 158.6 million kg/year (<a href=\"#koae048-B3\">Sun et al. 2020</a>). In addition to affecting food security, the false smut pathogen threatens food safety by producing mycotoxins such as ustiloxins and ustilaginoidins (<a href=\"#koae048-B5\">Zhou et al. 2012</a>). Control of rice false smut primarily relies on the application of fungicides. <span>U. virens</span> is a flower-infecting fungus that infects stamen and pistil by invading via the gap between lemma and palea. However, how rice flowers defend and how the pathogen overcomes plant defenses are largely unknown.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"420512fb376218c956c91a3e25d822ff6321405a89c69fc6607f9d111b45767f","category":"Environment"}
