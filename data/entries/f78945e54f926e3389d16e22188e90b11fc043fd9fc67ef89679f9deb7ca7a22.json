{"title":"Quantum Solution of Classical Turbulence. Decaying Energy Spectrum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1012/v8","date":1712569003000,"content":"This paper brings to fruition recently found \\cite{migdal2023exact} exact reduction of decaying turbulence in the Navier-Stokes equation in $3 + 1$ dimensions to a Number Theory problem of finding the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble. We reformulate the Euler ensemble as a Markov chain and show the equivalence of this formulation to the \\textbf{quantum} statistical theory of $N$ fermions on a ring, with an external field related to the random fractions of $\\pi$. We find the solution of this system in the turbulent limit $N\\to \\infty, \\nu \\to 0$ in terms of a complex trajectory (instanton) providing a saddle point to the path integral over the density of these fermions. This results in an analytic formula for the observable correlation function of vorticity in wavevector space. This is a full solution of decaying turbulence from the first principle without approximations or fitted parameters. The energy spectrum decays as $k^{-\\frac{7}{2}}$. We compute resulting integrals in \\Mathematica{} and present effective index $n(t) = -t\\partial_t \\log E $ for the energy decay as a function of time Fig.\\ref{fig::NPlot}. The asymptotic value of the effective index in energy decay $n(\\infty) = \\frac{5}{4}$, but the universal function $n(t)$ is neither constant nor linear.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f78945e54f926e3389d16e22188e90b11fc043fd9fc67ef89679f9deb7ca7a22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
