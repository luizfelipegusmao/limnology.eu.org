However, substantial inelastic scattering can alter the course of the experiment, i.e. via beam-induced heating [<a href=\"#ozae044.1038-B1\">1</a>] or radiolysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.1038-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1038-B3\">3</a>]. Particularly the latter drives redox and acidity equilibria towards non-standard conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.1038-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1038-B4\">4</a>]. Additional parameters such as liquid flow affect these processes further [<a href=\"#ozae044.1038-B5\">5</a>], demanding for precise parameter assessment during experimental design and interpretation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"64476dda6675b0a4fc4bd36c3165fdcf912af7cbfcfb2cb683506fdbf03d5847","category":"Environment"}
