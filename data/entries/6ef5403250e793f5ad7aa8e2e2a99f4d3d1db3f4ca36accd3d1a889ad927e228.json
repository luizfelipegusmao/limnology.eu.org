{"title":"Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi as Biostimulant and /or Biocontrol Agents? A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0305/v1","date":1717591655000,"content":"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil microorganisms living in symbiosis with most terrestrial plants. They are known to improve plant tolerance to numerous abiotic and biotic stresses through the systemic induction of resistance mechanisms. With the aim of developing a more sustainable agriculture, reducing the use of chemical inputs is becoming of a major concern. After providing an overview on the AMF history, phylogeny, development cycle and the symbiosis benefits, the current review aims at exploring the potential of AMF as biostimulants and/or biocontrol agents. Nowadays, AMF inoculums are already increasingly used as biostimulants, improving mineral nutrient plant acquisition. However, their role as promising tool into the biocontrol market, as alternative to chemical phytosanitary products, is underexplored and discussed. Thus, in the current review, we will address the mechanisms of mycorrhized plant resistance to biotic stresses induced by AMF, and highlight the various factors in favor of inoculum application, but also the challenges that remain to be overcame.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ef5403250e793f5ad7aa8e2e2a99f4d3d1db3f4ca36accd3d1a889ad927e228","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
