{"title":"Evaluation of MCL-1 as a prognostic factor in canine mammary gland tumors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306398","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Jaeho Cho, Heaji Chung, Sungin Lee, Wan Hee Kim</p>\r\n\r\nMyeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), which belongs to the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 family protein, is overexpressed in various cancers and is associated with cell immortality, malignant transformation, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis in humans. However, the significance of MCL-1 in canine mammary gland tumors (MGTs) remains unknown. This study aimed to examine MCL-1 expression in normal canine mammary glands and tumors and to assess its correlation with clinical and histologic variables. In total, 111 samples were examined, including 12 normal mammary gland tissues, 51 benign MGTs, and 48 malignant MGTs. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 53% of benign tumors and 75% of malignant tumors exhibited high MCL-1 expression, whereas only 8% of normal mammary glands exhibited high MCL-1 expression. High MCL-1 expression correlated with tumor malignancy (p &lt; 0.001), large tumor size (&gt; 3 cm) (p = 0.005), high Ki-67 expression (p = 0.046), and metastasis (p = 0.027). Survival curve analysis of dogs with malignant MGTs demonstrated a significant association between high MCL-1 expression and shorter median overall survival (p = 0.027) and progression-free survival (p = 0.014). Our study identified MCL-1 as a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in canine MGTs.","author":"Jaeho Cho","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"565153ed0f25e561998e4acb2b7b94ffa3db3d4027ebb1ad5b934a6c39826ed7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
