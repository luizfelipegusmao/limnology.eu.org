{"title":"Cost-Effectiveness of GaitSmart and an Artificial Intelligence Solution for Rehabilitation of Patients with Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis in Older Population in the United Kingdom","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1251/v1","date":1716190685000,"content":"Background: GaitSmart (GS) is a sensor-based digital medical device that can be used with the integrated app vGym to provide a personalised rehabilitation programme for older people undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aimed to determine whether the GS intervention used in the rehabilitation of older people undergoing THA or TKA is potentially cost-effective compared to the current standard of care (SoC). \nMethods: Decision-analytic modelling was conducted to estimate cost-effectiveness over a seventeen- week time horizon, from an NHS perspective.  UK clinical and cost data from the GaitSmart randomised clinical trial was used to obtain input parameters, and sensitivity analysis was performed to address uncertainty.  \nResults: Over a seventeen-week time horizon, GS incurred cost savings of Â£450.56 and a 0.02 gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to the SoC. These results indicate that GS is the dominant intervention because the device demonstrated greater effectiveness and lower costs.  Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our results.\nConclusion: GS appears to offer short-term efficiency benefits and demonstrates cost-effectiveness for the improvement of gait in people undergoing THA or TKA, compared to the SoC. These findings provided new evidence to inform policymakers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b77f819becb5b8c2b1ae9f12e75b7ac2fec4de050ba80ee52e0a98bf441a507","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
