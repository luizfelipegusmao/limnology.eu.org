{"title":"Josephson Junction Dynamics as a Ride on a Roller Coaster","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1913/v1","date":1729762220000,"content":"We discuss the dynamics of a roller coaster cart driven by a constant force along the \nsuspended track of a winding roller coaster. The track is assumed arbitrarily long and specially \nshaped. It is made by semicircular track portions, in the form of valleys and hills, standing perfectly \nvertical in the same plane. This is a mechanical analog of a Josephson junction electrodynamics. To \ndemonstrate the explanatory potential of the analogy, we focus particularly on the conditions of \nde-trapping of the cart from one of the valleys of the track. This mechanical process has its analog in \na non-noise-generated premature switching to the finite voltage state of a Josephson junction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53866356aff94e865c05d8d8d1a2934b6e6ea2e98e3aca190e6e96c5760f1ed5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
