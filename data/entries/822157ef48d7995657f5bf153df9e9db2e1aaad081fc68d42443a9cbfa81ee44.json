{"title":"Machine Learning Discoveries of TNF-X Synergy in ETC-1922159 Treated Colorectal Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0471/v1","date":1725533234000,"content":"Often, in biology, we are faced with the problem of exploring relevant unknown biological hypotheses in the form of myriads of combinations of factors/genes/proteins that might be affecting the pathway under certain conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, many genes were found up and down regu- lated, individually. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. These rankings reveal which TNF-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. If found true, oncologists can further test the combination of interest in wet lab and determine the mechanism of functioning between the TNF and X. In this research work, we cover combinations of TNF with Wnt, mucin (MUC), six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 4 (STEAP4), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2) family and BCL family.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"822157ef48d7995657f5bf153df9e9db2e1aaad081fc68d42443a9cbfa81ee44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
