{"title":"Comparison of a hand-held high-end resolution infrared thermography (FLIR P640) and a smartphone infrared thermographic device (FLIR One) for the assessment of skin surface temperature after anaesthetising the median nerve in Healthy horses","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309603","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Gustavo Ferlini Agne, Kellie Adamson, Leah McGlinchey, Olena Kravchuk, Luiz Santos, John Schumacher</p>\r\n\r\nAccuracy of a median nerve block is normally assessed by testing skin sensitivity on the medial and dorsal aspects of fetlock and pastern. The present study evaluated subjective and objective analysis of skin surface temperature obtained with two different infrared (IR) thermography cameras (a high-end [FLIR P640] and a smartphone IR thermography device [FLIR One®]) before and after anaesthesia of the median nerve. Thermographic images were obtained at 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after performing a median nerve block with 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride. The subjective analysis of thermographic images using the FLIR P640 camera found assessors had &gt;50% agreement for the presence of a nerve block (p&lt;0.01) based on assessment of skin temperature within the expected dermatome of the median nerve. The objective analysis found skin temperature increases in the treated leg using the FLIR One® in the dorsal fetlock, dorsal pastern and medial pastern at 60 minutes, and the lateral pastern at 90 minutes (p&lt;0.05). The treated leg, imaged using the FLIR P640 camera, had increases in skin temperature at the medial aspect of the fetlock at 60 minutes and lateral pastern at 90 minutes (p&lt;0.05). Images obtained with the P640 camera had higher resolution and finer thermal detail. The images obtained with the FLIR One® camera had a wider temperature range with overall higher temperature measurements than the images obtained using the P640 camera (p&lt;0.001). Skin temperatures in horses should be interpreted with caution when using the FLIR One® camera. Furthermore, the FLIR One® device detected an increase in skin surface temperature in both treated and non-treated legs and should not be used for assessment of a median nerve block. Infrared thermography appears to be useful for determining the presence of a high regional nerve block such as the median nerve block by observing increased temperatures of the skin surface after perineural anaesthesia. Further studies with a larger sample size as well as investigating the use of thermography for assessment of other regional nerve blocks are warranted.","author":"Gustavo Ferlini Agne","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"676866d77c9a5eed858ad1f5a958246ac01b7fb6f73001c374ead467fbbc160b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
