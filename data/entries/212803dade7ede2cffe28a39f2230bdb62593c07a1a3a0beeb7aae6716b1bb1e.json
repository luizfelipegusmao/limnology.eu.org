{"title":"Taxonomy, Biology, Symbionts, Omics, and Management of Rhynchophorus Palm Weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Dryophthorinae)","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-013023-121139?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Palm weevils, <span>Rhynchophorus</span> spp., are destructive pests of native, ornamental, and agricultural palm species. Of the 10 recognized species, two of the most injurious species, <span>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</span> and <span>Rhynchophorus palmarum</span>, both of which have spread beyond their native range, are the best studied. Due to its greater global spread and damage to edible date industries in the Middle East, <span>R. ferrugineus</span> has received more research interest. Integrated pest management programs utilize traps baited with aggregation pheromone, removal of infested palms, and insecticides. However, weevil control is costly, development of resistance to insecticides is problematic, and program efficacy can be impaired because early detection of infestations is difficult. The genome of <span>R. ferrugineus</span> has been sequenced, and omics research is providing insight into pheromone communication and changes in volatile and metabolism profiles of weevil-infested palms. We outline how such developments could lead to new control strategies and early detection tools.</p></div>","author":"Mark S. Hoddle, Binu Antony, Hamadttu A.F. El-Shafie, M.
