{"title":"Comparison of Biowaste Fillers Extracted from Fish Scales and Collagen on the Mechanical Properties of High-Density Polyurethane Foams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1464/v1","date":1726738306000,"content":"The utilization of biowaste fillers in the development of high-density polyurethane (PU) foams has gained significant attention due to environmental and economic benefits. This study investigates the mechanical properties of PU foams reinforced with biowaste fillers extracted from fish scales (FS) and fish scale derived collagen (FSC). The fish scales and collagen were characterized for their composition and integrated into PU foams at various loadings. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, hardness, and density were evaluated. ANOVA was used to analyze the mean values. Bonferroni tests were used to identify differences between the filler materials (Î±=.05). The tensile strength increases with increase in filler content for both FS (59.48 Kpa) and FSC (65.43Kpa). No differences were observed between FS and FSC in tensile strength. Significance differences were observed between the FS and FSC in both hardness and density (p&amp;lt;0.001). The results demonstrated that both fillers enhanced the mechanical properties of PU foams, with collagen-reinforced foams showing superior performance. This suggests that collagen and fish scales can be effective biowaste fillers for developing environmentally friendly PU foams with enhanced mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b4e4e2ecb2eafa5c864f5cc9a8c40d6f5023b43c4d17115e86e26e808a4e3fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
