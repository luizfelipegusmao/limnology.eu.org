{"title":"Traditional Plant‚ÄêDerived Compounds Inhibit Cell Migration and Induce Novel Cytoskeletal Effects in Glioblastoma Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0784/v1","date":1710342176000,"content":"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are aggressive and invasive cancers of the brain, associated with high rates of tumor recurrence and poor patient outcomes despite initial treatment. Targeting cell migration is therefore of interest in highly invasive cancers such as GBMs, to prevent tumor dissemination and regrowth. One current aim of GBM research focusses on assessing anti-migratory properties of novel or repurposed inhibitors, including plant-based drugs which display anti-cancer properties. We investigated the potential anti-migratory activity of plant-based products with known cytotoxic effects in cancers, using a range of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) migration and invasion assays as well as immunofluorescence microscopy to determine specific anti-migratory and phenotypic effects of three plant-derived compounds, Turmeric, Indigo and Magnolia bark, on established glioma cell lines. Migrastatic activity was observed in all three drugs, with Turmeric exerting the most inhibitory effect on GBM cell migration into scratches and from the spheroid edge at all timepoints investigated (p &lt; 0.001). We also observed novel cytoskeletal phenotypes affecting actin and focal adhesion dynamics. By determining the migrastatic activity of Turmeric, Indigo and Magnolia on GBM cell migration, we demonstrate a potential role for Turmeric as a novel GBM anti-migratory therapeutic, in combination with the current standard of care, to prevent tumor recurrence and promote patient survival.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb08fe9a7330f06074124e382ed0a233b60ddf2f1b1ff0fa6de297537f898cde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
