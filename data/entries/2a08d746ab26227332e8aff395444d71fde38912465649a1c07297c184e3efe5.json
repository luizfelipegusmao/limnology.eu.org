Adolescents begin to explore their sexual identity, form intimate relationships, and learn to manage their emotions in new and complex contexts. This study aims to analyze the prevalence of habits and behaviors related to the affective-sexual health of adolescents in the 4th year of ESO, identifying risk factors, comparing behaviors and risks, monitoring these behaviors, analyzing pornography consumption, and evaluating the use of the in-ternet as a source of sexual information. Method: Descriptive cross-sectional study using questionnaires. Participants are 4th-year ESO students from a school in the Baix Llobregat province (Catalonia) aged between 14 and 18 years. Descriptive and bivariate statistical analyses were conducted using the Chi-square test and p-value calculations with R Project software. Frequency and percentage analyses were also used to describe the health behav-iors of the participants. Results: The study reveals that girls have better knowledge of the contraceptive pill and male condom than boys. Sexual initiation and condom use man-agement vary between genders, with girls being more capable of persuading their partners to use them. Pornography consumption also shows significant differences in age of initia-tion and frequency between boys and girls. Conclusions: The study on adolescent affectiv-ity and sexuality reveals knowledge about contraceptives, early sexual initiation, and high pornography consumption, highlighting the need for early and diverse affective-sexual education, youth empowerment, and media misinformation management to promote safer and healthier behaviors in municipal public health.\nKeywords: Adolescents, Sexuality, Sexual Health, Pornography Consumption, Contracep-tive Knowledge, Gender Differences","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a08d746ab26227332e8aff395444d71fde38912465649a1c07297c184e3efe5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
