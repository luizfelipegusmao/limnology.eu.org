{"title":"A Note on Odd Perfect Numbers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0547/v1","date":1728379094000,"content":"This paper definitively settles the longstanding conjecture regarding odd perfect numbers. A perfect number is one whose sum of divisors equals itself doubled. While Euclid's method for constructing even perfect numbers is well-known, the existence of odd ones has remained elusive. By employing elementary techniques and analyzing the properties of the divisor sum function, we conclusively prove that no odd perfect numbers exist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02d67c0323057782691dd2219af59b8322423d0a46da7b509cc2e7dded0fccbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
