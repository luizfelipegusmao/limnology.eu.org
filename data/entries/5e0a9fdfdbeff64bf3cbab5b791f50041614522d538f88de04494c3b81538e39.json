{"title":"Insights Into the Role of Porosity in Lithium-Ion Battery Electrode Performance Using the TESCAN Unitom HR Micro-CT","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/4/30/7718043?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Use of lithium-ion batteries is extensive with many applications. One of the most common analyses performed in quality control for battery production is the characterization of porosity after calendaring. In this study we report the use of micro-CT to evaluate porosity at the micron scale to enable geometrical quantification of the copper anode current collector. Micro-CT resolution permitted analysis of particle disintegration and delamination from the current collector, which provided a starting point for porosity characterization. Segmentation analysis revealed an average porosity below 30% with a wide range of pore sizes from 1.2 µm to 9.6 µm. This information is critical for the optimization of electrical resistance and may improve the economy of production by reducing the time for battery cell soaking with electrolyte.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"5e0a9fdfdbeff64bf3cbab5b791f50041614522d538f88de04494c3b81538e39","category":"Environment"}
