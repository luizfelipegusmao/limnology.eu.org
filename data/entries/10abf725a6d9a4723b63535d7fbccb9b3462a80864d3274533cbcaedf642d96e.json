{"title":"From Muscle-Bone Concept to The ArthroMyoFascial Complex: A Pragmatic Anatomical Concept for Physio and Manual Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1773/v1","date":1716811663000,"content":"Background: In physiotherapy, a classic muscle-bone concept is used to translate basic and clinical anatomy. By defining the anatomical structures from superficial to deeper layers which frame the ArthroMyoFascial complex, our aim is to offer clinicians a comprehensive concept of fasciae within the muscle-bone concept. Method: Narrative review and ultrasound observation. Results: Based on literature and ultrasound skeletonization, the ArthroMyoFascial complex has been defined. This model clarifies fascial continuity at the joint level, describing anatomical structures from skin to deeper layers, including superficial fascia, deep fascia, myofascia including skeletal muscle fibers, and arthrofascia all connected via connective tissue linkages. This model enhances understanding of the muscle-bone concept within the larger ArthroMyoFascial complex. Conclusion: The ArthroMyofascial complex consists of multiple layers from superficial to deeper anatomical structures, namely the skin, superficial fascia, deep fascia, myofascia including muscle fibers, and arthrofascia, all linked within a connective tissue matrix. This model indicates that it is a force-transmitting system from the skin to the bone. This information is crucial for manual thera-pists, including physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, and massage therapists, as they all work with fasciae within the musculoskeletal domain. Understanding fascia within the mus-cle-bone concept enhances clinical practice, aiding in therapeutic testing, treatment, reporting, and multidisciplinary communication, which is vital for musculoskeletal and orthopedic rehabilitation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10abf725a6d9a4723b63535d7fbccb9b3462a80864d3274533cbcaedf642d96e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
