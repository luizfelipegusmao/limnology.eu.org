{"title":"The effects of TiO2, ZnO, IONs and Al2O3 metallic nanoparticles on the CYP1A1 and NBN transcripts in rat liver","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae034/7636846?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Introduction</div>Metal oxide nanoparticles are currently used widely in many aspects of human and animal life with broad prospects for biomedical purposes. The present work was carried out to investigate the effects of orally administrated TiO2NPs, ZnONPs, IONs and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>NPs on the mRNA expression level of CYP 1A1 and <span>NBN</span> in the rat liver.<div>Materials and Methods</div>Four groups of male Albino rats were given their respective treatment orally for 60 days in a dose of 1/20 of the LD50 TiO2NPs (600 mg/Kg b.wt/day), ZnONPs (340 mg/Kg b.wt/day), IONs (200 mg/kg b.wt/day) and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>NPs (100 mg/Kg b.wt/day) and a fifth group served as a control group.<div>Rresults</div>The mRNA level of CYP 1A1 and <span>NBN</span> showed up-regulation in all the NPs-treated groups relative to the control group. ZnONPs group recorded the highest expression level while the TiO2NPs group showed the lowest expression level transcript. Conclusion:The toxic effects produced by these nanoparticles were more pronounced in the case of zinc oxide, followed by aluminum oxide, iron oxide nanoparticles and titanium dioxide, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"0b6f6c5069865e334990b1e6154a415eed830c2873575a532a0079f57a523345","category":"Environment"}
