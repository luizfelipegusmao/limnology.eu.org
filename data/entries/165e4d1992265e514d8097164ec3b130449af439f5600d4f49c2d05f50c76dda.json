{"title":"Financial Impact of Personal Electric Transportation Platforms in an Urban Area: A Cohort of Injuries over 18 Months at a Level 1 Urban Trauma Center","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0448/v1","date":1715160116000,"content":"The use of e-scooters and e-bicycles has been on the rise with an increased medical and financial burden. Our purpose was to identify risk factors for increased medical charges and recommend appropriate steps. We studied a retrospective cohort presenting to a level 1 urban trauma center from January 2018 through July 2019 due to micro-mobility platforms. The primary outcome for comparison was total billing cost and a regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with higher cost.\nA total of 4073 patients were identified. The majority of which were males (67%), aged 20-30 years (41%). Helmet use reported in only 39.8%. Radiologic studies were performed more often in the e-bicycle group. Total billing charges amounted to 28.3 million New Israeli Shekels ($7.9 million). Average total cost was higher for e-bicycle injuries and in non-helmet users. Other factors associated with higher cost were age, and time of day 12:00-18:00. \nWe recommend that urban cities invest in infrastructure in advance to micro-mobility introduction, regulate the use of e-platforms, designate resources for education on personal protective equipment and prepare medical centers in advance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"165e4d1992265e514d8097164ec3b130449af439f5600d4f49c2d05f50c76dda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
