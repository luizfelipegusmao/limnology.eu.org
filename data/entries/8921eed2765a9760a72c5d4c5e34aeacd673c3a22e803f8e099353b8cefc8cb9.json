{"title":"287 Effects of crude glycerin supplementation of beef cattle grazing wheat pasture on forage intake and characteristics of rumen fermentation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/427/7757491?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Crude glycerin (CG), mainly composed of glycerin, is a by-product of biodiesel production. Glycerin can be utilized as a substrate of gluconeogenesis by either rapid fermentation to propionate in the rumen or can be directly absorbed through the rumen epithelial wall, resulting in the conversion to glucose in the liver. Therefore, CG supplementation may increase the energy intake of cattle grazing wheat pasture. Ruminally cannulated Angus-crossbred cows [n = 9; 564.4 ±101.6 kg initial body weight (BW)] grazing wheat pasture were utilized in a split-plot design with the objective of evaluating the effects of CG supplementation and forage maturity on forage intake and rumen fermentation characteristics. Treatment was the main plot, and stage of forage maturity was the subplot. Treatments were unsupplemented control (CON) and crude glycerin supplementation (SUP; 37.2% glycerin, DM basis) dosed at 0.11% BW (DM basis). Supplementation levels correspond to 5% of the diet, assuming forage intake of 2.2% of BW on a DM basis. The stages of wheat maturity pasture were March (MAR; vegetative stage) and April (APR; early reproductive stage). Cows grazed a single wheat pasture and were supplemented directly through the rumen cannula twice daily at 0700 and 1900 h. Forage intake in kg/d and as % of BW was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04) for SUP than CON. Ruminal pH, ammonia, and VFA concentrations, as well as proportions of VFAs, were not affected by CG supplementation (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.34; Table 1). However, ruminal pH (5.77 and 5.99 ± 0.049) and ammonia concentration (0.67 and 3.37 ± 0.307 mM) were greater, while total VFA concentration (136.3 and 110.8 ± 5.23 mM) was less (<span>P</span> = 0.01) for APR compared with MAR. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate molar proportions, as well as acetate: propionate ratio, were not affected (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.27) by the stage of wheat pasture maturity. Results indicate that crude glycerin used as an ingredient in supplementation strategies for cattle grazing wheat pasture may increase cattle energy intake without negatively affecting forage intake and ruminal fermentation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8921eed2765a9760a72c5d4c5e34aeacd673c3a22e803f8e099353b8cefc8cb9","category":"Environment"}
