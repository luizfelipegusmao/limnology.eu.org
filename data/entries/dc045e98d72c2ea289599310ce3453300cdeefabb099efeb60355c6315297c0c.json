{"title":"Are Teachers&rsquo; Time Resources Scarce? The Association between Teachers&rsquo; Time Poverty and Job Burnout: The Mediating Effect of Mental Health Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0125/v1","date":1717496608000,"content":"Teachers’ time resources are becoming increasingly scarce and time poverty will have a direct impact on the long-term sustainability of their professional development. However, the current state of teachers’ time poverty and its potential harmful consequences are unclear. Therefore, this research conducts two cross-sectional studies to investigate the current situation and group differences in time poverty among Chinese teachers (Sample 1), as well as the influence of teachers’ time poverty on job burnout (Sample 2). The results indicate that: (1) there is a high level of time poverty among teachers; (2) there is no significant difference in gender, teaching years, or teaching section, and there is a significant difference in teaching responsibilities; (3) time poverty could positively and significantly predict job burnout, and job burnout could positively and significantly predict mental health; (4) mental health factors (including depression, anxiety and stress) play the mediating role in the relationship between teachers’ time poverty and job burnout. To create a sustainable development environment for teachers, it is suggested that teachers improve time management skills and establish a self-regulation mechanism; schools should clarify the boundaries of teachers’ work and respect their right to rest; and society should provide positive and adequate spiritual support.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc045e98d72c2ea289599310ce3453300cdeefabb099efeb60355c6315297c0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
