{"title":"Integration of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) for Smart Manufacturing: State-of-Art and Future Opportunities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1271/v1","date":1718877116000,"content":"Industry 4.0 (I4.0) epitomizes the nexus of technological evolution and manufacturing process enhancements, underpinned by four critical pillars: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twins (DT), the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Cloud Computing (CC). Through the lens of the German Reference Architectural Model Industrie (RAMI) 4.0, these components are integral to fostering Smart Manufacturing (SM) practices. In conjunction, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) facilitates seamless inter-company communication and enables adaptability to fluctuating market demands. This paper delves into the structural intricacies of AAS and SM within the RAMI 4.0 framework, unveiling three distinct implementation strategies. Furthermore, it meticulously scrutinizes challenges that hinder the full realization of I4.0 potential, such as interoperability, security concerns, and standardized communication protocols. By examining these models and identifying current barriers, the study illuminates pathways for future research, particularly in enhancing the integration of AAS and SM systems, ensuring robust security measures, and advocating for the development of universal standards. This exploration aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on I4.0, proposing avenues for advancing manufacturing technologies and operational frameworks in alignment with the principles of RAMI 4.0.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1cef29651e4bda2f2e79e44cd1052e1a9b746cf7f73f0594e651d4fa758138c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
