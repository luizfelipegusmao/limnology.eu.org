{"title":"Enzyme Catalysis for Sustainable Value Creation using Renewable Biobased Resources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0784/v1","date":1723451341000,"content":"Enzyme catalysis has traditionally been used by various human cultures for creating value, long before its basic concepts have been uncovered, by preparing useful products through the trans-formation of raw materials available from natural resources. Tremendous scientific and techno-logical progress has been accumulated globally in understanding what constitutes an enzyme, what reactions enzymes can catalyze, and how to search, develop, apply and improve enzymes to make desired products. The exquisite properties of enzymes as nature's preferred catalysts, such as high selectivity, diversity and adaptability, enable their optimal work, whether in single reactions or in multiple reactions. Excellent opportunities for resource efficient manufacturing of compounds needed are provided by the actions of enzymes working in reaction cascades and  pathways within the same reaction space, like molecular robots along a production line. Enzyme catalysis plays an increasing role for industrial innovation and responsible production in various areas, such as green and sustainable chemistry, industrial or white biotechnology. Sources of inspiration can be current manufacturing or supply chain challenges, the treasure of natural enzymes or the opportunities of engineering tailor-made enzymes. Making best use of the power of enzyme catalysis is essential for changing the way how current products are manufactured, how renewable biobased resources can replace fossil-based resources, and how the safety, health environment aspects of manufacturing processes can be improved towards cleaner and more sustainable production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd7b881cb86119e59eb214ebdee10a75d86e84d75d06a319084c660461310f04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
