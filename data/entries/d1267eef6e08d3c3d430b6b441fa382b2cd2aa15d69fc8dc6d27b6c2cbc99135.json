Advancements in metal alloy fuels have focused on developing fuels operating at much higher burnups due to their low smear density. However, numerous studies demonstrate impacts on fuel performance due to fission gas release causing fuel swelling in certain cases [<a href=\"#ozae044.048-B2\">2</a>]. Other phenomena like fuel cladding chemical and mechanical interaction (FCCI and FCMI) influences or limits the performance in different metallic fuels [<a href=\"#ozae044.048-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.048-B4\">4</a>]. Additionally, neutron irradiation causes a large number of fission products (FP) to be generated impacting the chemical and mechanical properties of the fuel [<a href=\"#ozae044.048-B5\">5</a>]. These effects are essential to understanding metallic fuels and their irradiation behaviour.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d1267eef6e08d3c3d430b6b441fa382b2cd2aa15d69fc8dc6d27b6c2cbc99135","category":"Environment"}
