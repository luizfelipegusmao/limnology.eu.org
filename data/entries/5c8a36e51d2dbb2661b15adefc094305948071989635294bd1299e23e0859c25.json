{"title":"Noble Dome: A Novel Air-Free Transfer System for Scanning Electron Microscopy and Focused Ion Beam","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.876/7720211?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>This paper introduces an innovative solution for loading air-sensitive samples into SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and FIB (Focused Ion Beam) instruments. Traditional loading methods expose samples to atmosphere during transfer, hindering investigations of reactive materials. The presented prototype, Noble Dome, directly attaches to the SEM/FIB, enabling sample transfer in an oxygen-free environment. The device's design and operational process are outlined, including airtight chambers, gas introduction, and modified venting systems. Experimental results demonstrate Noble Dome's effectiveness in preserving sample integrity. This device was invented, prototyped and tested by faculty at University of Oregon. Compared to existing solutions, which often pose limitations, Noble Dome offers a practical approach for various research needs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5c8a36e51d2dbb2661b15adefc094305948071989635294bd1299e23e0859c25","category":"Environment"}
