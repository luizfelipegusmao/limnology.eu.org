Thus, the market demand for physically modified starch is increasing. Potato, tapioca and corn starches were physically modified by mild heat treatment in an alcoholic solution to enhance their gelling property and freeze–thaw stability.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>During mild heating of starch suspension (40% w/w) in 10% ethanol solution at the onset gelatinization temperature, granular swelling of starch occurred, followed by amylose leaching with medication of the surface structure of the starch granules. All treated starches exhibited increased gelatinization and pasting temperatures and decreased breakdown for pasting as a result of improved stability against shear and heat. The treated starches had higher hardness, cohesiveness and springiness of gel than the respective native starches, and these gel properties were more pronounced in potato starch than in tapioca and corn starches. The treated starches showed substantially reduced gel syneresis during freeze–thawing.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Physical modification of starch by mild heat treatment in an alcoholic solution substantially improved its gelation ability and freeze–thaw stability. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Han‐Jun Park, \nDong‐Hwa Cho, \nHyun‐Jung Chung, \nSeung‐Taik Lim","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"312e189a33c06c398f74e2d9dfd8d416693b5fb92e4c849d12a94c30d8d492bc","category":"Environment"}
