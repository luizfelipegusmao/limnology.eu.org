{"title":"Up for the challenge: Power motive congruence drives nurses to craft their jobs and experience well-being","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310717","date":1727964000000,"content":"<p>by Rawan Ghazzawi, Athanasios Chasiotis, Michael Bender, Lina Daouk-Öyry, Nicola Baumann</p>\r\n\r\nJob crafting is the behavior that employees engage in to create personally better fitting work environments, for example, by increasing challenging job demands. To better understand the driving forces behind employees’ engagement in job crafting, we investigated implicit and explicit power motives. While implicit motives tend to operate at the unconscious, explicit motives operate at the unconscious level. We focused on power motives, as power is an agentic motive characterized by the need to influence your environment. Although power is relevant to job crafting in its entirety, in this study, we link it to increasing challenging job demands due to its relevance to job control, which falls under the umbrella of power. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected survey data from a sample of Lebanese nurses (N = 360) working in 18 different hospitals across the country. In both implicit and explicit power motive measures, we focused on <i>integrative power</i> that enable people to stay calm and integrate opposition. The results showed that <i>explicit power</i> predicted job crafting (H1) and that <i>implicit power</i> amplified this effect (H2). Furthermore, job crafting mediated the relationship between congruently high power motives and positive work-related outcomes (H3) that were interrelated (H4). Our findings unravel the driving forces behind one of the most important dimensions of job crafting and extend the benefits of motive congruence to work-related outcomes.","author":"Rawan Ghazzawi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3d4eeb4b9b3317412317ea6582836ce4bedc35a62079ac9ad0bd9e596ff41991","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
