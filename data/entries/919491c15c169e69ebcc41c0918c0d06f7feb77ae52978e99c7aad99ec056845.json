Nevertheless, with the exception of the limited instances observed in cuprite, the synthesis of this metastable phase has predominantly been restricted to the kinetically controlled hydride reduction of oxygen-rich phases with three-dimensional (3-D) polygonal oxygen coordination. Considering the relative instability compared to its thermodynamically stable end phases through decomposition, capturing the rapid transformation to metastable infinite-layer phase during reduction with atomic resolution presents a challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"919491c15c169e69ebcc41c0918c0d06f7feb77ae52978e99c7aad99ec056845","category":"Environment"}
