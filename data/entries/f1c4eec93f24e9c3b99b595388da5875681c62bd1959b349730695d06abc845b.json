{"title":"Crystal Plasticity Parameter Optimization in Cyclically Deformed Electrodeposited Copper &ndash; A Machine Learning Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2044/v1","date":1717073904000,"content":"The paper describes an application of machine learning approach for parameter optimization. The method is demonstrated for the elasto-viscoplastic model with both isotropic and kinematic hardening. It is shown that the proposed method based on long-short term memory networks enabled to obtain reasonable agreement of stress-strain curves for cyclic deformation in low-cycle fatigue regime. The main advantage of the proposed approach over traditional optimization schemes lies in the possibility to get parameters for a new material without the necessity to conduct any further optimizations. As the power and robustness of the developed method was demonstrated on the very challenging problem (cyclic deformation, crystal plasticity, self-consistent model, isotropic and kinematic hardening), it is directly applicable to other experiments and models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1c4eec93f24e9c3b99b595388da5875681c62bd1959b349730695d06abc845b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
