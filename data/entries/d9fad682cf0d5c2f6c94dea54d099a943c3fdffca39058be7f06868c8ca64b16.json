{"title":"Characterization of Antineoplastic Agents Inducing Taste and Smell Disorders Using the FAERS Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0726/v1","date":1720591124000,"content":"Taste and smell disorders can worsen the nutritional status of patients receiving chemotherapy and potentially affect drug treatment. However, there is limited knowledge on antineoplastic agents that induce taste and smell disorders. Therefore, we used the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database to analyze the characteristics of patients and antineoplastic agents in relation to taste and smell disorders. No gender differences related to onset of taste and smell disorders were found, whereas older age was identified as a possible risk factor. Among antineoplastic agent classes, protein kinase inhibitors appeared to be particularly likely to induce taste and smell disorders. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis that taste and smell disorders induced by antineoplastic agents are characterized by “disorder of taste/smell” and “decrease/change of taste and smell.” These findings might be useful in selecting drugs for patients experiencing similar side effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9fad682cf0d5c2f6c94dea54d099a943c3fdffca39058be7f06868c8ca64b16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
