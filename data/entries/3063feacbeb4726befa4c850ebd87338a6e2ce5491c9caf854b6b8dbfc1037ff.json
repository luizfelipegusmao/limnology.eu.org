{"title":"Drying of Cirina Forda Caterpillar: Experiments and Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1478/v1","date":1716454008000,"content":"Cirina forda caterpillars are a significant protein source in Central Africa, yet their preservation and consumption pose challenges. This study investigates the drying of Cirina forda caterpillars to enhance preservation methods and product quality. Caterpillars were subjected to drying experiments at temperatures ranging from 40°C to 70°C, using tunnel and oven dryers. The drying kinetics was analyzed using mathematical models, revealing a water diffusion-limited mechanism in all the tested conditions. The Newton model provided adequate estimations of the drying behavior, facilitating further practical dryer design. Shrinkage analysis indicated a two-step process independent of the drying conditions. Achieving a moisture content suitable for prolonged storage resulted in substantial volume loss, highlighting the challenges of preserving dried caterpillars. These findings shed light on how to optimize drying processes for Cirina forda caterpillars, crucial for sustaining protein sources in Central Africa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3063feacbeb4726befa4c850ebd87338a6e2ce5491c9caf854b6b8dbfc1037ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
