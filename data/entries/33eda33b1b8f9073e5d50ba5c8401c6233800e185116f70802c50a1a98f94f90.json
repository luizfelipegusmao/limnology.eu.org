{"title":"Evaluation of Type I Interferon Treatment in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1544/v1","date":1716460469000,"content":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide; therefore, effective treatments remain crucial to controlling it. As interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and -beta (β) have been proposed as COVID-19 treatments, we sought to assess their effectiveness on respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric signs and symptoms, as well as PASC and death, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without multiple sclerosis (MS). Using a federated data research network (TriNetX), we performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients without MS who received IFN-α or -β treatment, comparing them to a similar cohort who did not receive treatment. Following propensity score-matched analyses, we demonstrate that hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were treated with IFN-α or -β had significantly higher odds of death. In contrast, there was no significant difference in any other outcomes between 1-30 days or 1 day to anytime afterward. Overall, hospitalized COVID-19 patients without MS who were treated with IFN-α or -β had similar short- and long-term sequelae (except for mortality) as those who did not receive treatment. The potential benefits of utilizing IFN-α or -β treatment as therapeutics remain to be realized, and our research highlights the need to explore repurposing drugs for COVID-19 using real-world evidence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33eda33b1b8f9073e5d50ba5c8401c6233800e185116f70802c50a1a98f94f90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
