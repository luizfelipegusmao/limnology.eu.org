{"title":"3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Delays Paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans Models of Amyloid-Beta and Polyglutamine Proteotoxicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0079/v1","date":1714550739000,"content":"Age is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and a leading cause of death in the elderly population of the United States. No effective treatments for these diseases currently exist. Identifying effective treatments for Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases is a major current focus of national scientific resources, and there is a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here we investigate the potential for targeting the kynurenine pathway metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) using Caenorhabditis elegans expressing amyloid-beta or a polyglutamine peptide in body wall muscle, modeling proteotoxicity in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease-related, respectively. We show that knocking down the enzyme that degrades 3HAA, 3HAA dioxygenase (HAAO) delays age-associated paralysis in both models. This effect on paralysis was independent of protein aggregation in the polyglutamine model. We also show that the mechanism of protection against proteotoxicity from HAAO knockdown is mimicked by 3HAA supplementation, supporting elevated 3HAA as the mediating event liking HAAO knockdown to delayed paralysis. This work demonstrates potential for 3HAA as a targeted therapeutic in neurodegenerative disease, though the mechanism is yet to be explored.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08b566af315effc4e076c377087b089a6dae5fdfd4b06d5d8818218de503f921","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
