{"title":"Effect of Neighboring Transitions on Critical Angle in Conversion between EIA and EIT in 87Rb Atoms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1613/v1","date":1729562952000,"content":"The effects of neighboring transitions (ENT) on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA), and the conversion between EIA and EIT in a degenerate multi-level system of 87Rb atoms were studied in terms of the angle (θ) between the polarization axes of the coupling and probe beams. The predicted critical values of θ, in which EIT transitioned to EIA, were consistent with the experimental values. In this work these results were systematically confirmed using the calculated spectra by varying the frequency spacings in the excited state of 87Rb via a factor called the ratio. We observed that when the ratio was less than 0.1, the critical angle θc was inverted. This may be attributed to the interplay between the strengths of the EIA and EIT as the ENT varied. We also discovered that by modifying the frequency spacings in the excited state of 87Rb, it becomes feasible to predict ENT and the interplay between EIT and EIA in alkali-metal atoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15a7c23aeca01d0e4e7c1ed5f453e13b44c9d29ee743cf021fce79fadcfbfcfc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
