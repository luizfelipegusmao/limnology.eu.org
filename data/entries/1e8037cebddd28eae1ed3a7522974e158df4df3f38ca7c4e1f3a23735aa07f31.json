{"title":"A Brief Report on the Caregiver Burden: Exploring the Risk and Psychological Factors in Caregivers of Patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1384/v1","date":1718870611000,"content":"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects both patients and their caregivers, particularly parents who often become informal caregivers. Caring for someone with PD is linked to increased psychiatric morbidity and persistent anxiety-depressive distress. Methods: This study investigates the burden on caregivers of PD patients using multi-dimensional scales and identifies the personological and environmental factors contributing to this burden. Results: 20.6% of participants reported a severe burden according to the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), while 13.8% had a moderate to severe burden according to the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory (ZBI). The Family Strain Questionnaire Short Form (FSQ-SF) high-lighted a minority of caregivers needing psychological support, with some cases requiring ur-gent attention, particularly in stress-related symptoms (SR) and urgent support (U). The Depres-sion Anxiety Stress Scales Short Version (DASS-21) results showed a higher prevalence of stress-related symptoms compared to anxiety and depression. Retired caregivers reported higher ZBI scores and lower life satisfaction levels compared to working caregivers. Additionally, years of schooling negatively correlated with the ZBI score. T-test analysis indicated that caregivers of patients with cognitive impairment were at greater risk compared to caregivers of patients with-out cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for early recognition of risky situations and adequate support for caregivers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e8037cebddd28eae1ed3a7522974e158df4df3f38ca7c4e1f3a23735aa07f31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
