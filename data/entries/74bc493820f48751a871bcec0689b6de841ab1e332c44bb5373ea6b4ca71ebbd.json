{"title":"Defective mutations in STAY-GREEN 1, PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1, and MYB12 genes lead to formation of green ripe fruit in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3322/7632371?rss=1","date":1710892800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Modern tomatoes produce colorful mature fruits, but many wild tomato ancestors form green or gray green ripe fruits. Here, tomato cultivar ‘Lvbaoshi’ (LBS) that produces green ripe fruits was found to contain three recessive loci responsible for fruit development. The colorless peel of LBS fruits was caused by a 603 bp deletion in the promoter of <span>SlMYB12.</span> The candidate genes of the remaining two loci were identified as <span>STAY-GREEN 1</span> (<span>SlSGR1</span>) and <span>PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1</span> (<span>SlPSY1</span>). <span>SGR1</span> and <span>PSY1</span> co-suppression by RNAi converted the pink fruits into green ripe fruits in transgenic plants. An amino acid change in PSY1 and a deletion in the promoter of <span>SGR1</span> were also identified in several wild tomatoes bearing green or gray ripe fruits. Overexpression of <span>PSY1</span> from green ripe fruit wild tomatoes in LBS plants could only partially rescue the green ripe fruit phenotype of LBS, and transgenic lines expressing <span>ProSGR1</span>::<span>SGR1</span> from <span>Solanum pennellii</span> also failed to convert purple-flesh into red-flesh fruits. This work uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism by which <span>SlMYB12</span>, <span>SlPSY1</span>, and <span>SlSGR1</span> control fruit color in cultivated and some wild tomato species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"74bc493820f48751a871bcec0689b6de841ab1e332c44bb5373ea6b4ca71ebbd","category":"Environment"}
