{"title":"79 Microbiological effects of control measures during pork production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/228/7757337?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing <span>Escherichia coli</span> (STEC) O157:H7 and efficacy of control measures at a pork processing facility. Outbreaks of <span>E. coli</span> O157:H7 associated with pork, though not common globally, have been reported multiple times in recent years in Alberta. Sampling at a commercial facility processing hogs was carried out at monthly intervals for 11 mo. At the facility, the dressed carcasses are sprayed with 5% lactic acid (LA) and immediately air-chilled after the LA spray. At each sampling time, 14 different types of samples were collected: dirt from the holding pen floor (n = 2), gloves of workers (n = 5), scalding water (n = 1), tonsils (n = 5), cecal material (n = 5), five swabs each from hides of animals after bleeding (HAB), and carcasses after scalding (CAS), before evisceration (CBE), after evisceration (CAE), before LA spray (BLA), after LA spray (ALA), 1h after LA spray (ALA1), 2h after LA spray (ALA2), and after chilling (ACH). All samples were enumerated for total plate count (TPC), <span>Enterobacteriaceae</span>, and <span>E. coli</span> using specific media for each. In addition, an aliquot of each sample was enriched and tested for the presence of the O-antigen gene (rfbE) for <span>E. coli</span> O157 and Shiga toxin-producing gene (stx1/stx2) using real-time PCR. Cultures positive for both rfbE and stx were further plated for the isolation of <span>E. coli</span> O157:H7. Of the 683 enrichment cultures, 12 were positive for both marker genes, from cecal material (n = 2), dirt (n = 4) and HAB (n = 6). However, none of these samples yielded STEC O157 isolates. Of these enrichment cultures, 69, 45 and 32 were positive for stx1, stx2, and both stx genes, respectively. Positive samples were mostly associated with HAB, cecal material and dirt. HAB was most and least contaminated in August/June and December, differing by 1 log unit for TPC (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). <span>Enterobacteriaceae</span> and <span>E. coli</span> on HAB were also affected by month of sampling (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), but this temporal trend differed from TPC (Table). The numbers for TPC, Enterobacteriaceae, and <span>E. coli</span> all decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) as the stage of carcass processing progressed. The overall reduction of TPC and <span>E. coli</span> was 7 and 5 log units, respectively. Scalding, LA spray and air chilling all reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the numbers of indicator bacteria on carcasses. Of the 55 samples each collected from BLA, ALA, ALA1, ALA2, and ACH, 36, 13, 2, 1 and 0 were positive for <span>E. coli</span>, respectively. In conclusion, pork processing environments can be contaminated with STEC from hides, feces and holding pen, but levels of STEC O157 appear to be low. Scalding, LA spray and air chilling can be effective measures to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination of pork.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8c91a850f9d3bf131599ab31f737b8df163af3538989efb6e1aa0d012d5d4237","category":"Environment"}
