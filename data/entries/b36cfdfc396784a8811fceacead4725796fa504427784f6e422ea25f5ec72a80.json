{"title":"Penrose Scattering in Quantum Vacuum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1058/v1","date":1713275184000,"content":"Scattering of a probe laser pulse by an intense light spring in QED vacuum is considered. This new scattering configuration can be seen as the vacuum equivalent to the process originally associated with scattering of light by a rotating black hole, usually called Penrose superradiance. Here the rotating object is an intense laser beam containing two different components of orbital angular momentum. Due to these two components with slightly different frequencies, the energy profile of the intense laser beam rotates with a frequency that depends on the frequency difference. The nonlinear properties of quantum vacuum are described by first order Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. It is shown that, in such a configuration, nonlinear photon-photon coupling leads to scattered radiation, with frequency shift and angular dispersion. These two distinct properties, of frequency and propagation direction, could eventually be favourable for possible experimental observations. In principle, this new scattering configuration can also be reproduced in a nonlinear optical medium.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b36cfdfc396784a8811fceacead4725796fa504427784f6e422ea25f5ec72a80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
