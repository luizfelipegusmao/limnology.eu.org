{"title":"Post-Acute Sequelae And Mitochondrial Aberration In SARS-CoV-2 Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1289/v1","date":1718718068000,"content":"This review investigates links between post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), post-infection viral persistence, mitochondrial involvement and aberrant innate immune response and cellular metabolism during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Advancement of proteomic and metabolomic studies now allows deeper investigation of alterations to cellular metabolism, autophagic processes and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection while computational biology and machine learning have advanced methodologies of predicting virus-host gene and protein interactions. Particular focus is given to interaction between viral genes and proteins with mitochondrial function and that of the innate immune system. Finally, the authors hypothesise that viral persistence may be a function of mitochondrial involvement in sequestration of viral genetic material. While further work is necessary to understand the mechanisms definitively, a number of studies now point to resolution of questions regarding the pathogenesis of PASC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c95c8ce2b204d7eafce6149c26d8e87934468cf16cb082f8e527aab52e6c8437","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
