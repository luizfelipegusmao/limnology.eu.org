{"title":"The efficacy of pediatric elbow radiographic guidance in diagnosis of lateral humeral condyle fracture","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300014","date":1710511200000,"content":"<p>by Satetha Vasaruchapong, Patarawan Woratanarat, Tanyaporn Patathong, Thira Woratanarat, Supaneewan Jaovisidha, Chanika Angsanunsukh</p>\r\n\r\nAlthough lateral humeral condyle fracture is common, the incidence of missed diagnosis is very high. Delayed and missed diagnosis led to significant morbidities and loss of functions. We designed a pediatric elbow radiographic guidance aiming to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the radiographic guidance for the diagnosis of lateral condyle fracture. A cross-sectional study was conducted after defining the essential parameters as a guidance for assessing the pediatric elbow radiographs. We included medical students, emergency medicine, orthopedic, and radiology residents and fellows into this study. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the efficacy of the guidance. All participants underwent a pretest evaluation, followed by studying the guidance, and then finished a posttest evaluation. Baseline characteristics, diagnostic scores, and parameter evaluation scores were collected. The pretest and posttest scores were analyzed using paired t-test. Association between baseline characteristics and diagnostic scores were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. We included 177 participants. Average diagnostic score was significantly increased after using the guidance, from 12.2 ± 1.9 to 13.0 ± 1.7 (p &lt; 0.0001). Medical students showed the most improvement, from 11.9 ± 1.9 to 13.1 ± 1.3 (p &lt;0.001). All means of essential parameter evaluation scores were significantly improved in overall participants.The pediatric elbow radiographic guidance is useful for evaluation and diagnosis of lateral condyle fracture, especially for young physicians and trainees. Therefore, this should be recommended in routine medical education and general practice.","author":"Satetha Vasaruchapong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7e16392227afa0b722bce86766e8d173aea2cb941813c0de9e60839364b46621","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
