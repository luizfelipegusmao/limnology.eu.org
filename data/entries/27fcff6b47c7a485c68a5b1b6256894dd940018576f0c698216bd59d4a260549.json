These alloys are essential due to their extraordinary combination of great mechanical and physical properties, especially their high specific strength (strength-to-weight ratio). The strength of titanium alloys is mainly determined by the precipitation strengthening, the precipitation of hexagonal closed packed (hcp) structure α precipitates in the body centered cubic structured β matrix. The size, morphology, and distribution of hcp α precipitates can influence the strength of titanium alloy significantly, due to their influence on the motion of dislocations. Our recent studies have shown that the preformed nanostructures, including hexagonal structured ω phase, orthorhombic structured O’ phase, and ordered orthorhombic structured O” phase, can significantly influence the subsequent α precipitation [<a href=\"#ozae044.110-B1\">1-3</a>]. It has been revealed that the preformed metastable nanostructures can alter the local structure and composition in the nanoscale region near these nanostructures and thus provide extra driving force by modifying the stress field and composition field for α precipitation in titanium alloys [<a href=\"#ozae044.110-B4\">4</a>]. However, there still exits controversy regarding the detailed mechanisms regarding how these nanoscales transform to α precipitates. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the nanostructures in titanium alloys. In this presentation, we will introduce our latest study of nanoscale ω phase particles in a modeled binary Ti-Fe compositionally gradient sample using multi-dimensional imaging techniques including 2D aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and 3D atom probe tomography (APT).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"27fcff6b47c7a485c68a5b1b6256894dd940018576f0c698216bd59d4a260549","category":"Environment"}
