{"title":"Mechanical Properties of an Extremely Tough 1.5 mol% Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Material","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1207/v1","date":1721047063000,"content":"Yttria stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) ceramics with drastically reduced yttria content have been introduced by different manufacturers aiming at improving the damage tolerance of ceramic components. In this study an alumina doped 1.5Y-TZP was axially pressed, pressureless sintered in air at 1250–1400 °C for 2 h and characterized with respect to mechanical properties, microstructure and phase composition. The material exhibits a combination of high strength of 1000 MPa and a high toughness of 8.5–10 MPa√m. The measured fracture toughness is, however, extremely depending on measurement protocol. Direct crack length measurements overestimate toughness due to trapping effects. The initially purely tetragonal material has a high transformability of &amp;gt; 80 %, the transformation behavior is predominantly dilatoric, measured R-curve related toughness increments are in good agreement with transformation toughness increments derived from XRD data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a260cb60dc044ea279ce7af527e2cb9329f66ad134e61b16dd55d791e08d682","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
