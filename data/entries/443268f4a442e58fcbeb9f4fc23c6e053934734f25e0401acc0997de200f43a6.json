{"title":"Synthesis and Properties of a Red Na5Zn2Gd1-x(MoO4)6: xEu3+ Phosphor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0916/v1","date":1728642416000,"content":"The novel phosphor Eu3+ doped Na5Zn2Gd(MoO4)6 triple molybdate were prepared by the sol-gel method. The structure, morphology, and luminescent properties have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and Luminescence spectroscopy. The results indicated that the synthesized Na5Zn2Gd1-x(MoO4)6: xEu3+phosphor consisted of a pure phase with monoclinic structure. Under excitation at 465 nm, the Na5Zn2Gd1-x(MoO4)6: xEu3+ phosphor exhibits  intensive red emission band around 610 nm corresponding to the transition of 5D0→7F2 is much higher than that 5D0→7F1 at 594 nm, which was appropriate for blue LED. According to the influence of the synthesis conditions, the phosphors show the highest emission intensity as the doping concentration of Eu3+ was 25 mol.% and the molar ratio of citric acid to metal ions was 2:1. Na5Zn2Gd0.75(MoO4)6: 0.25 Eu3+ with the color coordinates (x= 0.658, y= 0.341) is a stable red phosphor for blue-based white LEDs due to it is closer to the NTSC standard values (0.670, 0.330) comparing with the color coordinates (0.48, 0.50) of the commercial Y2O2S: Eu3+ red phosphor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"443268f4a442e58fcbeb9f4fc23c6e053934734f25e0401acc0997de200f43a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
