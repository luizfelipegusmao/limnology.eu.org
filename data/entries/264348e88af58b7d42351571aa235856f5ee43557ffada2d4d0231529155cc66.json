{"title":"Single&minus;molecule Level Quantification Reveals the Interaction between Melittin and Lipopolysaccharide by Atomic Force Microscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2140/v1","date":1724981823000,"content":"The interaction forces and mechanical properties of the interaction between melittin (Mel) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are considered a crucial driving force for Mel in killing Gram−negative bacteria (GNB). However, how their interaction forces are performed at the single−molecule level and the dissociation kinetic characteristics of the Mel/LPS complex remain poorly understood. In this study, the single−molecule level interaction forces between Mel and LPSs from E. coil K−12, O55:B5, O111:B4, and O128:B12 were explored using atomic force microscopy (AFM) based single−molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). Further, the AFM−based dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) and advanced analytical model were employed to investigate the kinetic characteristics of the Mel/LPSs complex dissociation. The results indicated that Mel could interact with both rough (R)−form LPS (E. coli K−12) and smooth (S)−form LPSs (E. coli O55:B5, O111:B4, O128:B12), and the S−form LPSs showed a more robust interaction with Mel than R−form LPS, and a slight difference existed in the interaction forces between Mel and diverse S−form LPSs. The Mel interacts with S−form LPSs showed greater specific and non−specific interaction forces than R−form LPS (p &amp;lt; 0.05), as determined by AFM−based SMFS. However, there was no significant difference in the specific and non−specific interaction forces among the three S−form LPSs (p &amp;gt; 0.05), indicating the variability of O−antigen could not affect the interaction between Mel and LPSs. The DFS result showed that the Mel/S−form LPSs complexes had a lower dissociation rate constant (koff), a shorter energy barrier width (xβ), a longer bond lifetime (τoff), and a higher height of the energy barrier (∆G), demonstrating that Mel could interact with S−form LPSs to form more stable complexes. In conclusion, this study promotes our knowledge of the interaction micromechanics and kinetics characteristics between Mel and LPS at the single−molecule level. Moreover, it can help us design and evaluate new anti−GNB drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"264348e88af58b7d42351571aa235856f5ee43557ffada2d4d0231529155cc66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
