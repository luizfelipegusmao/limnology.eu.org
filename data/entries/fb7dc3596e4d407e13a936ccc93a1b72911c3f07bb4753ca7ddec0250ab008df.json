{"title":"A Review of Vehicles for Fire Suppression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0184/v1","date":1725353885000,"content":"The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires necessitate innovative solutions to enhance firefighting capabilities. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of vehicles specifically designed for direct forest fire suppression, focusing on their speed of fire response, and encompasses both ground and aerial units. The study explores the functionality and speed capacity of various fire suppression vehicles, including fire trucks, firefighting aircrafts and helicopters, robotic firefighting vehicles and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Key features such as mobility, water capacity, and advanced technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven navigation and remote sensing capabilities are evaluated. The review also addresses the operational challenges these vehicles face in wildland environments. Additionally, it identifies emerging trends and innovations in fire suppression vehicle technology, offering insights into future developments that aim to enhance the effectiveness and safety of firefighting operations in forest fires. This overview aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, fire departments, and emergency response planners focused on advancing fire suppression strategies in forest.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb7dc3596e4d407e13a936ccc93a1b72911c3f07bb4753ca7ddec0250ab008df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
