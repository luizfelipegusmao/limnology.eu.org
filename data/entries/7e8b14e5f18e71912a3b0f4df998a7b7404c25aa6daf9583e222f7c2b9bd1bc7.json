Androgen abuse is associated with increased mortality, and multisystem adverse effects have been reported, including cardiovascular toxicity, infertility, hypogonadism, hepatotoxicity, and mental health disorders. Men may present with the negative health consequences of androgen abuse even despite cessation for a number of years. There is frequently a reluctance to disclose androgen abuse, and substances are often sourced from the black market, which is not regulated and where the products sold may be counterfeit. All men should be encouraged to stop androgen abuse. Managing associated adverse effects will be organ-specific and is complex due to physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms, substance dependence, and high rates of relapse. Given the broad reach and prolonged adverse effects of androgen abuse, clinicians across medical specialties should have an awareness of androgen abuse, its increasing prevalence, and the harms it poses to men and their families. This narrative review aims to summarize the adverse effects and risks associated with androgen abuse.</p>","author":"Bonnie Grant, \nElizabeth Hyams, \nRhianna Davies, \nSuks Minhas, \nChanna N.
