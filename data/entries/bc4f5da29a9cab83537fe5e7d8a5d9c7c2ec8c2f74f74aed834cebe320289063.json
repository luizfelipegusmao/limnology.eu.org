{"title":"Exploring Tenebrio molitor as a source of low‐molecular‐weight antimicrobial peptides using a n in silico approach: correlation of molecular features and molecular docking","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13949?af=R","date":1729081167000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Yellow mealworm (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>) larvae are increasingly recognized as a potential source of bioactive peptides due to their high protein content. Antimicrobial peptides from sustainable sources are a research topic of interest. This study aims to characterize the peptidome of <i>T</i>. <i>molitor</i> flour and an Alcalase-derived hydrolysate, and to explore the potential presence of antimicrobial peptides using <i>in silico</i> analyses, including prediction tools, molecular docking and parameter correlations.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p><i>T</i>. <i>molitor</i> protein was hydrolysed using Alcalase, resulting in a hydrolysate (TMH10A) with a 10% degree of hydrolysis. The peptidome was analysed using LC-TIMS-MS/MS, yielding over 6000 sequences. These sequences were filtered using the PeptideRanker tool, selecting the top 100 sequences with scores &gt;0.8. Bioactivity predictions indicated that specific peptides, particularly WLNSKGGF and GFIPYEPFLKKMMA, showed significant antimicrobial potential, particularly against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Correlations were found between antifungal activity and physicochemical properties such as net charge, hydrophobicity and isoelectric point.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The study identified specific <i>T</i>. <i>molitor</i>-derived peptides with strong predicted antimicrobial activity through <i>in silico</i> analysis. These peptides, particularly WLNSKGGF and GFIPYEPFLKKMMA, might offer potential applications in food safety and healthcare. Further experimental validation is required to confirm their efficacy. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Teresa Gonzalez‐de la Rosa, \nElvira Marquez‐Paradas, \nMaria J Leon, \nSergio Montserrat‐de la Paz, \nFernando Rivero‐Pino","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"bc4f5da29a9cab83537fe5e7d8a5d9c7c2ec8c2f74f74aed834cebe320289063","category":"Environment"}
