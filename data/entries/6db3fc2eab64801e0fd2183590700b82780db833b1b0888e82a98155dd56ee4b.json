{"title":"Response of tef yield and yield components to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299861","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Ewunetie Melak, Workat Sebnie, Tilahun Esubalew, Haymanot Lamesgn, Messay Abera, Tesfa Asmelie</p>\r\n\r\nThe challenge facing Ethiopian farmers are the combination of low soil fertility and reduced agricultural productivity. The study aimed to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus-containing fertilizers for tef production in Sekota and Lasta-Lalibela districts, using four nitrogen and three phosphorus levels from urea and triple super phosphate sources. The Results showed that nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers significantly affected tef yield and yield components. Application of nitrogen at the rate of 92 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> increased tef grain yield by 131.01%, 87.78% and 182.23% in Woleh, Sayda and Lasta Lalibela districts, respectively, compared to control treatment. Similarly, 23 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> phosphorus increased tef grain yield by 7.42 and 8.52% in Woleh and Lasta Lalibela, respectively. In Lalibela and Woleh, the application of 92 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> resulted in a maximum net benefits of 2099.6 and 2007 United States Dollar (USD) respectively. Furthermore, in Sayda, the application of 92 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> and 23 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yielded a net benefit of 1812.55 USD. The marginal rate of return (MRR) from these applications was 539.6% in Lalibela, 781% in Woleh and 352.44% in Sayda. Therefore, application of 92 N and 23 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> is appropriate for maximum tef production in Sekota and Lasta districts of Amhara region. Further research and extension services should focus on promoting the adoption of these optimized fertilizer practices among smallholder farmers to maximize the sustainable production of tef.","author":"Ewunetie Melak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6db3fc2eab64801e0fd2183590700b82780db833b1b0888e82a98155dd56ee4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
