{"title":"Evaluation and Prototype of Health Counseling LLM Using the Turing Test","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1614/v1","date":1724307951000,"content":"In 2021, Japan's medical expenses will exceed 45 trillion yen, and the shortage of doctors, especially in remote and mountainous areas, is becoming serious, making it difficult to maintain the medical system. We have conducted a study of 800 health consultation text data. We developed an on-premise health counseling LLM system by constructing a dialogue flow based on 800 health counseling text data. We conducted a Turing test of this system using 200 test data and verified its effectiveness with three medical professionals. The Turing test was a comparison experiment between this system and a conventional LLM system. The health counseling LLM infrastructure focuses on exercise guidance and analyzes gender, height, weight, body fat percentage, and muscle mass. While the accuracy of the conventional LLM system was 87.5%, this system showed a higher accuracy of 93.1%. Although telemedicine has been slow to spread in Japan, the introduction of a health consultation system using Personal Health Record and Large Language Models has the potential to reduce the burden on physicians. In the future, we aim to improve the accuracy of the system by using Japanese language and medical-specific evaluation scales.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28a64b998463edcdaf7ed0c411129d3d136c1d532864df535f75bb1dfd303c27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
