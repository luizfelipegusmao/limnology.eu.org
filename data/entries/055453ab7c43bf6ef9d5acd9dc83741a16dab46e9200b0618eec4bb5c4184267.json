The approach utilizes four preprocessed monitoring signals representing different health states of the scraper conveyor as input sources. Through multiple transformations of the data using a constructed one-dimensional convolutional neural network model, it extracts effective features from the data and establishes a mapping relationship between input data and equipment health status. This enables the recognition of the health status of the scraper conveyor. Comparative experimental analysis indicates that the proposed method can effectively identify the health status of the scraper conveyor, achieving an accuracy rate of 98.9%. This method provides an effective means and technical support for the subsequent health management of scraper conveyors in coal mining fully mechanized workfaces.","author":"Jie Lu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"055453ab7c43bf6ef9d5acd9dc83741a16dab46e9200b0618eec4bb5c4184267","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
