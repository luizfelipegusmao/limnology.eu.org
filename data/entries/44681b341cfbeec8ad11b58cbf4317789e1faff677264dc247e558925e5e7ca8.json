{"title":"Gaidropsarus mauritanicus (Gadiformes, Gaidropsaridae) a new three‐bearded rockling from a deep‐water coral ecosystem with a genetically verified biogeographical distribution of the genus and notes to its ecology and behavior","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15859?af=R","date":1723829866000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Gaidropsarus mauritanicus</i> sp. nov. is described from one specimen collected using a grab sample from the Tanoûdêrt Canyon (ca. 20° N) off Mauritania at a depth of 595 m. The new species was further observed during eight remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives along the Mauritanian slope southwards down to the Tiguent Coral Mound Complex (~17° N) in a bathymetric range between 613 and 416 m. It can be distinguished from congeners by a combination of characteristics, including large eyes (38.1% head length [HL]), large head (25.8% standard length [SL]), elongated pelvic fins (35.7% SL), low number of vertebrae (44), and coloration (pinkish with a dorsal darker brownish hue and bright blotches along the dorsal-fin base). A species-delimitation analysis performed with available cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (<i>COI</i>) sequences affiliated to the genus <i>Gaidropsarus</i> additionally supported the validity of the new species. Video analyses showed a deep-water coral-associated and protection-seeking behavior, which may explain why the species has remained undescribed until now. Additional ROV footage from separate deep-water coral sites in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea further highlights the ecological behavior and hidden diversity of bathyal three-bearded rocklings. Here, we additionally discuss the biogeographical distribution of all genetically verified <i>Gaidropsarus</i> spp. in combination with genetic data and morphological characters. <i>G. mauritanicus</i> sp. nov. is closely related to a species from Tasmania (43° S), a geographical point furthest among the studied samples, which may hint to an important influence of (paleo-) oceanography on the distributions of <i>Gaidropsarus</i> species.</p>","author":"Alexander H.
