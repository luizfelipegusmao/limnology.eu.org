Recent topotactic transformations of perovskite nickelates have allowed precise control of oxygen vacancies, thereby exploiting the resulting coupling effects in these materials. The discovery of superconductivity in thin films of the infinite-layer (IL) nickelate Nd<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.694-B1\">1</a>] has opened a new avenue to explore a material system closely related to cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To unravel the potential of these phenomena, it is imperative to gain in-depth insights into the atomic-scale lattice and electronic structure during topotactic reduction. Recently, the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> at high pressures (&gt;14 GPa) has attracted considerable attention [<a href=\"#ozae044.694-B2\">2</a>]. However, the fundamental properties of the superconducting phase are currently the subject of controversial debates, including the interpretation of the possible filamentary character, whereas early investigations consistently postulated a crystal structure consisting of NiO<sub>6</sub> octahedral bilayers stacked along the c-axis on La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Our atomic-scale investigations, detailed below, establish a critical link between the observable properties of nickelates and their underlying microscopic origins, paving the way for further exploration of nickelates with distinct crystal structures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"683b6d95b50c3e162d78ca1a0fbd4de022ded4f0a9004a340ac6d9d18a240c3e","category":"Environment"}
