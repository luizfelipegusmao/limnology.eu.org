{"title":"What Do We Know about the Relationship between Lycopene and Metabolic Diseases? Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2122/v1","date":1727345628000,"content":"Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are closely related. They are characterized by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Obesity is the most important risk factor for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels, among other conditions. These disorders contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, which can exacerbate other metabolic disorders. Numerous studies indicate that diet and nutrients can have a major impact on preventing and treating these conditions. One such ingredient is lycopene. It exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and can affect metabolic processes in the body. According to the research presented, lycopene supplementation may have significant potential in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"220868279dfa353a223b45e485e652faecf4d20a874d6b9c9720ca7424265969","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
