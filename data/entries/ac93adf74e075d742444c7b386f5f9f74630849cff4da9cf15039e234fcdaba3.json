{"title":"An Early Warning System for Urban Fluvial Floods Based on Rainfall Depth-Duration Thresholds and a Predefined Library of Flood Event Scenarios: The Case Study of Palermo (Italy)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1985/v1","date":1721859369000,"content":"Several cities are experiencing an increase in flood hazard and exposure, and consequentially in flood risk, attributable to the coupled effect of climate change and urbanization. Non-structural protection strategies demonstrate significant potential in the short term for mitigating hydraulic risk in urban areas, particularly where the implementation of structural measures is impeded by a complex urban environment. This work proposes an Early Warning System (EWS) for fluvial floods developed for the city of Palermo (Italy). It is based on the preliminary definition of po-tential Flood Event Scenarios (FESs) as a function of typical potential precursors. Each FES pre-dicts first points of flooding, flood areas and water depths, also providing specific hazard maps for people, vehicles, and buildings. The EWS uses rainfall depth-duration thresholds to assess the expected hydrograph as a function of rainfall forecasts and the water stage observed in real time at an upstream section of the river crossing the city. This last also allows for estimating the ante-cedent wetness conditions. Based on this information, the EWS retrieves an expected FES from a pre-built library with a preannouncement time up to 36 h. The EWS is here successfully tested on a historical flood event.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac93adf74e075d742444c7b386f5f9f74630849cff4da9cf15039e234fcdaba3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
