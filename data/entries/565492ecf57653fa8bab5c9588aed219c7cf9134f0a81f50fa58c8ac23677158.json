{"title":"Roseto Revisited: Fact or Fiction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0964/v1","date":1726132073000,"content":"Objective: A 1964 study challenged the consensus that saturated fat consumption increased the risk for myocardial infarction (MI). Roseto Pennsylvania, an Italian-American enclave of 1600 people, had similar rates of cigarette smoking, obesity and higher saturated fat consumption as neighboring towns, but far lower MI death rates. More than 50 years later, it remains uncertain if Rosetoâ€™s residents had better heart health than the average American and if so, what factors were responsible. Methods: We compared MI deaths in Roseto and neighboring towns to the Framingham Heart Study cohort matched for age and sex. Results: We found no evidence that MI deaths were lower in Roseto, PA than in Framingham, MA when controlling for age and sex. While the role of social support in health is uncontested, methodological issues, confounding factors and biases challenge the validity of the Roseto study. Conclusions: The dramatically lower MI and MI mortality rates among males in Roseto reflects biases in sampling and comparison populations, which also impacted the contrasting Diet-Heart hypothesis that saturated fats cause heart disease. Although social support enhances health outcomes, the Roseto study neither supported nor refuted this connection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"565492ecf57653fa8bab5c9588aed219c7cf9134f0a81f50fa58c8ac23677158","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
