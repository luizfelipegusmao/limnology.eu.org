Hence, there is still an important reservoir of HPV in adults, as vaccination programs are mainly focused on young women. The primary objective of this non-randomized, open-label trial is to evaluate if a 3-dose regimen of Gardasil-9 in HPV16/18-positive women could reduce the infective capacity of their body fluids. We aim to assess if vaccine-induced antibodies could neutralize virions present in the mucosa, thus preventing the release of infective particles and HPV transmission to sexual partners. As our main endpoint, the E1^E4-HaCaT model will be used to assess the infectivity rate of cervical, anal and oral samples, obtained from women before and after vaccination. HPV DNA positivity, virion production, seroconversion, and the presence of antibodies in the exudates, will be evaluated to attribute infectivity reduction to vaccination. Our study will recruit two different cohorts (RIFT-HPV1 and RIFT-HPV2) of non-vaccinated adult women. RIFT-HPV1 will include subjects with an HPV16/18 positive cervical test and no apparent cervical lesions or cervical lesions eligible for conservative treatment. RIFT-HPV2 will include subjects with an HPV16/18 positive anal test and no apparent anal lesions or anal lesions eligible for conservative treatment, as well as women with an HPV16/18 positive cervical test and HPV-associated vulvar lesions. Subjects complying with inclusion criteria for both cohorts will be recruited to the main cohort, RIFT-HPV1. Three doses of Gardasil-9 will be administered intramuscularly at visit 1 (0 months), visit 2 (2 months) and visit 3 (6 months). Even though prophylactic HPV vaccines would not eliminate a pre-existing infection, our results will determine if HPV vaccination could be considered as a new complementary strategy to prevent HPV-associated diseases by reducing viral spread.\r\nTrial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05334706.","author":"Victoria López-Codony","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9e3bb57ed8d73bca07608dd1ea1baa2961ffdb552239c626edc01411c5193705","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
