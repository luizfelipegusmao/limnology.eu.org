{"title":"Deciphering the Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Cirsium japonicum by Combining Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking and In Vitro Experimental Evaluation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1721/v1","date":1727085381000,"content":"Cirsium japonicum, a traditional herb, exhibits significant anti-inflammatory activity; however, the main components and potential mechanisms of C. japonicum remain unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Cirsium japonicum through network pharmacology and cellular experiments. The effective components and potential targets for anti-inflammatory activity of C. japonicum were identified using traditional Chinese medicine systematic pharmacology database, TCMSP analysis platform, and GeneCards database. The drug-component-target-disease network diagram was constructed using Cytoscape3.8.0 software, while the protein interaction network diagram was created using STRING database and Cytoscape3.8.0 software. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were carried out using DAVID database. Molecular docking between key targets and active components was constructed with AutoDock software to determine the best binding target. Results revealed that 14 active components of C. japonicum targeted 171 anti-inflammatory proteins. GO function enrichment analysis yielded 173 items, while KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified 48 signaling pathways related to inflammation regulation. Molecular docking showed that strong affinity between sitosterol, stigmasterol, and other components with key targets such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± recombinant protein (PPARA) and cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2). Vanillin, one active ingredient of C. japonicum, inhibited the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory factors in RAW264.7 cells. These findings suggest that C. japonicum may exert its anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt) signal pathway (PI3K-Akt) and apoptin signal pathway, highlighting the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-channel molecular mechanism underlying its anti-inflammatory properties. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effect of vanillin, an effective component in C. japonicum, was verified by cell experiments. This study provides a new understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of C. japonicum in treatment of inflammatory conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14278935aaa51c8e062d127d742a4aa0718604a3ce60141eba5e06e1a80892eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
