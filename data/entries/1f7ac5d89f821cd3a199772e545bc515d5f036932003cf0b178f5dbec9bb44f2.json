{"title":"Smart Shoe Tightening System for People with CP","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0545/v1","date":1718004465000,"content":"Cerebral Palsy (CP) poses substantial challenges to individuals, affecting their physical capabilities and daily functioning, and necessitates tailored interventions to enhance their quality of life and independence. Hand functionality is often affected in more than 60% of individuals with CP; they (mostly children) may spend up to 2-3 hours tightening their shoes perfectly. This includes the tightening of laces, standing up to determine if it is sufficient, and having to repeat the process many times till desired throughout the day. This paper focuses on the development of such a system that will assist them in effectively reducing this time to an approximate maximum time of 10 minutes. In its proposed form, this would reduce the shoe-tying process and make it ~18 times faster. The system will allow the user to perform the process with one hand and be simple and reliable. This additional freedom, among utilization of other systems, could lead to a betterment in mental health regarding the desire to perform outdoor activities among individuals with CP","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f7ac5d89f821cd3a199772e545bc515d5f036932003cf0b178f5dbec9bb44f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
