{"title":"Intelligent Petroleum Processing: A Short Review on Applying AI/ML to Petroleum Products Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0442/v1","date":1712315884000,"content":"Improving the quality of petroleum products and refining processes through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is the topic of this article. It shows that expert knowledge and conventional empirical models can't get you where you want to go in a refining process. To effectively capture complex interactions and forecast fuel qualities, machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and partial least squares (PLS) are suggested. Gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as property prediction, process control, product quality, and operational efficiency in refineries, can all be improved with the help of machine learning applied to spectral or distillation curve data. An exciting new direction in optimizing operations, meeting environmental norms, and precisely estimating gasoline quality is offered by advanced machine learning algorithms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b70de3eefd0f9aa4fe0a957d69fd6c9e289b57c75b10a2920853bed0c62da63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
