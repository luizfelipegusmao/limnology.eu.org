{"title":"Assessment of Sustainable Mobility Patterns of University Students and Staff: Case of a LMIC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0656/v1","date":1710176219000,"content":"The transition to sustainable mobility is a recognized socio-economic and environmental challenge, particularly among young adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper addresses the lack of comprehensive research on mobility patterns for LMICs by examining the travel patterns of students, staff, and lecturers at the National Advanced School of Public Works, Yaound√© (NASPW) to understand transport mode choices and barriers to the use of public and active transport modes. Data was collected through online questionnaires from 425 participants. Findings revealed that most students (27.5%) used multiple modes of transport, with moto-taxis being the most common (21%). Lecturers primarily used private cars (50%), while staff relied on taxis or multiple modes (33%). Accessibility, vehicle speed, and flexibility appeared as the most important reasons for the preferred modes of transport. Barriers included long waiting times and traffic congestion for public transport, and distance and inadequate infrastructure for active mobility. The usage of public transportation was encouraged by its affordability and reduced travel time, whilst active options were preferred due to their cost savings and health benefits. To promote sustainable mobility for campus travel, it is crucial to encourage active modes, develop mass transport systems, and raise awareness through symposiums and conferences among students and staff.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"601e71415e0a643cf31817dd0c2606056d7afac4b86c1c9a5871569d0b66490a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
