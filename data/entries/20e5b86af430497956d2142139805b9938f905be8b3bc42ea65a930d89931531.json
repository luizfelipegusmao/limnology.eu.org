{"title":"A Note on Oppermann's Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1161/v3","date":1724399101000,"content":"A prime gap is the difference between consecutive prime numbers. The $n^{\\text{th}}$ prime gap, denoted $g_{n}$, is calculated by subtracting the $n^{\\text{th}}$ prime from the $(n+1)^{\\text{th}}$ prime: $g_{n}=p_{n+1}-p_{n}$. Oppermann's conjecture is a prominent unsolved problem in pure mathematics concerning prime gaps. Despite verification for numerous primes, a general proof remains elusive. If true, the conjecture implies that prime gaps grow at a rate bounded by $g_{n}&lt;{\\sqrt {p_{n}}}$. We examine the ratio of Chebyshev functions for consecutive primes, $\\frac{\\theta(p_{n+1})}{\\theta(p_{n})}$, and compare it to the square root of their ratio, $\\sqrt {\\frac{p_{n+1}}{p_{n}}}$. Assuming this inequality holds for primes larger than $10^{8}$, we demonstrate the truth of Oppermann's conjecture. For sufficiently large $n$, this inequality guarantees that $g_{n}&lt;{\\sqrt {p_{n}}}$ for all primes beyond a certain point. Our proof also validates Andrica's, Legendre's, and Brocard's conjectures for primes exceeding a specific threshold.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20e5b86af430497956d2142139805b9938f905be8b3bc42ea65a930d89931531","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
