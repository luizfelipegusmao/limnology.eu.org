{"title":"PSIX-22 Maternal methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen flux compared with progeny gas flux","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/735/7757881?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Red Angus heifers [n = 19; body weight (BW) = 370 ± 8.1 kg) and their paired offspring (BW = 283 ± 4.2 kg; 18 heifers, 1 steer) were used to compare the respiration gas parameters between dams and their progeny over 2 calving cycles (8 pairs in the 1st cycle, 11 in the 2nd). The methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption of the dams were measured at 14 mo of age over a 70-d period using an automated head-chamber system (AHCS) that measured the flux of these 3 gases. Dams grazed native mixed-grass prairie and were offered a daily supplement of alfalfa (<span>Medicago sativa L.</span>) pellets (1.0 kg) via the AHCS. Dams were artificially inseminated using sexed semen (female) from a single Black Angus sire. The gas fluxes of the progeny were measured, beginning at 11 mo of age, over a 70-d period. Like the dams, during their measurement period, the progeny grazed native mixed-grass prairie and were offered a daily supplement (1.0 kg) of alfalfa pellets via the AHCS. Pearson correlations were developed between the 70-d means of daily CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio, respiratory quotient (RQ), and heat of production estimates for the dams and their progeny by regressing maternal parameters on the parameters of the progeny, using beginning dam and progeny BW as covariates, and year as an indicator variable. A dam’s CH<sub>4</sub> emission was very strongly correlated with that of their offspring (ρ = 0.86). The CO<sub>2</sub> emission and O<sub>2</sub> consumption of the dams were both also very strongly (ρ = 0.92 and ρ = 0.97, respectively) correlated, with that of their progeny. The heat production and CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of the dams were very strongly (ρ = 0.96) and fairly (ρ = 0.50) correlated, respectively, with that of their progeny. Lastly, the RQ of the dam was also very strongly correlated (ρ = 0.87) with the RQ of the progeny. These results indicate that CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio, and heat of production of the dam are fairly to very strongly correlated to the gas flux parameters of their progeny. Hence, even with this small dataset, there is evidence that beef cattle traits related to greenhouse gas emissions are somewhat heritable and could potentially be selected in breeding animals to decrease greenhouse gas emission intensity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"6151a537583779ace30bcfb8126815c6a39544259e72b2371d859a62cef8177b","category":"Environment"}
