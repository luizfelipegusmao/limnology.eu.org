Green Credit Guidelines (NIGCG) is a major policy innovation to promote green credit and further improve sustainable economic development. The influence of these guidelines on environmentally friendly enterprises’ sustainable development capacity, proxied by environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG), has not yet been discussed. Therefore, this study takes the NIGCG issued in 2012 as a quasi-natural experiment, and adopts a propensity score matching–difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) model to test whether the NIGCG has affected ESG in environmentally friendly enterprises from 2009 to 2022. Our results indicate that the NIGCG significantly boosts environmentally friendly enterprises’ ESG, and this finding remains robust to a series of tests. In addition, a mediating effect analysis reveals that the NIGCG affects enterprises’ ESG through research and development (R&amp;D) investment, verifying the Porter hypothesis in China. Finally, we determine that the role of NIGCG in promoting ESG is significantly reflected in the non-politically connected enterprises and enterprises in the eastern region. The empirical results suggest that the authorities should stimulate enterprises’ R&amp;D investments through supporting policies, such as tax reimbursement and government subsidies, and formulate differentiated policies according to the characteristics of enterprises and their regions, so as to improve the effect of NIGCG.","author":"Shengyu Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5f75b5d2d27f10a53442d2da9ff9fc370c95876e573c1848cce1b80917d190a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
