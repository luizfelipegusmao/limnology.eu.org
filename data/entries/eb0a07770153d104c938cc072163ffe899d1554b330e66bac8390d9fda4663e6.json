{"title":"Evaluating EEG-Based Parameters for Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis Using a Synthetic Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0633/v1","date":1720434458000,"content":"This study explores the efficacy of using EEG-based parameters to diagnose bipolar disorder. A synthetic dataset was generated, including both correctly diagnosed and misdiagnosed cases, simulating realistic clinical conditions. EEG features such as theta-alpha mean, beta band mean, and coherence measures were used to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 92%, demonstrating strong potential for EEG-based diagnostics. However, challenges such as standardization of electrode configurations and addressing equipment differences are crucial for broader applicability and validity of the findings in diverse clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb0a07770153d104c938cc072163ffe899d1554b330e66bac8390d9fda4663e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
