{"title":"A new type of sulfation reaction: C-sulfonation for α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups by a novel sulfotransferase SULT7A1","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae097/7618967?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are cytosolic enzymes that catalyze the transfer of sulfonate group to key endogenous compounds, altering the physiological functions of their substrates. SULT enzymes catalyze the <span>O</span>-sulfonation of hydroxy groups or <span>N</span>-sulfonation of amino groups of substrate compounds. In this study, we report the discovery of <span>C</span>-sulfonation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups mediated by a new SULT enzyme, SULT7A1, and human SULT1C4. Enzymatic assays revealed that SULT7A1 is capable of transferring the sulfonate group from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to the α-carbon of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl-containing compounds, including cyclopentenone prostaglandins as representative endogenous substrates. Structural analyses of SULT7A1 suggest that the <span>C</span>-sulfonation reaction is catalyzed by a novel mechanism mediated by His and Cys residues in the active site. Ligand-activity assays demonstrated that sulfonated 15-deoxy prostaglandin J<sub>2</sub> exhibits antagonist activity against the prostaglandin receptor EP2 and the prostacyclin receptor IP. Modification of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups via the new prostaglandin-sulfonating enzyme, SULT7A1, may regulate the physiological function of prostaglandins in the gut. Discovery of <span>C</span>-sulfonation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups will broaden the spectrum of potential substrates and physiological functions of SULTs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"052e0d5eb46071f7dec7de548829bb4e4c54d7638ac6ed740c3e6f38c500ce3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
