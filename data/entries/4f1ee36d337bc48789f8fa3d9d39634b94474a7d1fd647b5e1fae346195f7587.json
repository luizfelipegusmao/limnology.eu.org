Typically, high-resolution scanning/transmission electron microscopy (HR-S/TEM) is employed for this purpose, utilizing high-energy electrons. However, when studying delicate soft matter, the use of an electron beam as a probe can be intrusive, potentially altering the original structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.986-B1\">1</a>]. Therefore, it's important to investigate and comprehend how atomic-scale experiments affect the sample's structure. By controlling electron-sample interactions, including adjusting high tension, total electron dose, and electron dose rate, structural damage during experiments can be minimized [<a href=\"#ozae044.986-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.986-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4f1ee36d337bc48789f8fa3d9d39634b94474a7d1fd647b5e1fae346195f7587","category":"Environment"}
