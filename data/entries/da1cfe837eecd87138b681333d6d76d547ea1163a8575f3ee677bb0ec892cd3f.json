The influence of graphite particle size on physical and chemical properties has been extensively investigated, both as an additive and as a raw material [<a href=\"#ozae044.337-B4\">4-6</a>]. However, due to the morphological similarities between talc and graphite, identifying and characterizing graphite within such mixtures remains challenging. Chemical or physical separation of graphite from talc in bulk has also proven to be a formidable task. In the example SEM image acquired from graphite/ talc mixture, as shown in Figure 1, plate-like morphologies are prevalent within the mixture. Additionally, a uniform contrast is discernible in the backscattered electron image. Consequently, distinguishing between graphite and talc becomes a challenging task.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"da1cfe837eecd87138b681333d6d76d547ea1163a8575f3ee677bb0ec892cd3f","category":"Environment"}
