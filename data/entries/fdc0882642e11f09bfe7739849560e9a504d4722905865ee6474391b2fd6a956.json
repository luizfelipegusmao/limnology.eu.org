{"title":"Combine Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Optimize the Application Path of Digital Image Processing Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0270/v1","date":1719996364000,"content":"Artificial intelligence provides a new research concept for digital image processing. However, at present, artificial intelligence is rarely introduced into the teaching of digital image processing in colleges and universities, and there are problems such as obsolete teaching content, single teaching methods, and simple course experiments, which affect the teaching effect and are not conducive to the cultivation of comprehensive and innovative talents. Digital image processing technology brings more possibilities to communication engineering and makes communication more convenient. For example, video calls and photo transmission make people's communication methods in daily life more and more diversified. Time and space limitations allow people to meet online, creating more communication possibilities. However, there are still many problems and methods worthy of in-depth exploration. Therefore, this paper has a comprehensive understanding and mastery of the traditional and deep learning methods of digital image processing to improve the relevant project practice and scientific research exploration ability and refer for similar research conclusions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdc0882642e11f09bfe7739849560e9a504d4722905865ee6474391b2fd6a956","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
