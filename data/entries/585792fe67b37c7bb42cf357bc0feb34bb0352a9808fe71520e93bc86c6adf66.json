{"title":"Screening for Postpartum Depression: Barriers, Guidelines, and Measurement Scales","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0463/v1","date":1722983270000,"content":"Background: Screening for postpartum depression can lower prevalence and ensure that mothers get adequate treatment and support. Yet, few practitioners screen.The present article is a brief review on barriers to screening and two screening scales that are validated for perinatal women. Findings: Despite recommendations from health organizations, most new mothers are not screened for depression. Providers cite lack of time, opening “Pandora’s box,” and lack of resources for mothers who screen positive as reasons for why they do not screen. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaires are brief screening scales that have been validated for new mothers and are widely available.Conclusions: Screening is the necessary first step to identifying new mothers who are depressed. Practitioners who screen need a clear plan, and to know how to access available community resources, so they will know what to do when a mother screens positive.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"585792fe67b37c7bb42cf357bc0feb34bb0352a9808fe71520e93bc86c6adf66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
