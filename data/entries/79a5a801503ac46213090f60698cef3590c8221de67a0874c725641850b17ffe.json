{"title":"Analysis of sulfide signaling in rice highlights specific drought responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/5130/7684510?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hydrogen sulfide regulates essential plant processes, including adaptation responses to stress situations, and the best characterized mechanism of action of sulfide consists of the post-translational modification of persulfidation. In this study, we reveal the first persulfidation proteome described in rice including 3443 different persulfidated proteins that participate in a broad range of biological processes and metabolic pathways. In addition, comparative proteomics revealed specific proteins involved in sulfide signaling during drought responses. Several proteins are involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and energy-related pathways, and ion transmembrane transport and cellular water homeostasis, with the aquaporin family showing the highest differential levels of persulfidation. We revealed that water transport activity is regulated by sulfide which correlates with an increasing level of persulfidation of aquaporins. Our findings emphasize the impact of persulfidation on total ATP levels, fatty acid composition, levels of reactive oxygen species, antioxidant enzymatic activities, and relative water content. Interestingly, the role of persulfidation in aquaporin transport activity as an adaptation response in rice differs from current knowledge of Arabidopsis, which highlights the distinct role of sulfide in improving rice tolerance to drought.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"79a5a801503ac46213090f60698cef3590c8221de67a0874c725641850b17ffe","category":"Environment"}
