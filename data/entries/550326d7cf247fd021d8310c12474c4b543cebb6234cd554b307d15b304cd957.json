{"title":"Green Scalar Function Method for Analyzing Dielectric Media","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0197/v1","date":1722596969000,"content":"In this work we present a formalism based on scalar Green’s functions to deal with electromagnetic scattering problems. Although the formulations of the Mie theory and Born approximations in terms of electromagnetic scattering are well known and relevant, they have certain disadvantages; complexity, computational time, few symmetries, etc. Therefore, the study with scalar Green’s functions allows dealing with these problems with greater simplicity and efficiency. However, the information provided by the vector formulation is sacrificed. Nevertheless, different cases of electromagnetic scattering of dielectric media with different dimensions, geometries and refractive indices will be presented. Thus, we will be able to verify the capacity of this scalar method in predicting light scattering problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"550326d7cf247fd021d8310c12474c4b543cebb6234cd554b307d15b304cd957","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
