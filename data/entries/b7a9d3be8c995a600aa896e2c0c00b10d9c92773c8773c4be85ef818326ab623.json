Their biocompatibility and resemblance to biological tissues result in diverse applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, agriculture, and bioelectronics [<a href=\"#ozae044.995-B1\">1-4</a>]. Despite their advantages, hydrogels also face challenges such as improving thermal and environmental stability or incorporating useful hydrophobic compounds. To resolve these issues, researchers have formulated binary-solvent gels, such as those in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [<a href=\"#ozae044.995-B5\">5-6</a>], that are more stable and interact more favorably with hydrophobic compounds. Unlike water-only hydrogels, however, the internal structure of these binary solvent hydrogels remains poorly understood due to the lack of sample preparation techniques specific to the materials systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b7a9d3be8c995a600aa896e2c0c00b10d9c92773c8773c4be85ef818326ab623","category":"Environment"}
