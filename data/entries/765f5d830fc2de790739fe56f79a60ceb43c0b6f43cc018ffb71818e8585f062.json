{"title":"Overexpression of SETD7 is Associated with Progression of Ovarian Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1124/v2","date":1718788073000,"content":"SETD7 is a member of the SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase family and is a crucial component in the development and spread of a number of human cancers. However, the specific function of the SETD7 gene in ovarian cancer (OC) is still unclear. The purpose of this research was to elucidate the expression and role of SETD7 in OC. In comparison to normal controls, OC tissues (83%, 73/88) and cell lines exhibited higher protein levels of SETD7 (p &lt; 0.001). High SETD7 protein levels were substantially correlated with M category (p = 0.019) and FIGO stage (p = 0.021). Furthermore, the high mRNA levels of SETD7 were correlated to poor progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients and serous patients with OC (p &lt; 0.05). Importantly, the biological function experiments showed that SETD7 behaved as an oncogene in OC by dramatically facilitating the proliferation and migration of A2780 and SKOV3 cells. Additionally, SETD7 might promote cell migration via accelerating the EMT process in A2780 and SKOV3 cells. Our findings reveal that SETD7 may be a valuable molecular marker for identifying and anticipating the development of OC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"765f5d830fc2de790739fe56f79a60ceb43c0b6f43cc018ffb71818e8585f062","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
