As these methods are increasingly employed to inform direct public health action, it is important to rigorously evaluate the risk of false positive and false negative haplotypes derived from clinically-relevant sample types. We performed a control experiment evaluating haplotype recovery from AmpSeq of 5 marker genes (<i>ama1</i>, <i>csp</i>, <i>msp7</i>, <i>sera2</i>, and <i>trap</i>) from DBS containing mixtures of DNA from 1 to 10 known <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> reference strains across 3 parasite densities in triplicate (n = 270 samples). While false positive haplotypes were present across all parasite densities and mixtures, we optimized censoring criteria to remove 83% (148/179) of false positives while removing only 8% (67/859) of true positives. Post-censoring, the median pairwise Jaccard distance between replicates was 0.83. We failed to recover 35% (477/1365) of haplotypes expected to be present in the sample. Haplotypes were more likely to be missed in low-density samples with &lt;1.5 genomes/μL (OR: 3.88, CI: 1.82–8.27, vs. high-density samples with ≥75 genomes/μL) and in samples with lower read depth (OR per 10,000 reads: 0.61, CI: 0.54–0.69). Furthermore, minority haplotypes within a sample were more likely to be missed than dominant haplotypes (OR per 0.01 increase in proportion: 0.96, CI: 0.96–0.97). Finally, in clinical samples the percent concordance across markers for multiplicity of infection ranged from 40%-80%. Taken together, our observations indicate that, with sufficient read depth, the majority of haplotypes can be successfully recovered from DBS while limiting the false positive rate.","author":"Zena Lapp","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"dedc5eef966b5c927d53d195a861f110779d55bfff73381d3e293750ef933408","category":"Environment"}
