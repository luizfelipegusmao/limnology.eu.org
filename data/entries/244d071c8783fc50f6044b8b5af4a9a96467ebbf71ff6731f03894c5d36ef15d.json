In approximately 30%–40% of lung cancer patients, bone metastases ensues with osteolytic destruction. Worse still, intractable pain, pathological fracture, and nerve compression caused by bone metastases are currently the bottleneck of research, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. Therefore, the present study aims at investigating the effectiveness of a new composite material made of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) and Endostar on repairing bone defects in vitro and in vivo. As indicated in results, the mechanical properties of CPC+Endostar and CPC+PLGA+Endostar do not differ from those of pure CPC. The PLGA-embedded Endostar slow-release microspheres were designed and prepared, and were combined with CPC. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a biodegradable polymer material in vivo, so the effect on its mechanical properties is negligible. CPC+Endostar and CPC+PLGA+Endostar have been proved to inhibit cell proliferation, promote apoptosis and block cell cycle in G2 phase; the expression levels of osteoclast-related genes CXCL2, TGF-β1, IGF-1, IL-6, and RANKL were significantly decreased while osteogenic ability and alkaline phosphatase activity observably enhanced. In vivo studies have revealed that the expression levels of TRAP, RANKL, and Caspase3 in CPC+PLGA+ENDO-treated tumor tissues after 3 weeks were higher than those in other groups with the prolongation of animal treatment time, while the expression levels of OPN and BCL2 were lower than those in other groups. In hematoxylin and eosin and TUNEL staining, 3 weeks of CPC+PLGA+ENDO-treatment yielded higher tissue necrosis and apoptosis than other groups; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging results showed the posterior edge bone damage reduced as a result of the CPC+PLGA+ENDO grafting in vertebral pedicle. Overall, the feasibility and reliability of CPC-loaded Endostar in the treatment of bone metastasis in lung cancer were investigated in this study, so as to promote the basic research and treatment of bone metastasis in lung cancer and other malignant tumors.</p>","author":"QingHua Tian, \nCong Tian, \nYingYing Lu, \nBiCong Yan, \nKaixian Zhang, \nChunGen Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"244d071c8783fc50f6044b8b5af4a9a96467ebbf71ff6731f03894c5d36ef15d","category":"Environment"}
