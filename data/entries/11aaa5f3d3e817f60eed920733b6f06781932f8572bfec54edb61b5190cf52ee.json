One of the most prominent methods in this field is known as Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). This technique leverages the power of a focused, high-energy laser beam to selectively melt and bond powder particles together, layer-by-layer, to construct objects in a three-dimensional form. The printing process utilizes a reservoir filled with powder material, encompassing a wide range of meltable substances including various metals [<a href=\"#ozae044.330-B1\">1</a>] and different types of polymers [<a href=\"#ozae044.330-B2\">2</a>]. A thin layer of powder is spread from the reservoir onto the print area and selectively melted following computer-aided design (CAD); this process is repeated layer by layer to manufacture the desired object and a 50 Î¼m feature resolution has been previously shown [<a href=\"#ozae044.330-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"11aaa5f3d3e817f60eed920733b6f06781932f8572bfec54edb61b5190cf52ee","category":"Environment"}
