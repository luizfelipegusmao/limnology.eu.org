{"title":"The Circular Fluid Heating &ndash; Transient Entropy Generation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1250/v1","date":1711014127000,"content":"Two heating surfaces with longitudinal fins are located within the closed channel inside the housing made of thermal insulation material. The air flow inside the channel was carried out by an axial fan. The heating of the fins is established by using two positive temperature coefficient heating elements (PTC). Air flows circularly from one finned surface to another, and after reaching the required temperature, it leaves the housing. In the heating system conceived in this way, a methodology based on transient thermal irreversibility of heating sources and circular air flow has been established. Volumetric air flow and circulation time within the channel were varied. The total entropy generated does not include hydraulic irreversibility, but transient thermal irreversibility of the air and heat sources. For conducting analytical modeling, the temperature of the PTC heater was considered constant at 423K and 473K. Volumetric air flow varied in the interval from 0.00001m3s-1 to 0.00006m3s-1. The experimental determination of the transient thermal entropy was performed at a much higher air flow rate of 0.005m3s-1 inside the closed channel. Due to the continuous increase in air temperature, the temperatures of both PTC heaters increased within the examined time interval of 300s. According to experimental testing, the total transient thermal entropy of the described heating system has a minimum after 175s from the start of the circular heating of the air. The minimum of transient entropy also implies the optimal time of channel opening and exit of heated air.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"544d40101be02b8f74c2e7ed907e6af191e312155317d882ccd5833cd936c375","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
