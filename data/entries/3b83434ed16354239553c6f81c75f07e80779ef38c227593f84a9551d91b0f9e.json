{"title":"15 Influence of early progesterone removal on follicular development, estrus expression, and pregnancy rates in presynchronized beef cows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/58/7617992?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of early progesterone removal on pregnancy rates to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) in presynchronized beef cows. Postpartum beef cows (n = 922; body condition score = 4.9 ± 0.77; days postpartum = 77.3 ± 20.77 d) from 7 locations were enrolled in a completely randomized design. Within location, cows were stratified by parity and days postpartum before being randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) 7&amp;7 Synch: Cows received a controlled internal drug release insert (CIDR) and a 25-mg injection of prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> (PG1; d 0). Cows received 100 μg of GnRH on d 7 and the CIDR was removed 7 d later, concurrently with a second prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> (PG2) injection (d 14). Cows received a second injection of GnRH and were FTAI 60-66 h after PG2 (d 17); 2) 7&amp;6 Synch: Cows received the same treatment as 7&amp;7 Synch cows; however, CIDR removal and PG2 were performed on d 13, and cows were FTAI 60-66 h after CIDR removal. Ovarian ultrasonography was performed to determine follicle diameter and CL presence at PG2 and FTAI in a subset of cows (n = 40). Estrus detection patches were utilized to evaluate estrus expression between PG2 and FTAI. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed 28-35 d after FTAI. Cows exposed to the 7&amp;7 Synch tended to have larger follicle diameter at PG2 compared with 7&amp;6 Synch cows (P = 0.09); however, there were no differences in follicle diameter at FTAI. Cows that expressed estrus tended to have larger follicle diameter at FTAI compared with cows that failed to express estrus (P = 0.10). Follicular growth between PG2 and FTAI, percentage of cows with a corpus luteum at PG2, and ovulation rate were not impacted by treatment (P ≥ 0.56). No differences were determined between treatments for estrus expression (7&amp;7 Synch: 77.1 ± 5.91; 7&amp;6 Synch: 74.6 ± 6.28; P = 0.50) or pregnancy rates to FTAI (7&amp;7 Synch: 60.1 ± 4.32; 7&amp;6 Synch: 58.2 ± 4.26; P = 0.69). In conclusion, early removal of progesterone did not impact pregnancy rates in presynchronized beef cows. Thus, the 7&amp;6 Synch protocol described herein may be used as an alternative to the conventional 7&amp;7 Synch protocol without compromising fertility.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3b83434ed16354239553c6f81c75f07e80779ef38c227593f84a9551d91b0f9e","category":"Environment"}
