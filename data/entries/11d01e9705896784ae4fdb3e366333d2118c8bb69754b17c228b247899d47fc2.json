{"title":"A Novel Mastadenovirus from N. noctula which Represents a Distinct Evolutionary Branch of Viruses Infecting Bats in Europe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0564/v1","date":1715231774000,"content":"Bats are natural hosts for a wide variety of viruses and could therefore be the reservoir, source and spillover for several mammalian viruses, including adenoviruses. We examined faecal samples from 12 bats (five species of the family Vespertilionidae) from central Russia (Moscow Region) and found that two of them (16%) were positive for mastadenoviruses. One of the identified viruses was isolated from faeces of Nyctalis noctule and named BatAdV/MOW15-Nn19. The genome of the BatAdV/MOW15-Nn19 was 37,915 bp in length. Comparative studies have shown significant divergence of the nucleotide sequence of the BatAdV/MOW15-Nn19 genome from European mastadenoviruses, the highest genome sequence similarity was to isolate WA3301 from an Australian bat. Phylogenetic analysis, as well as a comparative analysis of the protein coding genes to homologous available from public database, showed evidence of novel species within Mastadenovirus genus (preliminary named «K»). Analysis of the short part of the DNA polymerase gene of BatAdV/MOW15-Nn19 reveals few NCBI records from Europe with high identity to the new virus, i.e. mastadenoviruses related to the new species are circulating in European bats. The partial genome of another mastadenovirus from Pipistrellus nathusii was identified, it represented bat adenovirus species B, which is widely distributed in European Vespertilionidae bats. New data on the genetic diversity of bat adenoviruses may help to better understand how they evolved in mammals and spread across Europe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11d01e9705896784ae4fdb3e366333d2118c8bb69754b17c228b247899d47fc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
