{"title":"Shear-Wave Ultrasonographic Elastography in Pediatric Spleen and Its Role in Differential Diagnosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0275/v1","date":1714980672000,"content":": Shear-wave elastography (SWE) has become popular in clinical practice for many diseases.However, there are not adequate research for spleen-related diseases.This study aimed to investigate the potential of quantitative values obtained through SWE in evaluating spleen pathologies in the pediatric population and to demonstrate its perfomance to differentiate splenomegaly-related diseases.Research group retrospectively included children with pathological diagnoses related to spleen from November 2016 to April 2021 and they were categorized three groups as portal hypertension (PH), benign lymphoid hyperplasia (BLH), malignant infiltration (MI).Spleen sizes and parenchymal stiffness were also calculated for each group.Subsequently, mean spleen stiffness in each compared with normal values within the same age group.In total 2781 children (1379 children for study group, 1402 children for control group) were enrolled to the study.The highest stiffness were observed in the PH group, which is statistically higher than others (p&amp;lt;0.05). Although the mean spleen stiffness in the group with BLH was higher than the control and MI group, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08).The mean stiffness in the group with MI was significantly lower than both the control group (p=0.005) and PH (p=0.01).In conclusion, using SWE in the differential diagnosis of etiologies causing splenomegaly, could make important contribution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f16ea1f3b0422c6425ef7d8abc993dafe1521bba6d8f7367aa68dfca7d76693","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
