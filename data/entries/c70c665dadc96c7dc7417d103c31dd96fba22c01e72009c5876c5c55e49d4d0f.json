{"title":"Understanding Phase Stabilization and Transformations in Ga2O3 Wide-Bandgap Semiconductors Through In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.794/7719969?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The wide bandgap (∼4.8 eV) semiconductor gallium oxide (Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is of significant interest for applications in high-power electronics and UV photodetection. Of its four commonly accepted polymorphs – trigonal α, monoclinic β, cubic γ, and orthorhombic κ(ε) – β is calculated to the most thermodynamically stable polymorph while γ is the least. In high-power electronics, β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is the most widely used, but despite its thermodynamic stability, γ-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> inverse-spinel inclusions often form during the growth of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films, particularly when doped, as with Ge, Sn, or Sl; alloyed with Al or Mg; or even at some contact metallization interfaces.[<a href=\"#ozae044.794-B1\">1-4</a>] The potential detrimental effect of these γ inclusions on the performance of devices based on β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has not been well-studied [<a href=\"#ozae044.794-B1\">1</a>], and the mechanism(s) of their formation have remained speculative. The κ-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase exhibits excellent UV photodetection properties, but is very difficult to stabilize. It has been recently reported that slight doping during low-temperature deposition may be capable of facilitating the growth of κ-phase, but details of the resulting structure and its thermal stability are important outstanding questions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c70c665dadc96c7dc7417d103c31dd96fba22c01e72009c5876c5c55e49d4d0f","category":"Environment"}
