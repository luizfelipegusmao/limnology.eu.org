{"title":"Novel Nonlinear Suspension based on the Concept of Origami Metastructures: Theoretical and Experimental Investigations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2059/v1","date":1727329609000,"content":"This study presents a comprehensive investigation on an innovative mechanical system inspired by recent advancements in metamaterials, more specifically the work is focused on Origami-type structures for their intriguing mechanical properties. Originating from the specific fields such as aerospace for their lightweight and foldable characteristics, Origami mechanical devices exhibit unique non-linear stiffness, in particular, when suitably designed, they show Quasi-Zero Stiffness (QZS) characteristics within a specific working range. The QZS property, aligned with the High Static Low Dynamic (HSLD) stiffness concept, suggests promising applications such as a low-frequency mechanical passive vibration isolator. The study explores the vibration isolation characteristics of Origami-type suspensions, with a particular emphasis on their potential application as low-frequency passive vibration isolators. The Kresling Origami Module (KOM) has been selected for its compactness and compatibility with 3D printers. A detailed analysis using 3D CAD, Finite Element Analysis, and experimental testing have been carried out. The investigation includes the analysis of the influence of geometric parameters on the non-linear Force-Displacement curve. Multibody simulations validate the low-frequency isolation properties within the QZS region, and disparities in dynamic properties beyond the QZS range. The study underscores the transformative potential of Origami-type metamaterials in enhancing low-frequency vibration isolation technology. It also highlights challenges related to material properties and loading mass variations, providing valuable insights for future developments in this promising field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"056f94b28df96f3e6ee2ab23ed269f51cab00fe96f853517903f63ade05e35cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
