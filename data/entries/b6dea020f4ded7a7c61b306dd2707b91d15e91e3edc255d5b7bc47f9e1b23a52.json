{"title":"Improvement of Outcomes over the Last Decades in Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma Treated by Radical Radiotherapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1891/v1","date":1721814571000,"content":"Backround: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of different radiotherapy techniques used in routine clinical practice for the radical treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer and to assess improvements over the last few decades.\nMethods: We compared the outcomes of patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with curative radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy between January 1992 and December 2020, using 2D-RT, 3D-CRT/IMRT, and VMAT techniques. A retrospective analysis was conducted on eighty-one patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. \nResults: The median follow-up time was 26 months (range: 6-290). In multivariate analysis, radiotherapy technique, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), nodal stage, and clinical stage were identified as statistically significant factors affecting overall survival and local-regional relapse-free survival. Grade 2-4 early and late side effects were significantly more frequent in Group I patients (treated with 2D Conventional Radiotherapy) (20.3%) compared to Group II patients (treated with 3DCRT/IMRT and VMAT techniques) (3.1%)\nConclusion: KPS, stage, and advanced RT techniques independently significantly affected outcomes. Moreover, advanced RT techniques were associated with a significant reduction in side effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6dea020f4ded7a7c61b306dd2707b91d15e91e3edc255d5b7bc47f9e1b23a52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
