{"title":"Hallmarks of Brain Plasticity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1269/v1","date":1726552845000,"content":"Brain plasticity is the ability of the brain to change and adapt in response to experience or learning. Its hallmarks are developmental flexibility, complex interactions of genetic and environmental influences, and structure-functional changes comprising neurogenesis, axonal sprouting, and synaptic remodeling. Herein, we review brain plasticity association with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Studies on brain plasticity have important practical implications. Numerous cerebral ncRNAs are linked with neurological disorders, which makes them putative targets for RNA-based diagnostics and therapeutics since molecular characteristics of brain plastic change may reveal disease course and rehabilitative potential of the patient. A new insight into the concept of brain plasticity will provide perspectives on functional recovery following brain damage. The knowledge of this phenomenon will enable physicians to exploit cerebral plastic potential and regulate eloquent networks with timely interventions. Future studies will provide pathophysiologic mechanisms of brain plasticity at macro- and microscopic levels to advance rehabilitation strategies and improve the quality of life in neurological disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a70b44d3d15e9fe7995a6af9c7ff5aa4c5e57ab4d54b2ed25dff884e8f5189bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
