{"title":"Supplementation of Selenium‐Yeast Enhances Fishmeal Replacement by Soy Protein Concentrate in Diets for Golden Pompano (Trachinotus ovatus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8953076?af=R","date":1675670400000,"content":"<p>An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of selenium-yeast (Se-yeast) supplementation on replacing fishmeal with soy protein concentrate (SPC) in diets for golden pompano (<i>Trachinotus ovatus</i>). The control diet (C) contained 400 g/kg fishmeal, of which 40% and 80% of the fishmeal in diet C were substituted by SPC, with or without 1 g/kg Se-yeast supplementation (four diets, R40, R80, R40 + Se, and R80 + Se, were formulated). The weight gain of the fish-fed diet C showed no obvious difference from that of the fed-diet R40 + Se, although it was higher than that of the fish-fed diets R40, R80, and R80 + Se. Fish-fed diets R40 + Se and R80 + Se exhibited higher weight gain and nitrogen and phosphorus retention efficiencies, whereas they had relatively lower feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and nitrogen and phosphorus waste outputs than fish-fed diets R40 and R80. No statistical differences were found in condition factor and whole-body components either between fish-fed diets R40 and R40 + Se or between fish-fed diets R80 and R80 + Se. Our research suggests that it is feasible to reduce dietary fishmeal for golden pompano to 240 g/kg with SPC and 1 g/kg Se-yeast inclusion.</p>","author":"Yubo Wu, \nHuaiyi Fang, \nHengjia Ma, \nXiujuan Wang, \nFemi Fawole","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"9a544f3350b739d14e83e8713e069fc433988eed2609c40a7e715724a10644e7","category":"Environment"}
