{"title":"EcoFloras Elucidate Insights from Biodiversity Data: Evaluating the Strengths and Limitations of iNaturalist Observations and Herbarium Specimens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0017/v1","date":1727756338000,"content":"The EcoFlora Project was launched at the New York Botanical Garden and expanded to other botanical gardens across the United States to enhance our understanding of urban plant biodiversity through community science iNaturalist observations. This study evaluates the strengths and limitations of using iNaturalist observations and herbarium specimen records in biodiversity research, demonstrating their complementary roles. iNaturalist engages community scientists and provides real-time data but may suffer from biases and inconsistent identification accuracy. Conversely, herbarium specimens offer verified, historical records but require significant resources for collection and upkeep. Through case studies in five U.S. metro areas, EcoFloras highlight the effectiveness of combining these data sources for comprehensive biodiversity assessments. The project reveals how leveraging both digital tools and traditional specimen collections can provide a more complete picture of biodiversity, informing conservation strategies and biodiversity management. Integrating community science with established scientific methods fosters greater public involvement in conservation and offers a robust framework for addressing biodiversity challenges. Rigorous data cleaning is essential, and future efforts should focus on linking both data sources to enhance plant conservation strategies. By leveraging the strengths of both iNaturalist and herbarium data, researchers can greatly enhance the effectiveness of conservation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bacfbd84f7ebdc08fb52e105ea37e03932c30bb52fa4b8ac1cfa022c06c91df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
