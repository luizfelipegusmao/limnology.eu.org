{"title":"Fading beauty: The protein degradation mechanism behind rose petal senescence","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1578/7619586?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span>Sending a bouquet of roses to a loved one is a profoundly romantic gesture. While the desire for these beautiful blooms to last forever remains unattainable, the process of their natural fading can be prolonged. In this issue, <strong>Jingyun Lu, Guifang Zhang, and colleagues</strong> (<a href=\"#koae069-B3\">Lu et al. 2024</a>) provide a comprehensive understanding of how rose petal senescence is controlled at the molecular level. In their study, a new rose protein, SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED F-BOX (RhSAF), was identified as a key player in mediating ethylene-induced petal senescence by destabilizing proteins involved in gibberellic acid (GA) signaling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"71508601610bdd8632a6ab641e9679d9ac590cd865c9216151676c105923e824","category":"Environment"}
