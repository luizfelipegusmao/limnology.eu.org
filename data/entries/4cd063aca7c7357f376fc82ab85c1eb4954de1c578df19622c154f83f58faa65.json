{"title":"An Acid Responsive Fluorescent Molecule for Erasable Anti-Counterfeiting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0049/v1","date":1722562705000,"content":"A tetraphenylethylene-derived compound, TPEPhDAT, has been prepared by successive Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and ring-closing reactions. This compound exhibits aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties in the DMSO/MeOH system, with a fluorescence emission intensity in the aggregated state that is 5-fold higher than that of its counterpart in a dilute solution. Moreover, the diaminotriazine structure of the molecule is a good acceptor of protons, and thus the TPEPhDAT molecule exhibits acid-responsive fluorescence. TPEPhDAT was protonated by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), leading to a fluorescence quenching, which was reversibly restored by treatment with ammonia (On-Off switch). Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) computational studies have shown that protonation enhances the electron-withdrawing capacity of the triazine nucleus and reduces the bandgap, producing a more intense intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), thus leading to fluorescence quenching. MeOH can easily remove the protonated TPEPhDAT, and this acid-induced discolouration and erasable property can be applied in anti-counterfeiting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4cd063aca7c7357f376fc82ab85c1eb4954de1c578df19622c154f83f58faa65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
