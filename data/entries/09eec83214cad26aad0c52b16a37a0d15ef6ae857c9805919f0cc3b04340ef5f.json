Characterized by their unique interlayer interactions and exotic physical properties, these materials are driving transformative advancements in fields spanning from electronics, energy storage and conversion, photonics and optoelectronics [<a href=\"#ozae044.589-B1\">1</a>]. Given that numerous novel properties hinge on the number of 2D layers, precise quantification of thickness is paramount in the design of 2D vdW materials to achieve desired properties and performance. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an essential tool for materials structural and chemical characterizations on the atomic to nanometer scale [<a href=\"#ozae044.589-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.589-B3\">3</a>], determining thickness poses challenges due to its comparatively lower sensitivity along the beam path compared to atomic force microscopy (AFM). Here, we aim to address this technical challenge through a series of control experiments to measure and calibrate the thickness profiles of 2D vdW layers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"09eec83214cad26aad0c52b16a37a0d15ef6ae857c9805919f0cc3b04340ef5f","category":"Environment"}
