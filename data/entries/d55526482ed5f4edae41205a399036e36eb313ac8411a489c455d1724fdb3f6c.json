{"title":"Ultrasound Guided Hip Injections with High Density Hyaluronic Acid: Outcome at One Year Follow Up","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0730/v1","date":1710253115000,"content":"The ultrasound guided viscosupplementation of the hip joint with hyaluronic acid(HA)is considered a standard procedure among the conservative treatments for hip arthritis.The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical benefit and the incidence of adverse events of the technique in a obseravtional study at one year follow up.\r\nWe evaluated a consecutive series of 85 patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic arthritis that performed intra-articular ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injections. The scales used for evaluation were modified Harris Hip Score(mHHS),WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster University),Hip Outcome Score (HOOS) with subscale Sport (HOOSs), for pain the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS).The patients were classified according to Tonnisâ€™ radiological classification of arthrosis (range 0-3):20 patients(grade 0),32(grade 1),18(grade 2),15(grade 3).At last follow up all the scales increased:mHHS from 59.35 to 82.1,HOOS from 69.45 to 78.53,HOS Sport from 47.4 to 58.11,VAS from 6.09 to 3.97,WOMAC from 33.2 to 31.5 (p&lt;0.05 for all the parameters);13/85 requested arthroplasty.\r\nBased on our findings, indication for use of hyaluronic acid is limited to patients with mild to moderate arthritis.Patients in advanced arthritis refusing replacement surgery and asking for this treatment should be informed about the poor results of the technique even in the short term follow up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d55526482ed5f4edae41205a399036e36eb313ac8411a489c455d1724fdb3f6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
