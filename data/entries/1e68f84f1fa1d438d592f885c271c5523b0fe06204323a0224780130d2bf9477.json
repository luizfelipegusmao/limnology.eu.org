{"title":"Corylin alleviated sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction via attenuating inflammation through downregulation of microRNA-214-5p","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae081/7689627?rss=1","date":1717718400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Corylin, a natural flavonoid, is isolated from the fruit of <span>Psoralea corylifolia</span> L. Nevertheless, the effect of corylin on sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the role and mechanism of corylin in sepsis related cardiac dysfunction.<div>Methods</div>Experiments were carried out on mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or myocardial cell sepsis induced by LPS.<div>Results</div>Administration of corylin improved cardiac dysfunction induced by LPS or CLP in mice. Corylin inhibited the increases of interleukin-1 (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the heart of mice with LPS or CLP. LPS elevated the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in cardiomyocytes, which were inhibited by corylin treatment. Corylin attenuated the increases of microRNA (miRNA)-214-5p in the heart of mice with LPS, CLP, LPS-treated NRCMs, H9c2 and AC16 cells. Administration of miRNA-214-5p agomiR reversed the improving effects of corylin on the damaged cardiac function and the increases of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in mice treated with LPS.<div>Conclusion</div>These outcomes indicated that corylin improved sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction by inhibiting inflammation. And corylin inhibited inflammation of sepsis by decreasing miRNA-214-5p. Downregulation of miRNA-214-5p improved sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction and inhibited inflammatory factors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"1e68f84f1fa1d438d592f885c271c5523b0fe06204323a0224780130d2bf9477","category":"Environment"}
