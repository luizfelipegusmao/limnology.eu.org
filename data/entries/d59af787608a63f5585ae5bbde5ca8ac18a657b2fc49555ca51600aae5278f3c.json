The use of the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies-based therapies has changed the frequency and epidemiology of infections. We report herein the safety profile of the pivotal clinical trials conducted with anti-CD38 mAbs (daratumumab and isatuximab) and anti-SLAMF7 mAbs (elotuzumab) that led to the approval of regimens employed today in NDMM and RRMM patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d59af787608a63f5585ae5bbde5ca8ac18a657b2fc49555ca51600aae5278f3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
