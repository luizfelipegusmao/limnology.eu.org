{"title":"Adaptive Supervised Learning on Data Streams in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces with Data Sparsity Constraint","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1733/v1","date":1716798066000,"content":"In recent years, the abundance of streaming data has posed significant challenges for traditional machine learning algorithms due to the dynamic nature and high volume of data. To address these challenges, this paper presents an adaptive supervised learning framework designed for data streams, leveraging the power of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) while incorporating a data sparsity constraint. The proposed framework aims to adaptively update the model to efficiently handle the continuous arrival of streaming data while ensuring accurate and reliable predictions. The primary objective is to exploit the RKHS framework, which provides a rich mathematical structure for learning in high-dimensional feature spaces. By utilizing RKHS, the model can capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in the streaming data. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a data sparsity constraint to address the issue of limited resources and computational efficiency. The constraint promotes the selection of a subset of relevant features, reducing the dimensionality of the problem and enhancing the scalability of the learning algorithm. This constraint not only improves computational efficiency but also mitigates the effects of noisy or irrelevant features, leading to more robust and accurate predictions. To achieve adaptability, the proposed framework employs an online learning approach that incrementally updates the model parameters as new data arrives. This allows the model to adapt to concept drift and changing data distributions, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness over time. The adaptation process is guided by a mechanism that balances the exploitation of current knowledge with the exploration of new information, enabling the model to gradually evolve and refine its predictions. Experimental evaluations on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in handling streaming data. The results indicate that the adaptive supervised learning approach in RKHS with a data sparsity constraint outperforms traditional batch learning methods and exhibits superior accuracy, scalability, and adaptability in dynamic data stream scenarios. Overall, this research contributes to the development of adaptive supervised learning methods for data streams, highlighting the effectiveness of RKHS and the significance of incorporating a data sparsity constraint. The proposed framework offers a promising solution to handle the challenges posed by streaming data, paving the way for real-time, efficient, and accurate learning in diverse application domains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"858824ca4e76016e62aa6048c2eb0c73844634537e0dfad511dd092a0caa327c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
