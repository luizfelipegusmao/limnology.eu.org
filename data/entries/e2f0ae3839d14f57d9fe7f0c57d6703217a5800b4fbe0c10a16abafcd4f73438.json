{"title":"Agronomic and Economic Evaluation of Tree Species in Agroforestry Systems with Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) in Amazonas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1032/v1","date":1710774771000,"content":"Agroforestry systems (AFS) are beneficial ecosystems that increase cocoa productivity by providing shade and controlling pests. Despite deforestation, there is a transition towards more sustainable practices that combine diverse species with cocoa, generating economic and environmental benefits. This study evaluates AFS with cocoa in the Amazon region. Of the 72 farms evaluated, species diversity was observed, highlighting Cordia alliadora and Calycophyllum spruceanum with an im-portance value index (IVI) of 18.58% and 17.66%, respectively. Fruit trees such as Citrus limetta, Cocos nucifera, Mangifera indica, and Persea americana are common. The designed AFSs proved more profitable, generating revenue from the fourth year, while the conventional ones took longer. Indicators such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) supported the effi-ciency of the designed AFS. Six optimal species were identified with specific distances and planting systems, providing up to 45.83% total shade in flat topography and up to 2405 annual shade hours on a 7Â° slope. These results highlight the economic and agronomic viability of AFSs designed for regional cocoa production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2f0ae3839d14f57d9fe7f0c57d6703217a5800b4fbe0c10a16abafcd4f73438","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
