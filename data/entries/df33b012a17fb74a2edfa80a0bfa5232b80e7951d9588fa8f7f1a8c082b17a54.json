{"title":"Agricultural Micro Biogas Plants as a Factor in Farm Development&mdash;A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0754/v1","date":1715595437000,"content":"Energy from biogas is one of the most promising renewable energy sources. Significant, for technical, economic, and environmental reasons, is the construction of agricultural microgas plants next to households specialising in cattle rearing. The availability of free substrate makes it possible not only to produce one's electricity and heat but also to produce a more environmentally and human-friendly manure. The operation of biogas plants is, unfortunately, associated with technical problems. This paper presents the results of a study of the quality of electricity generated in an agricultural biogas plant built at a farm specialising in dairy cows, where the owner reported a problem with the voltage in the power supply network. Therefore, selected power quality parameters occurring at the connection point of the biogas plant were analysed in detail. As the authors' research showed, in the case in question, the agricultural biogas plant was connected via a cable with too small a conductor cross-section, which resulted in significant voltage exceedances, making it impossible to switch on the second of the biogas plant's generators. Replacement of the feed-in cable has enabled both generators to run, but significant fluctuations in the feed-in voltage values were still noticeable. Analysis of the subsequent measurements revealed the need for changes in the design of the digester itself. The proposal for change is to replace the two current digester mixers (each rated at 9 kW) with more mixers of lower power. The new mixers would operate in an alternating system, where only one would always be activated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df33b012a17fb74a2edfa80a0bfa5232b80e7951d9588fa8f7f1a8c082b17a54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
