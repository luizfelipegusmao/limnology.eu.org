{"title":"104 Maternal pre- and post-partum supplementation of Bacillus-based DFM enhanced cow and calf performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/33/7617953?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the effects of maternal supplementation of Bacillus-based direct-fed microbials (DFM) on physiology and growth performance of Bos indicus-influenced cow-calf pairs. On d 0 (~139 d before expected calving date), 72 fall-calving, Brangus crossbred beef heifers (25 to 37.5% Bos indicus; 20 to 22 mo of age) pregnant with their first offspring were stratified by their initial body weight (BW; 431 ± 31 kg) and body condition score (BCS; 6.0 ± 0.36; scale 1 to 9), and randomly allocated into 1 of 12 bahiagrass pastures (1 ha and 6 heifers per pasture). Treatments were randomly assigned to pastures (6 pastures per treatment) and consisted of heifers supplemented with 1 kg/d of soybean hulls dry matter (DM) added (BAC) or not (CON) with a Bacillus-based DFM mixture (BovacillusTM; Chr. Hansen A/S, Hørsholm, Denmark) from d 0 to 242 (139 ± 4 d prepartum to 104 ± 4 d postpartum). Calves were weaned on d 242 (96 ± 30 d of age) and then allocated into 1 of 16 drylot pens and limit-fed the same concentrate at 3.25% of BW until d 319. Maternal treatment effects were not detected (P ≥ 0.29) for herbage allowance, forage nutritive value, and heifer activity on pasture. Heifer BCS on d 39 and 63 tended (P ≤ 0.09) to be greater, whereas heifer BCS on d 91 was greater (P = 0.01) for BAC vs. CON heifers and did not differ (P ≥ 0.20) between treatments on d 179 and 242. Plasma concentrations of glucose did not differ from d 0 to 63 (P ≥ 0.14) but were greater (P = 0.005) on d 179 and tended (P = 0.09) to be greater on d 242 for BAC vs. CON heifers. First offspring BW at birth, ADG from birth to early weaning, and BW weaning did not differ (P ≥ 0.19), but BW at drylot exit (d 319) was greater (P = 0.05) for BAC vs. CON calves. Maternal treatment effects were not detected (P ≥ 0.42) for calf serum concentrations of IgG at birth, and post-vaccination plasma concentrations of glucose, cortisol and haptoglobin. However, serum titers against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were greater (P = 0.04) for BAC vs. CON calves on d 287, whereas seroconversion against parainfluenza 3 virus (PI-3) was greater (P &lt; 0.01) for BAC vs. CON calves on d 271. Thus, maternal supplementation of Bacillus-based DFM increased prepartum BCS gain and postpartum plasma concentrations of glucose of heifers and led to positive carryover effects on post-weaning BW gain and some indicators of humoral immune response to vaccination in their first offspring.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f33f4205b1cd5d5379dcbb5f117c11ef728886210f7e2fbbdce17e95b14ba7c9","category":"Environment"}
