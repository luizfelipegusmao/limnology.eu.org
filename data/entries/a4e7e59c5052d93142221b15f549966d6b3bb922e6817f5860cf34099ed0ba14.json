{"title":"Language abilities and associated risk factors of school-aged children with cleft lip and palate","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299095","date":1713794400000,"content":"<p>by Lim Hui Hui, Eh Yee Ling, Yazmin Ahmad Rusli, Goh Bee See, Hasherah Mohd Ibrahim</p>\r\n\r\nPrevious research on children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) reported unequivocal findings with regard to language skills, with the majority suggesting persistent difficulties in early childhood. While expressive language deficits improved with age, receptive language skills were consistently lower than peers. Further study investigating the long term and persistent impact of language deficits amongst school-aged children with CLP is warranted. This was a cross-sectional study, aimed to determine the language abilities and explore the associated risk factors in Malay speaking children with CLP in Malaysia. Fifty-two children with CLP aged 7- to 12-year-old participated in this study. Language skills were assessed using the Malay Preschool Language Assessment Tool and the adapted Subway–School–age Language &amp; Assessment Measures. Findings revealed that 14 (26.92%) school-aged children with CLP demonstrated language deficits. Children with CLP performed significantly poorer in reading comprehension (p = 0.031) and narrative (p = 0.026) skills. It was found that the age significantly influenced total receptive language score (β = 0.421, p = 0.003) and total expressive language score (β = 0.477, p = 0.000). Findings suggested that children with CLP may continue to have persistent language deficits into their school-age years. Recommendations for regular monitoring of language performance especially for those from younger age groups is warranted to help maximize school attainment.","author":"Lim Hui Hui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a4e7e59c5052d93142221b15f549966d6b3bb922e6817f5860cf34099ed0ba14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
