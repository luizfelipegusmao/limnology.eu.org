{"title":"Low Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity, Patient-Reported Measures and Reduced Nailfold Capillary Density Are Associated with Interstitial Lung Disease in Systemic Sclerosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1337/v1","date":1716304923000,"content":"To identify factors associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and build an algorithm to better define this association, for a personalized application in clinical practice. Methods. 78 SSc patients underwent HRCT to assess ILD. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were collected, focusing on those associated either directly or indirectly with lung involvement. The discriminant value of each variable was determined using the operating characteristic curves (ROC) and included in a model to estimate the strength of ILD association in SSc. Results. Thirty-three (42.31%) patients showed ILD on HRCT. DLco, M-Borg, GERD-Q, and capillary density were significantly associated with the presence of ILD-SSc. A model including these variables had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.697. DLco had an AUC of 0.861 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a cut-off ≤72.3% (sensitivity 78.8%, specificity 91.1%, +LR 8.86). The m-Borg scale showed an AUC of 0.883 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a cut-off &amp;gt;2 (sensitivity 84.8%, specificity 82.2%, +LR 4.77), GERD-Q had an AUC of 0.815 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a cut-off &amp;gt;7 (sensitivity 72.7%, specificity 86.7%, +LR 5.45). The capillary density showed an AUC of 0.815 (p&amp;lt;0.001) with a cut-off ≤4.78 (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 68.9%, +LR 2.82). Based on the pre-test probability values, these four variables were applied to Fagan's nomogram to calculate the post-test probability of this association. Conclusions. Our study identified four associated clinical factors of ILD in SSc patients. Moreover, their inclusion in an algorithm for the post-test probability, tailored to the specific patients’ characteristics, significantly increases the ability to find out the presence of SSc-ILD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f954ec4f04adf66e9b806df38e68d19789ad94042ae426c6a6a406866b32bd4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
