{"title":"Study on Key Properties and Model Establishment of Innovative Recycled Aggregate Pervious Concrete","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0163/v1","date":1717510482000,"content":"Traditional concrete pavements have poor water permeability, while the strength of pervious concrete pavements is low. To solve these problems, this study designed Innovative recycled aggregate pervious concrete (I-RAPC) with controllable water permeability and high strength by using response surface methodology, and investigated the effects of different pore parameters (number, diameter, material, distribution form, etc.) on the performance of I-RAPC. And the strength discount factor method was proposed to construct the theoretical calculation model of compressive strength and pipe pore parameters, and the calculation model of water permeability coefficient was established at the same time. The results show that the fewer the number of holes and the smaller the pipe diameter of I-RAPC, the higher its compressive strength and the smaller the water permeability coefficient. The theoretical model of compressive strength can accurately evaluate the discounting effect of the pore parameters on the compressive strength of I-RAPC, and the maximum relative error is only 7.52%, and the maximum relative error of the calculation model of water permeability coefficient is only 4.42%. I-RAPC has the advantages of high strength and permeability with controllable performance, which overcomes the problems of random distribution of pore space, uncertainty of water permeability, and strength of ordinary pervious concrete.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75ce5cdeefd84b7e279afc30e0beb09cd9260ec46eab2a102072235e70b03012","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
