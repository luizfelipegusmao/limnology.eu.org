{"title":"96 Evaluating the impact of macroenvironment temperature on thermoregulatory and milk quality parameters in lactating sows and their litter","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/31/7665004?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Farrowing facility macroenvironment temperatures (T<sub>Macro</sub>) are often maintained at the upper end of the thermoneutral zone (24–25°C) of lactating sows, which may result in heat stress and reduced milk quality and quantity. Therefore, the study objective was to evaluate the impact of T<sub>Macro</sub> on thermoregulatory and milk quality parameters in lactating sows and their litters. In two repetitions, 37 lactating sows (parity = 3.1 ± 1.7) and their litters (d 1 litter size = 12.0 ± 1.0) were housed within 1 of 3 farrowing rooms set to different T<sub>Macro</sub>: LOW (n = 12 sows and litters; 15.0 ± 0.4°C), MID (n = 13 sows and litters; 19.3 ± 0.2°C), and HIGH (n = 12 sows and litters; 24.6 ± 0.8°C). Lactating sows and litters were monitored from d 3 of lactation until weaning (19.8 ± 0.9 d of age). All litters were provided with a 0.34 × 1.52 m heating pad. Sow respiration rates (RR, breaths per minute, BPM) were measured daily at 0800, 1200, 1600 and 2000 h by counting the number of flank movements. Vaginal temperature (T<sub>V</sub>) was measured in all sows at 10-min intervals using implanted data loggers. One sentinel piglet from each litter was implanted with a temperature recording bolus at d 2 of age to monitor core body temperature in 15-min intervals. Milk samples were collected from all sows on d 6, 12, and 18 of lactation and analyzed for true protein %, total solid %, and fat %. Data were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX. The litter was considered the experimental unit for piglet measures, and the sow was considered the experimental unit for sow measures. Respiration rates were greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for HIGH (48 ± 2 bpm) sows versus MID (33 ± 2 BPM) and LOW (27 ± 2 bpm) sows, but no differences were detected between MID and LOW sows. A T<sub>Macro</sub> treatment by lactation day effect was observed for T<sub>V</sub> (<span>P</span> = 0.02), where HOT sows had greater T<sub>V</sub> on lactation d 15 (+0.31°C), 18 (+0.43°C) and 19 (+0.34°C) versus MID and LOW sows. Piglet core body temperature was reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) in the HIGH (39.07 ± 0.06 °C) versus the MID (39.31 ± 0.06 °C) and LOW (39.33 ± 0.07 °C) treatment groups, but it was similar for MID and LOW litters. Fat % was reduced for COLD (6.15 ± 0.52%) versus MID (7.35 ± 0.50%) sows on d 12, but no differences were observed when compared with HIGH sows (6.97 ± 0.52%). In conclusion, the HIGH treatment resulted in physiological heat stress for lactating sows and lowered piglet core body temperature, but it had minimal effects on measures of milk quality.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5f019461cdf4d3f749a7962ffb0515a41fdfd7f90adaf396e130b64be4ffe523","category":"Environment"}
