The increase in the abundance of this planktivorous fish evidences the growing importance of autochthonous herbivory food chains as the reservoir stabilized in this novel lentic ecosystem. These changes would otherwise remain unnoticed only through fish sampling, highlighting the importance of assessing trophic interactions to understand responses to damming at the community and ecosystem levels.</p>","author":"Vitor Manuel Barros Ferreira, \nMíriam Pilz Albrecht","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"1c8e4925b900cf219a985eefe81343e5f44b1c4461b9abe7d3fdaa65b886b57a","category":"Environment"}
