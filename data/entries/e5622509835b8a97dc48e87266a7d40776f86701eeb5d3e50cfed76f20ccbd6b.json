{"title":"A Pilot Evaluation of Oxidative Stress Markers and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Cytokine mRNA of Atopic Dermatitis Dogs Treated with Full Spectrum Cannabis Oil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2010/v1","date":1719633424000,"content":"Dermatological consultations are a significant aspect of daily operations at small animal clinics, with atopic dermatitis (CAD) affecting almost 15% of the canine population. The ECS role in the skin reveals its direct action on homeostasis and deregulation, contributing to dermatopathies. It also details its presence in specialized skin cells, revealing a delicate and complex therapeutic potential. Due to the difficulties and the growing scientific evidence of the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, this work aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of cannabis oil in treating CAD. Thus, canines diagnosed with CAD were divided into two groups: the group treated using full spectrum high cannabidiol (CBD) [cannabis oil orally] and the control group (olive oil). The evaluation methods for the effectiveness of the therapy were based on the measurement RNAm of interleukins 6, 10, and 31 and oxidative stress in the blood. Despite the theoretical basis, no significant results were obtained between the groups in this work. Thus, it is concluded that oral administration of full spectrum high CBD cannabis oil 2,5 mg/kg twice a day is not efficient in reducing IL and oxidative stress compared to placebo; nevertheless, it still presents a promising approach in the multi-target treatment of CAD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5622509835b8a97dc48e87266a7d40776f86701eeb5d3e50cfed76f20ccbd6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
