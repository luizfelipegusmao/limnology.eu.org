{"title":"The Effect of Climate Change on Organic Honey Efficiency in T&uuml;rkiye via Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0797/v1","date":1712827833000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of climate change on the efficiency of organic honey production in TÃ¼rkiye using a machine learning approach. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is employed for the Machine Learning (ML) modelling. The analysis includes data on organic honey production performance from 2004 to 2023, spanning a period of 20 years, and 8 different climate variables (16 variables depending on daytime and nighttime values). The dataset created to investigate the impact of climate change on organic honey yield comprises 28 columns and 120,960 rows. The study aimed to determine the significance of different climatic variables on the efficiency of organic honey production. The study found that, in addition to daytime solar radiation and temperature, wind speed and direction were also important factors. The sensitivity analysis has shown that minor alterations in the variables have a significant impact on the model's predictions. Additionally, non-linear relationships between the variables and honey production were identified. These findings suggest that it may be beneficial to consider implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in agricultural policies and beekeeping practices. The study suggests that machine learning has the potential to provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between climate change and agricultural production. This could aid in the sustainability and economic optimization of the sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04631da3a694fc79c917cef985263162376f8c5058eb7705dd36443c7b383a5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
