In particular, wide-bandgap materials are essential to host these deep-level defects with high spin states [<a href=\"#ozae044.760-B3\">3</a>]. Moreover, the interplay with higher dimensional defects can be used as a critical ‘knob’ to control properties further. For example, in silicon carbide (SiC), placing di-vacancy (V<sub>Si</sub>V<sub>C</sub>) spin qubits near stacking faults enhances their room temperature stability by modulating ionization energy [<a href=\"#ozae044.760-B4\">4</a>]. Given that the qubit’s properties are intertwined with other defects in the host material, quantifying the structural changes of dopant complexes within the local environment is critical to gain complete control of their behavior [<a href=\"#ozae044.760-B4\">4</a>]. Nevertheless, the identification and quantification of these defects/defect complexes, especially when obscured within the bulk matrix, remains formidable challenges attributed to the projective nature of conventional electron microscopy techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"49c68466426828f619af96f51da7d4fc03e3891754bb8c19bdffdf4adb7c70ea","category":"Environment"}
