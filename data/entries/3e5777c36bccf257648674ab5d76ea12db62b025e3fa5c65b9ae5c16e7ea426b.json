{"title":"Preparation and structural characteristics of polysaccharides from loquat peel waste, and their preliminary bioactivities","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13924?af=R","date":1727783357000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Loquat peel, often as food waste, is a valuable source of bioactive polysaccharides. However, study of such polysaccharides is insufficient, leaving a significant gap in understanding their preparation, structure and bioactivities.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, three types of loquat peel polysaccharides (LPWP, LPHP and LPNP) were sequentially extracted using hot water, HCl and NaOH solutions, respectively. Among them, LPWP was the purest, with a yield of 3.4% and molecular weight of 470.6 kDa, and it differed from LPHP and LPNP in structure, as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, which demonstrated that LPWP consisted of more arabinose (Ara) but less galacturonic acid, rhamnose and galactose, with molar percentages of 71.3%, 23.3%, 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively. Besides, LPWP also exhibited superior antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities <i>in vitro</i>, particularly in inhibiting α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Methylation and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed that LPWP was a methyl-esterified pectic polysaccharide rich in branched arabinan, as evidenced by the notable proportion of α-Ara residues, including T-α-Ara<i>f</i>, 1,5-α-Ara<i>f</i> and 1,2,3,5-α-Ara<i>f</i>, with molar percentages of 27.1%, 23.1% and 10.2%, respectively. AFM imaging further revealed its branched-chain morphology and aggregation behavior.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study highlights the potential of loquat peel polysaccharides as a bioactive ingredient with significant antioxidant and antihyperglycemic properties, particularly LPWP, which was found as a methyl-esterified pectic polysaccharide with abundant-branched arabinan. Our work provides valuable insights into the application of loquat peel polysaccharides in functional foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Dan Liu, \nLingju Zhang, \nHongge Huang, \nChangchun Fu, \nYunxiao Wei, \nZuolong Yu, \nChao Han, \nWei Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3e5777c36bccf257648674ab5d76ea12db62b025e3fa5c65b9ae5c16e7ea426b","category":"Environment"}
