{"title":"Energy poverty and environmental sustainability in Sub‐Saharan Africa: Evidence from method of moments quantile regression","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12551?af=R","date":1724654328000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The enormous ensembles of energy resources have elevated Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to a prominent position in the world energy scene as a leading region in forming a sustainable energy future. However, over half of the population in the region lives without electricity and less than 20% of the population has access to clean fuels. The excessive reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, kerosene, and solid biomass has implications for environmental outcomes in SSA. Nevertheless, the environmental impact of energy poverty from the SSA perspective remains an under-explored terrain in the research landscape. In this context, to address the pressing challenges of energy poverty and environmental sustainability, this study aims to explore the threat energy poverty poses on the ecological footprints, focusing on “land-use, carbon footprint, forestry resources, and fishing ground” across 35 SSA countries using disaggregated data covering the period 2000 and 2021. This study employs the novel Method of the Moments Quantile Regression following the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model as the reference theoretical and analytical framework. The findings disclose heterogeneous effects of rural and urban energy poverty on ecological footprint items. When comparing the magnitudes, we found that rural energy poverty has a more detrimental impact on land-use than urban energy poverty. Energy poverty is found to have no reliable power to explain the variation in carbon footprint and fishing ground. In the meantime, urban energy poverty exerts a positive effect on forestry resource sustainability. Surprisingly, population density is found to have a significant and desirable impact on land-use. Based on the obtained results, numerous policy suggestions have been discussed along with some prospects for future research.</p>","author":"Mohammed Alnour, \nFaik Bilgili, \nKamran Khan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"e924d4fc6d6089e9eebcaef393726a2addedc0e8a956c03e0cb4888b562ba04c","category":"Environment"}
