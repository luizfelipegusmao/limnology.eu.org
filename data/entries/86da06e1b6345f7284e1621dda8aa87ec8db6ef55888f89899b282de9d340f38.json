{"title":"489 Antibiotic Resistance of cecal Escherichia coli isolates from Lohmann LSL lite pullets and laying hens fed omega-3 fatty acids or yeast bioactives, reared at different spacing allowance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/156/7757357?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Poultry diets provide components that alter gut microbiota composition. We investigated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes of <span>E. coli</span> isolates from ceca digesta of pullets and hens reared at different spacing allowance (SA) and dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids (N-3 FA) and yeast bioactives (YB) from placement to 17 wk of age (woa). A total of 2,632-day old chicks were placed in cages at two SA (24 cages each): High SA (HSA, 348 cm<sup>2</sup>/bird; ~50 birds/cage) and Low SA (LSA, 284 cm<sup>2</sup>/bird; ~68 birds/cage). Birds were fed corn and soybean-based diets (C), C + 3% co-extruded full fat flaxseed and pulse mixture (N-3 FA) and C + 0.05% YB processed with β-1,3-glucan hydrolase. At 4, 16 and 35 woa, ceca samples were collected to isolate <span>E. coli</span> using Chromocult agar. Their susceptibility to 14 antibiotics were determined by automated Sensititre system according to CLSI and CIPARS guidelines to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Number of antibiotics resistant <span>E. coli</span> isolates were analyzed using general linear mixed model procedure of SAS with diets, SA, sampling age and associated interactions as fixed factors. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to determine the relationship between these treatments, and differences between treatments were considered significant at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Out of 428 presumptive <span>E. coli</span> isolated, 153 of 428 isolates (35.7%) were resistant to one antimicrobial class but no resistance against ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and nalidixic acid were detected. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant <span>E. coli</span> decreased as the birds aged from wk 4–35 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). At wk 4 (<span>P</span> = 0.002) and 16 (<span>P</span> = 0.011), the least prevalence of ampicillin (AMP) resistance was in ceca digesta from N-3 FA-fed birds. At 35 woa, no AMP and cefoxitin (FOX) resistance were detected in birds fed YB (Table 2). At 16 woa, the prevalence of streptomycin resistance was greater in N-3 FA-fed than in YB-fed birds (<span>P</span> = 0.02), which was less than control-fed birds. Of the 428 isolates, 59 (13.8%) were resistant to more than two antimicrobial classes, with most from TIO-FOX-AMP-TET and STR-SULF-TET. At wk-4, SA had a significant effect on multiple resistance spectrum with LSA having the lowest MDR <span>E. coli</span> (<span>P</span> = 0.02) mainly from N-3 FA-fed pullets. This study showed an overall low AMR prevalence which decreases with age of the bird. This study is the first to report that feed additives (N-3 FA or YB) influence the AMR profile of cecal <span>E. coli</span> in pullets and layers. Prevalence of AMP resistance was least in N-3 FA-fed birds, whereas least STEP- and SULF resistance was observed in YB-fed birds. Our next study would help understand the molecular and evolutionary aspect of this resistant <span>E. coli</span> and their potential to cause colibacillosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"86da06e1b6345f7284e1621dda8aa87ec8db6ef55888f89899b282de9d340f38","category":"Environment"}
