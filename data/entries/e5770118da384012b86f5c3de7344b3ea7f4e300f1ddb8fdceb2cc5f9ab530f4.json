Plants growing in full sunlight are exposed to roughly equal ratios of red and far-red light. However, those in another plant's shadow receive a higher proportion of far-red light, as the shorter wavelengths are absorbed by the other plant's leaves, which hinders photosynthesis. Plants therefore need to be able to perceive the quantity and quality of light they receive so they can adjust their growth and development accordingly, such as by flowering at the correct time of year or by avoiding the shade of another plant by elongating and growing towards the light. One way they do this is through the phytochrome (phy) family of photoreceptors (comprising phyA–E), which perceive red and far-red (∼650–730 nm) light.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"e5770118da384012b86f5c3de7344b3ea7f4e300f1ddb8fdceb2cc5f9ab530f4","category":"Environment"}
