{"title":"Comparative study on nutraceutical and sensorial characteristics of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) cultivated in Iran, Spain, and Türkiye","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13594?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Quality properties of 14 saffron samples from Iran, Spain, and Türkiye were compared.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Significant differences were observed between anthocyanins, volatile compounds, fatty acids, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of saffron samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Besides, significant differences in color parameters were observed. Moreover, a total of 13 volatile compounds were identified in the saffron samples using. headspace–solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, safranal and α-isophorone being the two predominant aroma compounds. Regarding fatty acids, significant differences were seen in the fatty acid profiles of saffron samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while linoleic acid was the most concentrated fatty acid. In terms of sensory properties, different concentrations of safranal, α-isophorone and 4-ketoisophorone may lead to significant differences in the odor and taste attributes of saffron samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Changes in corm origin along with climate and agricultural conditions may affect the quality characteristics of saffron cultivated in different geographical areas to a significant degree. © 2024 The Authors.
