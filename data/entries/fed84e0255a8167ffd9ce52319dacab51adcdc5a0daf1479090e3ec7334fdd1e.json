{"title":"On Thin Ice: Solar Geoengineering to Manage Tipping Element Risks in the Cryosphere by 2040","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004797?af=R","date":1723554166000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Tipping elements are features of the climate system that can display self-reinforcing and non-linear responses if pushed beyond a certain threshold (the “tipping point”). Models suggest that we may surpass several of these tipping points in the next few decades, irrespective of which emissions pathway humanity follows. Some tipping elements reside in the Arctic and Antarctic and could potentially be avoided or arrested via a stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) program applied only at the poles. This paper considers the utility of proactively developing the capacity to respond to emergent tipping element threats at the poles as a matter of risk management. It then examines both the air and ground infrastructure that would be required to operationalize such capability by 2040 and finds that this would require a funded launch decision by a financially credible actor by roughly 2030.</p>","author":"Wake Smith, \nMadeline F.
