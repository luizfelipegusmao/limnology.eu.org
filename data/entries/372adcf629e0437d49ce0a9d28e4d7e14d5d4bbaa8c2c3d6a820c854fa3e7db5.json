{"title":"The Role of Data Networks and APIs in Enhancing Operational Efficiency in SME: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0848/v1","date":1728611856000,"content":"The adoption of Data Networks and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) has become crucial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. However, SMEs often face challenges such as resource limitations and security vulnerabilities, which hinder their ability to fully leverage these technologies. This systematic review examines the role of Data Networks and APIs in enhancing operational efficiency within SMEs, focusing on key metrics such as speed, cost reduction, scalability, and security challenges. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted a systematic search across multiple databases including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. Studies published between 2014 and 2024, focused on SMEs and addressing the role of Data Networks and APIs in operational efficiency, were included. A total of 49 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for key outcomes related to operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and security risks. The review found that Data Networks and APIs significantly improve operational efficiency by increasing process speed (12% increase), reducing operational costs (8% reduction), and enhancing overall productivity. However, security challenges, particularly related to API vulnerabilities, were a major concern, with cyberattacks on APIs increasing by 400% in Q1 2023 alone. Despite these risks, the benefits of implementing Data Networks and APIs in SMEs, particularly in terms of scalability and real-time data processing, were evident across industries. Data Networks and APIs offer substantial improvements in operational efficiency for SMEs, though security remains a significant challenge. Future efforts should focus on developing security frameworks tailored to SMEs while maintaining the operational benefits of these technologies. Further research is needed to explore scalable and secure API models for SMEs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"372adcf629e0437d49ce0a9d28e4d7e14d5d4bbaa8c2c3d6a820c854fa3e7db5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
