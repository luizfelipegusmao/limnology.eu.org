{"title":"Shark and odontocete depredation on the catch of the tuna longline fishery in New Caledonia (South Pacific Ocean)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/3/491/7610204?rss=1","date":1708300800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Large marine predators feeding on fish caught on fishing gear, referred to as ‘depredation’, occur in a wide range of fisheries worldwide. Depredation can result in negative ecological and socio-economic impacts, leading to conflict between fishers and depredating species. However, depredation remains understudied in many fisheries, and this hampers the development of effective mitigation solutions. In this study, 21 years of fishing data (2002–2022) were used to assess shark and odontocete depredation in the pelagic tuna longline fishery of New Caledonia. Using generalized linear models, the year, season, effort, soaking time, and vessel were identified as variables significantly influencing the probability of depredation to occur. Results showed that while shark depredation occurred more frequently than odontocete depredation (58.5% vs. 9.2% of the longline sets), they damaged a lower proportion of fish (3.9% vs. 12.3%) over the study period. Unlike sharks, odontocetes selectively depredate tuna, with their highest occurrence during periods of high tuna catch rates, suggesting a co-occurrence with fishing activities. Together, these results indicate that depredation in the New Caledonian fishery is high compared to other regions and provide essential information on the dynamics and impacts of the issue as a basis for considering management and mitigation options.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"5775451f5d0f6fb841c6553135fea937478010e916efbcaf420ddf57cb99fa1e","category":"Environment"}
