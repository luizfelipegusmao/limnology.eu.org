{"title":"Naringenin Against Cadmium Toxicity in Fibroblast Cells: An Integrated Network Pharmacology and In Vitro Metabolomics Approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24388?af=R","date":1729043194000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Cadmium, a heavy metal, disrupts cellular homeostasis and is highly toxic, with no effective treatments currently available against its toxicity. According to studies, phytochemicals provide a promising strategy for mitigating cadmium toxicity. Naringenin (NG), a potent antioxidant found primarily in citrus fruits, showed protective properties against cadmium toxicity in rats. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of cadmium cytotoxicity in fibroblasts remains unknown. This study evaluated NG against cadmium (CdCl<sub>2</sub>) toxicity utilizing network pharmacology and in silico molecular docking, and was further validated experimentally in rat fibroblast F111 cells. Using network pharmacology, 25 possible targets, including the top 10 targets of NG against cadmium, were identified. Molecular docking of interleukin 6 (IL6), the top potential target with NG, showed robust binding with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 58.76 μM, supporting its potential therapeutic potential. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that “response to reactive oxygen species” and “negative regulation of small molecules metabolic process” were the topmost pathways targeted by NG against cadmium. In vitro analysis showed that NG (10 μM) attenuated CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress by reducing altered intracellular ROS, mitochondrial mass, and membrane potential. Also, NG reversed CdCl<sub>2</sub>-mediated nuclear damage, G2/M phase arrest, and apoptosis. GC/MS-based metabolomics of F111 cells revealed CdCl<sub>2</sub> reduced cholesterol levels, which led to alterations in primary bile acid, steroid and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways, whereas, NG restored these alterations. In summary, combined in silico and in vitro analysis suggested that NG protected cells from CdCl<sub>2</sub> toxicity by mitigating oxidative stress and metabolic pathway alterations, providing a comprehensive understanding of its protective mechanisms against cadmium-induced toxicity.</p>","author":"Komal Priya, \nAshim Chandra Roy, \nAbhinav Prasad, \nPrabhat Kumar, \nIlora Ghosh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"a1413bbd85aa1f6a73399937e82e82fcc94a1d453e391f6a97497db72051c355","category":"Environment"}
