{"title":"Nucleolin-Targeting AS1411 Aptamer-Conjugated Nanospheres for Targeted Treatment of Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0167/v1","date":1712040772000,"content":"Post-operative chemotherapy is still required for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), and nanocarrier-based drug delivery has been identified as one of the most effective methods. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and non-specific delivery to non-tumor tissues can significantly limit drug accumulation in tumor tissues and cause damage to nearby normal tissues. This study describes a targeted cancer therapy approach that uses AS1411 aptamer-conjugated nanospheres, 100-300 nm in size, loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) to selectively identify tumor cells overexpressing nucleolin (NCL) proteins. The study demonstrates that the active target model, which employs aptamer-mediated drug delivery, is more effective than nonspecific enhanced permeability and maintenance (EPR)-mediated delivery and passive drug delivery in improving drug penetration and maintenance in tumor cells. Additionally, the study shows the potential for anticancer effects through 3D spheroidal and in vivo GBM xenograft models. The DNA-protein hybrid nanospheres utilized in this study offer numerous benefits, such as efficient synthesis, structural stability, high drug loading, dye labelling, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. When combined with nanospheres, the 1411 aptamer has been shown to be an effective drug delivery carrier for precisely targeting tumors. This combination has the potential to produce anti-tumor effects in active targeted therapy of GBM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac96e686ae968abc78d7d0b24d67c648260cf9a69ea8341085308c608217bcce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
