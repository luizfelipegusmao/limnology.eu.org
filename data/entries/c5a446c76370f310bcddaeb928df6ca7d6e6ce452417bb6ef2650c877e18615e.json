{"title":"A Multivariate Phenotypical Approach of Sepsis and Septic Shock &ndash; a Comprehensive Narrative Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2197/v1","date":1727422503000,"content":"Despite medical advances, sepsis and septic shock remain one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with a high inter-individual variability in prognosis, clinical manifestations and response to treatment. Given the heterogeneity of sepsis and recent technological progress amongst machine learning analysis technique, a new, personalized approach in sepsis is being intensively studied. Despite the difficulties when tailoring a targeted approach, with the use of artificial intelligence-based pattern recognition, more and more publications are becoming available, highlighting novel factors that may intervene in the high heterogenicity of sepsis. This has led to the devise of a phenotypical approach in sepsis, further dividing patients based on host and trigger-related factors, clinical manifestations and progression towards organ deficiencies, dynamic prognosis algorithms and patient trajectory in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Host and trigger-related factors refer to patients’ comorbidities, body-mass index, age, temperature, immune response, type of bacteria and infection site. The progression to organ deficiencies refers to individual particularities of sepsis-related multiorgan failure. Finally, the patient’s trajectory in the ICU points out the need of a better understanding of interindividual response to various supportive therapies. This review aims to identify the main sources of variability in clustering septic patients in various clinical phenotypes, as a useful clinical tool for precision-based approach in sepsis and septic shock.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5a446c76370f310bcddaeb928df6ca7d6e6ce452417bb6ef2650c877e18615e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
