{"title":"A Pandemic Risk Index to Monitor the Risk of Par&aacute;&rsquo;s Coastal Municipalities during COVID-19: Addressing Vulnerabilities and Open Space Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1011/v1","date":1726280726000,"content":"Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, open spaces provided solace for people during social\nisolation but also heighten risks, particularly in areas lacking proper management. This\nwas especially critical in regions already facing challenges like low human\ndevelopment, extreme poverty, limited healthcare access, as seen in Pará Coastal\nZone (NE Brazil). To address this, this study introduced the Pandemic Risk Index\n(PRI), evaluating Covid-19 risk using demographic, social, economic, and\nepidemiological indicators. Applied to municipalities in the area, PRI highlighted preexisting vulnerabilities shaping the region’s pandemic response and overall risk. PRI\nanalysis revealed temporal and spatial variations in risk levels, identifying areas where\nthe use of open spaces like beaches, presented a higher transmission risk. The results\nemphasized the significance of effective governance, improved healthcare, and\ncontainment measures, lowers risk levels. affect risk levels, and becomes one of the\nmost important challenges, especially in remote areas with limited services and\naccess.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a11546019e393dca5bf3b4f01a8effaf414f35c25511684ea7417fc842bd2e8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
