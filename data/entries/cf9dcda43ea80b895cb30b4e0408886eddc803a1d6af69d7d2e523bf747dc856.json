{"title":"3D Organoid Models in Cancer Immunotherapy: Bioengineering Approach for Personalized Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0822/v1","date":1723459740000,"content":"Recent advances in organoid technology have revolutionized cancer biology and thera-peutic interventions, offering personalized immunotherapy treatment. Organoids, three-dimensional cell cultures derived from patient tumors, accurately replicate the tumor microenvi-ronment, providing unprecedented insights into tumor-immune interactions and therapeutic re-sponses. In this literature-based study, we discuss various culture methods for the diverse appli-cations of organoids in cancer immunotherapy, including drug screening, personalized treatment strategies, and mechanistic studies. Additionally, we address the technological challenges asso-ciated with these methods and propose potential future solutions to accelerate the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. This review highlights the transformative potential of or-ganoid models in advancing preclinical cancer immunotherapy modeling, screening, and evalua-tion, paving the way for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf9dcda43ea80b895cb30b4e0408886eddc803a1d6af69d7d2e523bf747dc856","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
