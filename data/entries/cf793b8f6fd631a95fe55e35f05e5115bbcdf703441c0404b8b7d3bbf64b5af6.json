{"title":"The Impact of a Congested Competition Schedule on Load, Recovery, and Well-Being in U16 Female Football Players: A Comparison between Starters and Non-Starters during a Development Tournament","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0538/v1","date":1723112644000,"content":"Monitoring training load, recovery, and wellness in maturation ages is even more relevant than in adulthood, especially during congested schedules. The objective of this study was to quantify and describe the differences in external and internal load, recovery, and perceived wellness in elite under-16 female players during a period of three competitions in seven days, based on their participation during matches. An observational design was used to quantify external load (total distance, high-speed distance, and PlayerLoad), internal load (differential sRPE), as well as recovery and wellness of 18 international under-16 players during a development tournament. The external load pattern of the starting players was undulating, with matches showing the highest internal load values compared to training sessions and non-starters. Non-starters players (whether training or matches) showed similar external load and differential sRPE values throughout the tournament (p&amp;gt;0.05). Starting players experienced higher internal load than non-starters during matches (p&amp;lt;0.037), without differences between training sessions (p&amp;gt;0.05). No changes were seen in wellness or recovery (all p-values &amp;gt;0.05), except for non-starters in session 3 compared to session 7 (p=0.024). Starting players had more weekly total minutes (p=0.018), differential sRPE (breath: p=0.002; leg: p=0.002; cognitive: p=0.003), total distance (p=0.003), and PlayerLoad (p=0.008) than non-starters. Our results indicate differing load patterns between starters and non-starters, which do not affect wellness and recovery differently. Starters accumulate more weekly total load. Coaches can use these findings to guide decisions and load compensations in high competition contexts for young female soccer players.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf793b8f6fd631a95fe55e35f05e5115bbcdf703441c0404b8b7d3bbf64b5af6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
