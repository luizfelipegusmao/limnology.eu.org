{"title":"High freezing sensitivity of legumes relative to other herbaceous species in northern temperate plant communities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/2/283/7671352?rss=1","date":1715644800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Reduced snow cover and increased air temperature variability are predicted to expose overwintering herbaceous plants to more severe freezing in some northern temperate regions. Legumes are a key functional group that may exhibit lower freezing tolerance than other species in these regions, but this trend has been observed only for non-native legumes. Our aim was to confirm if this trend is restricted to non-native legumes or whether native legumes in these regions also exhibit low freezing tolerance.<div>Methods</div>First, we transplanted legumes (five non-native species and four native species) into either an old field (non-native) or a prairie (native) and used snow removal to expose the plots to increased soil freezing. Second, we grew plants in mesocosms (old field) and pots (prairie species) and exposed them in controlled environment chambers to a range of freezing treatments (control, 0, −5 or −10 °C) in winter or spring. We assessed freezing responses by comparing differences in biomass, cover and nodulation between freezing (or snow removal) treatments and controls.<div>Key Results</div>Among legume species, lower freezing tolerance was positively correlated with a lower proportion of nodulated plants and active nodules, and under controlled conditions, freezing-induced reductions in above-ground biomass were lower on average in native legumes than in non-native legumes. Nevertheless, both non-native and native legumes (except <span>Desmodium canadense</span>) exhibited greater reductions in biomass in response to increased freezing than their non-leguminous neighbours, both in controlled environments and in the field.<div>Conclusions</div>These results demonstrate that both native and non-native legumes exhibit low freezing tolerance relative to other herbaceous species in northern temperate plant communities. By reducing legume biomass and nodulation, increased soil freezing could reduce nitrogen inputs into these systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"2eeef20abb0e273863a939ac6689710eebea7a40f6fb1bc0e727212fbf492e46","category":"Environment"}
