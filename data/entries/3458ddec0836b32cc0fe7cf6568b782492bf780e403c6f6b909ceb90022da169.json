{"title":"P=NP in the Three Dimensions of Time","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1961/v1","date":1724796649000,"content":"In this paper, the P versus NP problem is studied based on a six-dimensional space-time perspective. The gap between the P-class and NP-class arises from the relationship between time and the solution, as well as the answer that is independent of time. The complexity of solving a problem depends on the time dependence of the answer. Solving problems whose answers do not depend on the passage of time is very difficult and impossible. Like the description of the gravitational factor in Newtonian physics, NP class problems require different mathematical tools. Based on the generalization of physical facts in mathematics, based on six-dimensional space-time, a method to solve problem P versus NP problem has been stated. The results of this study offer a fresh insight into information processing that occurs independent of the passage of time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3458ddec0836b32cc0fe7cf6568b782492bf780e403c6f6b909ceb90022da169","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
