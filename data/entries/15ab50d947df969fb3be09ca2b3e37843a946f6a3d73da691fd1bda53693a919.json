{"title":"&ldquo;I Have Never Visited a Health Center:&rdquo; Ethiopian Centenarians&rsquo; Perceptions of Their Health Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0206/v1","date":1717504939000,"content":"The global centenarian population is expected to reach 3 million by 2050, yet little is known about the health status of centenarians in Sub-Saharan Africa. A case study examined the health conditions and functionality of nine Ethiopian centenarians. In-depth interviews revealed that all nine were Orthodox-Christians and lived with extended family; eight were male.  Aside from minor health complaints, centenarians in rural Ethiopia perceived that their sensory/cognitive functionality was normal until their late 90s. Despite a lack of medical care, the centenarians included 2 survivors, 4 delayers, and 3 escapers.  Centenarians in rural Ethiopia were embedded in closely-knit, religious, multigenerational households and communities and aspired to live resiliently. Findings call for consideration of the unique health status of centenarians in Global South nations in their own cultural context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15ab50d947df969fb3be09ca2b3e37843a946f6a3d73da691fd1bda53693a919","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
