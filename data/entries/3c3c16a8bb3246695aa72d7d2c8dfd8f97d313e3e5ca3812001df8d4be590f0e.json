{"title":"Phenolic Profile Dynamics during Grain Development in Hull-Less Food Barley Genotypes with Varying Grain Colors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1487/v1","date":1716442293000,"content":"Barley is rich in phenolic compounds, providing health benefits and making it a valuable addition to a balanced diet. However, most studies focus on these compounds at barley's final maturity, neglecting their synthesis during grain development and its impact on barley quality for food applications. This study investigates phenolic profiles during grain development in four hull-less barley genotypes with different grain colors, specifically bred for food applications. The objectives were to determine the phenolic profile and identify the optimal maturity stage for maximum phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Using UPLC-MS/MS and in-vitro antioxidant capacity assays, results show that total phenolic compounds decrease as grain matures due to increased synthesis of reserve components. Flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, and flavone glycosides peaked at immature stages, while anthocyanins peaked at physiological maturity. The harvest stage had the lowest phenolic content, with a gradient from black to yellow, purple, and blue genotypes. Antioxidant capacity fluctuated during maturation, correlating positively with phenolic compounds, especially bound phenolic acids and anthocyanins. These findings suggest that early harvesting of immature grain can help retain bioactive compounds, promoting the use of immature barley grains in foods. To support this market, incentives should offset costs associated with decreased grain weight.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c3c16a8bb3246695aa72d7d2c8dfd8f97d313e3e5ca3812001df8d4be590f0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
