{"title":"Effect of portulaca (Portulaca oleracea L.) extract on the quality and physicochemical attributes of vacuum‐packed seasoned steaks during chilled storage","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13420?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Vacuum packaging has the ability to reduce oxidative deterioration and microbial-induced spoilage of meat. However, in an oxygen-free environment, it can lead to the development of an unappealing purplish-red color and a decrease in the water-holding capacity of meat, thereby impacting the overall meat quality. <i>Portulaca oleracea</i> L. (POL) is a homology of medicine and food known for its exceptional antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The aim of our present study was to investigate the antioxidant and antimicrobial ability of <i>n</i>-butanol phase extract of POL and the effect of POL extract incorporation on the quality (water-holding capacity, shear force, color, and texture) and physicochemical (pH, total volatile base nitrogen, and total viable counts) attributes of vacuum-packed seasoned steaks at 4 °C over a 15-day period. Results showed that the POL extract had excellent antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity. Furthermore, the addition of POL extract significantly inhibited protein oxidation and microbial growth of steaks (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and improved the water-holding capacity, color properties, and tenderness (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) in the color, water-holding capacity, or tenderness between the 0.5 and 1 g kg<sup>−1</sup> POL extract treatment groups compared to the sodium nitrite control group.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results indicate that POL extract had the potential to replace sodium nitrite due to its ability to hinder protein oxidation and microbial growth of vacuum-packed seasoned steaks, while enhancing the color, water-holding capacity, and tenderness of seasoned steaks. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zhengshan Zhao, \nQiuhao Deng, \nXin Wang, \nHuijie Xiao, \nXiaojing Fan, \nLin Chen, \nXianchao Feng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e2578a1440545a769b32e3120f3b253128d460d3996018373ed398ea026870f8","category":"Environment"}
