{"title":"Preparation and hydration properties of sodium silicate-activated municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash composite slag cementitious materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1085/v1","date":1713333961000,"content":"The production of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWIBA) is very massive and has the potential to replace cement despite the problems of complex composition, uneven particle size distribution, and low reactivity. This paper adopts sodium silicate activation of MSWIBA-slag to improve the reactivity to prepare composite cementitious materials. It explores the hydration performance study of the composite cementitious materials by isothermal calorimetric analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, XRD physical diffraction analysis, and SEM/EDS tests. SEM/EDS tests will be used to explore the hydration properties of the composite gelling. The results showed that with the increase of MSWIBA doping, the porosity between the materials increased, the degree of Hydration decreased, and the compressive strength decreased with the rise of MSWIBA. When sodium silicate increased from 25% to 35%, too much alkaline material occurred over the alkaline effect, which inhibited the Hydration of the particles, and the degree of hydration reaction decreased, and the compressive strength decreased accordingly; the exothermic process of Hydration can be mainly divided into five stages, quartz and calcite did not participate in the hydration reaction completely, and sexual aluminum participated in the hydration reaction. The vibrational peaks of Si-O-Ti (T = Si and Al) were present in the material. The vibrational peaks of XRD, FTIR, and SEM-EDS all indicate the presence of silica-aluminate network structures in the hydration products, mainly N-A-S-H and C-A-S-H gels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff6c76279c7a0818f8b0d5d69cacfb4d72581bb36f643191f75466afac4f2b46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
