Beta gallium oxide (<span>β</span>-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) shows unique advantages, such as the large bandgap (∼ 4.8 eV), high breakdown voltage, and availability as inexpensive bulk substrates, that attracted significant attention for its potential applications in high power devices essential for efficient usage and transfer of energies, for example, for electrical grids for the wide adaptation of next-generation electric vehicles and high speed rails in the next decade.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b12a739dcd57fd51591c95a45a7681e45d031f28a4620860fad33409b2a7e507","category":"Environment"}
