{"title":"Patient-Prosthesis Mismatch and Its Influence on Immediate Postoperative Von Willebrand Factor Levels in Aortic Valve Replacement Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0109/v2","date":1723716998000,"content":"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular disorder that often requires surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to alleviate symptoms and improve survival. However, the selection of an appropriate prosthetic valve size is crucial to avoid patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM), which can lead to suboptimal hemodynamic outcomes. Von Willebrand factor (VWF), a key component of hemostasis, has been shown to be altered in AS patients and may contribute to the hemostatic imbalance observed following valve replacement. This prospective study aimed to investigate the impact of PPM on postprocedural VWF levels in patients undergoing SAVR for severe AS. The study included 31 consecutive patients diagnosed with severe AS who underwent SAVR. By focusing on the relationship between PPM and VWF dynamics, this study sought to provide valuable insights into the potential role of VWF as a marker for hemostatic changes associated with PPM, ultimately informing strategies for optimal valve selection and perioperative management to minimize complications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e487204c6efd0473ab517967d7267ff5bd91c279e19176c6b99812dbeb7454d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
