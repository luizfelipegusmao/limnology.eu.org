{"title":"Toxicological effects of microplastics in renal ischemia–reperfusion injury","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24115?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The widespread presence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment poses a significant threat to biological survival and human health. However, our understanding of the toxic effects of MPs on the kidneys remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of the toxic effects of MPs on the kidneys using an ischemia–reperfusion (IR) mouse model. Four-week-old ICR mice were exposed to 0.5 μm MPs for 12 weeks prior to IR injury. The results showed that MPs exposure could aggravate the IR-induced damage to renal tubules and glomeruli. Although there were no significant changes in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels 7 days after IR, MPs treatment resulted in a slight increase in both parameters. In addition, the expression levels of inflammatory factors (MCP-1 and IL-6) at the mRNA level, as well as macrophage markers (CD68 and F4/80), were significantly higher in the MPs + IR group than in the Sham group after IR. Furthermore, MPs exposure exacerbated IR-induced renal fibrosis. Importantly, the expression of pyroptosis-related genes, including NLRP3, ASC, GSDMD, cleaved caspase-1, and IL-18, was significantly upregulated by MPs, indicating that MPs exacerbate pyroptosis in the context of renal IR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that MPs exposure can aggravate renal IR-induced pyroptosis by activating NLRP3-GSDMD signaling.</p>","author":"Qihui Kuang, \nLikun Gao, \nLixiang Feng, \nXi Xiong, \nJun Yang, \nWei Zhang, \nLizhi Huang, \nLili Li, \nPengcheng Luo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"f87f6043c360e4b644364178273e78c82226da39bc70d9f37f0fa79d6b9e0703","category":"Environment"}
