{"title":"Korean Triage and Acuity Scale education using role-playing and its effects on triage competency: A quasi-experimental design","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311892","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by Yon Hee Seo, Sun-Og Lim</p>\r\n\r\nTriage is the process of prioritizing patients in the emergency department (ED). This has a pivotal role in ensuring patient safety and that the ED operates smoothly; therefore, triage training education is an important aspect of triage nurses’ preparedness in different emergency situations. This study employed a quasi-experimental research design using a non-equivalent control group pre–post-test design to verify the effect of the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) education using role-playing on the knowledge of triage, triage performance ability, and triage competency in nursing students. Participants were 78 fourth-year nursing students from Shinseong University in South Korea; 39 were assigned to the experimental group, and 39 to the control group. The intervention was conducted for three weeks, from January 31 to February 16, 2024. The experimental group received KTAS education through role-playing, whereas the control group received triage education through lectures. Triage knowledge (t = 2.94, <i>p</i> = .004) and triage performance ability (t = 3.11, <i>p</i> = .003) were significantly improved in the experimental group. However, there was no significant difference in triage competency between groups (t = 1.32, <i>p</i> = .192). The post-test score of triage record in the experimental group showed a significant improvement over time (t = 0.56, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). This study demonstrated that KTAS education using role-playing was more effective in improving triage knowledge and performance ability than traditional lecture methods for nursing students. Triage education programs should be developed considering the effectiveness of various teaching methods.","author":"Yon Hee Seo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e5bfae8f820c974e452e60a1709b60f57bc04fe36c6fd40b7a79a00dde3f1f87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
