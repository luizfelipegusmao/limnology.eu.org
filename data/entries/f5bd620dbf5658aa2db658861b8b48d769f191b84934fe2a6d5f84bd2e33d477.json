{"title":"Dietary administration effects of Microbial Exopolysaccharide from Bacillus subtilis P1 on Biological activities, Growth Performance and Immunity in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1554/v1","date":1724257062000,"content":"Exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria were isolated from the intestines of freshwater fish as prebiotics. Among the isolates, Bacillus sp. P1 was the potent EPS producer with a high EPS production and was then identified as Bacillus subtilis P1 based on 16S rRNA and biochemical characteristics. The produced microbial EPS was characterized its functional groups by FTIR, showing a 90.20% correlation to inulin while the EPS molecular weight was approximately 105 Da with a high PDI (&amp;gt;1.5). Moreover, the EPS from B. subtilis P1 was assessed for prebiotic properties by growing probiotic bacteria and the significant cell growth occurred in sugar-free TSB with 0.5% EPS (p&amp;lt;0.05). EPS exhibited approximately 55.37% DPPH radical scavenging at 20 mg/mL and inhibited certain fish pathogens at 400 Î¼g/mL (10-13 mm inhibition zone). EPS cytotoxicity was confirmed (&amp;lt;1% hemolysis) prior to use as immunobiotics in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) diet supplementation. Nile tilapia growth and immune response were monitored after feeding with control (C): Basal Diet (BD) and treatment (T): BD + EPS 5 g/kg. In the T-group, WG, %SGR, and ADG significantly increased compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) by week 4th, with no negative effects on blood chemistry parameters. Lysozyme activity and respiratory burst activity in T-groups were significantly higher than control (p&amp;lt;0.05), with a 50% RLP survival rate of Nile Tilapia challenged with Aeromonas veronii in the T-group within two weeks. On the other hand, for the proximate analysis revealed higher protein content in the T-group. These findings suggest that EPS from B. subtilis P1 in fish diets efficiently supports fish growth and stimulates innate immune responses in Nile Tilapia, thus showing potential as the immunobiotics for aquaculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5bd620dbf5658aa2db658861b8b48d769f191b84934fe2a6d5f84bd2e33d477","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
