{"title":"Climate Change and Dew and Rain Evolution in Semi-arid South-Western Madagascar between 1991 and 2033 (Extrapolated)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.0198/v2","date":1719211426000,"content":"In the context of global warming and increasing scarcity of fresh water resources, it becomes significant to evaluate the contribution and evolution of non-rainfall waters such as dew. This study therefore aims to evaluate the relative dew and rain contributions in three sites of south-western of Madagascar (Ifaty, Toliara and Andremba), a semi-arid region which suffers from a strong water deficit. The studied period is 1/1991 â€“ 7/2023, with extrapolation to 8/2033. Dew is calculated from meteo data by using a well-established energy model. The extrapolation of dew and rain follows an artificial neural network approach. It is found that dew forms regularly (2-3 days in average between events), in contrast to rain (10-15 days). The evolutions of dew and rain are similar, with an increase from 1991 to 2000, a decrease up to 2020 and a further increase until 2033. These oscillations follow the Indian Ocean dipole variations and should be influenced by the climate change. Dew contribution to the water balance remains modest on a yearly basis (3-4%) but is important during the dry season (Apr.-Oct.), up to 30%. Dew therefore appears to be a reliable and sustainable resource for plants, small animals and population, especially during droughts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b99f28baecf94836c62374b2f74b6ac7a6eba1932133535560e0a20cf9e770c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
