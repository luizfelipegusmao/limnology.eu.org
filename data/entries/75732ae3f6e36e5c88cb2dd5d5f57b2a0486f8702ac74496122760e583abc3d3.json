We conducted a systematic review of scientific articles published up to the year 2021, which included <i>in vivo</i> pre-clinical tests and clinical trials involving patients with acute infectious diarrhea to verify the antidiarrheal, antibacterial and antispasmodic effects of galenic preparations or phytopharmaceuticals from <i>P. guajava</i>. PRISMA and Rayyan were used as tools for the selection of studies collected in four databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct). The keywords used to carry out the search were: ‘<i>Psidium guajava</i>’, ‘guava’, ‘antidiarrhe*’ and ‘diarrhe*’, joined by Boolean operators ‘OR’ or ‘AND’. The characteristics of studies in animal models of acute diarrhea induction, as well as <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> motility and microbiological tests linked with its main pathophysiological mechanisms, were collected. Twenty-three articles were included. Twenty (87%) of these reported heterogenic preclinical studies, predominating pharmacological studies of efficacy against conventional antidiarrheal agents, which utilized relevant outcomes and models of infectious diarrhea from the top pathogens in the clinic along with classical castor oil-induced diarrhea associated with motility tests. Only three articles (13%) corresponded to clinical trials investigating the efficacy, dose and safety of these preparations. Most studies reported positive results and significant mechanistic evidence from antibacterial, anti-motility, anti-secretory and protective/anti-inflammatory perspectives. However, further studies are needed to define the clinical significance and safety treatment with <i>P. guajava</i> extracts. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Gabino Garrido, \nBárbara B.
