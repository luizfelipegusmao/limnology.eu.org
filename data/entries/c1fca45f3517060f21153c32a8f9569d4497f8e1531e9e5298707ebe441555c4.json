{"title":"Growth response of the picoplanktic Picocystis salinarum and the microplanktic Limnospira (Arthrospira) fusiformis strains from Lake Nakuru (Kenya) to rapidly changing environmental conditions","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05397-y","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The East African soda lakes are known worldwide for their huge populations of lesser flamingos. Their phytoplankton community is often dominated by the cyanobacterium <em>Limnospira fusiformis</em>, the main food of lesser flamingos. In the early 2010s, the population of the cyanobacterium collapsed and the picoplanktic green alga <em>Picocystis salinarum</em> became dominant in Lake Nakuru. Consequently, lesser flamingos had to migrate to other lakes in search of food. To establish the reasons for the success of <em>P. salinarum</em>, photosynthesis measurements have been performed on monoalgal cultures of both species. The examined environmental variables (temperature, light intensity) were not responsible for the dominance of <em>P. salinarum</em> either alone or in their any combination. Moreover, photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacterium was higher by an order of magnitude during all light and temperature treatments. Co-cultivation of <em>L. fusiformis</em> and <em>P. salinarum</em> in a chemostat revealed that a possible reason for the <em>Limnospira</em> replacement can be a rapid and remarkable increase of conductivity, as <em>P. salinarum</em> showed higher level of tolerance to this rapid change. Shortly after returning to the initial conductivity levels, the population of <em>L. fusiformis</em> recovered quickly.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"c1fca45f3517060f21153c32a8f9569d4497f8e1531e9e5298707ebe441555c4","category":"Environment"}
