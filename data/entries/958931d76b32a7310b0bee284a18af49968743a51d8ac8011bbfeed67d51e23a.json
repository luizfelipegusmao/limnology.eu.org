{"title":"Decomposing decision-making in preschoolers: Making decisions under ambiguity versus risk","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311295","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Nancy Garon, Ellen Doucet, Bronwyn Inness</p>\r\n\r\nDecision-making in the real world involves multiple abilities. The main goal of the current study was to examine the abilities underlying the Preschool Gambling task (PGT), a preschool variant of the Iowa Gambling task (IGT), in the context of an integrative decision-making framework. Preschoolers (<i>n</i> = 144) were given the PGT along with four novel decision-making tasks assessing either decision-making under ambiguity or decision-making under risk. Results indicated that the ability to learn from feedback, to maintain a stable preference, and to integrate losses and gains contributed to the variance in decision-making on the PGT. Furthermore, childrenâ€™s awareness level on the PGT contributed additional variance, suggesting both implicit and explicit processes are involved. The results partially support the integrative decision-making framework and suggest that multiple abilities contribute to individual differences in decision-making on the PGT.","author":"Nancy Garon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"958931d76b32a7310b0bee284a18af49968743a51d8ac8011bbfeed67d51e23a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
