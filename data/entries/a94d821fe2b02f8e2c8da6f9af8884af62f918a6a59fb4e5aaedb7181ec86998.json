{"title":"Reconfiguring Identity Politics and Social Exclusion: The Case of Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0493/v1","date":1728364017000,"content":"This paper examines the role of identity politics in the exclusion and statelessness of the Rohingya in Myanmar. Using an anthropological lens, the study explores how the Rohingya resist their marginalization through cultural practices and informal leadership within refugee camps in Bangladesh. The analysis, based on ethnographic fieldwork, draws on theories of homo sacer and cultural resistance to demonstrate how Myanmarâ€™s exclusionary national identity has stripped the Rohingya of citizenship, exposing them to violence and displacement. Despite this, the Rohingya actively preserve their identity and assert political agency, offering a critical perspective on statelessness and resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a94d821fe2b02f8e2c8da6f9af8884af62f918a6a59fb4e5aaedb7181ec86998","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
