Don et al. (2023) proposed defining carbon sequestration as \"[the] Process of transferring carbon from the atmosphere into the soil through plants or other organisms, which is retained as soil organic carbon resulting in a global carbon stock increase of the soil\". In our view, this definition is incomplete because a comprehensive definition of carbon sequestration should explicitly include the time that carbon remains stored in an ecosystem, thus mitigating its contribution to the greenhouse effect.</p>\n<br />","author":"Estefanía Muñoz, \nIngrid Chanca, \nMaximiliano González‐Sosa, \nAgustín Sarquis, \nAndrés Tangarife‐Escobar, \nCarlos A.
