However, post-restoration recovery of small omnivorous fish can increase water nutrient concentrations through excretion. The impact of these recycled nutrients on submerged macrophytes is not well-studied, and it may depend on fish food of varying nutrient contents. We studied the effects of <em>Acheilognathus macropterus</em> on the growth and nutrient stoichiometry of <em>Vallisneria denseserrulata</em> and <em>Hydrilla verticillata</em>. The experiment had six treatments: two controls without recycled nutrients and two nutrient treatments for each of the plant species, respectively. We found that fish released more phosphorus after consuming low N:P food and more nitrogen after high N:P food. The recycled nutrients significantly promoted the growth of both macrophyte species. Interestingly, macrophytes showed higher growth rates in treatments with nutrients from the low N:P food source. Our study, therefore, suggests that nutrient subsidy from fish excretion can significantly stimulate the growth of submerged macrophytes, the magnitude of the effect being determined by the N:P ratio of the fish food. The realization of this growth potential, however, also depends on the phytoplankton response to these nutrients, that expectedly will be weaker at high macrophyte coverage.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"69074694fafeda2dd5e4e14e7e89042f70baa08e1810735c7e2be7dd382db6e9","category":"Environment"}
