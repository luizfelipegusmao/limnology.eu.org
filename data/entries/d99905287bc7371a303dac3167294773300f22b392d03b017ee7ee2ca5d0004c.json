{"title":"Coating of Refractory Surfaces with Fine TiO2 Particles via Gas‚ÄêDynamic Cold Spraying","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2451/v1","date":1722339866000,"content":"Refractory materials are used worldwide in process equipment. However, gaseous and liquid process products penetrate the surface layer, and deep into the volume of refractories destructing rather expensive constructions complicated to repair. To address this challenge, there is a need to develop protective coatings for refractory that can limit the penetration of working media and extend their operational lifespan. In this work, the application of gas-dynamic cold spraying (CGDS) to produce a coating on the refractory using fine titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles is explored. These particles are accelerated within a nitrogen flow, passing through a Laval nozzle, and then sprayed onto a fireclay surface. The mechanisms of particle deposition and layer formation on porous surfaces through experiments and numerical simulations were investigated. The geometry of a typical refractory pore was determined, which was then incorporated into Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to model the cold spraying process of porous substrates. As a result, the influence of the particle size on its velocity and angle of penetration into pores was established. Experimental findings demonstrate the effective closure of pores and the formation of a particle layer on the refractory surface. Furthermore, the nanoindentation tests for the refractory samples showcase capabilities for checking coating thickness for porous materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d99905287bc7371a303dac3167294773300f22b392d03b017ee7ee2ca5d0004c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
