The design and preparation of uranium adsorbents with high efficiency and affinity are still difficult. Herein, we presented a facile one-pot strategy to obtain a novel metal organic framework (denoted as Mn-NDISA) for stable and efficient trapping of low concentration uranium. Mn-NDISA with a built-in hydrophobic cavity can boost the absorption affinity to 1.99 × 10<sup>6</sup> mL g<sup>−1</sup> through the cooperative capture composed of electrostatic interaction, coordination force and hydrogen binding. Owing to the coordination-available oxygen sites in flexible framework, a rapid kinetic equilibrium was achieved in just 25 min. Moreover, these exceptional adsorption features enabled Mn-NDISA to successfully capture the naturally occurring uranium traces (~ppb) in wastewater samples, making it one of the most influential absorbents toward UO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>2+</sup> ever reported. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the electrostatic attraction came from the surface negatively charged Mn-NDISA and the positively charged UO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>2+</sup>. The coordination originated from Lewis basic hydroxyl, carbonyl groups, and Lewis acid UO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>2+</sup>, while hydrogen bonds further reinforced the as-formed uranium binding complex. This research offered a promising cooperative capture strategy to improve the uranium affinity of the pristine MOF for trace contaminants removal in environmental remediation fields.</p>","author":"Wan‐Wan Zhao, \nLi‐Hong Li, \nJian‐Zhen Liao, \nHua Ke, \nRu‐Ping Liang, \nJian‐Ding Qiu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"381247ab78c4dc404e86e69ecc18035cdb230300acc6537ff7262a4c051e7d0d","category":"Environment"}
