{"title":"Low Prognostic Nutritional Index Predicts In-hospital Complications and Mortality in Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0727/v1","date":1715584282000,"content":"Background: The study aimed to explore the association between the prognostic nutrition index (PNI) and in-hospital complication and mortality in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the Changhua Christian Hospital Clinical Research Database (CCHRD) between January 2015 and December 2022. 2402 patients were included, with the median PNI value set at 42.77. The restricted cubic spline model, Kaplan-Meier and ROC analysis for overall survival were used to evaluate the association of PNI with medical complications and mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to balance these clinical variables between groups, which could reduce potential bias to some extent. Results: PNI was significantly associated with in-hospital complications and 28-day and 90-day mortality in multivariate analysis. The main finding of our study is that a low PNI score at admission was independently associated with a poor ICH outcome. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed higher survival rates in the high PNI group. PNI demonstrated sensitivity to predict medical complications and mortality based on ROC analysis. Conclusions Our study suggests that PNI could serve as a valuable marker for predicting medical complications and mortality in patients with spontaneous ICH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e895f62a2b5474339960da367045e74b4da3967af6da032547fe7d14cbde086c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
