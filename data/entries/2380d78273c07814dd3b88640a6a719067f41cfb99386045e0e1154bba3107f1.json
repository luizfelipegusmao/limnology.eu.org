{"title":"Natural and Artificial Intelligence Interactions in Digital Networking:A Multilayer Network Model for Economic Value Creation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2132/v1","date":1724919491000,"content":"This study investigates the integration of natural intelligence (NI) and artificial intelligence (AI) within traditional firms, proposing a multilayer network framework to enhance economic value. The research explores the central question: How can the integration of NI and AI, facilitated by copula nodes, drive economic value creation in digitized firms? Through empirical testing across multiple industries—namely manufacturing, retail, and finance—the study evaluates the cost-benefit improvements associated with AI adoption. The findings reveal substantial efficiency gains, improved decision-making, and notable cost reductions, validating the proposed model's predictions. The study emphasizes the critical role of copula nodes in optimizing interactions between NI and AI, ensuring that their integration yields maximum economic benefits. By providing a novel framework for quantifying AI's economic impact within digitized firms, this research fills a significant gap in the literature on multilayer networks and intelligent systems. The practical implications are profound, offering a strategic pathway for firms to enhance profitability and competitiveness in the digital age.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2380d78273c07814dd3b88640a6a719067f41cfb99386045e0e1154bba3107f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
