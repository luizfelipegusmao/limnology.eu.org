All elements from lithium to uranium can be detected with detection limits ranging from 0.1 to 3 atomic percent (element dependent). When an X-ray of known energy (hν), for example Al(Kα) at 1486.7eV, interacts with an atom, a photoelectron can be emitted via the photoelectric effect. The emitted electron’s kinetic energy (Ek) can be measured and the atomic core level binding energy (Eb) relative to the Fermi level (EF) of the sample is determined by the following equation:</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f2cc8744b6ac08a7c95666877430e0805ddf10a454fded4cdc3becb63ae4e669","category":"Environment"}
