{"title":"Allergies to Allergens from Cats and Dogs: A Review and Update on Sources, Pathogenesis, and Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1655/v1","date":1724336916000,"content":"Inhalation allergies caused by cats and dogs can lead to a range of discomforting symptoms, such as rhinitis and asthma, in humans. Given the increasing popularity and care provided to these companion animals, the allergens they produce pose a growing threat to the health of susceptible patients. Allergens from cats and dogs have emerged as significant risk factors for triggering asthma and allergic rhinitis worldwide; however, there remains a lack of systematic measures aimed at assisting individuals in recognizing and preventing allergies caused by these animals. This review provides comprhensive insights into the classification of cat and dog allerges, alongwith their pathogenic mechanisms. The study also discusses implementation strategies for prevention and control measures, including physical methods, gene editing technology, immunological approaches, as well as potential strategies for enhancing allergen immunotherapy combined with immunoinformatics. Finally, it presents future prospects for the prevention and treatment of human allergies caused by cats and dogs. This review will improve knowledge regarding allergies to cats and dogs, while identifying potential targets for the development of next-generation treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7073f00e8fc6072c9a25bf1a68ad1c28a11985e76a88c3ef806ab52c02570235","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
