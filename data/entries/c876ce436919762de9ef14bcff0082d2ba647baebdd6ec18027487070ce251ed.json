Here we report opportunistic sightings of manta rays (<i>Mobula</i> cf. <i>birostris</i>) in the Brazilian Amazon estuaries and the Great Amazon Reef System. These sightings consist of manta ray individuals stranded in tide pools, caught in artisanal fisheries, and footage obtained with a submersible. Future investigations on the spatial, temporal, and environmental drivers of manta rays' distribution on the northern Brazilian coast and the threats posed by fishing gear are warranted.</p>","author":"Nayara Bucair, \nHéllida Negrão Dias, \nAna Rita Onodera Palmeira Nunes, \nKeyton Kylson Fonseca Coelho, \nRafaela Maria Serra de Brito, \nJoão Bráullio de Luna Sales, \nGetulio Rincon, \nRonaldo Bastos Francini‐Filho, \nJune Ferraz Dias, \nIsrael H.
