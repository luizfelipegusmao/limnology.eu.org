{"title":"Immigration, Human Capital, and Economic Growth in Brazil: From the Late 19th Century to the Present","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1439/v1","date":1729229630000,"content":"This article examines the profound impact of immigration on Brazil's human capital formation and economic growth from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. It highlights how the influx of European and Asian immigrants filled the labor void created by the abolition of slavery in 1888, fostering agricultural expansion, industrialization, and urbanization. Immigrants brought diverse skills, technologies, and cultural practices that enriched Brazil's socio-economic fabric. The article also compares these historical dynamics with contemporary demographic trends, notably the challenges posed by a declining fertility rate and an aging population. It underscores the necessity of re-evaluating inclusion policies and investing in human capital to sustain economic growth. By drawing lessons from the past, the article suggests that Brazil can navigate current demographic challenges through strategic policy interventions aimed at enhancing human capital as a tool for economic revitalization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3baa323e3721d65affcf1b5d4a09c7cdeec1ce5406c4fa20708986d83047325","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
