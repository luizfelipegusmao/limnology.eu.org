{"title":"Intraspecific Variation in the Placement of Campaniform Sensilla on the Wings of the Hawkmoth Manduca Sexta","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae007/7628299?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Flight control requires active sensory feedback, and insects have many sensors that help them estimate their current locomotor state, including campaniform sensilla (CS), which are mechanoreceptors that sense strain resulting from deformation of the cuticle. CS on the wing detect bending and torsional forces encountered during flight, providing input to the flight feedback control system. During flight, wings experience complex spatio-temporal strain patterns. Because CS detect only local strain, their placement on the wing is presumably critical for determining the overall representation of wing deformation; however, how these sensilla are distributed across wings is largely unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that CS are found in stereotyped locations across individuals of <span>Manduca sexta</span>, a hawkmoth. We found that although CS are consistently found on the same veins or in the same regions of the wings, their total number and distribution can vary extensively. This suggests that there is some robustness to variation in sensory feedback in the insect flight control system. The regions where CS are consistently found provide clues to their functional roles, although some patterns might be reflective of developmental processes. Collectively, our results on intraspecific variation in CS placement on insect wings will help reshape our thinking on the utility of mechanosensory feedback for insect flight control and guide further experimental and comparative studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"347a39dd63e5d1cc310ccc4de5f8544483c95d384a1921c0d38b4c0880adfee5","category":"Environment"}
