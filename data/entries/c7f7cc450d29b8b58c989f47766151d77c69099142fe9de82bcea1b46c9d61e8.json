This study aims to evaluate the potential of Mars photon-counting CT technology in reducing metal artefacts. It focuses on identifying and quantifying clinically significant materials in the presence of metal objects. A multi-material phantom was used, containing inserts of varying concentrations of hydroxyapatite (a mineral present in teeth, bones, and calcified plaque), iodine (used as a contrast agent), CT water (to mimic soft tissue), and adipose (as a fat substitute). Three sets of scans were acquired: with aluminium, with stainless steel, and without a metal insert as a reference dataset. Data acquisition was performed using a Mars SPCCT scanner (Microlab 5×120); operated at 118 kVp and 80 μA. The images were subsequently reconstructed into five energy bins: 7-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-79, and 79-118 keV. Evaluation metrics including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), linearity of attenuation profiles, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the curve (AUC) were employed to assess the energy and material-density images with and without metal inserts. Results show decreased metal artefacts and a better signal-to-noise ratio (up to 25%) with increased energy bins as compared to reference data. The attenuation profile also demonstrated high linearity (R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.95) and lower RMSE across all material concentrations, even in the presence of aluminium and steel. Material identification accuracy for iodine and hydroxyapatite (with and without metal inserts) remained consistent, minimally impacting AUC values. For demonstration purposes, the biological sample was also scanned with the stainless steel volar implant and cortical bone screw, and the images were objectively assessed to indicate the potential effectiveness of SPCCT in replicating real-world clinical scenarios.","author":"Briya Tariq","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c7f7cc450d29b8b58c989f47766151d77c69099142fe9de82bcea1b46c9d61e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
