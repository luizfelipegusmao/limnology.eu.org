Freshwater pearl mussels provide δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>water</sub> estimates that overcome temporal and spatial limitations of instrumental records. The reliability of shell-based δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>water</sub> reconstructions depends on understanding which shell layer biomineralizes closer to oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient water. To determine this, both the (outer) prismatic and (inner) nacreous sublayers of the outer shell layer were sampled. Over 2500 isotope values were obtained from shells collected from the Our River (Luxembourg) and from mussels cultured in tanks at constant temperature and monitored δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>water</sub>. Calculated δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>water</sub> from the prismatic portion was in excellent agreement with monitored δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>water</sub>, while δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>shell</sub> of the nacreous portion was systematically offset by +0.43‰, overestimating δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>water</sub> by +0.53‰. Although shell portions were formed simultaneously from the same extrapallial fluid, they underwent different fractionation mechanisms, presumably due to differences in carbonic anhydrase activity catalyzing mineralization processes.</p>","author":"Christoph J.
