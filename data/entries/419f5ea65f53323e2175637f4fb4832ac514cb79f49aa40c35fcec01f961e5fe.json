{"title":"Exploring Round Dataset for Domain Generalization in Autonomous Vehicle Trajectory Prediction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2107/v1","date":1727354688000,"content":"In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the RounD dataset to enhance the understanding of motion forecasting for autonomous vehicles in complex roundabout environments. We implement a trajectory prediction framework that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with graph-based modules to model vehicle interactions. Our primary objective is to assess the generalizability of a standard trajectory prediction model across diverse training and testing datasets. Through extensive experiments, we analyze how varying data distributions, including different road configurations and recording times, influence the modelâ€™s prediction accuracy and robustness. This study provides key insights into the challenges of domain generalization in autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"419f5ea65f53323e2175637f4fb4832ac514cb79f49aa40c35fcec01f961e5fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
