These models assume that adjustments to regulating valves occur, either manually or automatically, over an extended period of time, then the system inertia can be neglected. This research introduces the development of a rigid water column model for analysing water leakages in single pipelines, which can be employed to account for regulation valve adjustments in shorter time periods, thereby providing greater accuracy when assessing water losses. The application to a case study is presented to analyse pressure variations and leakage flow patterns over 30, 60, and 180 s. A comparison between the extended period simulation and rigid water column model is presented in order to note the order of magnitude on leakages when the system inertia is not considered. The results confirm that is crucial for water utilities the consideration of inertial system to simulate adequately opening and closure manoeuvres in water distribution systems, since according to the case study the extended period simulation can overestimated or underestimated the total leakage volume in percentages of 37.1 and 55.2 <span>\n                      \n                      <span>\\(\\%\\)</span>\n                      \n                    </span>, respectively.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"a2aa5ad12994ebf715580df1ef2aceaf5d03db46f1bed629194ff3c8cf89cf36","category":"Environment"}
