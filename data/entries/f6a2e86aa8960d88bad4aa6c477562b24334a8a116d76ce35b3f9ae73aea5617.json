Since its beginning, rooted in the principles of field ion microscopy, APT has witnessed an evolution in both measurement equipment and specimen preparation methodologies. Initially confined to the study of electrochemically etched metal wire specimens, the field has expanded to incorporate a diverse array of specimen holders and carriers, such as microtip coupons and half-grid type holders, with focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out methods emerging as a standard practice. These advancements resulted in a variety of approaches for achieving ready-to-run field emitter type specimens, yet the intricate and time-intensive nature of these procedures continues to pose significant challenges, representing a bottleneck in APT research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f6a2e86aa8960d88bad4aa6c477562b24334a8a116d76ce35b3f9ae73aea5617","category":"Environment"}
