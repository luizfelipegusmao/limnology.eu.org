{"title":"The new normal chemical landscape: the future of risk assessment toward optimum consumer safety","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae016/7618662?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The further optimization of consumer safety through risk assessment of chemicals present in food will require adaptability and flexibility to utilize the accelerating developments in safety science and technology. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) are gaining traction as a systematic approach to support informed decision making in chemical risk assessment. The vision is to be able to predict risk more accurately, rapidly and efficiently. The opportunity exists now to use these approaches which requires a strategy to translate the science into future regulatory implementation. Here we discuss new insights obtained from three recent workshops on how to translate the science into future regulatory implementation. To assist the UK in this endeavor, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the scientific advisory committee on chemical toxicity (COT) have been developing a roadmap. In addition, we discuss how these new insights fit into the bigger picture of the new chemical landscape for better consumer safety and the importance of international harmonization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"8bb8a3e9fa842f8f9dbd894cf6958309fe5d1f1fa8b5aac39ae1a58293f98dec","category":"Environment"}
