{"title":"CGR-CUSUM: a continuous time generalized rapid response cumulative sum chart","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/1/253/6705266?rss=1","date":1663545600000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Rapidly detecting problems in the quality of care is of utmost importance for the well-being of patients. Without proper inspection schemes, such problems can go undetected for years. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts have proven to be useful for quality control, yet available methodology for survival outcomes is limited. The few available continuous time inspection charts usually require the researcher to specify an expected increase in the failure rate in advance, thereby requiring prior knowledge about the problem at hand. Misspecifying parameters can lead to false positive alerts and large detection delays. To solve this problem, we take a more general approach to derive the new Continuous time Generalized Rapid response CUSUM (CGR-CUSUM) chart. We find an expression for the approximate average run length (average time to detection) and illustrate the possible gain in detection speed by using the CGR-CUSUM over other commonly used monitoring schemes on a real-life data set from the Dutch Arthroplasty Register as well as in simulation studies. Besides the inspection of medical procedures, the CGR-CUSUM can also be used for other real-time inspection schemes such as industrial production lines and quality control of services.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"0c41864ffc41f3d1e8cd63681b12f4643fcf52426186c2f20fed92c0655d9318","category":"Environment"}
