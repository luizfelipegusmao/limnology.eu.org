{"title":"Neoliberal Urbanism in Chile: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0563/v1","date":1728442208000,"content":"This paper examines the impact of neoliberal urbanism on socio-spatial inequalities in Chile, focusing on housing commodification and urban fragmentation. Utilizing a thematic analysis of key academic literature from the past two decades, the study explores the ethical challenges faced by urban practitioners in reconciling profit-driven urban development with the right to the city. The findings highlight how neoliberal policies have intensified segregation in cities like Santiago, where wealth and resources are concentrated in affluent areas, while peripheral, impoverished regions suffer from limited access to services. This dynamic perpetuates cycles of exclusion and marginalization, challenging efforts toward spatial justice. The paper also considers potential alternative frameworks for urban governance and policymaking that could foster more inclusive, equitable urban environments. Ultimately, the study calls for a redefinition of urban planning strategies to prioritize social equity over market imperatives, advocating for a more participatory and democratic approach to urban development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3103914c0de9adb17d41779455edc5a0d71e7a4d1341703db2904d8dbfaec464","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
