{"title":"Influence of Mepiquat Chloride on Canopy Architecture, Yield and Quality of Drought-Stressed Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) at Different Scheduling Period","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0372/v1","date":1720077624000,"content":"A field study was conducted at the Eastern Mediterranean Agricultural Research Institute, Adana, Turkey, during the 2022/23 cropping seasons to examine the impact of Mepiquat chloride dosage applied at different intervals to optimize growth, yield characteristics enhancement and improve fiber quality attributes of cotton. The study employed a split-split plot design with three replications. The results revealed that differences among treatments were not statistically significant for most parameters investigated. The observed discrepancies indicated that all treatments tested in 2012 delayed cotton development, whereas in 2023, they led to premium fibers. In 2023, the fiber percentage was highest in the control treatment, and in 2022, it was highest at 400 mL·ha-1. Across all years, the Selin variety exhibited the highest fiber percentage when Mepiquat chloride was applied at the bolling stage. The shoot-root ratio was highest at 400 mL·ha-1 during harvest in 2022 and at 0 mL·ha-1 during the reproductive stage in 2023. Overall, the results demonstrated that the application of Mepiquat chloride altered the physiological characteristics of the cotton plants, leading to bottom-up effects on cotton performance. This implies that the effectiveness of Mepiquat chloride in cotton production to alleviate drought stress is influenced by weather-related conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b2f26737284b80e4cb309cd613b4cec1d6fb8c1b05f8f7f939d2441fa0ff7e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
