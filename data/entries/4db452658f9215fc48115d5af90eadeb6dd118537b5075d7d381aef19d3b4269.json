{"title":"Person-to-Person Bacterial Transmission Can Change the Sleep Pattern in Newly Married Couples","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2354/v2","date":1728637146000,"content":"The composition of the gut microbiota varies significantly among healthy individuals and insomniacs, hypersomniacs and healthy people. On the other hand, there is a substantial bacterial strain shared across these populations with distinct intra-population, mother-to-infant and intra-household transmission patterns. Based on these premises, we propose a hypothesis stating that person-to-person bacterial transmission can change the sleep pattern in couples. In this pilot study, 157 couples who had been married and living together for an average of 5.91 months were enrolled. A wide range of questionnaires were administered to participants to measure sleep patterns. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed at two time points: baseline and 3 months. We found that sleep disturbances in couples can be partially explained by changes in gut microbiota.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4db452658f9215fc48115d5af90eadeb6dd118537b5075d7d381aef19d3b4269","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
