{"title":"Intestinal strangulation in farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua): Pathological changes and possible predisposing anatomical features","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13955?af=R","date":1712570000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>During recent years, there has been a renewed interest in establishing farming of Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) in Norway. However, a fatal abdominal disorder compromises animal welfare and causes economic losses. A similar problem was present during a previous attempt to establish Atlantic cod farming more than a decade ago. In this paper, we provide the first in-depth description of this intestinal disorder, which is correctly denoted ‘strangulating obstruction’. In affected fish, part of the intestine is permanently entrapped (incarcerated) under fibrous strands in the mesentery. The entrapment interferes with blood flow and physically blocks the intestine, causing a strangulating obstruction with severe venous congestion and ischemia of the intestinal wall. Furthermore, comparison of macroscopical and histological anatomy of farmed and wild Atlantic cod is presented and risk factors associated with the anatomical differences are discussed.</p>","author":"Fredrik Strebel Skedsmo, \nGuro Løkka, \nElvis Chikwati, \nJulianne Valla Jacobsen, \nArild Espenes, \nTrond M.
