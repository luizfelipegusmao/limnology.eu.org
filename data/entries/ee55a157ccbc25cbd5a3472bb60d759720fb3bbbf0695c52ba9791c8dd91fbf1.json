{"title":"Rugby Union Match Injury Surveillance in Portuguese Top-Tier Competition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0913/v1","date":1723540180000,"content":"Objective: To report time-loss match injuries in Portugal’s “Divisão de Honra” (Portuguese First Tier) 2022/23 season focusing on injury incidence, injury burden, anatomical region and type of injury. Methods: A cohort prospective observational study was conducted. Data was collected through an online form sent for every team medical department categorizing player position, injury type, location and severity. Injury incidence and burden were calculated per 1000-player-match-hours. Results: The overall injury incidence was 54.4 injuries per 1000 player-match-hours (CI95% 30.3-96.2). Forwards had a higher incidence comparing to backs. Lower limbs were the most affected location (52% of the injuries). Sprain/ligaments injuries were the most common type of injury followed by muscle injuries. Discussion: The injury incidence was higher than what is reported in amateur competitions and lower than professional ones. Injury severity was similar to other studies. Our study suggests a lower injury burden compared to other semi-professional and elite leagues. Further research with broader participation and training injury data is needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee55a157ccbc25cbd5a3472bb60d759720fb3bbbf0695c52ba9791c8dd91fbf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
