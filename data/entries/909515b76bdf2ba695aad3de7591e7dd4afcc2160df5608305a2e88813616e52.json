{"title":"Identifying assessment criteria for in vitro studies: a method and item bank","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/2/240/7706257?rss=1","date":1724976000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To support the development of appraisal tools for assessing the quality of <span>in vitro</span> studies, we developed a method for literature-based discovery of study assessment criteria, used the method to create an item bank of assessment criteria of potential relevance to <span>in vitro</span> studies, and analyzed the item bank to discern and critique current approaches for appraisal of <span>in vitro</span> studies. We searched four research indexes and included any document that identified itself as an appraisal tool for in vitro studies, was a systematic review that included a critical appraisal step, or was a reporting checklist for in vitro studies. We abstracted, normalized, and categorized all criteria applied by the included appraisal tools to create an “item bank” database of issues relevant to the assessment of <span>in vitro</span> studies. The resulting item bank consists of 676 unique appraisal concepts from 67 appraisal tools. We believe this item bank is the single most comprehensive resource of its type to date, should be of high utility for future tool development exercises, and provides a robust methodology for grounding tool development in the existing literature. Although we set out to develop an item bank specifically targeting <span>in vitro</span> studies, we found that many of the assessment concepts we discovered are readily applicable to other study designs. Item banks can be of significant value as a resource; however, there are important challenges in developing, maintaining, and extending them of which researchers should be aware.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"909515b76bdf2ba695aad3de7591e7dd4afcc2160df5608305a2e88813616e52","category":"Environment"}
