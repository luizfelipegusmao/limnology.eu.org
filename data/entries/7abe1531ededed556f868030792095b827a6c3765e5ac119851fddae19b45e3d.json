{"title":"Antibiofilm Activity Of Benzoic Acid Against Salmonella Typhimurium","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0482/v1","date":1713234022000,"content":"The occurrence and ability of Salmonella typhimurium to withstand the effects of various antibiotics has been extensively recorded. This highlights the necessity for alternative methods to combat Salmonella infections. The current investigation aimed to ascertain the impact of benzoic acid on the extent of surface coverage and biomass of S. typhimurium biofilm after 48 and 72 hours. The findings indicated that all the different doses of benzoic acid (ranging from 3.125% to 50%) resulted in a decrease in the extent of biofilm surface coverage. Benzoic acid exhibited a substantial inhibitory effect on the biofilm biomass at all concentrations. Higher concentrations of benzoic acid led to a decrease in biofilm biomass, suggesting a concentration-dependent response. This finding implies that benzoic acid is effective in managing Salmonella infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7abe1531ededed556f868030792095b827a6c3765e5ac119851fddae19b45e3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
