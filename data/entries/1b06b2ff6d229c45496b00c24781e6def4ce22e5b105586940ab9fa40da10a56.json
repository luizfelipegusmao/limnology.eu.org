Since salinity affects the development and distribution of hydrozoan species, it is important to get further understanding of salinity tolerance and dormancy ability of <em>Cladonema</em> species. <em>Cladonema digitatum</em> is a cryptic species and is discovered only in artificial environments. In this study, multiple experiments have been conducted to determine how salinity affects the development of <em>C. digitatum</em> polyps and medusae, to describe the dormancy and recovery of the <em>C. digitatum</em> polyps, and to find the possible prevention and disposal protocol for the occurrence of <em>Cladonema</em> in artificial environments. As results, salinity range of 35–40 ppt was optimal for <em>C. digitatum</em> polyps, while <em>C. digitatum</em> medusae lived best in 30–35 ppt; <em>C. digitatum</em> would form menonts at 15, 50–60 ppt, revive and change their survival strategies after salinity upturned to 35 ppt, which could enhance their tolerance and adaptability. <em>Cladonema digitatum</em> medusae also showed different death rates when faced with sharp hypersaline and hyposaline stress. In summary, this research provided ecological information about salinity range and dormancy ability of <em>C. digitatum</em>, which not only facilitated tracing the wild habitats of the <em>C. digitatum</em>, but also provided the theoretical basic of elimination and prevention of <em>Cladonema</em> species intrusion and breeding conservation in the laboratory.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"1b06b2ff6d229c45496b00c24781e6def4ce22e5b105586940ab9fa40da10a56","category":"Environment"}
