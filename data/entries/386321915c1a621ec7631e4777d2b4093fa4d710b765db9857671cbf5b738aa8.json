{"title":"The potential role of religiosity, psychological immunity, gender, and age group in predicting the psychological well-being of diabetic patients in Saudi Arabia within the Bayesian framework","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308454","date":1724421600000,"content":"<p>by Nawal A.

The study was conducted from May 2022 to February 2023 on a random sample of 186 Saudis diagnosed with diabetes. After obtaining participants’ consent, they completed three R, MI, and PWB scales. Bayesian Independent Samples <i>t-test</i> was performed to identify differences, and Bayesian linear regression analysis was used to reveal the best prediction model of PWB. The results of the Bayesian independent samples <i>t-test</i> indicated strong evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>, suggesting differences between male and female diabetic patients in R, MI, and PWB, with Bayesian factor values exceeding 10 (8.338×10<sup>+23</sup>, 1.762×10<sup>+25</sup>, and 1.866×10<sup>+24</sup>), and Cohen’s δ of (-1.866, -1.934, -1.884). These results indicated that females with diabetes have higher means of R, MI, and PWB compared to males. However, the results also suggested evidence for the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> of no differences in R, MI, and PWB among diabetic patients due to age group, with Bayesian factor values (0.176, 0.181, and 0.187) less than 1.00 and small Cohen’s δ of (-0.034, -0.050, -0.063). Bayesian linear regression analysis detected strong evidence that the model including MI is the best predictive model (BF<sub>10</sub> for mental immunity is 1.00 and for the other two models are 0.07 and 4.249×10<sup>−16</sup>) for the PWB of diabetic patients, however, there is no evidence that the model including R or the interaction between R and MI is the best predictor of PWB for diabetic patients. These findings highlight the need for direct psychological care services for male diabetic patients and the urgent need to enhance IM in diabetic patients to improve their PWB. Furthermore, results recommended that healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia integrate MI interventions into diabetes care programs.","author":"Nawal A.
