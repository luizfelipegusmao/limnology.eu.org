{"title":"The HSP70 and IL‐1β of Nile tilapia as molecular adjuvants can enhance the immune protection of DNA vaccine against Streptococcus agalactiae infection","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14002?af=R","date":1722318263000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Globally, streptococcal disease caused by <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> is known for its high mortality rate, which severely limits the development of the tilapia breeding industry. As a third-generation vaccine, DNA vaccines have shown great application prospects in the prevention and control of aquatic diseases, but their low immunogenicity limits their development. The combination of DNA vaccines and molecular adjuvants proved to be an effective method for inducing protective immunity. This study constructed recombinant plasmids encoding tilapia <i>HSP70</i> and <i>IL-1β</i> genes (pcHSP70 and pcIL-1β) to verify their effectiveness as molecular adjuvants for <i>S. agalactiae</i> DNA vaccine (pcSIP) in the immunized tilapia model. The results revealed that serum-specific IgM production, enzyme activities, and immune-related gene expression in tilapia immunized with pcSIP plus pcHSP70 or pcIL-1β were significantly higher than those in tilapia immunized with pcSIP alone. It is worth noting that combination with molecular adjuvants improved the immune protection of DNA vaccines, with a relative percentage survival (RPS) of 51.72% (pcSIP plus pcHSP70) and 44.83% (pcSIP plus pcIL-1β), respectively, compared with that of pcSIP alone (24.14%). Thus, our study indicated that <i>HSP70</i> and <i>IL-1β</i> in tilapia are promising molecular adjuvants of the DNA vaccine in controlling <i>S. agalactiae</i> infection.</p>","author":"Fei‐Fan Xu, \nZhu‐Yang Deng, \nJun‐Jie Sheng, \nBin Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"97bc366d09b01250649e261f85e3c20b88c504a953b8337d4fa914c8262cc1e1","category":"Environment"}
