{"title":"Divine Kenotic Creativity&mdash;the Divine Agency behind Natural Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0540/v1","date":1723100275000,"content":"Understanding creation as divine kenosis, which has become rather widespread since the last century, may emphasize the strong connection between the creation theology and the key Christian doctrine of the Incarnation while contributing to the dialogue between theology and science. At the same time, this theological project requires a thorough rethinking of divine action to avoid representing divine agency and natural causality as the competitive factors and to affirm divine kenosis as the definitive trait of God without compromising divine simplicity and freedom. To this end, the concept of “divine kenotic creativity” is suggested and discussed in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"937591126a9a82af3b023ed40cd6f37f7e08e05fc2c71796125fed2224987920","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
