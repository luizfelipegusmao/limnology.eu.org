{"title":"Effect of Pure Dephasing Quantum Noise in the Quantum Search Algorithm Using Atos Quantum Assembly","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0930/v1","date":1715671780000,"content":"Quantum computing is tipped to lead the future of global technological progress. However, the obstacles related to quantum software development are an actual challenge to overcome. In this scenario, this work presents an implementation of the quantum search algorithm in Atos Quantum Assembly Language (AQASM) using the quantum software stack my Quantum Learning Machine (myQLM). We present the creation of a virtual quantum processor whose configurable architecture allows the analysis of induced quantum noise effects on the quantum algorithms. The codes are available throughout the manuscript so that readers can replicate them and apply the methods discussed in this article to solve their own quantum computing projects. The presented results are consistent with theoretical predictions and demonstrate that AQASM and myQLM are powerful tools for building, implementing, and simulating quantum hardware.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6b9593ebd6f076678337e3c2ba9789c91ce19f284fbf223e9517ed6c16ad2d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
