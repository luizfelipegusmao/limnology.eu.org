{"title":"Candida auris Outbreak in a Multidisciplinary Hospital in Romania, during Post-pandemic Era: Potential Solutions and Challenges in Surveillance and Epidemiological Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0911/v1","date":1710497431000,"content":"C. auris is a newly emerging yeast, raising public health concerns due to its outbreak potential, lack of protocols for decontamination and isolation of patients or contacts, increased resistance to common antifungals and associated high mortality. \nThis research aimed to describe the challenges related to identifying the outbreak, limiting further contamination, and treating affected individuals.\nWe retrospectively analysed all cases of C. auris detected between October 2022 and August 2023, but our investigation focused on a three-month-long outbreak in the department of cardio-vascular surgery and the related intensive care unit. \nAlong with isolated cases in different wards, we identified 13 patients who became infected or colonized in the same area and time, even though the epidemiological link could be traced only in 10 patients, according to the epidemiological investigation. \nIn conclusion, our study emphasizes the substantial challenge encountered in clinical practice when attempting to diagnose and limit the spread of an outbreak. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly apply contact precaution measures and appropriate environmental cleaning, from the first case detected positive.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b815daff302ade6a4f75472b8c1eefaaaec3d89ea44d53375357eb3a60645ef2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
