{"title":"Combined Pretreatment with Bioequivalent Doses of Plant Growth Regulators Alleviates Dehydration Stress in Lactuca sativa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0296/v1","date":1714985936000,"content":"Plant hormones regulate the adaptive responses to various biotic and abiotic stress factors. Applied exogenously they trigger the natural plant defense mechanisms, a feature that could be implemented in strategies for supporting crop resilience. The potential of exogenous cytokinin-like acting compound (kinetin), the auxin analogue 1-naphtyl acetic acid (NAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and the ethylene-precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to mitigate dehydration was tested on Lactuca sativa (lettuce) grown on 12% polyethylene glycol (PEG). Priming with different blends containing these plant growth regulators applied in bioequivalent concentrations was evaluated through biometric measurements and biochemical analyses. The combined treatment with the four plant hormones exhibited the best dehydration protective effect. The antioxidative enzyme profiling of the PGR-primed individuals revealed increased SOD, catalase and peroxidase activity in the leaves. Immunodetection of higher levels of the rate-limiting enzyme for proline biosynthesis (delta-pyroline-5-carboxylate synthase) in the primed plants coincided with a significantly higher content of the amino acid measured in the leaves. These plants also accumulated particular dehydrin types, which may have contributed to the observed stress-relieving effect. The four-component hormonal mix applied by spraying or through the roots exerted similar stress-mitigating properties on soil-grown lettuce subjected to moderate drought.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"017a94019eeb0304ff345d3d65a54601fa0c441cc65edda913a39a8c7526ccbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
