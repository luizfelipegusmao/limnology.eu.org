{"title":"Recent Developments in the Design, Modeling, Optimization, and Control of Electro-mechanical Inlet Valves for Gas Expanders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0248/v1","date":1722848426000,"content":"The ever-growing concerns about global warming and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels have triggered a rising interest in research for cleaner, more efficient and cost-effective energy generation. Organic Rankine cycle systems have immense potential to become a strong alternative to conventional methods of energy generation. However, such systemsâ€™ efficiency is limited by the performance of the incorporated gas expanders or prime movers. Conventional gas expanders often utilize ports or cam-operated valves. Ported expanders offer limited efficiency and controllability, and produce high emissions causing a large amount of heated and compressed gas to be wasted. Cam-operated valves, in contrast, increase expansion performance compared to ported expanders, however, they have no variability and adaptability to changes in system parameters such as gas pressure, temperature, dryness fraction, and load variation to name a few. On a positive note, this issue can be addressed by adopting a variable timing and fast-operating, control valve with an accurate and adaptive control mechanism at the expander inlet. A properly designed and controlled valve can greatly improve the system performance of gas expanders and pave the way for an efficient low-cost alternative energy generation. This manuscript provides a comparative review of recent progress on the design, modeling, optimization, and control aspects of valves for gas expanders. A clear pathway on the scope of further development is also drawn based on the present state of the art.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"386bf38dfcf38526eca5eafeb0e7f0d8bf701d823d492ffacb513781252277ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
