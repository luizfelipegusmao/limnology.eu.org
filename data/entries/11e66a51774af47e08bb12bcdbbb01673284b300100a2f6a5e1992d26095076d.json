{"title":"Menin Inhibitors: New Players in KMT2A-Rearranged and NPM1-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0091/v1","date":1712019103000,"content":"Menin inhibitors are new and promising agents currently in clinical development that target the HOXA/MEIS1 transcriptional program which is critical for leukemogenesis in histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A rearranged (KMT2Ar) and in NPM1-mutated (NPM1mut) acute leukemia. The mechanism of action of this new class of agents is based on the disruption of menin-KMT2A complex (constitute of chromatin remodelling proteins), leading to the differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells expressing KMT2A or mutated NPM1. This new class of drugs has been tested alone, or in combination with synergistic drugs, in phase I and II clinical trials (AUGMENT-01 and 02, KOMET-01 and 07, SAVE, COVALENT trial and others), showing promising results in terms of response rates and safety in heavily pre-treated acute leukemia patients. In this review, we summarise the key findings on menin inhibitors, focusing on the mechanism of action and preliminary clinical data of this emerging and promising class of agents, in particular revumenib and ziftomenib.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11e66a51774af47e08bb12bcdbbb01673284b300100a2f6a5e1992d26095076d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
