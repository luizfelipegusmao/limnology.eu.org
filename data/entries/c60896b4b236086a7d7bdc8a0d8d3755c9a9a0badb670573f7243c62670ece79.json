{"title":"Child Fatalities in Tractor-Related Agricultural Incidents in Iceland 1918&ndash;2024: A Historical Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0116/v1","date":1725289099000,"content":"Children on farms face high risks of work and non-work-related fatalities, with tractors being a significant contributor. This study examines children's involvement in fatal tractor-related accidents within agriculture in Iceland in 1950-2024, explores adult reflections on childhood tractor-driving experiences, and analyses Members of ParliamentÂ´s arguments against setting a minimum age for off-road tractor driving. Data rests on fatal tractor-related accidents using newspaper archives and supplementary sources, narrative interviews with former summer children who stayed at farms in childhood, and parliamentary debates on tractor-related legislation. Over half of the 81 registered accidents involved children, primarily boys, with 75% occurring between 1958 and 1988 when no minimum age for off-road tractor driving existed. Children's fatality incidence rate was more than four times higher than adults. Arguments against minimum age requirements for off-road driving included the need for child labour, children's superior driving skills, and a denial that children were more often victims than adults. Since 1988, no child has died when driving a tractor. A human-centred approach focusing on working conditions, driver capacity, and adherence to safety procedures and legal frameworks is needed to prevent future accidents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c60896b4b236086a7d7bdc8a0d8d3755c9a9a0badb670573f7243c62670ece79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
