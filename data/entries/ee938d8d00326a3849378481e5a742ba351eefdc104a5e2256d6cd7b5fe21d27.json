{"title":"A Scoping Review on Technology-Based Approaches for Upper Limb Motor Rehabilitation after Stroke. Are We Really Targeting Severe Impairment?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1124/v1","date":1723696121000,"content":"Technology-based approaches for upper limb (UL) motor rehabilitation after stroke are designed mostly for severely affected patients to increase their recovery chances. However, the available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focused on efficacy of technology-based interventions often include patients with a wide range of motor impairment. This scoping review aims at overviewing the actual severity of stroke patients enrolled in RCTs which claim to specifically address UL severe motor impairment. The literature search was conducted on Scopus and PubMed databases and included articles from 2008 to May 2024, specifically RCTs investigating the impact of technology-based interventions on UL motor functional recovery after stroke. Forty-eight studies were selected. They showed that upon patientsâ€™ enrolment the values of the UL Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Action Research Arm Test covered the whole range of both scales, thus revealing the non-selective inclusion of severe impaired patients. Heterogeneity in terms of numerosity, characteristics of enrolled patients, trial design, implementation, and reporting were present across studies. No clear difference in the severity of the included patients according to the intervention type was found. Patient stratification upon enrolment is crucial to best direct resources to those patients who will benefit the most from a given technology-assisted approach (personalised rehabilitation).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee938d8d00326a3849378481e5a742ba351eefdc104a5e2256d6cd7b5fe21d27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
