{"title":"Comparative Study of a Compound Antioxidant and Ethoxyquin on Feed Oxidative Stability, Broiler Performance, Antioxidant Capacity, and Intestinal Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1166/v1","date":1726541946000,"content":"Concerns regarding the safety of ethoxyquin (EQ) have gradually increased, highlighting the necessity of identifying safer and more effective antioxidants for use in animal feed. This study investigates the effects of a compound antioxidant (CA) as an alternative to ethoxyquin on feed oxidative stability, growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal health in broilers. A total of 351 one-day-old Arbor Acres Plus male broilers were randomly assigned to three treatments with nine replicates of 13 birds each. The experimental treatments included: CON group (basal diet), EQ group (basal diet + 200 g/ton EQ at 60% purity), and CA group (basal diet + 200 g/ton compound antioxidant, which comprises 18% butylated hydroxytoluene, 3% citric acid, and 1% tertiary butylhydroquinone). The experiment lasted for 21 days. Compared to the control group, supplementation with CA significantly reduced the acid value, peroxide value, and malondialdehyde content in the feeds after storage. Moreover, CA supplementation significantly decreased feed intake and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) without affecting weight gain of boilers, while also improving liver antioxidant capacity (increased T-AOC and SOD levels), intestinal antioxidant capacity (increased CAT, HO-1, and GPX7 protein expression), and enhancing the duodenal villus height-to-crypt depth ratio and jejunal villus height. Additionally, CA treatment reduced intestinal barrier permeability (decreased diamine oxidase activity and D-lactate levels), potentially by promoting the expression of Occludin, ZO-1, and Mucin2 protein. Furthermore, the addition of CA elevated the protein levels of NF-κB p50 along with its inhibitory factors, IκB and NF-κB p105, in the intestines of broilers, thereby enhancing immune regulatory capacity. This supplementation also led to an increased abundance of beneficial gut microorganisms, including Lactobacillus, Alistipes, Candidatus Arthromitus, and Turicibacter. In comparison to the EQ group, CA supplementation enhanced feed oxidative stability, decreased the FCR, and improved the intestinal morphology, barrier functions, and inflammatory status in broilers. These findings suggest that this compound antioxidant may serve as a healthier and more effective alternative to ethoxyquin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97028baaf74e6a3cbf8beb0a4467bf3f68371be16de5957298e8d148d96715b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
