{"title":"Accessible luminal interface of bovine rectal organoids generated from cryopreserved biopsy tissues","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301079","date":1711029600000,"content":"<p>by Minae Kawasaki, Yoko M. Ambrosini</p>\r\n\r\nDeveloping precise species-specific <i>in vitro</i> models that closely resemble <i>in vivo</i> intestinal tissues is essential for advancing our understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and associated diseases. This is especially crucial in examining host-pathogen interactions, particularly in bovines, a known reservoir for microbes and pathogens posing substantial public health threats. This research investigated the viability of producing bovine rectal organoids from cryopreserved tissues. We compared two cryopreservation methods with a traditional technique using fresh tissues, evaluating their effectiveness through growth rates, long-term viability, and comprehensive structural, cellular, and genetic analyses. These assessments utilized phase-contrast imaging, immunofluorescence imaging, and RT-qPCR assays. Additionally, the study developed a sophisticated method for forming a functional epithelial barrier from organoid-derived bovine rectal monolayers, incorporating a wide range of epithelial cells. This methodology employed transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (<i>P</i><sub>app</sub>), confocal microscopy, and advanced imaging techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our findings decisively show that bovine rectal organoids can be effectively generated from cryopreserved biopsy tissues. Moreover, we formulated a robust and optimized protocol for creating functional rectal monolayers from these organoids. This significant progress is particularly relevant given the susceptibility of the bovine rectum to various enteric pathogens of public health concern, marking a vital step forward in veterinary and biomedical research. The creation of accurate species specific <i>in vitro</i> models that faithfully mimic <i>in vivo</i> intestinal tissues is critical for enhancing our understanding of gut physiology and related pathologies. This is particularly relevant in studying the interactions between hosts and microbes or pathogens with significant public health risks where bovine can be the major reservoir.","author":"Minae Kawasaki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"61bf917844cb5b2de95de8ed6ca523ef5af57e839c239f7295f92137384f9ac7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
