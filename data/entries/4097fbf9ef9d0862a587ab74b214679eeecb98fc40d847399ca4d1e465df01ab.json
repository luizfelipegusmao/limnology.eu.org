{"title":"Strategies for sustainable urban development: Assessing the impact of adaptation readiness, nanotechnology, and renewable energy on urban ecosystems","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12446?af=R","date":1716366244000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In an era marked by rapid urbanization and increasing environmental concerns, the quest for sustainable development has become paramount. The goal of this study is to support sustainability by critically analysing and reviewing methods for reducing people's ecological footprint in urban areas. We are comparing different ways of reducing the negative effects that people living in cities have on the natural world around them. The decrease in ecological footprint was 0.688% for a 1% increase in the nanotechnological innovations. The decrease in the ecological footprint (improvement in the environment was 0.575 due to 1% increase in renewable energy). The decrease in the ecological footprint was 0.517% due to 1% increase in the adaptation readiness. The increase in the ecological footprint was 0.837% and 0.443% due to 1% increase in the inclusive growth and urbanization. Renewable energy is extremely important for civilization to become carbon neutral. It is suggested to switch from conventional fuel to clean fuel to enhance the use of energy from renewable sources to reduce global warming. It is required to increase adaptation readiness as “preparedness” to effectively use investments for adapting to climate change. Future research endeavors should delve deeper into the enduring repercussions of strategies for reducing the ecological footprint, examining how these strategies evolve over time, and adapt to the ever-changing urban environments. The outcomes of this study possess substantial implications for policymaking, indicating that policymakers and urban planners should prioritize the adoption of holistic strategies for reducing the ecological footprint to nurture sustainable urban development. It advocates for the infusion of sustainability principles into urban policy frameworks and underscores the significance of ongoing monitoring and assessment to steer effective policy implementation.</p>","author":"Jiali Li, \nWeiqun Han, \nMuhammad Aamir Mahmood","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"4097fbf9ef9d0862a587ab74b214679eeecb98fc40d847399ca4d1e465df01ab","category":"Environment"}
