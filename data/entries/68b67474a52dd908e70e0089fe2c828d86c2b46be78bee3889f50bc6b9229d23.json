{"title":"Enhanced resistance of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum by expression of albumin","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13711?af=R","date":1720619708000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in plasma, playing crucial roles in regulating osmotic pressure and maintaining protein homeostasis. It is widely applied in the clinical treatment of various diseases. HSA can be purified from plasma or produced using recombinant DNA technology. Due to the improved efficiency and reduced costs, a growing body of research has focused on enhancing albumin production through bacterial strain overexpression. However, there have been few studies on the effect of albumin on the characteristics of the overexpressing-strain itself, particularly stress resistance. In this study, we utilized <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (<i>L. plantarum</i>) AR113 as the expression host and successfully constructed the albumin overexpression strain AR113-pLLY01 through gene editing technology. The successful expression of albumin was achieved and subsequently compared with the wild-type strain AR113-pIB184.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results demonstrated that the survival rate of AR113-pLLY01 was also significantly better than that of AR113-pIB184 after lyophilization. In addition, AR113-pLLY01 exhibited a significantly better protective effect than AR113-pIB184 at pH 3, indicating that albumin possesses a certain tolerance to acidic stress. At bile salt concentrations higher than 0.03%, both strains showed limited growth, but at a concentration of 0.02%, AR113-pLLY01 had a significant protective effect.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study suggest that albumin can improve strain tolerance, which has significant implications for future applications. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tongren Ding, \nGuangqiang Wang, \nLiuqian Tang, \nYongjun Xia, \nXin Song, \nYijin Yang, \nLianzhong Ai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"68b67474a52dd908e70e0089fe2c828d86c2b46be78bee3889f50bc6b9229d23","category":"Environment"}
