{"title":"The Use of Pareto Analysis and Pilots Testing with New Generation RO Membranes to Take Decision for the Improvement of the Energy Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1790/v1","date":1716879507000,"content":"In this study is considered the design and implementation of pilots in desalination plants, in a systematic way, to evaluate energy improvements in water desalination processes. Pilot tests with the latest generation of reverse osmosis membranes in large desalination plants are becoming increasingly common, as small-scale experiments are carried out on the operation of new generation membranes with better salt rejection and lower energy consumption, to achieve the best water quality required for each case at the lowest possible cost. In this way, pilot tests are being carried out before the decision is made whether or not to change the reverse osmosis membranes, as this represents a significant investment and we minimize the risk of making a mistake in order to ensure the best results in terms of energy consumption, operating costs and reducing the environmental impact while complying with the required water quality. In this case, the Pareto analysis is used to highlight the 2 or 3 most significant causes whose treatment affects more than 80% of the possible energy improvement to be implemented. In this sense, figure 3 below shows the Pareto diagram for the energy improvement of N plants in a given territory. A series of factors that can affect this energy improvement have been numbered from 1 to 7, such as the seawater intake, the decision on the membranes, the energy recuperators, the high-pressure pump, the decisions on the pre-treatment, the feed pump or the post-treatment. The Pareto diagram has been studied at territorial level with a total of 180 seawater desalination plants. The novelty of this article is to apply Pareto diagram to a study of a total of 180 seawater desali-nation plants at territorial level in Canary Islands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"935db39f93cebedee1785d0fb00a75bee7d99d282a506260af74efc7a166e940","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
