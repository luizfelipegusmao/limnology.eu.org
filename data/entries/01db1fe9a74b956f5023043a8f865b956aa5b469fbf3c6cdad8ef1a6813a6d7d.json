Host space, not energy or symbiont size, constrains feather mite abundance across passerine bird species. <i>Journal of Animal Ecology</i>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14032\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14032</a>. Symbionts represent crucial links between species in ecosystems. Consequently, understanding their patterns of abundance is a major goal in the study of symbioses. However, multiple biotic and abiotic factors may regulate symbionts, and disentangling the mechanisms that drive variation in their abundance across host species is challenging. One promising strategy to approach this challenge is to incorporate biologically relevant data into theoretical models. In a recent study, Labrador et al. (2023) used this strategy to investigate the poorly understood symbiosis between feather mites and their avian hosts. They integrate a remarkable amount of empirical data with models based on the metabolic theory of ecology to determine what factors limit feather mite abundance across European passerines. Their quantitative analyses indicate that the number of feather barbs limits mite abundance across host species, suggesting that mite populations are spatially, but not energetically, constrained. These findings not only reveal mechanisms that may drive the variation in feather mite abundances across hosts, but also advance our understanding of the ecology of interspecific interactions more generally.</p>","author":"Alix E.
