{"title":"On the Impact of Leading Enterprise Social Platforms in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Performance: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1455/v1","date":1729252812000,"content":"The adoption of enterprise social platforms (ESPs) has become increasingly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking to enhance communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing in the digital economy. As digital transformation progresses, the role of ESPs in improving operational efficiency and long-term business performance warrants comprehensive evaluation. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of leading ESPs on SME performance, focusing on their capabilities to improve communication efficiency, interdepartmental collaboration, and cost-effectiveness while highlighting emerging trends such as automation and AI integration. A PRISMA-guided systematic review was conducted, analyzing 18 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024. Inclusion criteria comprised English-language publications examining ESP adoption in SMEs, focusing on ESP features and their effects on operational and strategic outcomes. Quantitative analysis of the selected studies revealed that ESPs improve communication efficiency by 20% and enhance interdepartmental collaboration by 25%. While initial implementation costs pose challenges, ESPs contribute to a 15% reduction in operational costs over time. Additionally, trends in automation and AI integration suggest further potential for operational enhancements. The findings indicate that ESPs significantly enhance SMEs' competitiveness and sustainability, offering both immediate operational improvements and long-term strategic growth. Business leaders are encouraged to adopt ESPs to foster agility and innovation while ensuring robust data security measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9f28a85c6137037a7c263bb3e78010993229b8716171d9993834a5d6259201a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
