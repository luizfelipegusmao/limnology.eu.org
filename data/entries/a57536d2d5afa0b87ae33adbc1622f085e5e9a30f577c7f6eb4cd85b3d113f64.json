This study shows the performance of different full-scale implementations.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The frequent design challenge for existing water resource recovery facilities targets the accommodation of an ~50% load increase within the existing infrastructure and footprint. Off-loading this organic load at the top-end of the plant and redirection toward the digesters has proven the most efficient way of process intensification. The Triple A settler is an “activated primary treatment,” stands for alternating activated adsorption, and can be retrofitted into existing rectangular or circular (mostly) primary tanks at a hydraulic retention time of 2 h and a sludge retention time of about 0.5 days. Several technology implementations demonstrate flexible designs adjusting to existing tank geometries and depths of 2.5 to 5.0 m. Different implementation scales from dry-weather flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 10 mgd show generic applicability of the functional principles at any scale: Biosorption, bioflocculation, and assimilation provide the key added value in pretreatment efficiencies of ~60/25/33 in %COD/%N/%P removal compared with application of pure physics in primary settling with typical 33%/9%/11% removal, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Practitioners Points</h2>\n<p>\nTriple A is a hybrid form of A-stage and contact stabilizer for advanced primary treatment.\nBesides COD and TSS, also, P and N can be removed via Triple A.\nTriple A can be retrofitted in existing rectangular or circular tanks.\nThis high-rate process does not worsen the conditions for enhanced biological phosphorus removal.\nEnergy efficiency, capacity increase, and operational benefits are the main goals of Triple A.\n</p>","author":"Bernhard Wett, \nPeter Aichinger, \nSudhir Murthy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"a57536d2d5afa0b87ae33adbc1622f085e5e9a30f577c7f6eb4cd85b3d113f64","category":"Environment"}
