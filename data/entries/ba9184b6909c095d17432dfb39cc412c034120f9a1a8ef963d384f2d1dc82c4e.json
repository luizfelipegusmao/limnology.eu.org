{"title":"Does the Weather Still Affect Me When I Shop at Home? The Impact of Weather on Online Shopping Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2246/v1","date":1722244058000,"content":"Previous studies have acknowledged the impact of weather changes on retail uncertainty. They primarily focus on understanding how weather conditions affect offline consumer behavior and aiming to develop effective marketing strategies. However, there is little research on the complex impact of weather on online shopping behavior. To bridge this gap, we conduct a study with a sample of 261 consumers from China with shopping experience in Community Retail Shops (CRSs). We utilize the S-O-R model and theories including meteorological emotional effect theory, emotional coherence and meteorological psychology to propose and validate models elucidating the relationship between weather and consumers' online shopping behavior in CRS. Our findings reveal that weather conditions affect consumers' spending patterns and purchase diversity, mediating by consumers' emotion and risk aversion, when they comfortably shop online at home. Furthermore, employing the fsQCA model, we identify the critical path through which weather conditions and consumer types influence risk aversion awareness. The results provide management implications for retailers to develop online marketing strategies for different consumer types.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba9184b6909c095d17432dfb39cc412c034120f9a1a8ef963d384f2d1dc82c4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
