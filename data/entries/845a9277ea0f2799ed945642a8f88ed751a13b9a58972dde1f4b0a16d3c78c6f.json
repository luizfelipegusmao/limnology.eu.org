Eighteen family and community specialist nurses from different autonomous communities in Spain participated. Individual interviews and a focus group were conducted; Results: The results showed two themes and four sub-themes: 1) Current work situation of the Family and Community Nursing specialist: a) The lack of social and work recognition, and b) The advantages of working with Family and Community Nursing specialists; and 2) Support network and system of rejection: a) Systematic ambivalence towards Family and Community Nursing and b) Need for institutional support.
