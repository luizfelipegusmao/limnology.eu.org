{"title":"How Olive Oil Health Claims Depend on Fruit Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1745/v1","date":1711613246000,"content":"The most relevant fungal disease of the olive tree in Portugal is anthracnose, which has negative effects on fruit destruction and consequently on the yield and quality of the olive oil. Moreover, the loss of quality caused by olive fruit fly is associated with the presence of fungi in the galleries made by the larvae. The present study focuses on the effect of olive anthracnose and olive fly on the content of bioactive compounds, namely on hydroxytyrosol (HYT) and its derivatives (health claim) in olive oils extracted from 'Galega Vulgar' and 'Cobrançosa' cultivars. The olives, with different damage levels (olive fly and anthracnose disease), were harvested in Castelo Branco (Center of Portugal) in organic rainfed orchards, at four harvest times during 2019, 2020 and 2021 harvest years. The fruits were immediately submitted to olive oil extraction. The results of the quality criteria show that Galega olive oils extracted from olives with a higher anthracnose incidence show no conformity for the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and Virgin Olive Oil (VOO) categories, with high acidity values and negative sensory notes accompanied by the disappearance of oleacein (the main phenolic compound of both monovarietal olive oils). Conversely, no sensory defects were observed in Cobrançosa olive oils extracted from fruit with high anthracnose and olive fly incidence. Moreover, despite a decrease in all the positive attributes associated with the cultivar, namely in oleacein and oleocanthal contents, quality criteria were still in accordance with the EVOO category. The total HYT and tyrosol (TYR) content (&amp;gt; 5 mg/20g) allows the use of the health claim on the label of all the analysed Cobrançosa olive oils.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23c4477f891468bd4c47d3726ef77eb6e8064d8c5de6c06af4d675319e7f6d6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
