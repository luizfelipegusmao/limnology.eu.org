{"title":"Deep Vein Thrombosis After Laparoscopic Nephrectomy: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1544/v1","date":1721316178000,"content":"This case report presents a 63-year-old male patient who developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) shortly after undergoing retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for ureteral and renal pelvis tumors. Despite early postoperative mobilization and administration of low molecular weight heparin, the patient developed DVT, highlighting the limitations of current postoperative management strategies. The patient was promptly treated with the placement of an inferior vena cava filter and continued anticoagulation therapy, preventing the progression to pulmonary embolism and leading to a successful discharge.The report emphasizes the importance of vigilant postoperative monitoring and timely intervention in preventing complications such as DVT. It suggests that current strategies, including early mobilization and standard anticoagulation therapy, may not be sufficient to fully prevent DVT, necessitating further optimization of postoperative care. Regular monitoring of D-Dimer levels and ultrasound examinations, as well as appropriate limb protection measures during surgery, are recommended to detect and manage potential DVT early.This case contributes valuable insights into the early detection and management of postoperative DVT, providing useful references for similar cases and stressing the need for enhanced postoperative monitoring and timely intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27c80ecb9df3818095861ed6ea175913f1cf32980e42d672ecfd61569a7b5c11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
