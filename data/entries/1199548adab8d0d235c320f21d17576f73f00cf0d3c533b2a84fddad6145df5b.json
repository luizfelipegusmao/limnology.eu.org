{"title":"When the going gets tough: Extracellular vesicles transport lignin precursors and lignifying enzymes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/675/7700357?rss=1","date":1719446400000,"content":"<span>Lignin is a stiff phenolic polymer and one of the most abundant chemicals produced by plants. It provides vascular plants with both structural support and a means to transport water, for example, allowing giant redwoods (<span>Sequoiadendron giganteum</span>) to grow beyond 100 m tall and draw water to their tips. Lignin monomers (monolignols) are produced in the cytosol and are polymerized in the cell wall. Laccase and peroxidase enzymes oxidize monolignols to generate phenolic radicals that randomly couple to form the final polymer. How lignin monomers are transported from the site of synthesis to the apoplast is an open question. Passive diffusion of monolignols across the plasma membrane due to a concentration gradient, generated by the oxidation of monolignols in the cell wall, is a recently proposed model (<a href=\"#kiae354-B5\">Perkins et al. 2022</a>). Evidence also exists for active transport of monolignols; for example, the membrane-bound ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter <span>ABCG29</span> is reported to transport lignin monomers in <span>A. thaliana</span> (<a href=\"#kiae354-B1\">Alejandro et al. 2012</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1199548adab8d0d235c320f21d17576f73f00cf0d3c533b2a84fddad6145df5b","category":"Environment"}
