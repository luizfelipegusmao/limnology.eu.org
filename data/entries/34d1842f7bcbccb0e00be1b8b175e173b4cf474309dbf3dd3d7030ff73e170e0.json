We tested this hypothesis using data on plant community structure, above- and below-ground biomass, eight root traits including mycorrhizal colonisation and soil properties from an edaphic gradient driven by elevation and water availability in sandhills prairie, Nebraska, USA.\n\nWe found multidimensional trade-offs in rooting strategies represented by a two-way productivity-durability trade-off axis (captured by root length density and root dry matter content) and a three-way resource acquisition trade-off between specific root length, root:shoot mass ratio and mycorrhizal dependence. Variation in rooting strategies was driven to similar extents by interspecific differences and intraspecific responses to soil properties.\n\nOrgan-level traits alone were insufficient to capture community-level trade-offs in rooting strategies across the edaphic gradient. Instead, trait variation encompassing organ, plant and symbiosis levels revealed that consideration of whole-plant phenotypic integration is essential to defining multidimensional trade-offs shaping the functional variation of root systems.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/01/23/trade-offs-in-how-plants-acquire-soil-resources-the-root-of-the-matter/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Yuguo Yang, \nSabrina E.
