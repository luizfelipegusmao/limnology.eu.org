{"title":"Self-management education for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia as major risk factors for cardiovascular disease: <i>Insights from stakeholders’ experiences and expectations</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310961","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Nazanin Soleimani, Fatemeh Ebrahimi, Masoud Mirzaei</p>\r\nBackground <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of premature death, with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia as major risk factors. Effective self-management (SM) is crucial for controlling these conditions and improving quality of life. This study examines stakeholders’ experiences and expectations of SM education to enhance program development.</p> Methods <p>This study employed a qualitative grounded theory approach to explore the perspectives of three stakeholder groups: 19 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia, 11 primary healthcare providers, and five provincial health policymakers and managers. Data were collected via semi-structured patient interviews and focus group discussions(FGDs) with health professionals. Coding and analysis were conducted separately using Corbin and Strauss principles with ATLAS. ti version 9.0 software.</p> Results <p>Most patients were women (68%) aged 50–60 years (37%), with education levels from illiterate to master’s degree; 32% had completed primary school. Most were housewives (52%), and 12 had multiple chronic diseases. Healthcare providers included six community health workers and five primary care physicians, with average experience of 12 and 19 years, respectively. Health policymakers and managers averaged 25 years of experience. Patient interviews and FGDs resulted in 12 and 13 subthemes, respectively, with five subthemes common to both sources. These subthemes were grouped into broader main themes, including \"effective content design,\" \"effective presentation and delivery,\" \"characteristics and conditions of involved parties,\" and \"educational needs,\" collectively reflect the central concept of \"effective self-management education\".</p> Conclusion <p>Although the core concept and its main themes were evident and consistent across stakeholder groups, significant variations in subthemes from each stakeholder emerged. This underscores the importance of considering diverse viewpoints and highlights that, while overarching concepts may seem uniform, exploring the details of stakeholder perspectives is crucial for understanding their nuanced opinions. Effective education should integrate these insights, focusing on tailored communication, interactivity, and active monitoring.</p>","author":"Nazanin Soleimani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c84d62ceba4c4ad7b39b5183f6f4c2335a493717ba634485e38844f019157ca2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
