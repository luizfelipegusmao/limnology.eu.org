{"title":"Elacestrant Plus Alpelisib in an ESR1 and PIK3CA Co-mutated and Heavily Pretreated Metastatic Breast Cancer: The First Case for Combination Efficacy and Safety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0128/v1","date":1722563549000,"content":"Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, and hormone receptor (HR)-positive subtype makes up majority of all cases. The standard-of-care (SOC) in HR+/HER2- metastatic BC (MBC) is endocrine therapy (ET) plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i). ESR1 mutations could impair clinical efficacy of the ETs. Similarly, PIK3CA mutations may serve as a negative prognostic marker. Furthermore, MBC is challenging to treat despite new drug approvals. Our patient received multiple lines of ET Â± CDK4/6i and chemotherapy but persistently progressed after each or stopped the treatment due to adverse events. Here we showed for the first time that all-oral combination of elacestrant plus alpelisib was feasible, tolerable and clinically active in an ESR1 and PIK3CA co-mutated and heavily pretreated patient. We achieved a remarkable response in the metastatic lesions with minor toxicity issues. This case highlights the importance of utilizing up-to-date therapeutic agents and reactive decision-making during personalized cancer treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1095582cc2c7141aeeb1e137f012beee3cbd74337c77a9117a814f594b359433","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
