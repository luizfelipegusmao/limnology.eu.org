{"title":"Implementation and adaptation of a hub-based psychiatric and primary care program: A qualitative descriptive analysis of The Seamless Care Optimizing the Patient Experience (SCOPE) Mental Health program","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303750","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Carly Whitmore, Mona Emam, Pauline Pariser, Blanca Bolea</p>\r\nBackground <p>The Seamless Care Optimizing the Patient Experience (SCOPE)â€“Mental Health program is a comprehensive case management and psychiatric care initiative that supports primary care physicians in independent medical practices. This program offers a range of services that aims to enhance primary care capacity for mental health and provide accessible clinical care for patients. With its flexible hub-based approach, this program allows participating sites to tailor their implementation based on their available resources and specific needs within their community.</p> Objectives <p>The aim of this quality improvement initiative was to investigate the evolution of this collaborative mental health model, focusing on specific site adaptations, local implementation challenges, and opportunities for ongoing development and sustainability across SCOPE sites in the Greater Toronto Area.</p> Method <p>This evaluation employed a qualitative descriptive design where semi-structured interviews, guided by the Reach Effectiveness Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework were conducted with staff from all 8 SCOPE-Mental Health sites. Site representatives were interviewed virtually between March and July 2023 and data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.</p> Findings <p>The SCOPE-Mental Health model permits flexibility through specific local adaptations led by community need that leverage existing assets either at the site or within the individual community. Adoption by primary care physicians was crucial to program success and facilitated efficiency and interprofessional collaboration. Maintenance efforts included pathway refinement, and marketing and funding considerations. Challenges to program development included continuity of staff, physician compensation issues, and electronic health record interoperability. The SCOPE-Mental Health program fosters linkages among unaffiliated primary care offices, hospitals, and community-based resources to improve mental health care. Key recommendations include advocating for sustainable funding and facilitated mechanisms for psychiatric consultations.</p> Conclusions <p>This initiative offers valuable insights for healthcare organizations seeking to develop similar programs, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches and ongoing evaluation to ensure a lasting impact in underserved communities.</p>","author":"Carly Whitmore","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0b1b1f663385a41161c1c45b7590183adf16306792211a93adeb04900e968363","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
