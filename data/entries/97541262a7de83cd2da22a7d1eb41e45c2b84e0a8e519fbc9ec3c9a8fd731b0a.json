{"title":"Oxidative Stress in Canine Diseases: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1019/v1","date":1728902818000,"content":"Oxidative stress (OS), defined as a disruption in redox balance favoring oxidants, has emerged as a major contributor to numerous diseases in human and veterinary medicine. While several reviews have explored the implication of OS in human pathology, an exhaustive review for the canine species is lacking. This comprehensive review aims to summarize the existing literature on the role of OS in canine diseases, highlighting its potentially detrimental effect on various organs and systems. Some inconsistencies among studies exist, likely due to varying biomarkers and sample types. However, there is substantial evidence supporting the involvement of OS in the development or progression of numerous canine disorders, such as cardiovascular, oncologic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, renal, neurologic, infectious and parasitic diseases, among others. Additionally, this review discusses the efficacy of antioxidant and pro-oxidant therapeutic agents for these conditions. Dietary interventions to counteract OS in dogs have gained significant attention in recent years, although further research on the topic is needed. This review aims to serve a foundational resource for future investigations in this promising field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97541262a7de83cd2da22a7d1eb41e45c2b84e0a8e519fbc9ec3c9a8fd731b0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
