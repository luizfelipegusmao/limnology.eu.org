Agricultural expansion has proven advantageous for several Arctic-breeding goose species, leading to increased abundance and intensified conflict with farmers. Shooting is frequently implemented as a mitigation strategy to control population and via scaring to alter the spatial distribution of conflict species. However, the efficacy of such regimes in manipulating the fear landscape is not always investigated.\n\nWe developed resource selection functions using GPS-tracking data for Greenland barnacle geese (<i>Branta leucopsis</i>) wintering on Islay, Scotland to assess foraging site choice. We assessed overall foraging site preference and evaluated the influence of shooting management on foraging site selection of key habitats.\n\nBarnacle geese selected for improved grassland areas and the likelihood of utilisation varied between these fields according to field-specific management. Protected areas were strongly selected for along with newly reseeded grassland. Field-level exposure to shooting disturbance did not cause a notable change in site selection.\n\n<i>Synthesis and Applications</i>: Our results demonstrate the importance of providing refuges within managed agricultural landscapes to encourage site use and minimise conflict. We highlight how low-intensity shooting disturbance may be ineffective in altering winter habitat selection of high-value foraging sites (especially near roosts). If future management aimed to stimulate redistribution, higher intensity shooting disturbance along with the spatial and temporal coordination of shooting effort would likely be required to create a stronger perceived gradient of disturbance risk.\n</p>","author":"Aim√©e L.
