{"title":"Implementation of Online Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance Using Yolo for Autonomous Mobile Robots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1382/v1","date":1718848968000,"content":"Robotic path planning and navigation algorithms enable autonomous mobile robots to navigate complex environments. These algorithms allow robots to be deployed in search and rescue missions, where they can locate victims in hazardous areas inaccessible to humans. Additionally, autonomous driving algorithms hold the potential to revolutionize transportation by enabling self-driving cars to navigate roads safely and efficiently. This paper focuses on developing an algorithm for autonomous navigation of the mobile robot (Tortoise bot) using robot operating system (ROS), based on publish-subscribe communication facilitating seamless interaction between various nodes. Tortoise Bot is a differential wheeled robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot body. The Raspberry Pi acts as the controller. A 360-degree LiDAR and RGB-D camera are used for creating a 3D map of the environment. Various state-of-the art software tools, such as Gazebo, Ubuntu, MATLAB and RPI imager are used. Initially, a simulation based on simple obstacle avoidance is done using gazebo and MATLAB. Another simulation based on trajectory tracking is implemented using MATLAB to study the kinematic model. Online navigation and path planning are executed with the help of teleoperation and Dynamic Window Approach algorithm. A novel Wander algorithm is created that avoids obstacles on its path. Object recognition is also implemented during autonomous navigation using YOLO.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83d4ae7b9333071e4904c30afba4b5a059a916dce04f0494406cae79c11f295f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
