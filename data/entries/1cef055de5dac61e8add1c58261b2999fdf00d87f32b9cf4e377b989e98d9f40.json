{"title":"Native and non‐native species response to the colonization and subsequent suppression of northern pike Esox lucius","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15968?af=R","date":1729157199000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The expansion of northern Pike <i>Esox lucius</i> outside its native range into the western states of North America is a growing problem due to their negative effects on fish communities. Illegally introduced <i>E. lucius</i> were first detected in Box Canyon Reservoir in northeast Washington in 2004. By 2010, the <i>E. lucius</i> population was estimated at more than 10,000 individuals. Between 2012 and 2019, a gillnet suppression programme was conducted, which reduced the <i>E. lucius</i> catch per unit effort in Box Canyon Reservoir by 97% and their biomass by 98%. Between 2004 and 2019, four standardized surveys were conducted to characterize changes in the Box Canyon Reservoir fish community. Even after <i>E. lucius</i> were effectively suppressed, native species showed no signs of recovery during the study. The relative abundance of all native species decreased 82% in total number and 56% in total biomass between 2004 and 2019. Conversely, the relative abundance of non-native species increased 26% in total number and 33% in total biomass over the same period. As an apex predator, <i>E. lucius</i> had a significant impact on the fish community in Box Canyon Reservoir over a relatively short period of time (7 years), and appeared to act as a catalyst to increase the rate of replacement of native species with non-native species, which likely increased the pace of taxonomic homogenization in the reservoir.</p>","author":"Kent Mayer, \nDaniel L.
