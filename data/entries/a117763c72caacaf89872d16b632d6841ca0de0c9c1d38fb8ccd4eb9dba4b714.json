{"title":"Non-syndromic and Syndromic Defects in Children with Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors (eGCT): Data of 2,610 Children Registered with the German MAKEI 96/MAHO 98 Registry Compared to the General Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1550/v1","date":1713884388000,"content":"GCTs are developmental tumors and likely to reflect ontogenetic and teratogenetic determinants. The objective was to identify syndromes with or without congenital anomalies and non-syndromic defects as potential risk factors. \nPatients with extracranial GCTs (eGCTs) registered in MAKEI 96/MAHO 98 between 1996 and 2017 were used. According to Teilum's holistic concept malignant and benign teratomas were registered. We used a case control study design with Orphanet as a reference group for syndromic defects and the Mainz birth registry (EUROCAT) for congenital anomalies at birth. Co-occurring genetic syndromes and/or congenital anomalies were assessed accordingly. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and p-values for Fisherâ€™s exact test with Bonferroni correction if needed.\nA strong association was confirmed for Swyer (OR 338.6, 95% CI 43.7-2623.6) and Currarino syndrome (OR 34.2, 95% CI 13.2-88.6). We additionally found 17 isolated cases of eGCT with a wide range of syndromes, however not significantly associated following Bonferroni correction. All these cases pertained to girls. Regarding non-syndromic defects, no association with eGCTs could be identified. \nIn our study we confirmed a strong association for Swyer and Currarino syndromes with additional congenital anomalies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a117763c72caacaf89872d16b632d6841ca0de0c9c1d38fb8ccd4eb9dba4b714","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
