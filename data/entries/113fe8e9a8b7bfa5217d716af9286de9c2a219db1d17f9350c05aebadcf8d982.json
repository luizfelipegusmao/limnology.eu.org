{"title":"Valsa mali PR1-like protein modulates an apple valine-glutamine protein to suppress JA signaling-mediated immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2755/7571223?rss=1","date":1705449600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Apple Valsa canker (AVC) is a devastating disease of apple (<span>Malus</span> × <span>domestica</span>), caused by <span>Valsa mali</span> (<span>Vm</span>). The Cysteine-rich secretory protein, Antigen 5, and Pathogenesis-related protein 1 (CAP) superfamily protein PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEIN 1-LIKE PROTEIN c (VmPR1c) plays an important role in the pathogenicity of <span>Vm</span>. However, the mechanisms through which it exerts its virulence function in <span>Vm–</span>apple interactions remain unclear. In this study, we identified an apple valine-glutamine (VQ)-motif-containing protein, MdVQ29, as a VmPR1c target protein. <span>MdVQ29</span>-overexpressing transgenic apple plants showed substantially enhanced AVC resistance as compared with the wild type. MdVQ29 interacted with the transcription factor MdWRKY23, which was further shown to bind to the promoter of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling-related gene <span>CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1</span> (<span>MdCOI1</span>) and activate its expression to activate the JA signaling pathway. Disease evaluation in lesion areas on infected leaves showed that MdVQ29 positively modulated apple resistance in a MdWRKY23-dependent manner. Furthermore, MdVQ29 promoted the transcriptional activity of MdWRKY23 toward <span>MdCOI1</span>. In addition, VmPR1c suppressed the MdVQ29-enhanced transcriptional activation activity of MdWRKY23 by promoting the degradation of MdVQ29 and inhibiting <span>MdVQ29</span> expression and the MdVQ29<span>–</span>MdWRKY23 interaction, thereby interfering with the JA signaling pathway and facilitating <span>Vm</span> infection. Overall, our results demonstrate that VmPR1c targets MdVQ29 to manipulate the JA signaling pathway to regulate immunity. Thus, this study provides an important theoretical basis and guidance for mining and utilizing disease-resistance genetic resources for genetically improving apples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"113fe8e9a8b7bfa5217d716af9286de9c2a219db1d17f9350c05aebadcf8d982","category":"Environment"}
