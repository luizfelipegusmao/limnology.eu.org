{"title":"Control of an Extreme Oscillatory Object with a Delay: an Alternative to Smith Predictor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0694/v1","date":1728469982000,"content":"Controlling an object that is extremely prone to oscillations is a complex and highly relevant task. The tendency to oscillate arises due to the presence of an oscillatory element and a delay element, and control is often complicated by the presence of an integrator in the object. For such objects, a very effective method of numerical optimization of the controller is not effective enough without choosing the most efficient structure, more efficient than the PID controller and even than the PIDD controller. The method of using the Smith predictor, which is switched on parallel to the plant, allows solving a similar problem, but the resulting quality of control remains not good enough, since a large overshoot remains in the system. The article recommends, after using the Smith predictor, to additionally use an external control loop, the sequential controller of which should also be designed using the numerical optimization method. But the Smith predictor is not the best solution either. The article recommends the use of pseudo-local feedback. Such a connection provides more opportunities, since its structure and parameters can be optimized, while the Smith predictor in its parameters is completely determined by the object model and its modification is not allowed. The article shows that even the best sequential controller in the case of using the Smith predictor on a test example still cannot provide the required quality of control; in such a system, significant overshoot remains, more than 10%. The proposed method allows reducing overshoot to less than 0.5%. It is shown that the resulting system is robust, since the quality of control remains within specified limits even when the gain changes by 30% in both directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f58a894af66730f9a41a8c4d83a95663c78a6d6b26a2fed72a9de970b0e6fdf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
