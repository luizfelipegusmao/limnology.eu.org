{"title":"A Parametrical Study on Hypervelocity Impact of Orbital Debris","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0365/v1","date":1717666889000,"content":"A numerical method has been presented to simulate hypervelocity impacts into metal targets. The target is a rectangular prism and positioned at various inclined angles relative to the impact direc-tion, while four different projectile such as square prism, triangular prism, truncated cone and ogival shape are chosen. With this numerical model we aim to evaluate the risk of orbital debris impacting space structures in the design of shield systems for protection against hypervelocity impacts in space. To explore the geometric influences on hypervelocity impact, various projec-tile/target configurations are simulated using the Material Point Method. The Johnson–Cook plas-ticity model with a failure criterion is employed alongside Mie-Grüneisen's equation of state. Our analysis results reveal that the structure of debris cloud formations, scattering behavior of the ejected particle from both front and rear faces and penetration depth measures are significantly influenced by the projectile shape and impact angles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea666f6d4d86203ef940bc66a49b41e053c58d8d3757899c771760ac3e36dc7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
