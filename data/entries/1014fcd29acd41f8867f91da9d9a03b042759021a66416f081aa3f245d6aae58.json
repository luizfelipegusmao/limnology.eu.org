{"title":"Molecular regulatory mechanisms of staminate strobilus development and dehiscence in Torreya grandis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/534/7607898?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gymnosperms are mostly dioecious, and their staminate strobili undergo a longer developmental period than those of angiosperms. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to identify key genes and pathways involved in staminate strobilus development and dehiscence in <span>Torreya grandis</span>. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified fast elongation-related genes enriched in carbon metabolism and auxin signal transduction, whereas dehiscence-related genes were abundant in alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Based on WGCNA, we also identified <span>PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4</span> (TgPIF4) as a potential regulator for fast elongation of staminate strobilus and 2 WRKY proteins (TgWRKY3 and TgWRKY31) as potential regulators for staminate strobilus dehiscence. Multiple protein-DNA interaction analyses showed that TgPIF4 directly activates the expression of <span>TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE2</span> (<span>TgTIR2</span>) and <span>NADP-MALIC ENZYME</span> (<span>TgNADP-ME</span>). Overexpression of <span>TgPIF4</span> significantly promoted staminate strobilus elongation by elevating auxin signal transduction and pyruvate content. TgWRKY3 and TgWRKY31 bind to the promoters of the lignin biosynthesis gene <span>PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE</span> (<span>TgPAL</span>) and jasmonic acid metabolism gene <span>JASMONATE O-METHYLTRANSFERASE</span> (<span>TgJMT</span>), respectively, and directly activate their transcription. Overexpression of <span>TgWRKY3</span> and <span>TgWRKY31</span> in the staminate strobilus led to early dehiscence, accompanied by increased lignin and methyl jasmonate levels, respectively. Collectively, our findings offer a perspective for understanding the growth of staminate strobili in gymnosperms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1014fcd29acd41f8867f91da9d9a03b042759021a66416f081aa3f245d6aae58","category":"Environment"}
