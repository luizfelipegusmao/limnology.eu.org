Lacking the capacity to move, plants adjust their root systems to reach vital elements such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Soybeans and other legumes—important sources of proteins and oils for human food and animal feed—require little to no N fertilizer, owing to their capacity for N<sub>2</sub> fixation. However, this process is strongly reliant on P nutrition (<a href=\"#koae056-B4\">Zhong et al. 2023</a>). In addition, no more than 30% of applied P in fertilizers can be taken up by crops in the form of phosphate (Pi) (<a href=\"#koae056-B2\">López-Arredondo et al. 2014</a>), which makes this macronutrient limiting in modern agriculture. Therefore, expanding our understanding of Pi uptake in crops is pivotal to developing new varieties that can better mine this essential mineral.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"5a75667b565c146b0b1338bb622d3c1d3f49cd748deda36c96dfd8b32c6bf0a4","category":"Environment"}
