A Comparison through Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1626/v1","date":1719209032000,"content":"COVID-19 was a terrible worldwide pandemic that caused a global public health crisis, with numerous deaths and a severe economic depression. To suppress the spread of COVID-19 and initiate patient isolation and contact tracing to reduce its effect, early diagnosis was required, with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test being the most widely used. However, the RT-PCR test was sometimes found to be lengthy and inaccurate and; for that reason, in many cases of severe complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, chest screening with radiography imaging was preferred. In this paper, we carried out a study for COVID-19 detection from computed tomography images, and compared the obtained results using deep learning (DL) and support vector machine (SVM). The findings showed that, despite the excellent results shown by deep learning, the accuracy in predicting COVID-19 using SVM, in the presence of small databases, was slightly higher than DL. The execution time using SVM was also shorter","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"566bb6ed610572963742ce681fdd48ce7977e2654dfc52086a246d4710f247da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
