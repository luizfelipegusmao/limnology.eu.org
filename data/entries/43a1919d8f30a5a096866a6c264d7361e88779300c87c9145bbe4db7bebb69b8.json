{"title":"SIRT1 Serum Concentrations in Lipodystrophic Syndromes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0770/v1","date":1710320034000,"content":"Abstract: Lipodystrophies (LDs) are rare, complex disorders of the adipose tissue characterized by selective fat loss, altered adipokines profile and metabolic impairment. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are class III NAD+-dependent histone-deacetylases linked to fat metabolism. SIRT1 plays a critical role in metabolic health by deacetylating target proteins in tissues including liver, muscle and adipose tissue. Circulating SIRT1 levels have been found to be reduced in obesity while increased in anorexia nervosa and in patients experiencing weight loss. We evaluated circulating SIRT1 levels in relation to fat amount in 32 lipodystrophic patients affected by congenital or acquired LDs compared to non-LD subjects (24 with anorexia nervosa, 22 normal weight and 24 with obe-sity). SIRT1 serum levels were higher in LDs as compared with normal weight subjects (mean ± SEM: 4.17 ± 0.48 vs. 2.59 ± 0.20 ng/mL) or subjects with obesity (1.7 ± 0.39 ng/mL), whereas they were close to those measured in anorexia nervosa (3.44 ± 0.46 ng/mL). Our findings show that within the LD group there was no relationship between SIRT1 levels and the amount of body fat. The mechanisms responsible for secretion and regulation of SIRT1 in LD deserve further investi-gation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43a1919d8f30a5a096866a6c264d7361e88779300c87c9145bbe4db7bebb69b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
