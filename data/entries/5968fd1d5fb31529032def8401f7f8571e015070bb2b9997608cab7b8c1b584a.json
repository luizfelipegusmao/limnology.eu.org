{"title":"Population comparative genomics discovers gene gain and loss during grapevine domestication","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1401/7591227?rss=1","date":1706486400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant domestication are evolutionary experiments conducted by early farmers since thousands years ago, during which the crop wild progenitors are artificially selected for desired agronomic traits along with dramatic genomic variation in the course of moderate to severe bottlenecks. However, previous investigations are mainly focused on small-effect variants, while changes in gene contents are rarely investigated due to the lack of population-level assemblies for both the crop and its wild relatives. Here, we applied comparative genomic analyses to discover gene gain and loss during grapevine domestication using long-read assemblies of representative population samples for both domesticated grapevines (<span>V. vinifera</span> ssp. <span>vinifera</span>) and their wild progenitors (<span>V. vinifera</span> ssp. <span>sylvestris</span>). Only ∼7% of gene families were shared by 16 <span>Vitis</span> genomes while ∼8% of gene families were specific to each accession, suggesting dramatic variations of gene contents in grapevine genomes. Compared to wild progenitors, the domesticated accessions exhibited an increased presence of genes associated with asexual reproduction, while the wild progenitors showcased a higher abundance of genes related to pollination, revealing the transition from sexual reproduction to clonal propagation during domestication processes. Moreover, the domesticated accessions harbored fewer disease-resistance genes than wild progenitors. The SVs occurred frequently in aroma and disease-resistance related genes between domesticated grapevines and wild progenitors, indicating the rapid diversification of these genes during domestication. Our study provides insights and resources for biological studies and breeding programs in grapevine.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5968fd1d5fb31529032def8401f7f8571e015070bb2b9997608cab7b8c1b584a","category":"Environment"}
