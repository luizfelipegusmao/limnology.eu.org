{"title":"Ramsey Approach to Vector Fields","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1524/v1","date":1726740186000,"content":"Ramsey approach to the vectors fields is introduced. Set of  vectors defined on R^3, taken as the generators of the bi-colored complete graph, is introduced. Vectors are considered as the vertices of the graph. Following coloring procedure is suggested: vertices numbered i and j are linked with the red edge if their scalar product is non-negative; and they are linked with the green edge if their scalar product is negative. This procedure gives rise to the complete, bi-color graph. Graph generated by six vectors inevitably contains the monochromatic triangle: the Ramsey number  Ring-like systems of generating vectors are addressed. Applications of the graphs emerging from the vector fields are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e33cfa71d3f3b183f27b24660235ecff67f2120c84a4eb7bdd985d2b026daf16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
