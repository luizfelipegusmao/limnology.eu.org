{"title":"Synthesis and Study of Sorption Properties of Zinc-Imprinted Polymer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0197/v1","date":1727875024000,"content":"Imprinted polymers with imprints of Zn2+ ions (ZnIP) and reference polymers without imprints (NIP) were synthesized based on humic and methacrylic acids. Comparative studies of the physical parameters of ZnIP and NIP were carried out using elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Kinetic parameters of Zn2+ ion sorption on ZnIP and NIP were determined. It was found that the sorption kinetics on both ZnIP and NIP are approximated by a pseudo-first-order equation. The sorption rate constant for ZnIP is higher than that of NIP, indicating a higher adsorption rate of Zn2+ ions onto the surface of ZnIP. This may be due to more accessible sites on ZnIP. Adsorption of Zn2+ ions is best described by the Langmuir model, indicating monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface. The Langmuir model also shows that ZnIP is effective at low adsorbate concentrations. The Freundlich model describes the adsorption with less accuracy, which may indicate monolayer adsorption and less surface homogeneity. ZnIP shows better adsorption capacity and higher efficiency compared to NIP and can be proposed as a selective sorption material for Zn2+ ions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4a7314b2fb139ab5447e1894336302ee7687a82d7ca31b50ba0b6ec64a2e6b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
