{"title":"Host plant selection is linked to performance in Phthorimaea absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/665/7686618?rss=1","date":1717286400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The evolution of oviposition preference in insects is considered a key evolutionary strategy in the context of host–plant interaction. It is hypothesized that insects maximize the survival and fitness of the subsequent generations by preferring specific host plant(s), known as the “preference-performance hypothesis.” In this study, we tested whether adult host preference reflects the immature performance in an oligophagous insect, <span>Phthorimaea absoluta</span> Meyrick, a rapidly emerging invasive pest in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Based on a preliminary survey of the potential host plants of <span>P. absoluta</span>, we selected 6 Solanaceae species, namely, tomato, potato, eggplant, black nightshade, sweet pepper, and tobacco, for the oviposition preference studies. The results indicated that the tomato was the most preferred host in no-, dual- and multiple-choice assays, followed by potato, eggplant, and black nightshade. Subsequently, the insect life-table parameters were found to be superior on tomato compared to other hosts. The order of oviposition preference on the host plants was strongly correlated with the life-table parameters of <span>P. absoluta</span>. Thus, we provide clear evidence for the preference–performance hypothesis in the host selection behavior of <span>P. absoluta</span>. We also emphasize the necessity of conducting oviposition behavior research at various geographic locations to develop tailor-made integrated pest management programs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"866779dd06765ecd9a6a863d70f3ee9c9bd79759970af6fd01068f820823d404","category":"Environment"}
