{"title":"Ca2+‐mediated reactive oxygen species signaling regulates cell repair after mechanical wounding in the red alga Griffithsia monilis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13476?af=R","date":1719512656000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Mechanical damage to a cell can be fatal, and the cell must reseal its membrane and restore homeostasis to survive. Plant cell repair involves additional steps such as rebuilding vacuoles, rearranging chloroplasts, and remodeling the cell wall. When we pierced a <i>Griffithsia monilis</i> cell with a glass needle, a large amount of intracellular contents was released, but the cell membrane resealed in less than a second. The turgor of the vacuole was quickly restored, and the punctured cell returned to its original shape within an hour. Organelles such as chloroplasts and nuclei migrated to the wound site for 12 h and then dispersed throughout the cell after the wound was covered by a new cell wall. Using fluorescent probes, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium were detected at the wound site from 3 h after wounding, which disappeared when cell repair was complete. Wounding in a solution containing ROS scavengers inhibited cellular repair, and inhibiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity or blocking calcium influx reversibly inhibited cell repair. Oryzalin reversibly inhibited both chloroplast movement and ROS production during cell repair. Our results show that cell repair in <i>G. monilis</i> is regulated by calcium-mediated ROS signaling and that microtubules serve as mechanical effectors.</p>","author":"Chan Young Hong, \nJi Ho Yun, \nGwang Hoon Kim","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"026a0c7c632db5c513e0a02908f9a59e7a1bc1eb14180e1c3ccc6750d2a7701b","category":"Environment"}
