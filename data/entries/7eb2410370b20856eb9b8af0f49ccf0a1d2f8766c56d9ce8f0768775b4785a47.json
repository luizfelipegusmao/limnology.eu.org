{"title":"Study of the Effects of Wall Thickness and Size Variations on the Rupture Risk of Cerebral Aneurysms Using FSI Simulations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1517/v1","date":1718962117000,"content":"Cerebral aneurysms come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, they can evolve over time and present significant changes. It is generally accepted that large aneurysms are more prone to rupture, but the rupture of small aneurysms has also been observed, indicating the presence of additional risks factors. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of the aneurysm size and wall thickness on its rupture risk by using fluid-structure interaction simulations. Six patient-specific geometries were chosen, four were used for studying the size effect and two for studying the thickness effect. Additional cases where the aneurysm was removed were included. It was found that thinner walls suffer from significantly greater stresses, whereas an increment in size means, in general, lower wall shear stress and greater equivalent stress. By removing the aneurysm, it could be noted that at the rupture point, the reduction in the time-averaged wall shear stress was 75%. Although the size of an aneurysm has a great impact in its rupture risk, its wall thickness needs to be considered, since even maintaining its size, the aneurysm could suffer from a thin-ning of its walls that can lead to structural failure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7eb2410370b20856eb9b8af0f49ccf0a1d2f8766c56d9ce8f0768775b4785a47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
