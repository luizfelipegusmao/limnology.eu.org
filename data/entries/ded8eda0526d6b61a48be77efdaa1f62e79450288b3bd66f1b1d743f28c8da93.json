{"title":"Impact of Zirconium Carbide Particles on the Microstructure and Mechanical Characteristics of As-Cast and Heat Treated Al7475-Zirconim Carbide Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1277/v1","date":1726554859000,"content":"The aluminum alloys are prominently employed in the automotive, defense and aerospace industries owing to their excellent properties as compared to that of other metals and alloys. The present work has been centered on the synthesis and the evaluation of mechanical properties of cast and heat treated Al7475-Zirconium carbide composites. The composites were prepared by stir casting method. In order to enhance the properties, Al7475 alloy and Al7475-Zirconium carbide composite were subjected to a T6 heat treatment. The microstructural analysis and tensile, compression, impact and hardness tests were performed on the as-cast as well as T6 heat treated composite specimens. The microstructure of as-cast and heat treated Al7475-Zirconium carbide composite has revealed that the matrix of Al7475 alloy consisted of uniformly dispersed Zirconium carbide particles. The scanning electron microscopy image of heat-treated composite showed a decrease in grain size due to heat treatment effect, resulting in an increase in the strength of the composite. The mechanical properties of heat-treated Al7475-Zirconium carbide composite are superior compared to the as-cast composite. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, compression strength, impact strength and hardness of heat treated composite are 16.8%, 15.5%, 18.7%, 18.75% &amp;amp; 22.3% respectively higher than that of as-cast composite.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ded8eda0526d6b61a48be77efdaa1f62e79450288b3bd66f1b1d743f28c8da93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
