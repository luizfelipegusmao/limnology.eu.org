Here, we examine to what extent and why (mis)perceptions vary systematically across the income distribution. Drawing on data from four studies (<span>N</span> = 2,744)—including a representative sample and preregistered incentive-compatible experiments—we offer converging evidence that people specifically underestimate the amount of income held by the top of the income distribution. While this selective underestimation is likely driven by multiple mechanisms, including systemic factors, we find that cognitive biases contribute to the observed pattern of results. The rise of inequality in many developed countries has been documented before, and the fact that this growing inequality is largely driven by the outsized gains of the richest individuals may pose new challenges previously underappreciated: our theory and findings highlight that cognitive biases pose a key obstacle to people's recognition of the concentration of income among the richest individuals, and may potentially distort their preferences for redistribution. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and the importance of incorporating behavioral and cognitive limitations into the design of redistributive public policy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"eff0dc8a7fb8a5c068f3fcd1cb6ca3c777cb01dc274c61e6819a3d5150bc2a14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
