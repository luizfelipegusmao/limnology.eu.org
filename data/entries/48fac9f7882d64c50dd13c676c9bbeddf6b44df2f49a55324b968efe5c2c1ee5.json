{"title":"Preparation and functional properties of rice bran globulin‐chitooligosaccharide‐quercetin‐resveratrol covalent complex","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13506?af=R","date":1712144029000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>As the major protein (~36%) in rice bran, globulin exhibits excellent foaming and emulsifying properties, endowing its useful application as a foaming and emulsifying agent in the food industry. However, the low water solubility restricts its commercial potential in industrial applications. The aim of this study was to improve this protein's processing and functional properties.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>A novel covalent complex was fabricated by the combination of Maillard reaction and alkaline oxidation using rice bran globulin (RBG), chitooligosaccharide (COS), quercetin (Que), and resveratrol (Res). The Maillard reaction improved the solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties of RBG. The resultant glycosylated protein was covalently bonded with quercetin and resveratrol to form a (RBG-C)-Que-Res complex. (RBG-C)-Que-Res exhibited higher thermal stability and antioxidant ability than the native protein, binary globulin-chitooligosaccharide or ternary globulin-chitooligosaccharide-polyphenol (only containing quercetin or resveratrol) conjugates. (RBG-C)-Que-Res exerted better cytoprotection against the generation of MDA (malondialdehyde) and ROS (reactive oxygen species) in HepG2 cells, which was associated with increased activities of antioxidative enzymes SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase) through upregulated genes SOD1, CAT, GPX1 (glutathione peroxidase-1), GCLM (glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit), SLC1A11 (solute carrier family 7, Member 11), and SRXN1 (sulfiredoxin-1). The anti-apoptotic effect of (RBG-C)-Que-Res was confirmed by the downregulation of CASP3 (caspase-3) and p53 (protein 53) and the upregulation of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) gene expression.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study highlights the potential of (RBG-C)-Que-Res conjugates as functional ingredients in healthy foods.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
