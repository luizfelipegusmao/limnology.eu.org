{"title":"Grading Evaluation of Marbling in Wagyu Beef Using Fractal Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1059/v1","date":1720785673000,"content":"Wagyu beef is gaining worldwide popularity, primarily due to the fineness of its marbling. Cur-rently, the evaluation of this marbling is performed visually by graders. This method has several issues: varying evaluation standards among graders, reduced accuracy due to long working hours and external factors causing fatigue, and fluctuations in grading standards due to the grader's mood at the time. This paper proposes the use of fractal analysis for the grading evaluation of beef marbling to achieve automatic grading without the inconsistencies caused by human factors. In the experiments, cross-sectional images of the parts used for visual judgment were taken, and fractal analysis was performed on these images to evaluate them using fractal dimensions. The results confirmed a correlation between the marbling evaluation and the fractal dimensions, demonstrating that quantitative evaluation can be achieved, moving away from qualitative visual assessments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"233838454b938cd4e2b9ea7d2cfc84b43c6b8de1b2c2854ad55f6afc0446ce3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
