{"title":"Cross-cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Listening Inventory for Education-Revised in Italian","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1059/v1","date":1723629420000,"content":"Background: There has been a lack of tools to identify listening difficulties in school settings for both hearing and hearing-impaired Italian students. Thus, the present study aimed to realize cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Listening Inventory for Education-Revised for Italian students (LIFE-R-ITA). Methods: Following the validation of two forward-backward translations by a multidisciplinary committee, the content validation for the LIFE-R-ITA was performed by pre-testing six implanted children (8-18 years old). After minor cross-cultural adaptations, normative data were collected from a sample of 223 hearing students enrolled in different school settings and educational degrees. Results: For the LIFE-R-ITA, hearing students showed an average score of 72.26% (SD=11.93), reflecting some listening difficulties. The subscales (LIFE total, LIFE class, and LIFE social) indicated good internal consistency. All items were shown to be relevant. Most challenging situations happened when listening in large rooms, especially when other students made noise. LIFE social scores were significantly worse than those of LIFE class (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The LIFE-R-ITA may support teachers and clinicians in assessing studentsâ€™ self-perception of listening at school. Such understanding may help students overcome their listening difficulties, by planning and selecting the most effective strategies among classroom interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1e45dd39b83bb8a6767b582f50524803cc5253d13fa1105db307fc5ba98d81c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
