{"title":"Microglial Replacement and COURIER or SPIT for Neuronal Gene Editing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1620/v1","date":1713949505000,"content":"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors can be used for gene delivery.  AAV.CAP-Mac was recently developed; it can cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells throughout the CNS.  However, some brain regions were not transduced in adult rhesus monkeys.  Additionally, AAV vectors can only package 5 kb of DNA.  Also, AAV vectors may be genotoxic and cytotoxic, especially at high doses.  Finally, AAV vectors are very expensive to produce at sufficiently high titers for treatment.  Off-the-shelf cell-based delivery systems wherein the cells can infiltrate the target tissue and be hyper-motile would be ideal.  Also, mRNA-based gene editing would be a transient treatment, and thus be much safer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4cc975c1b6f2532844800d6f366041c61238ab0296e32dbe2bdf09a812e9f443","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
