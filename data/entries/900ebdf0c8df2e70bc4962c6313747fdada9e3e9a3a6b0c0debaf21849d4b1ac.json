For instance, electrons can self-organize into charge stripes that the lift the translation symmetry of the crystal through supercell formation [<a href=\"#ozae044.671-B1\">1</a>]. Alternatively, electron-lattice coupling can lead to the breaking of point group symmetries such as inversion, mirror, rotation. A key challenge in the field is understanding the precise intra-unit-cell arrangement of electronic order as well as its fluctuations [<a href=\"#ozae044.671-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.671-B2\">2</a>]. Towards that goal, atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques hold immense promise for advancing quantum materials research but progress has been hindered by the lack of low-temperature capabilities that are necessary to study quantum systems. Here I will show atomic-scale visualizations of quantum materials unleashed by the development of cryogenic electron microscopy techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.671-B2\">2</a>]. These advances enable direct visualizations of electron-lattice order and fluctuations. I will also describe our instrumentation development effort that has enabled cryogenic electron microscopy with liquid helium cooling (base temperature of 23 K), millikelvin temperature stability over many hours, and atomic resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.671-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.671-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"900ebdf0c8df2e70bc4962c6313747fdada9e3e9a3a6b0c0debaf21849d4b1ac","category":"Environment"}
