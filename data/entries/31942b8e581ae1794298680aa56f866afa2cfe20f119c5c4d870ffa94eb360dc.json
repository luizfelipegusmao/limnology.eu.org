{"title":"Evaluating local climate policy: Municipal action plans through the lens of resilience and environmental justice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000395","date":1726668000000,"content":"<p>by Graham Diedrich</p>\r\n\r\nIn the US, local governments are increasingly crucial in driving climate action. Drawing upon previous scholarly work, this study assesses nine local climate action plans in the state of Michigan. It introduces a comprehensive framework integrating climate resilience and environmental justice (EJ) indicators to evaluate plan content. Despite recognizing global climate concerns, qualitative content analysis shows that plans lack localized analyses and actions, hampering planning efforts as a result of insufficient data, minimal coordination, limited funds, and finite policy options. Key aspects like equitable resource distribution, environmental burdens, and community engagement are often overlooked. Without addressing these limitations, local governments lack the tools to effectively implement justice-oriented climate policies.","author":"Graham Diedrich","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"31942b8e581ae1794298680aa56f866afa2cfe20f119c5c4d870ffa94eb360dc","category":"Environment"}
