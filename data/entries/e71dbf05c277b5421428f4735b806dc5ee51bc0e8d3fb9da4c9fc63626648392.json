{"title":"Molecular Epidemiology and Spatial Distribution of Cat Rabies Cases in Yucatan, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1140/v1","date":1715938543000,"content":"The growing population in Yucatan has led to the expansion of construction in the Mayan jungle for tourist spaces, residential areas, and agriculture. Recently, rabies cases in cats (Felis catus) have increased. This study aimed to perform the antigenic and genetic characterization of the RABV and to try to identify factors contributing to the increased transmission of rabies virus from wildlife to cats in the State of Yucatan. The ArcGIS software was employed to generate maps depicting the geographic locations of rabies outbreaks in cats. A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was applied to investigate the association between cat rabies cases and sociodemographic and ecological variables. A total of nine feline rabies cases occurred, three antigenic variants were detected: RVV1 (n=1); (RVV3) (n=1), and the canine-originated atypical variant (n=7). Rabies cases were spatially distributed at the urban-jungle interface, which may favor contact between cats and wildlife. No statistically significant associations with sociodemographic/ecological variables were observed. Urban areas with low (0-2%) to moderate (2-4%) changes in land cover showed a substantial increase in the probability of feline rabies cases. This study highlights the concerning resurgence of rabies infections in cats, emphasizing the looming threat of its reintroduction in dogs should vaccination rates diminish. The genetic affinity between the atypical variant and the canine virus underscores the urgent need for vigilance in maintaining high vaccination coverage across all susceptible species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e71dbf05c277b5421428f4735b806dc5ee51bc0e8d3fb9da4c9fc63626648392","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
