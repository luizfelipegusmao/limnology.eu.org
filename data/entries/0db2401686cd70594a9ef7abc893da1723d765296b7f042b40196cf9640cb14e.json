{"title":"Inhibition of Protease Activated Receptor-2 Activation in Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0434/v1","date":1720083900000,"content":"In Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation is a complex defense mechanism. Activated microglia and Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) are key points in the regulation of neuroinflammation. 1-Piperidin Propionic Acid (1-PPA) has been recently described as a novel inhibitor of PAR2. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of 1-PPA in neuroinflammation and microglial activation in Parkinson's disease. Protein aggregates and PAR2 expression were analyzed by thioflavin S assay and immunofluorescence in cultured human fibroblasts from Parkinson's patients, treated or not with 1-PPA. A significant decrease of amyloid aggregates and expression of PAR2 were observed after 1-PPA treatment in all patients. A parallel decrease of PAR2 expression, that was higher in sporadic Parkinson’s patients, was also observed both at transcriptional and protein level. In addition, in mouse LPS-activated microglia, the inflammatory profile was significantly downregulated after 1-PPA treatment, with a remarkable decrease of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-togheter with PAR2 decreased expression.In conclusion, 1-PPA determines reduced neuroglia inflammation and amyloid aggregates formation, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of PAR2 could be proposed as a novel strategy to control neuroinflammation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0db2401686cd70594a9ef7abc893da1723d765296b7f042b40196cf9640cb14e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
