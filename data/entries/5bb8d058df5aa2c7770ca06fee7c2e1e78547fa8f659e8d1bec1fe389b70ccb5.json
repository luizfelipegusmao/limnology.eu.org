{"title":"Mapping Irrigation Methods in the Northwestern US Using Deep Learning Classification","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036155?af=R","date":1724212707000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Many agricultural areas of the western United States and other parts of the world practice irrigation using a variety of irrigation methods. Maps of irrigation methods are needed but existing technologies are often unable to distinguish between different irrigation methods when they co-exist on the same landscape. In this study, we develop a deep learning irrigation methods mapping tool for broad scale application. The technique uses a U-Net model trained on Landsat 5- and 8-derived input images. Training data consisted in irrigation method classified as Flood, Sprinkler or Other on agricultural fields from the Utah Water Related Land Use data set and additional labeling in selected areas of southern Idaho. An ensemble of 10 trained models had an overall accuracy of 0.78. Precision for Flood, Sprinkler and Other were 0.73, 0.82, and 0.80 while recall values were 0.75, 0.74, and 0.84 respectively. Model performance was generally stable throughout the training years but varied by areas. The best performance was obtained in regions with uniform irrigation method across large patches while small fields of contrasting irrigation method with their surroundings were inadequately predicted. Model prediction in an irrigated watershed of southern Idaho for 2006, 2011, 2013, and 2016 were consistent with previously published survey data. This methodology provides a tool for water resource managers to estimate irrigation methods in agricultural watersheds where natural precipitation is low during the growing season and irrigation methods include center pivots, wheel lines and flood irrigation.</p>","author":"S.
