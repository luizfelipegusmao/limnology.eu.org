{"title":"Chloroplastic ascorbate modifies plant metabolism and may act as a metabolite signal regardless of oxidative stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1691/7728162?rss=1","date":1722902400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ascorbate (Asc) is a major plant metabolite that plays crucial roles in various processes, from reactive oxygen scavenging to epigenetic regulation. However, to what extent and how Asc modulates metabolism is largely unknown. We investigated the consequences of chloroplastic and total cellular Asc deficiencies by studying chloroplastic Asc transporter mutant lines lacking PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 4; 4 and the Asc-deficient <span>vtc2-4</span> mutant of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Under regular growth conditions, both Asc deficiencies caused minor alterations in photosynthesis, with no apparent signs of oxidative damage. In contrast, metabolomics analysis revealed global and largely overlapping alterations in the metabolome profiles of both Asc-deficient mutants, suggesting that chloroplastic Asc modulates plant metabolism. We observed significant alterations in amino acid metabolism, particularly in arginine metabolism, activation of nucleotide salvage pathways, and changes in secondary metabolism. In addition, proteome-wide analysis of thermostability revealed that Asc may interact with enzymes involved in arginine metabolism, the Calvinâ€“Benson cycle, and several photosynthetic electron transport components. Overall, our results suggest that, independent of oxidative stress, chloroplastic Asc modulates the activity of diverse metabolic pathways in vascular plants and may act as an internal metabolite signal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0382d42669c12669e2427f181dac5c06699200960d9023e161e72522ee634777","category":"Environment"}
