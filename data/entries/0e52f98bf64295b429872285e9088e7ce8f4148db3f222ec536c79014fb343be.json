{"title":"COVID-19 Disease during Pregnancy. Gestational Duration and Fetal Weight: Two Understudied Adverse Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1612/v1","date":1719211409000,"content":"Abstract: (1) Background: to find out how COVID-19 infection during pregnancy affects the outcome of the pregnancy; (2) Methods: 166 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women formed the study group. 128 SARS-CoV-2-negative pregnant women formed the control group. Anatomopathological study of the placenta was performed in all cases; (3) Results: Placental insufficiency appeared in 38 patients (22.9%) of the study group and in 17 patients (13.2%) in the control group (p=0.016). Villitis appeared in 50 patients (30.1%) of the study group and in 16 (12.6%) in the control group (p=0.000). 166 COVID-19 positive patients were further subdivided, into those with anatomopathological affection of the placenta, and those without. When gestational age between patients with placental insufficiency and those without it are compared, a difference of 4.38 days is obtained (p=0.0393). If we compare neonatal weight between patients with placental insufficiency and those without it, a difference of 406.4 grams is obtained (p=0.0000). When gestational age between patients with villitis and those with-out it are compared, a difference of 3.2 days is found (p=0.0919). When neonatal weight between patients with villitis and those without it are compared, a difference of 242.2 grams is obtained (p=0.0018). (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 infection during pregnancy may produce lower fetal weight and shorter gestational length.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e52f98bf64295b429872285e9088e7ce8f4148db3f222ec536c79014fb343be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
