{"title":"Iron Nanoparticle Filter for Remediation of Groundwater Contaminated by Geogenic Arsenic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0387/v1","date":1715077355000,"content":"Arsenic is naturally present in many geological formations around the world and is a major source of groundwater contamination. Bolivia is not exempt from this problem. Physical-chemical studies of water quality in deep and shallow wells have determined the presence of arsenic in some areas of the Bolivian Altiplano, valleys, and plains. In the Lake Poopó basin, water from shallow wells (up to 30 m) has arsenic concentrations that exceed the Bolivian drinking water standard and the WHO recommendation of 10 μg-As/l by up to 25 times. In peri-urban areas of Cochabamba, the arsenic content in groundwater is up to 113 μg-As/l. chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with neurological and dermatological problems and carcinogenic effects. To date, no measures have been taken to mitigate the arsenic problem for the rural population, who often rely on arsenic-contaminated water as their only source of drinking water. This contamination represents a serious threat to the health and economic well-being of the inhabitants and ecosystem in these areas. In this work, for arsenic removal, iron and iron oxide nanoparticles obtained from recycling metal chips by top-down and bottom-up technology have been used for arsenic adsorption in an experimental filter combined with other artisanal filtering materials in the form of layers. The results have shown that water contaminated with arsenic after passing through the filter reduces the concentration of total arsenic filtered from 83, 52 ppb to less than 5 ppb, less than the Bolivian standard 512 of 10 ppb for drinking water.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5430adef236d3e60616b69c1855aa8da59e95698b397bdd5f97d5c28bc29b3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
