{"title":"Influence of peer discussions on trust in recommendations for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311109","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Rune Nathaniel Philemon, Innocent B. Mboya, Blandina T. Mmbaga, John Bartlett, Sia E. Msuya</p>\r\nBackground <p>Mothers attending prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV clinics seem to lack knowledge on many aspects of PMTCT, among which is breastfeeding. Breastfeeding recommendations in PMTCT have changed several times over the years leaving some confused and doubtful of what is currently recommended. One method shown to help improve their knowledge and acceptance of PMTCT recommendations is the use of peer educators. We sought to determine if mothers engage in discussions with other mothers during clinics and how these engagements influence trust in PMTCT recommendations.</p> Methods <p>We interviewed 524 mothers with children under two years enrolled in PMTCT clinics in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We selected 5 clinics with the highest numbers of PMTCT enrolment from each district in the region. In each clinic, over a one-month period, we recruited all mothers attending the PMTCT clinic. We collected information on their engagement in discussions regarding PMTCT during clinics and how they perceived the information from their peers in relation to that from healthcare providers.</p> Results <p>Fifty-five percent of the mothers reported engaging in peer discussions. Of the 90 (17%) mothers who reported noticing a change in PMTCT recommendations, 33 (36.7%) reported trusting previous recommendations more. A greater proportion (52.9%) of mothers who engaged in peer discussions reported trusting the information from peers more than that from healthcare workers.</p> Conclusions <p>Peers have a great influence on mothers, which is concerning when their knowledge shared is outdated. Harnessing their influence and training them on current recommendations might be key to improving adherence to PMTCT recommendations.</p>","author":"Rune Nathaniel Philemon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"faf122c61a5eb1a65e5c3b225fd910e7c6e4d935245c2d7a89dcc21239f778c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
