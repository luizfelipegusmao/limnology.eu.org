{"title":"Nanosecond‐pulsed plasma protects against bacterial fruit blotch and promotes melon seedling growth","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13623?af=R","date":1717422932000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB), known as the ‘cancer’ of cucurbits, is a seed-borne disease of melons caused by <i>Acidovorax citrulli</i>. Traditional chemical treatments for BFB are ineffective and adversely affect the environment. Using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) nanosecond-pulsed plasma technology, melon seeds were treated to promote germination and growth and to control BFB.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Based on the evaluation parameters of seed germination, seedling growth, leaf yellowing and bacterial infection after seed plasma treatments, 9 min at 20 kV was selected as the optimal plasma discharge parameter. In this study, seedling growth was significantly improved after treating melon seeds carrying <i>A. citrulli</i> using this discharge parameter. The number of first true leaves measured on the eighth day was 2.3 times higher and the disease index was reduced by 60.5% compared to the control group. Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared measurements show that plasma treatments penetrate the seed coat and denature polysaccharides and proteins in the seed kernel, affecting their growth and sterilization properties.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Pre-sowing treatment of melon seeds carrying <i>A. citrulli</i> using nanosecond-pulsed plasma technology can effectively control seedling BFB disease and promote melon seedling growth by optimizing DBD parameters. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yi‐Xi Guo, \nTing Fan, \nXiao‐Qin Liu, \nMan‐Jie Chen, \nNa‐Na Zhang, \nYu‐He Chen, \nXiao‐Dong Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e960c7d5a1f26270075815be4246e1e5a7fafce6777c3a84f218d5069c0b3f91","category":"Environment"}
