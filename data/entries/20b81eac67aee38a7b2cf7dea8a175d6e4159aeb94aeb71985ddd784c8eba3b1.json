{"title":"Suppression of long noncoding RNA SNHG6 alleviates cigarette smoke‐induced lung inflammation by modulating NF‐κB signaling","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24132?af=R","date":1713250800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread inflammatory disease with a high mortality rate. Long noncoding RNAs play important roles in pulmonary diseases and are potential targets for inflammation intervention.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The expression of small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) in mouse lung epithelial cell line MLE12 with or without cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatment was first detected using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. ELISA was used to evaluate the release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). The binding site of miR-182-5p with SNHG6 was predicted by using miRanda, which was verified by double luciferase reporter assay.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Here, we revealed that SNHG6 was upregulated in CS-exposed MLE12 alveolar epithelial cells and lungs from COPD-model mice. SNHG6 silencing weakened CS-induced inflammation in MLE12 cells and mouse lungs. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SNHG6 could upregulate IκBα kinase through sponging the microRNA miR-182-5p, followed by activated NF-κB signaling. The suppressive effects of SNHG6 silencing on CS-induced inflammation were blocked by an miR-182-5p inhibitor.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall, our findings suggested that SNHG6 regulates CS-induced inflammation in COPD by activating NF-κB signaling, thereby offering a novel potential target for COPD treatment.</p>","author":"Junxia Yang, \nYaping Yuan, \nLinxuan Wang, \nGuoping Deng, \nJiaru Huang, \nYuan Liu, \nWenchao Gu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"20b81eac67aee38a7b2cf7dea8a175d6e4159aeb94aeb71985ddd784c8eba3b1","category":"Environment"}
