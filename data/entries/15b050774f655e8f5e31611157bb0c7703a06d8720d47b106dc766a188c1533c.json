{"title":"Loop-Terminated Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Integrated with Functional Polymer for CO2 Gas Sensing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1850/v1","date":1716890333000,"content":"In this work, a numerical study on the loop-terminated Mach-Zehnder interferometer (LT-MZI) structure for CO2 gas sensing application is carried out via the finite element method. The sensing arm is covered with a polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) polymer which is highly receptive to CO2 gas. The refractive index of the host material decreases due to the absorption of the CO2 gas resulting in a shift in the interference pattern of the LT-MZI structure. As a result, a redshift in the wavelength is observed in the transmission spectrum of the device. The sensitivity of the device is estimated at 7.63 pm/ppm, 34.46 pm/ppm and 74.78 pm/ppm for the sensing arm length of 5 µm, 10 µm, and 15 µm, respectively. The sensitivity can be further enhanced, however at the cost of the bigger footprint of the device. Utilizing the innovative sensor design, a comprehensive range of CO2 gas concentrations spanning from 0 to 524 ppm is successfully detected. This compact and highly sensitive device serves as a vital tool for monitoring indoor CO2 levels, fostering a healthier breathing environment for all occupants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15b050774f655e8f5e31611157bb0c7703a06d8720d47b106dc766a188c1533c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
