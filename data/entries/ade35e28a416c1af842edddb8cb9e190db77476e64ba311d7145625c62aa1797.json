{"title":"Thirsty nation: An investigation into water scarcity and public conservation behaviour in Pakistan","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12930?af=R","date":1723514432000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Pakistan is on the brink of becoming a water-scarce country as a result of a peak in population and rapid urbanization. This research investigates the awareness of water scarcity amongst the general public in Pakistan and their behaviour and attitude towards water conservation practices at the household level. The study incorporated the theory of planned behaviour to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon. Households were surveyed in Islamabad Capital City using a quantitative research approach. Descriptive analysis and Fischer's exact test were followed to measure the variables. Results demonstrated a significant awareness regarding water scarcity amongst the residents which influenced positive behaviour and attitudes towards water conservation in the households. Notably, the <i>p</i>-value for water consumption patterns was found to be highly significant at 0.000 for activities such as laundry, gardening and car washing and less significant at 0.003 for bathing and 0.002 for housecleaning. It is concluded that water use is conditioned by dwelling characteristics and the types of devices employed in the houses. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for developing targeted interventions that resonate with diverse populations worldwide.</p>","author":"Aimen Zulqarnain, \nMuhammad Ammad Khan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"ade35e28a416c1af842edddb8cb9e190db77476e64ba311d7145625c62aa1797","category":"Environment"}
