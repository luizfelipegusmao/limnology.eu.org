{"title":"Proteomics analysis of duck lung tissues in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0768/v1","date":1712824606000,"content":"The domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) are resistant to most of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infections. In this study, we characterized the lung proteome and phosphoproteome of ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 virus (A/duck/India/02CA10/2011/Agartala) at 12 hr, 48 hr and 5 days post infection condition. Total 2082 proteins were differentially expressed and 320 phosphorylation sites mapping to 199 phosphopeptides corresponding to 129 proteins were identified. Functional annotation of proteome data analysis reveals activation of RIG-I-like receptor and Jak-STAT signaling pathways, that lead to induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. The pathway analysis of phosphoproteome datasets also confirms the activation of RIG I, Jak-STAT signaling, NF-kappa B signaling and MAPK signaling pathways in the lung tissues. The induction of ISGs proteins (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B, STAT6, IFIT5 and PKR) establishes protective antiviral immune response in duck lung tissue. Further, the protein-protein interaction network analysis identified proteins like AKT1, STAT3, JAK2, RAC1, STAT1, PTPN11, RPS27A, NFKB1 and MAPK1 as main hub proteins that might play important roles in disease progression in ducks. Together, functional annotation of proteome and phosphoproteome datasets reveals the molecular basis of the disease progression and disease resistance mechanism in ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 virus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5922cd7a0932f0d2a9916edb7050d7a6e5a940a17c8940cb4b516df47c846dd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
