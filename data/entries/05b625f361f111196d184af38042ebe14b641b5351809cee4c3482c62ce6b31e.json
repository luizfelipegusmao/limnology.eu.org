{"title":"Optimizing Traffic Flow Through Congestion Management at Peshawar Toll Plaza: A Data-Driven Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1263/v1","date":1718873177000,"content":"Toll plaza optimization is essential for improving traffic flow and easing congestion on road networks. This study aims to suggest and assess potential optimization solutions for the Peshawar toll plaza, considering variables like traffic volume, toll-collecting effectiveness, and customer facilitation. Different resources are used for data collection, like the National Highway Authority of Pakistan. Physical data is collected from the established Toll Plaza of Peshawar, along with the development of each line. The goal of this study is to suggest and assess potential optimization solutions for the Peshawar toll plaza, considering variables like traffic volume, toll-collecting effectiveness, and customer happiness.  The analysis of present traffic patterns, the detection of bottlenecks, and the creation of plans to ease congestion and enhance overall traffic flow are all part of the optimization process. The approaches used in this study include data analysis, simulation, and traffic modeling. PTV VISSIM is software for transportation planning, design, and analysis. The simulations consider various conditions, such as variable traffic volumes, toll collection methods, and lane configurations. When comparing the different optimization strategies, performance indicators like trip time, latency, and queue length are utilized to determine which approach is practical. Waiting time Vs. Existing each lane, etc, is explained. In the end, comparing queue lengths and throughput across different lane scenarios shows that maximizing throughput with existing lanes yields up to 45% improvement with E-tag lanes, 40% with existing E-tag lanes, 38% with E-tag plus additional toll and cash lanes, 32% with three cash lanes, and 28% with two E-tag lanes. Failure to regularly monitor and adjust the existing lane pattern scenario based on traffic patterns can lead to queues being 20% longer. Without proactive evaluation and optimization, there is a potential 63% opportunity for queue length improvement","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05b625f361f111196d184af38042ebe14b641b5351809cee4c3482c62ce6b31e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
