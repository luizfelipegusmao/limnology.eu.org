{"title":"Impacts of Climate Change on agriculture in Angola: analysis of agroclimatic and bioclimatic indicators","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0723/v1","date":1710250579000,"content":"Angola is vulnerable to climate change, as most of its agriculture is rain-fed and repre-sents the backbone of the people of the southern region of the country, and many peo-pleâ€™s livelihoods depend on it. All crops can suffer from the impacts of climate change, which can lead to challenges in agricultural production and food security in different regions of the world. The work consisted of a systematic review of the impacts of climate change on agriculture in Angola, particularly in the southern region. To achieve this objective the PRISMA2020 methodology was used, using the flowcharts for the selection of studies evaluated from the databases that are: Scopus and Web Sci-ence, resulting in 431 documents published between 1996 and 2023, and of these only 63 were included in the systematic review, with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research on the short and long-term effects of climate change impacts in agriculture in Angola and in particular the southern region is scarce and insufficient. Temperatures are pre-dicted to rise and precipitation generally decreases over time (approximately -2% by 2100), with the southern region experiencing a stronger drop in precipitation. Agri-culture in Angola will be hit hard and some models show that agricultural productiv-ity will be up to 7% lower by 2050 owing to climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f14abd455cc60f968aac073b95f0ff0797c28a1f710bb4d5aab2575efbe0d1fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
