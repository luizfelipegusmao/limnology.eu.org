{"title":"Mixed Matrix Organo-Silica-Hydrotalcite Membrane for CO2 Separation Part 2: Permeation and Selectivity Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0360/v1","date":1717753600000,"content":"This study introduces an innovative approach to designing membranes capable of separating CO2 from industrial gas streams at higher temperatures. The novel membrane design seeks to leverage the well-researched high-temperature CO2 adsorbent, hydrotalcite, by transforming it into a membrane. This is achieved by combining it with an amorphous organo-silica-based matrix, extending the polymer-based Mixed Matrix Membrane concept to inorganic compounds. Following the membrane material preparation and investigation of the individual membrane in Part 1 of this study, we examine its permeation and selectivity here. The pure 200 nm thick hydrotalcite membrane exhibits Knudsen behavior due to large intercrystalline pores. In contrast, the organo-silica membrane demonstrates a permselectivity of 13.5 and permeance for CO2 of 1.3 107 mol m2 s1 Pa1 at 25°C, at 150°C the good separation behavior is reduced. Combining both components results in a hybrid microstructure, featuring selective surface diffusion in the microporous regions and unselective Knudsen diffusion in the mesoporous regions. Further attempts to bridge both components to form a purely microporous microstructure are outlined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f81b40cd3d1d982b736363d26ec943febb534efb1a6120c26a848263f345ea97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
