{"title":"The effect of service outsourcing on labor income share: Measuring labor income share from the global value chains perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309656","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Qi Ye, Jie Yan</p>\r\n\r\nInspired by the positive impact of service outsourcing in Chery and other enterprises on human resources, this paper explores the impact of service outsourcing on labor income share. This paper introduces a framework to analyze how value added is distributed between capital and labor along the mix of inputs from different countries and sectors participating in global value chains and examines the effect of service outsourcing on the labor share income. Using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and OECD Inter-Country Input-Output (OECD- ICIO) table, this paper utilizes the WWZ decomposition method of global value chains (GVCs) to quantify labor share income. The results show that: (1) service outsourcing significantly contributes to the increase in labor share income; (2) Offshore outsourcing had a statistically stronger effect on labor share income after the financial crisis, both compared to the past and to onshore outsourcing; (3) Offshore outsourcing has a higher coefficient in countries with low technology. For ease of comparison, only onshore outsourcing shows a statistically significant difference among various service types; (4) The analysis using Chinese data reveals that the coefficient of offshore outsourcing is negative and statistically significant, indicating that industries with higher levels of service outsourcing have a lower labor share income.","author":"Qi Ye","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"45a5eaea1e2fe40198c78badcb491a5a09fc5e7fad78e449887e912e8471358c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
