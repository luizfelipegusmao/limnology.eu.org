{"title":"The Role of Polysaccharide Polymers in the Regulation of Angiogenesis and Atherogenic Inflammation in the Wall of Arterial Vessels. Analytical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0277/v1","date":1725375030000,"content":"Damage to peripheral arteries by the atherosclerotic process accounts for about 3% of the world's population, which puts this problem in the category of major social problems. Modified lipoproteins and cholesterol crystals are known to accumulate in the arterial intima and cause the formation of proatherogenic macrophages, foam cells, and inflammation. Defective efferocytosis of apoptotic foam cells leads to the formation of a necrotic core, a sign of failure to resolve inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is mediated by specialized pro-resorption lipid mediators, proteins and signaling gases. Improving the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors contributes to the reverse development of local atherogenesis. Active direct intervention in the reconstruction of the adventitial layer of the arterial wall using cholesterol-affinity polysaccharide hydrogels containing a cocktail of growth factors creates conditions for the formation of additional extracellular matrix and reversal of cholesterol mass from the subintimal zone. Creating concentration and electrostatic gradients in the adventitia zone using a hydrogel may be one of the effective ways to degrade early soft atherogenic plaques and locally restore the damaged structure of the vessel wall. Growing scientific interest in the previously insufficiently studied adventitia indicates its important role in angionesis and atherogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7cf3f8456486e7234549b715b5433c0fc4d6692cc3e5f75c88b46677ff382890","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
