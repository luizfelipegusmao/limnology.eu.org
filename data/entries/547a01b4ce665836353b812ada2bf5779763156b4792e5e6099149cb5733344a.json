{"title":"Functional Effects of Hydrolyzable Tannins on the Growth, Health Status, and Hepatopancreas Histology of Pacific White Shrimp Penaeus vannamei Reared under Commercial Pond Conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6644113?af=R","date":1698044400000,"content":"<p>In the present study, the functional effects of hydrolyzable tannins (HT) extracted from the sweet chestnut tree <i>Castanea sativa</i> were evaluated either by directly incorporating them into the diet or by using a top-dressing application on the growth, body composition, total hemocyte counts, lysozyme activity, and histomorphological condition of the hepatopancreas of Pacific white shrimp <i>Penaeus vannamei</i>. Shrimp was confined in hapa nets installed within commercial outdoor ponds for 90 days. Eight experimental diets included a basal formulated diet (BD) with varying inclusion levels of HT (BD-0%, BD-0.1%, BD-0.2%, and BD-0.3%), a low fish meal (FM) diet with reduction on the inclusion level of FM from 10% to 7.5% and labeled as LFM 0.3% HT, a top-dressing HT application (TC) on basal diet (BDTD-0.4% HT), and a commercial diet (CDTD-0% HT and CDTD-0.4% HT). The final body weight (FBW), percentage weight gain (PWG), thermal growth coefficient (TGC), average daily growth (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly better in the group of shrimp fed with BD-0.3% HT compared to BD-0% HT. The administration of CD-0.4% HT was able to enhance the growth performance of shrimp compared to BD-0% HT and CD without HT. Higher protein and fat contents were found in the body of shrimp fed with graded levels of HT compared to shrimp fed with BD or CD without HT. Numerically, the direct inclusion and top-dressing process of HT increased the total hemocyte count and lysozyme activity in shrimp. Both BDTD-0.4% HT and CDTD-0.4% HT were also able to support a better hepatopancreatic condition with reference to histomorphology and integrity. These results indicated that BD-0.3% HT inclusion could significantly improve the growth performance and prevent the alteration in health and histomorphological condition of the hepatopancreas of shrimp <i>P. vannamei</i> cultured in hapa nets under commercial farm conditions, but also 0.4% HT could be used as a supplementation dosage for the top-dressing process in diets.</p>","author":"Romi Novriadi, \nOtie Dylan Soebhakti Hasan, \nKhanh Nguyen, \nSimon Davies, \nZahid Gozali Panjaitan, \nSinar Pagi Sektiana, \nGiridhar Rahul Gaddipati, \nClara Trull√†s, \nMahmoud Dawood","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"547a01b4ce665836353b812ada2bf5779763156b4792e5e6099149cb5733344a","category":"Environment"}
