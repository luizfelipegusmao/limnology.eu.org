{"title":"Case Report of 2 Independent Moroccan Families with Syndromic Epidermodysplasia verruciformis and STK4 Deficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1906/v1","date":1721802177000,"content":"Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare genodermatosis caused by Î²-human papillomaviruses (HPV) in immunodeficient patients. EV is characterized by flat warts and pityriasis-like lesions and might be isolated or syndromic, associated with some other infectious manifestations. We report here three patients from 2 independent families with syndromic EV for 2 of them. By whole exome sequencing, we found that patients carry new homozygous variants in STK4, both leading to a premature stop codon. STK4 deficiency causes a combined immunodeficiency characterized by a broad infectious susceptibility to bacteria, viruses and fungi. Auto-immune manifestations were also reported. Deep immunophenotyping revealed multiple cytopenia in the three affected patients, in particular deep CD4+ T cells deficiency. We report here the fourth and the fifth cases of syndromic EV due to STK4 deficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a524e7ef318f2e8980ece62095235dd093b99c3cd4491442eabcdce86732306c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
