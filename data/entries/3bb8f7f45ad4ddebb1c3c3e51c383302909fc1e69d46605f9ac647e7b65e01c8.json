{"title":"Relationship Between Condylar and Ramal Asymmetries and ABO and RH Blood Groups: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1411/v1","date":1726657414000,"content":"Background:The association between ABO and Rh blood groups and diseases is an intriguing topic that continues to be studied. However, how mandibular symmetry may vary by blood group has not been investigated. This study explored the relationship between these blood groups and mandibular condyle and ramal asymmetries in the Turkish adult population. \nMethods:The study included 149 adult patients (67 males and 82 females) without systemic diseases or temporomandibular disorder complaints. Asymmetry was assessed in panoramic radiographic images using a formula developed in a previous study. The chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze differences among ABO groups while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for Rh groups. \nResults:There were no statistically significant differences among the ABO blood groups, nor the Rh groups, in terms of sex, Rh factor, and age distribution. However, a comparison of the ABO and Rh blood groups revealed that condylar asymmetries were significantly more common in the AB group. \nConclusions:These results suggest that mandibular asymmetry may be associated with the ABO blood group. These findings may guide future research to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between mandibular asymmetry and blood groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bb8f7f45ad4ddebb1c3c3e51c383302909fc1e69d46605f9ac647e7b65e01c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
