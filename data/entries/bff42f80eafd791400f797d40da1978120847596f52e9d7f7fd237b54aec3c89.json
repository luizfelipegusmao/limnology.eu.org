{"title":"The roles of epigenetic regulators in plant regeneration: Exploring patterns amidst complex conditions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2022/7593485?rss=1","date":1706572800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants possess remarkable capability to regenerate upon tissue damage or optimal environmental stimuli. This ability not only serves as a crucial strategy for immobile plants to survive through harsh environments, but also made numerous modern plant improvements techniques possible. At the cellular level, this biological process involves dynamic changes in gene expression that redirect cell fate transitions. It is increasingly recognized that chromatin epigenetic modifications, both activating and repressive, intricately interact to regulate this process. Moreover, the outcomes of epigenetic regulation on regeneration are influenced by factors such as the differences in regenerative plant species and donor tissue types, as well as the concentration and timing of hormone treatments. In this review, we focus on several well-characterized epigenetic modifications and their regulatory roles in the expression of widely studied morphogenic regulators, aiming to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications govern plant regeneration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bff42f80eafd791400f797d40da1978120847596f52e9d7f7fd237b54aec3c89","category":"Environment"}
