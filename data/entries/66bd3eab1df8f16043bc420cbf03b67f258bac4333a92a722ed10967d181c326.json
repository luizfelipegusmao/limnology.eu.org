{"title":"OsRPT5A: A Key Regulator of Enhanced Immune Responses in Rice Through Loss-of-Function Mutation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1962/v1","date":1714458137000,"content":"Our study explores the genetic mechanisms underlying the spotted leaf phenotype in rice, focusing on the rpt5a mutant characterized by persistent reddish-brown leaf spots from seedling stage to maturity, leading to extensive leaf necrosis. Through map-based cloning, we localized the responsible locus to a 330Kb region on chromosome 2 and identified LOC_Os02g56000 (named OsRPT5A) as the causative gene. A point mutation in OsRPT5A, substituting valine for glutamic acid, was identified as the critical factor for the phenotype. Functional complementation and generation of knockout lines in the IR64 background confirmed the central role of OsRPT5A in controlling this trait. Our study also revealed that OsRPT5A is constitutively expressed across various tissues, with its subcellular localization unaffected by mutations. Notably, we observed an abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rpt5a mutants, suggesting a disruption in the ROS system. Complementation studies indicated OsRPT5A's involvement in ROS homeostasis and catalase activity regulation. Moreover, the rpt5a mutant exhibited enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), highlighting OsRPT5A's role in rice's pathogen resistance mechanisms. These findings elucidate the genetic basis of the spotted leaf phenotype and emphasize the intricate interplay between plant defense responses and developmental pathways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66bd3eab1df8f16043bc420cbf03b67f258bac4333a92a722ed10967d181c326","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
