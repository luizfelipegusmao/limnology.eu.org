{"title":"Innovationology: A Transdisciplinary Science for Transformative Innovation and Sustainable Global Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1064/v1","date":1726213609000,"content":"As a pioneering transdisciplinary field, innovationology transcends the traditional boundaries of academic disciplines and development practices to address persistent global challenges. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of innovationology, delving deep into its philosophical foundations, ontological commitments, and ethical imperatives. By unpacking the core tenets of this innovative approach, the paper positions it as a robust and holistic science capable of catalyzing transformative innovation and sustainable development worldwide. Innovationology represents a paradigm shift that moves beyond conventional innovation and development theories, embracing a systems-oriented, community-centric, and decolonial praxis. Drawing on a synthesis of theoretical perspectives and empirical insights, the article examines innovationology's ontological commitment to marginalized communities as active agents of change, its epistemological grounding in pluralistic knowledge systems, and its ethical imperatives of social justice, environmental sustainability, and inclusive innovation. This in-depth analysis strengthens the conceptual and theoretical foundations of innovationology, providing critical guidance for its practical implementation and continued refinement as a cutting-edge transdisciplinary science for global transformation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a50b3641f5e1ed7476970a45cb7e495ec9af1016949dcc11fa38e0a45713505c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
