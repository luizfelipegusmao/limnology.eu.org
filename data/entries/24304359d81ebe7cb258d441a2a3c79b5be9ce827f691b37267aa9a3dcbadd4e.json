{"title":"Silver Nanoparticles Biosynthesized Using Cashew Nutshell Liquid (CNSL): Characterization and Methylene Blue Degradation Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1220/v1","date":1718701256000,"content":"In this work, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized from cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) by varying the concentration of silver ions and pH of the CNSL extract. The synthesized AgNPs were further characterized to study their surface, structural, and morphological proper-ties, and tested for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. The results of this study showed that depending on the conditions, particles of various sizes, ranging from 1 to 60 nm, and different degrees of stabilization and agglomeration were produced. The concentration of silver ions equal to 3 mM and the pH of the solution of ~ 4.5 (AgNP3) resulted in the most efficient biosynthesis, where particles appeared to be highly stabilized and homogeneously distributed on the surface, exhibiting a small average particle size and a narrow particle size distribution (6.7 Â± 6.5 nm). Such particles further showed the highest degradation of MB, where up to 80 % degradation rates were recorded within the first 20 min. Higher concentrations of silver ions and higher pH of the extract resulted in substantial particle agglomeration and unstable synthesis, respectively, which further negatively affected the ability of particles to degrade MB. Finally, visible light showed no significant effect on the degradation of MB by AgNPs with the average degradation rates found to be about the same as under the dark conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24304359d81ebe7cb258d441a2a3c79b5be9ce827f691b37267aa9a3dcbadd4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
