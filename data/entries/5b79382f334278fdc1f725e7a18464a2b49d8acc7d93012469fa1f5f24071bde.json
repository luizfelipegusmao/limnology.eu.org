{"title":"Sinapic acid protects against lead acetate‐induced lung toxicity by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress damage","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24255?af=R","date":1718077862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lead acetate (PbAc) is a compound that produces toxicity in many tissues after exposure. Sinapic acid (SNP) possesses many biological and pharmacological properties. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of SNP on the toxicity of PbAc in lung tissue. PbAc was administered orally at 30 mg/kg and SNP at 5 or 10 mg/kg for 7 days. Biochemical, genetic, and histological methods were used to investigate inflammatory, apoptotic, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative stress damage levels in lung tissue. SNP administration induced PbAc-reduced antioxidant (GSH, SOD, CAT, and GPx) and expression of HO-1 in lung tissue. It also reduced MDA, induced by PbAc, and thus alleviated oxidative stress. SNP decreased the inflammatory markers NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels induced by PbAc in lung tissue and exhibited anti-inflammatory effect. PbAc increased apoptotic Bax, Apaf-1, and Caspase-3 mRNA transcription levels and decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in lung tissues. SNP decreased apoptotic damage by reversing this situation. On the other hand, SNP regulated these markers and brought them closer to the levels of the control group. PbAc caused prolonged ER stress by increasing the levels of ATF6, PERK, IRE1α, GRP78 and this activity was stopped and tended to retreat with SNP. After evaluating all the data, While PbAc caused toxic damage in lung tissue, SNP showed a protective effect by reducing this damage.</p>","author":"Nurhan Akaras, \nSefa Kucukler, \nCihan Gur, \nMustafa Ileriturk, \nFatih Mehmet Kandemir","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"5b79382f334278fdc1f725e7a18464a2b49d8acc7d93012469fa1f5f24071bde","category":"Environment"}
