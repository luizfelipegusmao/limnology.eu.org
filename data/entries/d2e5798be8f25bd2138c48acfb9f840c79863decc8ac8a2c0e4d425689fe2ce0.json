{"title":"A Small-Scale Object Detection Algorithm in Intelligent Transportation Scenarios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0224/v1","date":1725366485000,"content":"In response to the problem of poor detection ability of object detection models for small-scale targets in intelligent transportation scenarios, a fusion method is proposed to enhance the features of small-scale targets, starting from feature utilization and fusion methods. The algorithm is based on the YOLOv4 tiny framework and enhances the utilization of shallow and mid level features on the basis of FPN, improving the detection accuracy of small and medium-sized targets; In view of the problem that the background of the intelligent traffic scene image is cluttered and there is more redundant information, the CBAM attention module is used to improve the attention of the model to the traffic target; To address the problem of data imbalance and prior bounding box adaptation in custom traffic datasets that expand traffic images in COCO and VOC, we propose a Copy Paste method with improved generation method and a K-means algorithm with improved distance measurement to enhance the model's detection ability for corresponding categories. Comparative experiments were conducted on a customized 260 thousand traffic dataset containing public traffic images, and the results showed that compared to YOLOv4 tiny, the proposed algorithm improved mAP by 4.9% while still ensuring the real-time performance of the model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2e5798be8f25bd2138c48acfb9f840c79863decc8ac8a2c0e4d425689fe2ce0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
