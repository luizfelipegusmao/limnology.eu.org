{"title":"Mechanisms of Gut-Related Viral Persistence in Long Covid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2270/v1","date":1722234730000,"content":"Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19, PASC) is a consequence of infection by SARS-CoV-2 that continues to disrupt the well-being of millions of affected individuals for many months beyond their first infection. While the exact mechanisms underlying PASC remain to be defined, hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of Long COVID are varied and include (but are not limited to) dysregulated local or systemic inflammatory responses, autoimmune mechanisms, viral-induced hormonal imbalances and long-term persistence of virus and/or fragments of viral RNA or proteins. This review article is based on a comprehensive review of the wide range of symptoms most often observed in long COVID and an attempt to integrate that information into a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PASC. In particular, it is proposed that longterm dysregulation of the gut in response to viral persistence could lead to the myriad of symptoms observed in PASC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"338a93b7d659f389954b2211fb275a816494d9ebb705d5cd3aee49cf32199112","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
