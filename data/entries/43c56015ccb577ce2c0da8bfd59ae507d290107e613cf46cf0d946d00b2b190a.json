{"title":"Epigenetic Alterations of Cognition Functions in Parkinson&#039;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0981/v1","date":1718347169000,"content":"The field of epigenetics, which explores how heritable traits or stable alterations of cell functions occur without changes to the DNA sequence and how environmental factors affect gene expression, is rapidly advancing. Epigenetics plays a critical role in memory formation, learning, and cognitive functioning, effectively bridging genetics with environmental influence. Maternal behavior in rats, for instance, can modify the stress response of their offspring through epigenetic mechanisms such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Understanding neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) depends on comprehending the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic modifications, which alter proteins and DNA structure without changing the DNA sequence, can activate or suppress gene expression, assisting organisms in adapting to environmental changes. These modifications may influence genes involved in inflammation, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection, potentially contributing to cognitive deficits in PD patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), histone modifications, and DNA methylation are the epigenetic mechanisms that significantly influence cell differentiation and maintain normal cellular activity. Understanding the intricate molecular processes of epigenetics could lead to more targeted and effective therapies. Despite numerous findings on how epigenetics affects cognitive alterations in PD patients, only some studies coordinate and integrate these results. Here, we summarize recent findings on how epigenetic changes impact gene expression linked to cognitive impairments in PD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43c56015ccb577ce2c0da8bfd59ae507d290107e613cf46cf0d946d00b2b190a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
