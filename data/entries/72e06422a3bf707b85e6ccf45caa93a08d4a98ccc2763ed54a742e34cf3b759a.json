{"title":"Distribution of Natural Trace Elements in Drinking Water Sources of Hungary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2052/v1","date":1719905381000,"content":"Source water quality is a key determinant of drinking water quality. The recast European Union 2020/2184 drinking water directive (DWD) introduced the obligation for comprehensive risk assessment in drinking water supplies, including the water source and incorporated new elements of natural origin in the list of parameters to be monitored. The current study is the first comprehensive assessment of 15 natural elements (B, Ba, Be, Ca, Co, K, Li, Mg, Mo, Na, Se, Sr, Ti, U and V) in 1155 (82%) Hungarian drinking water sources, including surface water, bank filtered and groundwater sources. Parameters posing a risk to health (Se, V and U) were typically below the lower limit of quantification (LOQ), but higher concentrations (max. 7.0, 17 and 41 Âµg/L, respectively) may occur in confined locations, the latter exceeding the DWD parametric value in one water supply. Li in a small geographical area, Mg and Ca in the majority of the water supplies reached the concentration range assumed to be protective to health. Water sources were grouped in 6 clusters based on their element distribution, some of them also showing clear geographical patterns. Water types were not differentiated, with the exception of karstic waters (dominated by Ca and Mg). None of the investigated parameters are expected to be a source of public health concern.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72e06422a3bf707b85e6ccf45caa93a08d4a98ccc2763ed54a742e34cf3b759a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
