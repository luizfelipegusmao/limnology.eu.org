{"title":"The different association between fat mass distribution and intake of three major nutrients in pre- and postmenopausal women","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304098","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Qin Sun, Congrong Liu, Shuxin Li, Juanjuan Ren, Zhaoxia Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Obesity, characterized by excessive body fat accumulation, is associated with various chronic health conditions. Body fat plays a crucial role in health outcomes, and nutrient intake is a contributing factor. Menopause further influences body fat, but the precise relationships between nutrients and fat mass distribution in pre- and post-menopausal women are unclear.</p> Methods <p>Data from 4751 adult women aged ≥18 years old (3855 pre-menopausal, 896 post-menopausal) with completed information were obtained from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2018. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations between protein, carbohydrate, fat intake and total percent fat (TPF), android percent fat (APF), gynoid percent fat (GPF), android to gynoid ratio (A/G), subcutaneous adipose tissue mass (SAT), visceral adipose tissue mass (VAT). Subgroup analyses, stratified by menopausal status, were also conducted. Additionally, we employed smoothing curve fitting techniques to investigate potential non-linear relationships between fat mass distribution and nutrient intake.</p> Results <p>Compared with pre-menopausal women, post-menopausal women had higher body fat, BMI, and metabolic indicators but lower nutrient intake (All p&lt;0.05). In the overall analysis, we found significant correlations between nutrient intake and fat mass. Specifically, protein intake was negatively correlated with TPF (β = -0.017, 95% CI: -0.030, -0.005), APF (β = -0.028, 95% CI: -0.044, -0.012), GPF (β = -0.019, 95% CI: -0.030, -0.008), while fat intake showed positive correlations with these measures (SAT: β = 2.769, 95% CI: 0.860, 4.678). Carbohydrate intake exhibited mixed associations. Notably, body fat mass-nutrient intake correlations differed by menopausal status. Generally speaking, protein intake showed negative correlations with body fat distribution in pre-menopausal women but positive correlations in post-menopausal women. Carbohydrate intake revealed significant negative associations with abdominal and visceral fat in post-menopausal women, while fat intake was consistently positive across all fat distribution indices, especially impacting visceral fat in post-menopausal women.</p> Conclusion <p>Dietary intake plays a crucial role in body fat distribution, with menopausal status significantly influencing the impact of nutrients on specific fat distribution metrics. The study emphasizes the need for dietary guidelines to consider the nutritional needs and health challenges unique to women at different life stages, particularly concerning menopausal status, to effectively manage obesity.</p>","author":"Qin Sun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2bdd9d8132178823beec4c7da25d82e4df2e381aba9c8a21cd9286951553f487","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
