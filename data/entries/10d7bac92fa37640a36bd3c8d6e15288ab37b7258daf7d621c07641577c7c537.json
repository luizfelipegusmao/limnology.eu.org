This technology delivers images with zero dark-noise, improved linearity, and SNR limited only by ideal Poisson counting statistics [<a href=\"#ozae044.191-B1\">1</a>]. By combining such event-counting hardware with fast electrostatic dose-modulators (EDM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.191-B2\">2</a>], a real-time ‘<span>event responsive</span>’ imaging mode can be realised [<a href=\"#ozae044.191-B3\">3</a>].
