{"title":"Summary Tests of Introgression Are Highly Sensitive to Rate Variation Across Lineages","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/72/6/1357/7271365?rss=1","date":1694476800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The evolutionary implications and frequency of hybridization and introgression are increasingly being recognized across the tree of life. To detect hybridization from multi-locus and genome-wide sequence data, a popular class of methods are based on summary statistics from subsets of 3 or 4 taxa. However, these methods often carry the assumption of a constant substitution rate across lineages and genes, which is commonly violated in many groups. In this work, we quantify the effects of rate variation on the D test (also known as ABBA–BABA test), the D3 test, and HyDe. All 3 tests are used widely across a range of taxonomic groups, in part because they are very fast to compute. We consider rate variation across species lineages, across genes, their lineage-by-gene interaction, and rate variation across gene-tree edges. We simulated species networks according to a birth–death-hybridization process, so as to capture a range of realistic species phylogenies. For all 3 methods tested, we found a marked increase in the false discovery of reticulation (type-1 error rate) when there is rate variation across species lineages. The D3 test was the most sensitive, with around 80% type-1 error, such that D3 appears to more sensitive to a departure from the clock than to the presence of reticulation. For all 3 tests, the power to detect hybridization events decreased as the number of hybridization events increased, indicating that multiple hybridization events can obscure one another if they occur within a small subset of taxa. Our study highlights the need to consider rate variation when using site-based summary statistics, and points to the advantages of methods that do not require assumptions on evolutionary rates across lineages or across genes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"aff49c154d9274c63f19aa326ab1f5753b88839a422ba9129da3cb949860ed03","category":"Environment"}
