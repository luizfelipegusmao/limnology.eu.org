{"title":"COVID-19’s psychological toll on oral health: A cross-sectional study in Iranian adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307429","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Mahsa Karimi, Mohammad Reza Khami, Shabnam Varmazyari, Ahmad Reza Shamshiri, Mahmoud Hormozi, Nourhan M. Aly, Morẹ́nikẹ́ Oluwátóyìn Foláyan</p>\r\nBackground <p>The Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic increased global psychological distress, emotional distress, and sleep disturbances, all known risk factors for compromised oral health. Despite this, there is limited understanding of the impacts of these psychological factors on oral health in certain populations, including Iranians. Thus, the present study investigates the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, emotional distress, sleep pattern changes, tooth brushing frequency, and oral ulcer reports in a sample of Iranian adults during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.</p> Materials and methods <p>This cross-sectional, web-based study collected data from Iranian adults between July and September 2022 using respondent-driven sampling. The Mental Health and Wellness questionnaire was used to gather information on sociodemographic characteristics, emotional distress, sleep pattern changes, toothbrushing frequency, and oral ulcer reports. Simple and multiple logistic regression served for statistical analysis.</p> Results <p>Among the 240 participants, comprising 164 females and 76 males, with a mean age of 35.3 years (±13.3), 28 individuals (11.7%) reported reduced tooth brushing frequency, and 35 individuals (14.6%) reported oral ulcers. Male gender (OR = 2.75, p = 0.016) and sleep patterns changes (OR = 2.93, p = 0.01) increased the likelihood of reduced tooth brushing frequency. Additionally, being younger than 30 (OR = 2.87, p = 0.025) and fearing coronavirus transmission (OR = 3.42, p = 0.009) increased the odds of oral ulcers.</p> Conclusions <p>Male gender and sleep pattern changes were risk factors for reduced tooth brushing frequency among the present sample of Iranian adults during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Additionally, being under 30 and fearing coronavirus transmission were identified as risk factors for oral ulcers in this population. To preserve and promote adults’ oral health during public health crises, targeted educational initiatives, public health awareness campaigns, and integrated mental and oral healthcare approaches are encouraged.</p>","author":"Mahsa Karimi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"467843ae341cdf04155de66c9d0f98241f4a96a505063aadf9852813b35f9fce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
