Both electrodes' performance were compared by their capacity to generate active chlorine in a synthetic solution and organic matter mineralization of a sample with an average phenol (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O) concentration of 100 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. Before degradation experiments, surface analysis, and linear sweep voltammetry tests were performed. SnO<sub>2</sub>–RuO<sub>2</sub>–IrO<sub>2</sub>|Ti anode yielded higher active chlorine, reaching an average concentration of 340 mg L<sup>−1</sup> at 90 min of electrolysis and 25 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. On the other hand, IrO<sub>2</sub>–Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>|Ti anode only generated an average concentration of 200 mg L<sup>−1</sup> at 90 min and 40 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. Regarding the degradation experiments, SnO<sub>2</sub>–RuO<sub>2</sub>–IrO<sub>2</sub>|Ti anode showed the highest dissolved organic carbon removal, ranging from 26% to 40%. In addition, through a three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix fluorescence analysis, it was possible to elucidate the degradation of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O and some possible polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in the effluent. The results suggested that 65%–90% of the hydrocarbons and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O present in the effluent were degraded with the SnO<sub>2</sub>–RuO<sub>2</sub>–IrO<sub>2</sub>|Ti anode applying 25 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> within the first 30 min of electrolysis, reaching almost 99% degradation at 90 min. The EO process using SnO<sub>2</sub>–RuO<sub>2</sub>–IrO<sub>2</sub>|Ti can be an alternative for tertiary treatment of oil refinery wastewater for degradation and mineralization of the remaining organic matter of secondary effluents (biological processes) via active chlorine species.</p>","author":"José Treviño‐Reséndez, \nAlejandro Medel, \nJesús Cárdenas, \nYunny Meas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"5fcbf59ad73bc5274e0be9bbe3f50832340f4e04b7870cbbb5428bd20e453fa2","category":"Environment"}
