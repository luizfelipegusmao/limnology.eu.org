{"title":"Net Zero Agrivoltaic Arrays for Agrotunnel Vertical Growing Systems: Energy Analysis and System Sizing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1820/v1","date":1719405797000,"content":"To control the volatility and reduce the electricity costs for indoor farming, the agrivoltaics agrotunnel introduced here uses: 1) high insulation for a building dedicated to vertical growing, 2) high-efficiency LED lighting, 3) heat pumps (HPs), and 4), solar photovoltaics (PV) provide known electric costs for 25 years. In order to size the PV array, this study develops a thermal model for agrotunnel load calculations and validates it using the Hourly Analysis Program and measured data so the effect of plants’ evapotranspiration can be included. HPs are sized, plug loads (i.e., water pump energy needed to provide for the hybrid aeroponics/hydroponics system, DC power running the LEDs hung on grow walls, and dehumidifier assisting in moisture condensation in summer) are measured/modeled. Ultimately, all models are combined to establish an annual load profile for an agrotunnel that is then used to model the necessary PV to power the system throughout the year. The results find that agrivoltaics to power an agrotunnel range from 40 to 50kW and make up an areas from 3.2 to 10.48 m²/m² of an agrotunnel footprint. Net zero agrotunnels are technically viable although future work is needed to deeply explore the economics of localized vertical food growing systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2914e127c865da62ae679775c6a4126c86a501ad25255798d3e11b6e9e520065","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
