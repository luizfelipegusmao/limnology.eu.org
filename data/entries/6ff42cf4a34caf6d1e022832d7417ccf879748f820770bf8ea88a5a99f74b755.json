{"title":"Investigation Study of Impact-Absorbed Energy and Flexural Strength of Multi-layer Composite Materials","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-57054-4_31","date":1735689600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>To investigate and measure the energy absorption processes in prospective automobile applications of composite materials, test procedures for progressive crush testing on composite plate specimens were developed. Some liquid hardening materials for the recipe include Sikadur-52 LP epoxy. Three types of fabrics were used with different arrangements of layers: Kevlar with three layers of epoxy, carbon fiber with three layers of epoxy, and fiberglass with random glass in three layers with epoxy. Multi-layer composites offer several benefits over conventional laminated materials, including good resistance attributes and economical processing. Kevlar and carbon fibers can absorb more energy, thereby permitting a body to penetrate the object. A three-layer arrangement of carbon fiber, Kevlar, and fiberglass absorbs more energy in impact tests and exhibits high flexural strength. Arrange 5 represents the layer’s arrangement (GF/KF/CF), which absorbs more energy than other samples due to high impact strength (208.10 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>). Conversely, arrange 4 (CF, KF, GF) absorbs the least energy (75.35 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>). Additionally, the former exhibits high flexural strength (0.9 kN), while the latter has the lowest (0.42 kN). The current arrangements may be considered the best, especially when exposed to various loads in engineering applications.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"6ff42cf4a34caf6d1e022832d7417ccf879748f820770bf8ea88a5a99f74b755","category":"Environment"}
