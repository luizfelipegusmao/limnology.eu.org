{"title":"Anti-Proliferative and Cytoprotective Activity of Ethylenediurea Derivatives with Alkyl and Oxygen-containing Groups as Substituents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1732/v1","date":1716798462000,"content":"Natural cytokinins are a promising group of cytoprotective and anti-tumor agents. In this research, we synthesized a set of novel cytokinin analogs with alkyl substituents at various positions of the aromatic moiety, as well as with oxygen-containing groups, and tested their antiproliferative activity in MDA-MB-231, A-375, and U-87 MG cell lines, and cytoprotective properties in H2O2 and CoCl2 models. Two amino-linked compounds were anti-proliferative with the ability to act synergistically with doxorubicin, and two carbamate-based ones were cytoprotective. According to the molecular docking data, anti-proliferation was based on the A2AR and APRT inhibition and cytoprotection on the CDK2 inhibition. The obtained results are promising for the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f5161bb2e0736d567132b7ded76fae154fc3de770646b558ec8800518b918a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
