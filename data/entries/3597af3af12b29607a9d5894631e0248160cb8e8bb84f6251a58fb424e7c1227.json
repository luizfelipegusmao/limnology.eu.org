{"title":"Space Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202105.0197/v9","date":1711458725000,"content":"The author introduces a novel theoretical framework that suggests matter and energy are both converted from curved space. In Space Theory, gravitation is generated by the flow of space, instead of being transmitted by the graviton as in String Theory. This theory also suggests that Newton's gravitational constant, denoted as G, may not be truly constant but could vary over time. The equivalent equation of space is S=Ec2=mc4, and the gravitation of hollow sphere space is Sμν=4πGm=(4/3)π((r+a)3-r3). The Space Theory also predicts that the surface gravitational acceleration of the neutron star Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21) is approximately 8.21924883×106 m/s2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3597af3af12b29607a9d5894631e0248160cb8e8bb84f6251a58fb424e7c1227","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
