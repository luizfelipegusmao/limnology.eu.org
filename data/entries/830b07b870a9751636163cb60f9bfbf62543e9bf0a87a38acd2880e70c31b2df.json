{"title":"Human Papillomavirus Requires COPI Coat Complex for a Successful Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.1668/v2","date":1713865976000,"content":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) uses the cellular trafficking machinery to reach the cell nucleus and initiate a successful infection. The HPV capsid consists of two proteins: L1 (the major capsid protein) and L2 (minor capsid protein), and L2 is known to be responsible for trafficking the viral genome to the nucleus. From previous studies, we know that many cellular proteins interact with L2 and are involved in the trafficking process at different stages of the infectious entry process. To further investigate how HPV-16 achieves successful viral entry, we have performed a mass spectrometry analysis to identify novel interacting proteins that associate with incoming HPV-16 virions. We show that HPV-16 pseudovirions interact with a group of cellular cargo proteins (COPI), and here we confirm that this is mediated by the direct binding of L2, but not L1, to the COPB1 subunit. We also show that the ability of L2 to interact with COPB1 is conserved in both low- and high-risk HPV types. Furthermore, we also show that the interaction is essential for successful infection entry of multiple HPV types, thereby identifying a novel constituent of the infectious entry pathway of the HPV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"830b07b870a9751636163cb60f9bfbf62543e9bf0a87a38acd2880e70c31b2df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
