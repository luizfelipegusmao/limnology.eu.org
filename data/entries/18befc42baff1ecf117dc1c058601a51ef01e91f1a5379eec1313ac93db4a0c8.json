These files can be loaded into software wavetable synthesizers to create audible forms of data that can represent complex information. Some background about sonification will be discussed, and the simple method developed here will be applied to graphene optoelectronics. Some key illustrative examples will be used to demonstrate the method, including data sets from previous work on light emission from graphene field effect transistors. We use the sonification method to show how changes in observed phenomena (e.g., light emission intensity and spectral shape) result in changes of the resulting sound (such as the timbre). Demonstrations are included in video format to hear and illustrate the method and resulting effects.</p>","author":"Adam Johan Bergren, \nAngela Beltaos, \nAlexander van Dijk","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"18befc42baff1ecf117dc1c058601a51ef01e91f1a5379eec1313ac93db4a0c8","category":"Environment"}
