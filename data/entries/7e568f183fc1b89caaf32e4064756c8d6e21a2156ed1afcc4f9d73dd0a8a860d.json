To elucidate the mechanisms of catalytic reactions, we need to clarify the complex process of charge transfer. Also, the potentials inside and around the catalyst particles need to be measured. Electron holography is a microscopic technique that detects phase changes in electron waves passing through an electromagnetic field potential and that is expected to become an important tool for catalyst measurements. However, electron holography measurements of catalytic nanoparticles at atmospheric pressure or in liquids, close to the actual catalyst use environment, have not yet been achieved. Measurements with gases and liquids in transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), including the electron holography, require the use of an environmental cell. However, the electron beam must pass through the membrane of the environmental cell, which often adds non-negligible noise to the acquired image.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7e568f183fc1b89caaf32e4064756c8d6e21a2156ed1afcc4f9d73dd0a8a860d","category":"Environment"}
