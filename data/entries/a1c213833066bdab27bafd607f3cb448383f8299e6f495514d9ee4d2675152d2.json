{"title":"Tracing the fate of seabird‐derived nitrogen in a coral reef using nitrate and coral skeleton nitrogen isotopes","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12485?af=R","date":1708528481000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seabirds transfer nutrients from the ocean to their nesting island, potentially altering nitrogen (N) cycling within adjacent terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Yet, the processes involved in seabird-N transfer along the land–sea continuum remain elusive. Using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>18</sup>O measurements of groundwater nitrate, we demonstrate the role of brackish groundwater located within a coral island's landmass as a major reservoir of nitrate (at millimolar levels). Nearly all of the total dissolved seabird-derived N leaching into the groundwater (mostly ammonium and uric acid) is converted to nitrate by nitrification, as supported by the relatively low δ<sup>18</sup>O of the groundwater nitrate (3.97‰ ± 0.30‰). Comparison of nitrate δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>18</sup>O suggests that little denitrification takes place within the groundwater lens, implying that the high δ<sup>15</sup>N of groundwater nitrate (13.73‰ ± 0.05‰) derives from the high trophic position of seabirds and postdepositional processes that increase the δ<sup>15</sup>N of seabird excreta. Seawater and coral skeleton samples from a reef flat exposed to groundwater had higher δ<sup>15</sup>N values than at sites devoid of groundwater influence, indicating that the main source of N at the latter site was the Subtropical Upper Water, while the groundwater nitrate dominated the exposed reef flat N pool up to 200 m from shore. In addition, these results indicate that coral-bound δ<sup>15</sup>N can detect seabird-derived nitrate δ<sup>15</sup>N, raising opportunities to reconstruct historical seabird-N inputs to coral reefs in relation to climatic and other changes, such as the introduction of invasive species.</p>","author":"Noémie Choisnard, \nNicolas Noel Duprey, \nTanja Wald, \nMartin Thibault, \nFanny Houlbrèque, \nAlan D.
