{"title":"Polyethylene Terephthalate Waste Forms: Going beyond Flakes and Fibers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0990/v1","date":1715761195000,"content":"There are various approaches to managing polyethylene terephthalate waste, including methods for recycling PET. However, at present, only the cleanest wastes that can already be efficiently recycled using known methods are considered in the scientific literature. The study aims to look at other forms of polyethylene terephthalate waste that pose a challenge: low quality PET flakes, polyester tire cord, PET dust and prepolymer waste. The waste was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, viscosimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, laser diffraction and sieve analysis. The findings describe the composition and properties of various forms of polyethylene terephthalate waste. Low quality PET flake waste and polyethylene terephthalate dust have been shown to be suitable for all chemical recycling methods. When recycling waste polyester tire cord, it is difficult to completely separate the rubber, so its presence in the final product must be taken into account. The most promising way to process a prepolymer is its depolymerization by hydrolysis, alcoholysis or glycolysis to produce monomers for the synthesis of PET, similar in properties to the primary one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c7bcf95931e860dbe6c3a873bf5b7e5a2178bdf77ffae731a03cfaa622f901b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
