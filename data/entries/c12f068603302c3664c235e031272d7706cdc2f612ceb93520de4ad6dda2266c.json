{"title":"A Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis Based on MacLaurin Expansion and Hadamard Product of the Completed Zeta Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202108.0146/v9","date":1634213659000,"content":"The basic idea is to expand the completed zeta function $\\xi(s)$ in MacLaurin series (infinite polynomial), which can be further expressed as infinite product (Hadamard product) by conjugate complex roots. Finally, the functional equation $\\xi(s)=\\xi(1-s)$ leads to $(s-\\alpha_i)^2 = (1-s-\\alpha_i)^2, i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with solution $\\alpha_i= \\frac{1}{2}, i \\in \\mathbb{N}$, where $\\alpha_i$ are the real parts of the zeros of $\\xi(s)$, i.e., $s_i =\\alpha_i\\pm j\\beta_i, i\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is achieved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c12f068603302c3664c235e031272d7706cdc2f612ceb93520de4ad6dda2266c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
