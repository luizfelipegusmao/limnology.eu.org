{"title":"Study of Lactobacillus plantarum coated with Tremella polysaccharides to improve its intestinal adhesion","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13530?af=R","date":1714046028000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The adhesion of probiotics to the intestine is crucial for their probiotic function. In previous studies, <i>Tremella</i> polysaccharides (TPS) (with sodium casein) have shown the potential to encapsulate probiotics and protect them in a simulated gastrointestinal tract. This study explored the effect of TPS (with sodium casein) on the adhesion of probiotics.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p><i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> was coated with TPS and sodium casein in different proportions, and was freeze-dried. The rheological properties of the mixture of probiotics powder and mucin solution were determined by static and dynamic rheological analysis. Aqueous solutions of probiotic powder and mucin mixture exhibited pseudoplastic fluid rheological properties. The higher the proportion of TPS content, the higher the apparent viscosity and yield stress. The mixed bacterial powder and mucin fluid displayed thixotropy and was in accordance with the Herschel–Bulkley model. The TPS increased the bio-adhesive force of the probiotic powder and mucin. When using TPS as the only carbon source, the adhesion of <i>L. plantarum</i> to Caco-2 cells increased by 228% in comparison with glucose <i>in vitro</i>. Twelve adhesive proteins were also detected in the whole-cell proteome of <i>L. plantarum</i>. Among them, ten adhesive proteins occurred abundantly when grown with TPS as a carbon source.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Tremella</i> polysaccharides therefore possess probiotic properties and can promote the intestinal adhesion of <i>L. plantarum</i>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yeli Zhu, \nFuhao Tang, \nYihan Wang, \nBingbing Li, \nJianwen Teng, \nLi Huang, \nNing Xia","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a6315ece0524a28a87536c6bd85a6db78b996a6bb32ebba5c6dd98aebd1765df","category":"Environment"}
