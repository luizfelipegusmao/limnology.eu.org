{"title":"Reevaluating Evolutionary Paradigms: The Impact of Darwin's Competitive Vision and Humboldt's Holistic Approach on Modern Ecology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0573/v1","date":1728376966000,"content":"This article critically examines the contrasting perspectives of Charles Darwin and Alexander von Humboldt on evolution and the interconnectedness of nature, arguing that Darwin's emphasis on competition has contributed to contemporary ecological crises. While Darwin's theory of natural selection revolutionized biological sciences by focusing on individual competition and the \"survival of the fittest,\" it reflects the competitive and anthropocentric values of Victorian England. In contrast, Humboldt's holistic vision, articulated in his work Kosmos, emphasizes the intricate interdependencies within ecosystems, anticipating modern ecological principles. By exploring the cultural contexts that shaped their theories, this article contends that the widespread adoption of Darwin's competitive framework has fostered exploitative attitudes toward nature, legitimizing environmental degradation and contributing to the current ecological crisis. Embracing Humboldt's interconnected perspective is posited as essential for addressing ecological catastrophes by promoting sustainable practices and fostering a more harmonious relationship with the natural world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"930c19c4c7b7ea2fce12e1975e6eac985033a30e057bf93ad31c167b044fad25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
