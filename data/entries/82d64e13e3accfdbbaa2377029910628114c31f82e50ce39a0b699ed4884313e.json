Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that can insert in coding and regulatory regions, potentially altering gene function. Due to their disruptive effect on genome integrity, most TEs are kept silent. However, transposition events still occur and may increase the genetic load.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"82d64e13e3accfdbbaa2377029910628114c31f82e50ce39a0b699ed4884313e","category":"Environment"}
