{"title":"Whey Protein Sodium-Caseinate as a Deliverable Vector for Tea Catechins: In vitro Optimization of Its Bioaccessibility, Bioavailability, and Bioactivity Mode of Actions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1786/v1","date":1716823613000,"content":"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the principal catechin in green tea, exhibits diverse therapeutic properties. However, its clinical efficacy is hindered by poor stability and low bioavailability. This study investigated solid particle-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) emulsions stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas) as carriers to enhance the bioavailability and intestinal absorption of EGCG. Molecular docking revealed binding interactions between EGCG and these macromolecules. The emulsions exhibited high encapsulation efficiencies and augmented EGCG bioaccessibility by 64% compared to free EGCG in a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model. EGCG-loaded emulsions demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity towards Caco-2 cells and facilitated EGCG transport across the intestinal epithelial layer without compromising tight junction integrity. Notably, EGCG-loaded emulsions protected Caco-2 cells against oxidative stress by suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species generation. The results demonstrate the potential of WPI- and NaCas-stabilized S/O/W emulsions to enhance the bioavailability, intestinal absorption, and bioactivity of EGCG, expanding its applications in functional foods and nutraceuticals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afb2c64e07dd48b4e58a4ed69ebd689e5969edc94971960ee0ae4a747aec6236","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
