{"title":"From Polar Day to Polar Night: A Comprehensive Sun and Star Photometer Study of Trends in Arctic Aerosol Properties in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1966/v1","date":1721836275000,"content":"The origin and climate impact of Arctic aerosols, like the Arctic Haze, are not fully understood. Therefore, long-term aerosol observations in the Arctic are performed. In this study we present a homogenised data set from sun and star photometer operated in the European Arctic, in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, from 2004 – 2023. Due to polar day and polar night it is crucial to use observations of both instruments. Their data is evaluated in the same way and follows the cloud-screening procedure of AERONET. Additionally, an improved method for the calibration of the star photometer is presented. We found out, that winter months are generally more polluted and have larger particles than summer. While the monthly median Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) decreases in spring, the AOD increases significantly in autumn months. The Arctic Haze is not characterised by large particles and can not be distinguished from large aerosols in winter months. With autocorrelation analysis we found out, that AOD events usually occur with duration of several hours and are therefore caused by large-scale processes and may have a periodicity of several days. Local processes can be neglected in Ny-Ålesund but long-range transport plays a major role for the Arctic aerosol budget. We also compared AOD events with large-scale processes, like large-scale oscillation patterns, sea ice, weather conditions or wildfires on the Northern Hemisphere but did not find one single cause, which clearly determines the Arctic AOD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"809f85a4ce8c7d1f6cbea6a6d0176f7f05768fb710533dd5cecd07d3693d0153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
