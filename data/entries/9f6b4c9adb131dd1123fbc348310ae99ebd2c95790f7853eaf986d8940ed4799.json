{"title":"Dopamine and acetylcholine have distinct roles in delay- and effort-based decision-making in humans","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002714","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Mani Erfanian Abdoust, Monja Isabel Frob√∂se, Alfons Schnitzler, Elisabeth Schreivogel, Gerhard Jocham</p>\r\n\r\nIn everyday life, we encounter situations that require tradeoffs between potential rewards and associated costs, such as time and (physical) effort. The literature indicates a prominent role for dopamine in discounting of both delay and effort, with mixed findings for delay discounting in humans. Moreover, the reciprocal antagonistic interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic transmission in the striatum suggests a potential opponent role of acetylcholine in these processes. We found opposing effects of dopamine D2 (haloperidol) and acetylcholine M1 receptor (biperiden) antagonism on specific components of effort-based decision-making in healthy humans: haloperidol decreased, whereas biperiden increased the willingness to exert physical effort. In contrast, delay discounting was reduced under haloperidol, but not affected by biperiden. Together, our data suggest that dopamine, acting at D2 receptors, modulates both effort and delay discounting, while acetylcholine, acting at M1 receptors, appears to exert a more specific influence on effort discounting only.","author":"Mani Erfanian Abdoust","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"9f6b4c9adb131dd1123fbc348310ae99ebd2c95790f7853eaf986d8940ed4799","category":"Environment"}
