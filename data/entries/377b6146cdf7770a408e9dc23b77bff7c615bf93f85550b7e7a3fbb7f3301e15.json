{"title":"Pseudo-Dynamic Tests on Frame-Shear Wall Structure with Precast Concrete Diaphragm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1147/v1","date":1710848374000,"content":"In order to study the way how to improve the spatial action of precast monolithic composite floor slabs, and would replace the cast-in-place surface layer for reduce the weight of structure, using pseudo-dynamic tests on 1/4 scale models of two-span and three-story frame structure. The lateral load tests compared the stresses and displacements with cast-in-place floor frame-shear wall structure (SJ1) and precast monolithic floor frame-shear wall structure with X horizontal braces at the bottom of the floor (SJ2). The results show the X horizontal braces can improve the spatial action. Structural integrity (SJ2) as well as the effective transmission of the horizontal force can be ensured by additional X bracing at the bottom of the rigidity of the floor without cast-in-place concrete topping. The results show that X horizontal braces more effectively transfer horizontal, which provides a beneficial reference for similar research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377b6146cdf7770a408e9dc23b77bff7c615bf93f85550b7e7a3fbb7f3301e15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
