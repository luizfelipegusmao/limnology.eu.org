{"title":"Fructose-Based Metal Organic Framework as a Means to Synthesize Chitosan Nanospheres Loaded with Sr with NLO Properties for Theranostic Applications in Radiotherapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0688/v1","date":1720496736000,"content":"Chitosan is a biodegradable polymer derived from chitin, that is a versatile material for various biological applications for its attractive properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity. Furthermore, chitosan possesses Second Harmonic Generation properties, that are useful for bio-sensing applications.\nIn this work we explored the possibility to exploit chitosan-based nanospheres as SHG-based bio-sensors, and also as carriers of 89Sr radionuclide, an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient for radiopharmaceutical treatments in cancer therapy. To load opportunely the Sr ion on the nanospheres, we used a fructose-based Metal Organic Framework, of formula [Sr(C6H12O6)2(H2O)2]Cl2Â·H2O, because the sugar was able to drive the Sr ions on the chitosan matrix. \nThe Sr-loaded chitosan nanospheres were synthetized, characterized, and their SHG response was measured. The results encouraged us to propose the nanospheres for theranostic purposes, i.e. at the same time valuable for both therapy and diagnostic applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"357202d5e5662e3450ba9ebcfacf915704fe0bddbe04c5a7536d9e7b5c00b46e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
