{"title":"Using Logs to Mitigate Process Variability and Reliance on Practitioners in Traditional Business Process Automation Software","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0776/v1","date":1723452124000,"content":"Context: Business Process Automation (BPA) is adopted by organizations to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase overall business performance. Traditional Business Process Automation (TBPA) is one of the three approaches employed to develop a BPA. TBPA entails developing BPA in a programming language for integrating the relevant applications in the digital ecosystem to execute a given process. Process variability and practitioner unavailability encumber the requirements specification for TBPA software. Objective: This work proposes a log-based approach for TBPA software to make software more adaptable to process changes and reduce reliance on practitioners, by providing a higher alignment among business process requirements and software architecture, and employing process mining to semi-automatically discover the business process during requirements elicitation. Method: The research conducted a case study in a technology institute to assess the approach and report its results in practice. Results: The results revealed significant improvements in adaptability to business process changes and decreased the time spent with practitioners, and, efficiency in development. The approach also presented limitations, including human intervention to accurately obtain the business process, complexity to trace the process into the architecture, data privacy concerns, and risk of network traffic overload. Conclusion: This research demonstrated the effectiveness of traceability between process requirements and software architecture, as well as the use of logs and process mining. These methods made TBPA software enhanced the software adaptability to changes and minimized the reliance on practitioners during requirements elicitation respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa6c5a156791b26870ed6d322c1b3b496a2682aa8811c0566cf78752dafd3f1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
