{"title":"Athletes and Iron - Challenges and Future of Sports Nutrition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0826/v1","date":1728566628000,"content":"One of the most common nutritional problems in athletes is iron deficiency. Although a lot of research has been done, the problem is still not solved. It is believed that iron deficiency is basically a lack of iron intake due to low dietary intake. Therefore, athletes who are found to be iron deficient are required to increase their iron intake (supplementation or intravenous administration). However, there are many supplements available on the market today, and if the problem is simply a lack of iron intake, it is a nutritional problem that should have been solved. In other words, there are reasons why the problem cannot be solved by simply taking iron, and it is important to conduct further research on the relationship between iron status and physical activity in the future.\nã€€In this paper, we summarize our recent research, focusing on the studies we have done so far.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcad670e4f74c344b380676d7a8c6e1c4a90976182e104f84dcbd0f31084eb82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
