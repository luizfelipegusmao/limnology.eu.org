{"title":"Dynamic BMP gene expression regulation in chick RPE during recovery from short term optical defocus and form-deprivation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311505","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Yan Zhang, Qiurong Zhu, Wulian Song, Grace May Chuang, Daniel Sun, Kiana Cheung, Andreana Chou, Andrea He, Elham Shoghi, Christine F. Wildsoet</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This study investigated the differential gene expression of BMPs in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) during recovery from short term exposure to optical defocus and form-deprivation (FD) treatments.</p> Methods <p>14-day old White-Leghorn chicks wore either monocular +10 or -10 D lenses, or diffusers for 2 or 48 h, after which eyes were allowed unobstructed vision for up to 96 h. Over this recovery period, refractive errors and choroidal thickness (ChT) were tracked using retinoscopy and high-frequency A-scan ultrasonography. Real-time PCR was used to examine the expression of BMP2, 4, and 7 genes in RPE samples collected 0, 15 min, 2, 24, 48, and 96 h after the termination of treatments. Expression levels in treated eyes and their contralateral control eyes were compared.</p> Results <p>After the termination of the lens and diffuser treatments, eyes gradually recovered from induced shifts in refractive error. With all three treatments, ChT changes reached statistical significance after 48 h of treatment, be it thinning with the -10 D lens and diffuser treatments (-0.06 ± 0.03mm, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; -0.11 ± 0.04 mm, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, resp.), or thickening with the +10 D lens (0.31 ± 0.04 mm, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). BMP2 gene expression was rapidly upregulated in eyes wearing the +10 D lens, being statistical significance after 2 h, as well as 48 h of treatment. With the 2 h treatment, the latter gene expression pattern persisted for 15 min into the recovery period, before decreasing to the same level as that of contralateral control eyes, with a short-lived rebound, i.e., upregulation, 24 h into the recovery period. With the longer, 48 h treatment, BMP2 gene expression decreased more gradually, from 739 ± 121% at the end of the treatment period, to 72 ± 14% after 48 h of recovery. Two and 48 h of both -10 D and FD treatments resulted in BMP2 gene expression downregulation, with the time taken for gene expression levels to fully recover varying with the duration of initial treatments. In both cases, BMP2 gene expression downregulation persisted for 15 min into the recovery period, but reversed to upregulation by 2 h. Similar gene expression patterns were also observed for BMP4, although the changes were smaller.</p> Conclusions <p>The observed changes in BMP gene expression in chick RPE imply dynamic, albeit complex regulation, with the duration of exposure and recovery being critical variables for all three types of visual manipulations. This study provides further evidence for a role of the RPE as an important signal relay linking the retina to the choroid and sclera in eye growth regulation.</p>","author":"Yan Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c55af907770298051f57f5a22b3d0c707f3f130f07660c9b87d34a896912f7e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
