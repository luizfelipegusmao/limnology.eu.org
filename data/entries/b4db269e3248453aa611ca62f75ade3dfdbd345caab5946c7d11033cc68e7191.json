The alternative approach is to perform the analysis in real space by quantitative atomic resolution imaging. In this work we use STEM HAADF and Differential Phase Contrast analysis to study the prototypical disordered phase of γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which despite decades of research has remined undetermined. γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> represents an important oxide with a broad use in multiple technological applications. Most importantly, it is heavily used in catalytic applications both as catalyst and catalytic support [<a href=\"#ozae044.553-B1\">1</a>]. We present crystallographic analysis approach for γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and show that the structural complexity arises from highly intertwined spinel nano-domains connected through finite thickness non-spinel faults.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b4db269e3248453aa611ca62f75ade3dfdbd345caab5946c7d11033cc68e7191","category":"Environment"}
