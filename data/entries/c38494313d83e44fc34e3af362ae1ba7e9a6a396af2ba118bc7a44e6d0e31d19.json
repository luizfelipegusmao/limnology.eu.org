{"title":"COI1 F-box proteins regulate DELLA protein levels, growth, and photosynthetic efficiency in maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3237/7683258?rss=1","date":1716768000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The F-box protein Coronatine Insensitive (COI) is a receptor for the jasmonic acid signaling pathway in plants. To investigate the functions of the 6 maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) COI proteins (COI1a, COI1b, COI1c, COI1d, COI2a, and COI2b), we generated single, double, and quadruple loss-of-function mutants. The pollen of the <span>coi2a coi2b</span> double mutant was inviable. The <span>coi1</span> quadruple mutant (<span>coi1-4x</span>) exhibited shorter internodes, decreased photosynthesis, leaf discoloration, microelement deficiencies, and accumulation of DWARF8 and/or DWARF9, 2 DELLA family proteins that repress the gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway. Coexpression of COI and DELLA in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> showed that the COI proteins trigger proteasome-dependent DELLA degradation. Many genes that are downregulated in the <span>coi1-4x</span> mutant are GA-inducible. In addition, most of the proteins encoded by the downregulated genes are predicted to be bundle sheath- or mesophyll-enriched, including those encoding C<sub>4</sub>-specific photosynthetic enzymes. Heterologous expression of maize <span>Coi</span> genes in <span>N. benthamiana</span> showed that COI2a is nucleus-localized and interacts with maize jasmonate zinc-finger inflorescence meristem domain (JAZ) proteins, the canonical COI repressor partners. However, maize COI1a and COI1c showed only partial nuclear localization and reduced binding efficiency to the tested JAZ proteins. Together, these results show the divergent functions of the 6 COI proteins in regulating maize growth and defense pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"c38494313d83e44fc34e3af362ae1ba7e9a6a396af2ba118bc7a44e6d0e31d19","category":"Environment"}
