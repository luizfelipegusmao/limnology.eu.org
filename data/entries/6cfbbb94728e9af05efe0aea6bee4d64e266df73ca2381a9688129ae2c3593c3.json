{"title":"Calcium signaling: an emerging player in plant antiviral defense","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1265/7368455?rss=1","date":1699228800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Calcium is a universal messenger in different kingdoms of living organisms and regulates most physiological processes, including defense against pathogens. The threat of viral infections in humans has become very clear in recent years, and this has triggered detailed research into all aspects of hostâ€“virus interactions, including the suppression of calcium signaling in infected cells. At the same time, however, the threat of plant viral infections is underestimated in society, and research in the field of calcium signaling during plant viral infections is scarce. Here we highlight an emerging role of calcium signaling for antiviral protection in plants, in parallel with the known evidence from studies of animal cells. Obtaining more knowledge in this domain might open up new perspectives for future crop protection and the improvement of food security.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"6cfbbb94728e9af05efe0aea6bee4d64e266df73ca2381a9688129ae2c3593c3","category":"Environment"}
