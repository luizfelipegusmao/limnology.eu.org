{"title":"Access of older people to primary health care in low and middle-income countries: A systematic scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298973","date":1713535200000,"content":"<p>by Saydeh Dableh, Kate Frazer, Diarmuid Stokes, Thilo Kroll</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Ensuring access for older people to Primary Health Care (PHC) is vital to achieve universal health coverage, improve health outcomes, and health-system performance. However, older people living in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) face barriers constraining their timely access to appropriate care. This review aims to summarize the nature and breadth of literature examining older people’s experiences with access to PHC in LMICs, and access barriers and enablers.</p> Methods <p>Guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, four databases [CINAHL, Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase] were systematically searched for all types of peer-reviewed articles published between 2002 and 2023, in any language but with English or French abstract. Gray literature presenting empirical data was also included by searching the United Nations, World Health Organization, and HelpAge websites. Data were independently screened and extracted.</p> Results <p>Of 1165 identified records, 30 are included. Data were generated mostly in Brazil (50%) and through studies adopting quantitative designs (80%). Older people’s experiences varied across countries and were shaped by several access barriers and enablers classified according to the Patient-Centered Access to Healthcare framework, featuring the characteristics of the care delivery system at the supply side and older people’s attributes from the demand side. The review identifies that most access barriers and enablers pertain to the availability and accommodation dimension, followed by the appropriateness, affordability, acceptability, and approachability of services. Socio-economic level and need perception were the most reported characteristics that affected older people’s access to PHC.</p> Conclusions <p>Older people’s experiences with PHC access varied according to local contexts, socioeconomic variables, and the provision of public or private health services. Results inform policymakers and PHC practitioners to generate policies and services that are evidence-based and responsive to older people’s needs. Identified knowledge gaps highlight the need for research to further understand older people’s access to PHC in different LMICs.</p>","author":"Saydeh Dableh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5a3bd28ee5b21bf36e00463eb704f30c350ad89757685ccaa69468b7a8736246","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
