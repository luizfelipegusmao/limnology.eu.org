{"title":"136 Evaluation of internal parasite burden in grazing beef cattle in North Carolina over a production lifecycle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/67/7617929?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) parasite infections can be detrimental to not only cattle health and immunity, but also result in economic loss and poor performance. Cattle grazing in the southeast are challenged even further by the favorable environmental conditions for parasite development, especially those animals who have yet to develop an immunity to combat parasitism. To diminish potential economic and performance-based losses, many beef producers treat animals for GIN parasites with anthelmintics on a regular basis without proper diagnosis. Anthelmintic resistance(AR) develops when deworming products are overused and misused. To minimize the development of AR, selective deworming and sustainable management practices should be implemented. However, the severity of parasite burden over the production cycle needs to be better understood in beef cattle herds before recommendations can be made. Thus, the objective was to investigate the rates of GIN parasite infections through fecal egg counts (FEC) and the impact on body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS). Angus-based cattle (6 mo-13 yr, n = 1,154) on a were utilized from five different research and educational herds across North Carolina. Cattle were categorized based on their age at the start of the project as either calves (n = 446), yearling heifers (n = 205), 2 year old (n = 260), 3-5 year old (n = 501), or 6+ year old (n = 206). Starting in September, FEC, BW, and BCS were collected and analyzed every 90 d at critical production timepoints (calving, breeding, weaning, and 90d post-weaning) to monitor the severity of GIN parasite challenge. Cattle on study were not treated with anthelmintics regardless of parasite load, with the exception of calves at four of the locations at the time of weaning. All data were analyzed using Proc MIXED in SAS with repeated measures. Statistical significance was declared at P ≤ 0.05 and a trend at 0.10 &gt; P &gt; 0.05. Age of cattle had an impact on FEC overall (P &lt; 0.05), however, there was no difference between FEC of mature cattle over 3 yr (4.29 ± 4.9 eggs/gm). Calves had the greatest FEC (120.59 ± 4.2 eggs/gm) while cattle 6+ yr had the least (3.68 ± 4.5 eggs/gm). Cattle age at each location affected BCS and BW (P &lt; 0.05). Between age groups across locations, time had an impact on FEC, BW, and BCS (P &lt; 0.05). There was also a tendency (P = 0.6) for location to impact FEC. Calf sex did not affect (P &gt; 0.05) FEC. Further FEC analysis of cattle under 2 yrof age is required to better understand when a natural immune response to GIN parasite infections develops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"135b4ac217eac925ed2e0389e9cc3c5f306d6026acea155258992e4c2bc770c4","category":"Environment"}
