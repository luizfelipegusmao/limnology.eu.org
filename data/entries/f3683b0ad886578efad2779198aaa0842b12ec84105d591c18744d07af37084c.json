This is a massive limitation compared to the previous Intel-based generation of Mac laptops that could run two displays when connected to a USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 docking station or hub that we hope will be rectified with the M3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, we list our tested and recommended software and hardware solutions for adding more than one display to the plain M1 and M2 Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the external display specs for Apple’s current laptops:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">M1 MacBook Air</a></strong>: Maximum one external display</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 MacBook Air</a></strong>: Maximum one external display</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/791082/13-inch-macbook-pro-m2-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 MacBook Pro</a></strong>: Maximum one external display</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/546363/14-inch-macbook-pro-m1-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 Pro MacBook Pro</a></strong>: Maximum two external displays</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668168/16in-macbook-pro-m1-max-2021-review-terribly-fast-and-well-built.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 Max MacBook Pro</a></strong>: Maximum four external displays</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are ways around this plain M1/M2 limitation, allowing you to run two or more external displays off your MacBook, which we will outline here. In each case, there’s a software download and a docking station, hub, or adapter required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the software workaround, there are some risks involved as you will be required to install third-party drivers, and these might later be unsupported by future updates of the macOS. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>External displays: Big problem for M1 and M2 Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Mac mini, MacBook Air, and 13-inch MacBook Pro were the first Macs to feature the Apple-designed M1 CPU. They received rave reviews for their speed improvements over Intel-based laptops, including here on Macworld.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if your MacBook setup includes running more than one external display, you have a major problem. Apple’s M1 or M2 chips simply won’t allow it—at least natively. Apple states in the M1 and M2 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro tech specs that they support only “one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz”.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-M1-M2-Display-Support-tech-specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple M1 and M2 Display Support tech specs\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-M1-M2-Display-Support-tech-specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-M1-M2-Display-Support-tech-specs.jpg?resize=300%2C82&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-M1-M2-Display-Support-tech-specs.jpg?resize=768%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1000\" height=\"274\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While the M1 and M2 MacBooks natively support just one monitor, the M1 and M2 Mac Mini does natively support up to two external monitors—one via the HDMI port and a second via USB-C. But the M1 models of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lack an HDMI port and only support a single external display over Thunderbolt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has apparently <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675911/apple-promises-to-fix-external-monitor-problems-with-m1-macs.html\">promised to fix the problem</a> in a future macOS update, but the arrival of the later M1 Pro and M1 Max—and more recently the M2—suggest that M1 owners could be waiting a long time. We have this guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677287/monitors-for-m1-macs-what-you-need-to-know-before-buying.html\">monitors for M1 Macs and what you need to know before buying.</a> We also cover the basics of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671793/how-to-connect-an-external-monitor-to-your-mac.html\">how to connect your Mac to an external monitor</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Workaround #1: Install DisplayLink software drivers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use a combination of display technologies to get around the M1/M2 MacBooks’ single-monitor limitation. This should work with most third-party docks, although some manufacturers, such as Caldigit, don’t recommend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whole new category of docks—many reviewed below—has appeared to solve the M1/M2 Mac one-screen problem. DisplayLink USB-C docks or just USB-C docks require software drivers to enable data compression that make them almost as powerful as a Thunderbolt dock. You’ll need to download the appropriate DisplayLink software from the dock manufacturer—full instructions later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many multi-display docks use a combination of native USB-C Alternate Mode (native “Alt Mode” video output) and DisplayLink technology. This combination serves as a workaround to the M1/M2 platform supporting only a single external display via USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that DisplayLink requires a third-party driver to be installed on the Mac. There are different versions of the DisplayLink driver, and some bring their own compromises to the party. But, in general, setup is straightforward. Some of the docks we review below offer the DisplayLink software when you first connect the dock to your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DisplayLink macOS app or DisplayLink Manager app are ways of enabling DisplayLink technology on macOS. The app is available as a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/macos&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">standalone installer</a> rather than through the mac App Store.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3799794/plugable-ud-ultc4k-usb-c-dock.jpg\" alt=\"Plugable UD-ULT4K dock M1 Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Plugable docking station and three external displays via DisplayLink.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> First, download the latest <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Mac DisplayLink driver</a>. As stated above, some docks, do this for you but it’s always best to use the latest version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayLink Manager Graphics Connectivity App v. 1.8.1 is compatible with macOS Big Sur 11, Monterey 12 and Ventura 13. It can be managed via the DisplayLink icon in the Apple Menu bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The macOS requires the user to permit “Screen Recording” in order for DisplayLink devices to work properly. This can be found in System Preferences under Privacy in Security &amp; Privacy; navigate to Screen Recording in the list on the left, then tick the Screen Recording permission for DisplayLink Manager after unlocking the padlock using your admin password. You may need to quit and restart DisplayLink Manager afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installation is straightforward. Older versions did not support laptops’ closed-display/Clamshell mode, but 1.8.1 does support Clamshell mode if the MacBook is Intel-based running macOS 12 or if the MacBook is M1-based running macOS 11 or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most scary bit is when you need to enable “Screen Recording” to allow the DisplayLink Manager app to capture pixels and send them to your USB peripheral. This entails making some adjustments in the Mac’s “Privacy” tab, but you are walked through it step by step. Take a look at the instructions <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/articles/1932214-displaylink-manager-app-for-macos-introduction-in&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an option in DisplayLink manager to “launch at startup”, or you can drag the DisplayLink Manager to your Login Items in Users &amp; Groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Then connect the MacBook to a docking station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong> For the first screen you can connect via the dock’s DisplayPort or HDMI Port, and this will be handled natively by the M1/M2 MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also connect the first external display via the dock’s other display ports or via a Thunderbolt or USB-C to HDMI or DisplayPort adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HDMI or DisplayPort output uses Alternate Mode (Alt Mode), and as it is basically a pipeline directly to the system’s native GPU, it will behave just like if you hooked up a USB-C to HDMI dongle to your laptop. This requires no user driver installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second and third displays will rely on the DisplayLink software. DisplayLink uses an installed driver and the system CPU and GPU to convert graphics data on the system into data packets. That data is then sent over the cable as data packets and converted back to video information and output to the monitors via the DisplayLink chip in the docking station.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Workaround #2: Install InstantView software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another third-party software solution is SiliconMotion’s InstantView, which operates in a similar way to DisplayLink and works with three of the hardware hubs and adapters we review below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial setup is easier than DisplayLink with the hubs from Hyper but similar to the Satechi hub—but it suffers the same challenge that Apple’s software updates can disable it, which will entail installing a newer version and allowing the necessary security &amp; privacy settings for screen recording, just as with DisplayLink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.siliconmotion.com/downloads/index.html&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">latest version of InstantView software here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither software solution is complicated and both worked well in our tests as you can read below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which docks support DisplayLink and InstantView?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, dock manufacturers did not officially support such a DisplayLink setup for Macs. The solution works, but they rightly warned that this could become unstuck in future versions of the macOS. Whenever there is a new OS update the drivers may need to be updated each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, after some recent testing and improvements Plugable, for example, has updated its compatibility to officially support that configuration. For Mac compatibility, it has validated both Apple and Intel platforms running at least macOS 11. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which dock is best?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A docking station connects to your MacBook via Thunderbolt or USB-C. It then offers multiple ports that your laptop now has access to. These can include new display ports, such as HDMI, as well as Gigabit Ethernet for wired Internet access, USB-C/Thunderbolt/USB-A ports at varying speeds, audio plugs, and card readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668894/best-thunderbolt-3-4-and-usb-c-docking-stations-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html\" target=\"_blank\">best Thunderbolt docking stations</a> for more details, or you can connect via a simpler <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/test-centre/pc-peripheral/usb-c-hubs-3683402/\" target=\"_blank\">USB-C hub</a>. Look for a dock with two or more display ports, preferably ones that can connect to your preferred displays without the need for an adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/725034/best-thunderbolt-4-and-usb4-hubs-and-docks.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbolt 4 docks or hubs</a> often have no dedicated display port but three available TB4 ports that can be used to connect directly to a USB-C display or via adapters to HDMI or DisplayPort monitors. While you may have to buy an adapter cable, 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4’s port flexibility and backward compatibility are recommended for users of modern Macs such as the M1 and M2 MacBooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB-C docks and hubs are usually cheaper, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docking station and hub manufacturers are now actively marketing their products as solutions to the M1/M2 external display limitation. Each requires either the DisplayLink download or another similar software solution, such as InstantView, but no further hardware adapter except for the dock or hub itself. And of course, these hubs offer the usual multi-port benefits as well as the external monitor solution.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3799794/usb-a-to-display-adapters.jpg\" alt=\"USB-A 3.0 to display adapters\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If your hub or dock has just one display port, you could also attach a second or third display via one or more of the spare USB ports, using an adapter such as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-USB-Dual-HDMI-Adapter/dp/B0725K1MHH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">StarTech.com USB 3.0 to Dual HDMI Adapter</a>. This costs around $60 or £50, so needs to be factored in when pricing an M1/M2 MacBook purchase if you require multiple monitors and want to use the USB-A port rather than a video port such as HDMI or DisplayPort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-DisplayPort-Monitor-Adapter-Compatible/dp/B08F2SZQYX?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Plugable’s USB Dual 4K Display Adapter</a>, which can work via USB-A or USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to connect to an old-school DVI or even VGA monitor, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HDMI-Monitor-External-Video-Adapter-Black/dp/B008CXFMT6?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">StarTech.com USB 3.0 to HDMI / DVI Adapter</a> will fulfil your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adapter turns an available USB-A 3.0 or USB-C port—via an included USB-B adapter cable—into one DVI-I or VGA port (DVI to VGA adapter included) and one HDMI output. Each display can simultaneously support the maximum resolution of 2048×1152 at 60Hz. Make sure to use an active HDMI DisplayLink adapter that can support 4K at 60Hz, as some are limited to 4K at 30Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that these will only work when you have installed the DisplayLink software; see above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We prefer to stick with USB-C where possible, and so recommend the more functional docks tested below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The best multiscreen hubs and adapters for M1 and M2 MacBooks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below we have gathered the best dedicated hubs and docks for multiscreen M1/M2. Note that these listed (and tested) below use USB-C rather than Thunderbolt, so don’t benefit from the MacBook’s potential 40Gbps data bandwidth. If you require all 40Gbps, go for a Thunderbolt dock and install DisplayLink as instructed above.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlogic DX3 Triple 4K Display Universal Docking Station – three 4K displays at 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" alt=\"Alogic DX3 Triple 4K Display Universal Docking Station – three 4K displays at 60Hz\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Alogic-Dx3-Docking-Station.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSupports three external displays at 4K 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t12 ports, inc. 10Gbps USB-C\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t3x DisplayPort 1.4 video ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSpeedy SD and MicroSD card readers\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t100W charging and 135W power supply\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$299.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0924789ZC?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$269.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://alogic.co/products/dx3-triple-4k-display-universal-docking-station-with-100w-power-delivery&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-6-2023655-20066&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$299.99 at  Alogic</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>This Alogic DisplayLink docking station is similar to the Satechi Triple 4K Display Dock (reviewed below) in that it supports up to three external 4K displays at an impressive 60Hz refresh rate and has an array of useful non-display ports. It can power the connected laptop at 100W and has a decent 135W external power supply so doesn’t require an extra USB-C charger.</p>\n\n<p>The DisplayLink download link is clearly shown in the user manual, and instructions make sense—although you need a magnifying glass to read them!</p>\n\n<p>The DX3 has fewer video ports than the Satechi dock but all are top-notch DisplayPort 1.4. If any of your monitors lacks DisplayLink but had HDMI, you’ll need to add an adapter between dock and display. As you’ll need to buy video cables anyway, this doesn’t matter as prices for straight cable and adapter cable are close enough.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the Satechi, this dock does have a card reader—indeed it has two: SD and MicroSD, both at top 312MBps UHS-II—allowing you to add inexpensive portable storage to your laptop setup. </p>\n\n<p>It also has Gigabit Ethernet, four USB-A (one with 7.5W charging) and two 10Gbps USB-C (one 100W PD upstream to the laptop, and one 7.5W smaller device charging).</p>\n\n<p>Choosing between the Alogic DX3 and Satechi Triple 4K docks could be decided on whether your monitors have HDMI rather than DisplayPort, although adapters mean there is an easy solution. We also applaud the DX3 for its dual SD card readers.</p>\n\n<p>Reviewed further down this list is Alogic’s DX2, which supports two 4K displays at 60Hz and lacks some of the other ports found on the DX3. if you just need two external monitors for your M1/M2 MacBook this may be a cheaper option.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSatechi Triple 4K Display Docking Station – three 4K displays at 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Satechi Triple 4K Display Docking Station – three 4K displays at 60Hz\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Satechi-Triple-4K-USB-C-Dock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSupports three external displays at 4K 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t12 ports, inc. 10Gbps USB-C and USB-A\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t3x HDMI 2.0 and 2x DisplayPort 1.4 video ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t100W charging and 130W power supply\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo card reader\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$299.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/TRIPLE-4K-DISPLAY-DOCKING-STATION/3268202200&amp;subid1=1-1-675869-6-1964969-14639\" target=\"_blank\">$237.13 at  Walmart</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6CF3JB1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$299.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://satechi.net/products/triple-4k-display-docking-station?variant=40227980247128&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-6-1964969-14639&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$299.99 at  Satechi</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Satechi Triple 4K Display Docking Station is a quality horizontal dock that supports up to three external displays on a plain (non-Pro or -Max) M1/M2 MacBook if you install DisplayLink software.

The mix of HDMI and DisplayPort offers a more flexible monitor choice than some docks tested here, although adapters will provide easy solutions if your dock’s port is DisplayPort but the monitor has just HDMI.</p>\n\n<p>There are 12 ports in total, including Gigabit Ethernet and 10Gbps USB-A and USB-C ports—two of which can power devices at a decent 7.5W. The dock connects to the MacBook via 10Gbps USB-C.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most of the docks reviewed here it comes with its own 130W power supply, so doesn’t require a high-powered USB-C charger.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t boast a card reader to add inexpensive portable storage to your laptop, but you can buy one cheaply enough to attach to one of the USB ports.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of

The first display at 60Hz is added via HDMI and DP Alt-mode and the second at 4K 30Hz through HDMI and InstantView. </p>\n\n<p>Also included are Gigabit Ethernet, MicroSD card reader (UHS-I), 3.5mm audio jack, 2x 5Gbps USB-A, and one 5Gbps USB-C.</p>\n\n<p>A further USB-C PD port allows you to charge the connected laptop at up to 100W—handy as the hub itself uses up one of your M1 or M2 laptop’s two Thunderbolt ports.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlogic DV4 Universal Quad Display Docking Station – one 4K display at 60Hz, two HD displays\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1200\" height=\"927\" alt=\"Alogic DV4 Universal Quad Display Docking Station – one 4K display at 60Hz, two HD displays\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alogic-DV4-Dock-4-screens.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSupports three external displays, one at 4K 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t14 ports, inc. 5Gbps USB-C and USB-A\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t3x HDMI 2.0 and 1x DisplayPort 1.4 video ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t12W USB-C charging\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t85W PD charging\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t2 displays at HD, not 4K\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRequires USB-C charger\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$239.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://alogic.co/products/dv4-universal-quad-display-docking-station&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-6-2007147-20066&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$239.99 at  Alogic</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Apple-led limitations mean that no docking station can connect four external displays, which is restricted to PCs with MST built-in.

While it’s cheaper than its 10-port sibling, we’d recommend the more able hub—unless you need three displays, in which case you’d need to look at the other hubs and docks reviewed here.</p>\n\n<p>One HDMI port supports 4K displays at 60Hz, but the other at the slower 30Hz.</p>\n\n<p>A passthrough USB-C port requires a USB-C charger but can supply 100W to the connected laptop.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re based outside the US, beware as Hyper charges $80 international shipping, making this adapter more expensive than its 10-port sibling.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlogic Dual 4K Universal Compact Docking Station – two 4K displays at 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alogic Dual 4K Universal Compact Docking Station – two 4K displays at 60Hz\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alogic-Dual-4K-Universal-Compact-Docking-Station-CH2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSupports two external displays at 4K 60Hz\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t7 ports, inc. 10Gbps USB-C and USB-A\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHDMI and DisplayPort versions\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRequires USB-C charger\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://alogic.co/products/alogic-dual-4k-universal-compact-docking-station-ch2-hdmi-edition&amp;xcust=1-1-675869-6-1377976-20066&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$199.99 at  Alogic</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Alogic Dual 4K Universal Compact Docking Station comes in two models—the CH2, which features two HDMI 2.0 ports; and the CD2, with two DisplayPort ports—so you can choose which best suits the external displays you already own.</p>\n\n<p>Two external screens are probably enough for most people.

If you require three 4K external displays at 60Hz, the Ugreen Triple Display Dock will fulfill your needs better. If 30Hz is fine, the Baseus will save you money. 60Hz is better for gamers as it offers smoother video.</p>\n\n<p>One big limitation for Macs, though, is that the external displays can only mirror and not extend the Mac’s screen.</p>\n\n<p>Its claim to have 17 ports is exaggerated slightly as one is for the external power supply that powers just the dock at 12W. and another to add power the dock via a USB-C charger and then onto the laptop. But it has 15 other ports including the upstream 5Gbps USB-C connection to the MacBook, plus Gigabit Ethernet, card readers and 5Gbps USB-A and USB-C ports. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Workaround caveats</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever there is a new OS update DisplayLink and InstantView drivers may need to be updated each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugable doesn’t recommend the workaround for gaming, video editing, digital audio workstations (DAWs), and protected content (HDCP) playback. For these workloads, users will want the full throughput of a “bare-metal” native GPU connection—such as provided by the DisplayPort or HDMI port on the dock using Alt Mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caldigit actively recommends against using DisplayLink, as it finds it unreliable and there would be no synergy between the driver and the dock. Because it requires a third-party driver, users are at the mercy of Apple and the third-party developer to support later versions, the company told Macworld.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this combination of display technologies does allow M1 and M2 MacBooks to run more than one external monitor, and the M1 and M2 Mac mini to run more than two. And more manufacturers are coming out with docks and hubs that support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only risk is that it could stop working at any time, although it wouldn’t harm your system if it did, and you could simply uninstall DisplayLink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayLink and InstantView are workarounds with a potentially limited timespan but the likelihood is that compatibility would be restored at some stage if the worst happened and you would get back your multi-monitor setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668078/macbook-air-m1-2020-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">M1 MacBook Air review</a> and everything you need to know about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678349/new-macbook-pro-2022-with-m2-could-be-coming-soon.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 MacBook Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676165/new-macbook-air.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are wanting to use a second display with your Mac and not have your Mac’s screen on, read our feature <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676437/how-to-turn-a-macs-screen-off.html\" target=\"_blank\">How to turn a Mac’s screen off.</a> Want to use an 8K monitor?

The video remains black while audio keeps playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all down to how the macOS interfaces the DisplayLink driver used to access graphics content. As soon as one DisplayLink-enabled screen is connected, protected content becomes unavailable on all screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is down to the streaming platforms using High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP), which is Intel-developed digital copy protection that prevents copying of digital audio and video content as it travels across connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because macOS requires DisplayLink and InstantView to enable Screen Recording, HDCP moves in because it thinks you are actually trying to record the content rather than just display it on screen.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>How to enable streaming content when using DisplayLink or InstantView</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>To get round HDCP stopping your DisplayLink or InstantView setup showing Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services, you may need to disconnect all the DisplayLink or InstantView screens, or switch to a browser other than Safari or Chrome (for example Opera or Firefox).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can disable hardware acceleration in your browser to access the protected content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Google Chrome, go to Google Chrome settings, and click on “Advanced” and then select “System”. Here you can disable “Use hardware acceleration when available”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select “Relaunch” to activate the new setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that doesn’t solve the black issue, disconnect the docking station, and try using the laptop’s build-in display or the direct video ports of the laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uninstalling the software is the ultimate solution.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\nComputer Accessories, Laptop Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f3683b0ad886578efad2779198aaa0842b12ec84105d591c18744d07af37084c","category":"Apple"}
