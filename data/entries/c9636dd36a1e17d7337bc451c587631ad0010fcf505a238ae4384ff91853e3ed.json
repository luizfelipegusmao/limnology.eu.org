{"title":"Wogonin induces apoptosis in macrophages by exhibiting cytotoxic and genotoxic effects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24150?af=R","date":1713250800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Macrophages play an important role in defending the body against invading pathogens. In the face of pathogens, macrophages become activated and release toxic materials that disrupt the pathogens. Macrophage overactivation can lead to severe illness and inflammation. Wogonin has several therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. No studies have investigated the cytotoxic effects of wogonin at concentrations of more than 0.1 mM in RAW264.7 cells. In this study, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with wogonin, which, at concentrations of more than 0.1 mM, had cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in the RAW264.7 cells, leading to apoptosis and necrosis. Further, wogonin at concentrations of more than 0.1 mM induced caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction and death receptor expression. These results suggest that wogonin induces apoptosis through upstream intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by exhibiting cytotoxic and genotoxic effects.</p>","author":"Ping‐Kun Tsai, \nChen‐Yu Chiang, \nTzu‐Ching Wang, \nKun‐Lin Yeh, \nWen‐Ying Chen, \nChun‐Jung Chen, \nChing‐Chi Tseng, \nLie‐Hua Deng, \nJason Tze Cheng Tzen, \nYin‐Che Lu, \nYu‐Hsiang Kuan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"c9636dd36a1e17d7337bc451c587631ad0010fcf505a238ae4384ff91853e3ed","category":"Environment"}
