{"title":"Mapping and Quantifying Green Infrastructure along the Urban-Rural Gradient of the Cities of Bujumbura, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1900/v1","date":1721801472000,"content":"This study maps and quantifies the green infrastructure of the cities of Bujumbura, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. A remote sensing approach, in conjunction with landscape ecology metrics, characterized this analysis, which was based upon three Landsat images acquired in 2000, 2013 and 2022 for each city. Spatial pattern indices show that green infrastructure was suppressed in the cities of Bujumbura and Kinshasa, in contrast to the city of Lubumbashi, which was characterized by a fragmentation of its green areas. Additionally, the values of the stability, aggregation and fractal dimension metrics suggest that the city of Bujumbura underwent rather intense dynamics and a reduction in the continuity of its green areas, while the city of Kinshasa shows weaker dynamics and tendances of patch aggregation in the study period. The city of Lubumbashi, in its turn, exhibits strong dynamics and an aggregation of its green infrastructure, in a context of a high level of anthropization. The evolution of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index shows a sawtooth evolution of tall vegetation patches for the city of Bujumbura, against a gradual decrease in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. It is advocated that the urban growth of these cities should be planned carefully in order to integrate the presence of sufficient green infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4b0ba1d0d2882b570f26d4ec0d3f3e9cc17884677d506e40b68d393c2165116","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
