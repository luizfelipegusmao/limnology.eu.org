However, due to the extreme global temperatures, new genotypes have been bred to adapt better to cold climates. Therefore, to better understand the metabolic and molecular differences that may contribute to the improved cold tolerance of these genotypes, it is essential to investigate whether specific molecules play a key role in determining the degree of sorghum tolerance. Furthermore, identifying genes associated with cold tolerance may assist in the development of more robust and productive sorghum cultivars. Here, we analysed the changes in selected elements of the antioxidant metabolism, genes, and miRNAs in two sorghum varieties with different degrees of tolerance to cold stress at different times of exposure to cold stress. The high expression of <i>SbCBF6</i> in response to cold treatment in early time in the tolerant variety suggests its involvement in the cold response, thereby facilitating a better adaptation of the plant to cold conditions. MiR398 and miR394 showed contrasting behaviour in both varieties in low temperatures, resulting in interesting miRNAs in the degree of sorghum tolerance. MiR319, a marker for the selection of cold-tolerant cultivars, presents a decrease, suggesting that the better capacity to repress the expression of several members of TCP family of transcription factor genes might be involved in better tolerance to cold stress. This study shows the changes of molecules of interest in response to cold stress in sorghum, marking the difference between cold-susceptible and cold-tolerant sorghum plants, which can contribute to selecting tolerant genotypes, allowing new strategies to enhance crop productivity and food security, in regions where low temperatures significantly constrain crop growth and yield.</p>","author":"Pedro Fernando Vera Hernández, \nVladimir Flores Benavides, \nMarcelino Martínez Núñez, \nSilvia Luna Suárez, \nFlor de Fátima Rosas Cárdenas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"80cc076c82367e7f1deed8b46dd10cb4c2bd8935b7981c5a4db2902a91980455","category":"Environment"}
