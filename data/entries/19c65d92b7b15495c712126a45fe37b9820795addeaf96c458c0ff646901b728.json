{"title":"Impact of mutations in starch synthesis genes on morphological, compositional, molecular structure, and functional properties of potato starch","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310990","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Shishanthi Jayarathna, Zsuzsanna Péter-Szabó, Gustav Nestor, Mariette Andersson, Francisco Vilaplana, Roger Andersson</p>\r\n\r\nMorphology, composition and molecular structure of starch directly affect the functional properties. This study investigated the morphological, compositional, and molecular structure properties of starch from starch branching enzyme gene (<i>SBE</i>) and granule-bound starch synthase gene (<i>GBSS</i>) mutated potato, and their associations with thermal, pasting, and film-making properties. <i>SBE</i> mutations were induced in native variety Desiree while <i>GBSS</i> mutations were herestacked to a selected <i>SBE</i> mutated parental line. Mutations in <i>SBE</i> resulted in smaller starch granules and higher amylose content, while <i>GBSS</i> mutations in the <i>SBE</i> background reduced amylose content. Mutations in <i>SBE</i>, particularly with <i>GBSS</i> mutations, significantly increased total phosphorus content. <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy revealed higher proportions of C6-bound phosphate than of C3-bound phosphate in all studied lines. Amylopectin unit chain and internal chain distributions showed higher proportions of long chains in mutated lines compared with Desiree. These amylopectin long-chains were positively correlated with gelatinizationand, pasting temperatures, and temperature at peak viscosity. Short amylopectin chains showed positive correlations with breakdown viscosity, but negative correlations with the crystal melting temperature of retrograded starch. Total phosphorus content was positively correlated with the crystal melting temperature of retrograded starch. Starch from different lines was used to produce a series of potato starch films that differed in morphology and functional properties. A negative correlation was observed between Young’s modulus of films and the long amylopectin-chain fraction. Thermal gravimetric analysis revealed highest thermal stability of Desiree starch films, followed by films from <i>SBE</i>-mutated high-amylose lines. Oxygen transmission rate and oxygen permeability analyses showed that films made with starch from selected <i>GBSS</i> and <i>SBE</i>s mutated line maintained comparable oxygen barrier properties to Desiree film. These insights on the impact of genetic mutations on starch properties indicate potential applications of <i>in-planta</i> starch modification for specific end-uses including packaging.","author":"Shishanthi Jayarathna","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"19c65d92b7b15495c712126a45fe37b9820795addeaf96c458c0ff646901b728","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
