{"title":"Effect of Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride on Corrosion Inhibition Properties of Mild Steel in Acidic Medium","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1187/v1","date":1713440361000,"content":"The corrosion inhibition behavior of cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) on mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was examined using measurement techniques such as Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The studies were carried out within a 25Â°C temperature range. The surface morphology of the corroded steel samples was investigated using FESEM and AFM. The results show that cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), a mild steel corrosion inhibitor, effectively prevents corrosion in 0.5 M H2SO4 and, when present, increases corrosion resistance. CPC has a stronger inhibitory effect on mild steel. The FESEM and AFM images clearly show how surface morphology changes when additives are present. The weight loss results were confirmed by en-ergy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis, and a value of 98.54% was obtained from potentiodynamic polarization studies at 0.0077M CPC. CPC acts as an important corrosion in-hibitor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"070140f46d1b6039bca936af3266bf577cdcbb975a85a6724e362d0ddfbbcbc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
