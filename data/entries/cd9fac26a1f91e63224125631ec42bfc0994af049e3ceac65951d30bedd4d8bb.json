{"title":"Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal the Effects of Walnut Kernel Cake on Adipose Deposition in Pig","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1493/v1","date":1711445043000,"content":"With the rising cost of animal feed protein, finding affordable and effective substitutes is crucial. Walnut kernel cake, a polyphenols, fiber, protein and fat-rich byproduct of walnut oil extraction, has been underexplored as a potential protein replacement in pig feed. In this study, we found that feeding large Diqing Tibetan pigs walnut kernel cake promoted adipose deposition and improved pork quality during pig growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed the upregulation of genes ANGPTL8, CCNP, ETV4, and TRIB3, associated with adipose deposition. Pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in adipose-deposition-related pathways, including PPAR, Insulin, PI3K-Akt, Wnt, and MAPK signaling. Further analysis identified DEGs (differentially expressed genes) positively correlated with adipose-related traits, such as PER2 and PTGES. Single-cell transcriptome data pointed to the specific expression of CD248 and PTGES in adipocyte progenitor/stem cells (APSCs), pivotal for adipocyte differentiation and adipose deposition regulation. This study demonstrates walnut kernel cake's potential to substitute soybean cake in pig feed, providing high-quality protein and promoting adipose deposition. It offers insights into feed protein replacement, human functional food, fat metabolism, and related diseases, with marker genes and pathways supporting pig breeding and pork quality improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd9fac26a1f91e63224125631ec42bfc0994af049e3ceac65951d30bedd4d8bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
