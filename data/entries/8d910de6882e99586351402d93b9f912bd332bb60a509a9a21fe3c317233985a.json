{"title":"The state of artificial intelligence in medical research: A survey of corresponding authors from top medical journals","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309208","date":1724421600000,"content":"<p>by Michele Salvagno, Alessandro De Cassai, Stefano Zorzi, Mario Zaccarelli, Marco Pasetto, Elda Diletta Sterchele, Dmytro Chumachenko, Alberto Giovanni Gerli, Razvan Azamfirei, Fabio Silvio Taccone</p>\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand and respond to human language through Large Language Models (LLMs)‥ These models have diverse applications in fields such as medical research, scientific writing, and publishing, but concerns such as hallucination, ethical issues, bias, and cybersecurity need to be addressed. To understand the scientific community’s understanding and perspective on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in research and authorship, a survey was designed for corresponding authors in top medical journals. An online survey was conducted from July 13<sup>th</sup>, 2023, to September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023, using the SurveyMonkey web instrument, and the population of interest were corresponding authors who published in 2022 in the 15 highest-impact medical journals, as ranked by the Journal Citation Report. The survey link has been sent to all the identified corresponding authors by mail. A total of 266 authors answered, and 236 entered the final analysis. Most of the researchers (40.6%) reported having moderate familiarity with artificial intelligence, while a minority (4.4%) had no associated knowledge. Furthermore, the vast majority (79.0%) believe that artificial intelligence will play a major role in the future of research. Of note, no correlation between academic metrics and artificial intelligence knowledge or confidence was found. The results indicate that although researchers have varying degrees of familiarity with artificial intelligence, its use in scientific research is still in its early phases. Despite lacking formal AI training, many scholars publishing in high-impact journals have started integrating such technologies into their projects, including rephrasing, translation, and proofreading tasks. Efforts should focus on providing training for their effective use, establishing guidelines by journal editors, and creating software applications that bundle multiple integrated tools into a single platform.","author":"Michele Salvagno","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8d910de6882e99586351402d93b9f912bd332bb60a509a9a21fe3c317233985a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
