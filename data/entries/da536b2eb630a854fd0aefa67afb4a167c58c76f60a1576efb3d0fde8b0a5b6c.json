{"title":"Effect of a plant extract of fenugreek (<i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i>) on testosterone in blood plasma and saliva in a double blind randomized controlled intervention study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310170","date":1726581600000,"content":"<p>by Sindre Lee-Ødegård, Thomas E. Gundersen, Christian A. Drevon</p>\r\n\r\nMany aging men experience reduced energy and libido related to non-optimal testosterone levels. We conducted a randomized double-blind trial with Trigozim<sup>R</sup> fenugreek extract to assess impact on plasma and saliva testosterone, and some subjective effects. 95 men (40-80y) completed a 12-week intervention, taking 3 tablets daily with 0 mg (placebo; n = 22), 600 mg (n = 21), 1200 mg (n = 25) and1800 mg (n = 27) fenugreek extract and essential nutrients. Samples were collected at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12. Participants answered a pre- and post-intervention questionnaire on lifestyle and libido. We measured total testosterone (HPLC-MS/MS) and sex hormone binding globulin (ELISA), calculated free testosterone index (FTI), and measured saliva testosterone. Plasma total testosterone and FTI increased after any dose of Trigozim<sup>R</sup> vs. baseline (13.0%, p = 1.0x10<sup>-4</sup> and 16.3%, p = 6.2x10<sup>-6</sup>), but not vs. placebo (9.0%, p = 0.122 and 11.3% p = 0.059). 1800 mg Trigozim<sup>R</sup> resulted in 12.2% increased FTI (p = 0.025). Saliva testosterone concentration increased after any dose of Trigozim<sup>R</sup> vs. baseline (31.1%, p = 2.3x10<sup>-4</sup>) and vs. placebo (37.2%, p = 0.042). 1800 mg Trigozim<sup>R</sup> for 12 weeks resulted in 19.6% (p = 0.006) increased saliva testosterone. Compliance was confirmed by enhanced plasma concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. We observed no subjective effects or side-effects of Trigozim<sup>R</sup>. Trigozim<sup>R</sup> increased saliva and plasma testosterone concentration during intervention but only for saliva vs. placebo. Saliva may be preferred for measuring free testosterone due to no protein-bound testosterone.","author":"Sindre Lee-Ødegård","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"da536b2eb630a854fd0aefa67afb4a167c58c76f60a1576efb3d0fde8b0a5b6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
