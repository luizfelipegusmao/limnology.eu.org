{"title":"Redefining Data-Centric Design: A New Approach with a Domain Model and Core Data Ontology for Computational Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0037/v1","date":1725260029000,"content":"This paper presents an innovative data-centric paradigm for designing computational systems by introducing a new informatics domain model. The proposed model moves away from the conventional node-centric framework and focuses on data-centric categorization, using a multimodal approach that incorporates objects, events, concepts, and actions. By drawing on interdisciplinary research and establishing a foundational ontology based on these core elements, the model promotes semantic consistency and secure data handling across distributed ecosystems. We also explore the implementation of this model as an OWL 2 ontology, discuss its potential applications, and outline its scalability and future directions for research. This work aims to serve as a foundational guide for system designers and data architects in developing more secure, interoperable, and scalable data systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"455ea9dd1fd8085bd0c37bd5415e643e173014065130ad26dc9d0921d5b95ca6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
