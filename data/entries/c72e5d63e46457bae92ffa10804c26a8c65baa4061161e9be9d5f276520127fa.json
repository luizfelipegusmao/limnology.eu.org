{"title":"A New Probiotic Blend Facilitates Resolution of Inflammation in a Crohn&rsquo;s Disease Mouse Model by Promoting Apoptosis in Mucosal Innate Immune Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0050/v1","date":1727775350000,"content":"The interaction between gut-residing microorganisms plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Crohnâ€™s disease (CD), where microbiome dysregulation can alter immune responses leading to unresolved local inflammation. The aim of this study is to analyze the immunomodulatory properties of our recently developed probiotic+amylase blend in the SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mouse model of CD-like ileitis. Four groups of SAMP mice were gavaged for 56 days with: 1) probiotic strains + amylase (concentration: 0.25 mg/100 uL PBS); 2) only probiotics; 3) only amylase; PBS (vehicle-treated controls). Ilea were collected for GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) analysis and histological evaluation. Histology assessment for inflammation indicated a significantly reduced level of ileitis in mice administered probiotics+amylase blend. DSP analysis showed decreased abundance of neutrophils and increased abundance of dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells and macrophages, with a significant enrichment of five intracellular pathways related to apoptosis, in probiotics+amylase treated mice. Increased apoptosis occurrence was confirmed by TUNEL assay. Our data demonstrate a beneficial role of the probiotic and amylase blend, highlighting an increased apoptosis of innate immunity-associated cell subsets, thus promoting the resolution of inflammation. Hence, we suggest that our recently developed probiotic blend may be a therapeutic tool to manage CD and therefore could be a candidate compound to be tested in clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c72e5d63e46457bae92ffa10804c26a8c65baa4061161e9be9d5f276520127fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
