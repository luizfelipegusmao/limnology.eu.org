{"title":"Is Deuterium Fractionation a Major Controlling Factor in Human Metabolism and Cancer? An Essential Role for Proline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1284/v2","date":1718771452000,"content":"Deuterium is a heavy nonradioactive isotope of hydrogen, having a neutron as well as a proton, making it twice as heavy. It is a natural element, present at 156 parts per million in seawater. The ATPase pumps in the mitochondria utilize proton motive force to drive ATP synthesis, and deuterons damage the pumps, producing a stutter that can cause reactive oxygen release and inefficiencies in ATP synthesis. Cellular metabolism incorporates several novel mechanisms to assure low deuterium content in the mitochondria and other organelles. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a major carrier of deuterium depleted (deupleted) protons to supply the mitochondria. Many enzymes, especially flavoproteins, are able to use proton tunneling to fractionate out deuterium. In this paper, we argue that the amino acid proline is able to trap and sequester deuterium, and that peptidyl prolyl isomerases (PPIases) play a central role in facilitating deuterium trapping in proline-rich proteins, most notably collagen. The endothelial glycocalyx also sequesters deuterium in gelled water lining the blood vessels, creating a battery and promoting low deuterium in the circulation. Excess deuterium promotes cancer growth, and cancer cells release large quantities of lactate via aerobic glycolysis to help reverse deuterium overload, systemically.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdd215300701099e3bba07f5d4939541d1cd451d6de5befaca64864a4a0c5f76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
