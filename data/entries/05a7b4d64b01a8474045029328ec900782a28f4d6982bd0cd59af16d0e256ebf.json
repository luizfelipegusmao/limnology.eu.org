Many government agencies have a role in monitoring, responding to, and confirming a harmful algal bloom (HAB). HAB scientists have important information to share, however, given the complexities of HABs, which often involve decoupled drivers from observed impacts, presents challenges to outreach and engagement. Understanding key audience information needs can help scientists prioritize key science communication and engagement opportunities to maximize the impact of such efforts. Scientists may need additional science communication training or support for scientist-community partnerships. This will be evermore important into the future with the likely range expansion of HABs due to climate change.</p>","author":"Erica Clites, \nHeather Triezenberg, \nDiane Doberneck","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Contemporary Water Research & Education: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b3db72dc581bb02a697df2c99e39cca4549085da8786047d814851ca018c4f9a","entryHash":"05a7b4d64b01a8474045029328ec900782a28f4d6982bd0cd59af16d0e256ebf","category":"Environment"}
