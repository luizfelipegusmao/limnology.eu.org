{"title":"Epidemiology and referral patterns of patients living with chronic kidney disease in Johannesburg, South Africa: A single centre experience","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003119","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Yusuf Urade, Zaheera Cassimjee, Chandni Dayal, Sheetal Chiba, Adekunle Ajayi, Malcolm Davies</p>\r\n\r\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant contributor to the global burden of non-communicable disease. Early intervention may facilitate slowing down of progression of CKD; recognition of at-risk patient groups may improve detection through screening. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 960 patients attending a specialist nephrology outpatient clinic during the period 1 January 2011â€“31 December 2021. A significant proportion (47.8%) of patients were referred with established CKD stage G4 or G5. Non-national immigration status, previous diagnosis with diabetes, and advancing age were associated with late referral; antecedent diagnosis with HIV reduced the odds of late referral. Black African patients comprised most of the sample cohort and were younger at referral and more frequently female than other ethnicities; non-nationals were younger at referral than South Africans. Hypertension-associated kidney disease was the leading ascribed aetiological factor for CKD (40.7% of cases), followed by diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (19%), glomerular disease (12.5%), and HIV-associated kidney disease (11.8%). Hypertension-related (25.9%) and diabetic (10.7%) kidney diseases were not uncommon in people living with HIV. Advancing age and male sex increased the likelihood of diagnosis with hypertensive nephropathy, DKD and obstructive uropathy; males were additionally at increased risk of HIV-associated kidney disease and nephrotoxin exposure, as were patients of Black African ethnicity. In summary, this data shows that hypertension, diabetes, and HIV remain important aetiological factors in CKD in the South African context. Despite the well-described risk of CKD in these disorders, referral to nephrology services occurs late. Interventions and policy actions targeting at-risk populations are required to improve referral practices.","author":"Yusuf Urade","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"0960d07a3b0c4c9fa9257889ec1f064d3d4660b1ce5c5d74322f4b4995722864","category":"Environment"}
