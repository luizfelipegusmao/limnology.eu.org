{"title":"Making fetch happen: Prevalence and characteristics of fetching behavior in owned domestic cats (<i>Felis catus</i>) and dogs (<i>Canis familiaris</i>)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309068","date":1725458400000,"content":"<p>by Mikel M.

In this study, we assessed data from online surveys of cat and dog behavior (Fe-BARQ; C-BARQ) completed by cat (N = 8224) and dog owners (N = 73724). We assessed responses to the items \"Plays ‘fetch’; likes to retrieve thrown objects or toys\" (Fe-BARQ) and “Will ʻfetchʼ or attempt to fetch sticks, balls, or objects” (C-BARQ). Cats and dogs described as \"sometimes,\" \"usually\" or \"always\" fetching were categorized as fetchers. Regression models were used to examine which animal-related (e.g., sex, age) and environmental factors best predicted fetching, and chi-square tests were used to explore the effect of breed on fetching behavior. Fetching was reported in 40.9% of cats and 77.8% of dogs. In cats, fetching was correlated with play and activity. In dogs, fetching was correlated with overall trainability. In both cats and dogs, being female, older, living with (other) dogs, and having health problems decreased the likelihood of fetching. Breed effects were observed in both species, with fetching more prominent in cat breeds originating in the Far East (e.g., Burmese, Siamese, and Tonkinese) and in dog breeds from the Retriever, UK Rural, Poodle, Pointer and Spaniel clades. We discuss the results in the context of domestication history of both cats and dogs and posit several hypotheses about why fetching behavior is observed in both.","author":"Mikel M.
