R.Dahlgren) herbal tea is popular due to its health-promoting properties. Information on its characteristic sensory profile is scarce and sensory tools to define product variation are needed. The storage conditions and time during its shelf-life are hypothesized to affect the product quality.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Production batches from two producers spanning 5 years (<i>n</i> = 57) were analyzed using descriptive sensory analysis. Primary attributes (&gt;30 median intensity; 100% occurrence frequency) included ‘hay/dried grass’, ‘cooked oats’, ‘tobacco’, ‘honey’ and ‘caramel’ aromas, and astringent mouthfeel. ‘Cooked vegetables’, ‘green grass’, ‘stewed fruit’, ‘rooibos-woody’, ‘marmalade’ and ‘cardboard’ aromas, sweet taste and bitter taste were secondary attributes (10–20 median intensity; 100% occurrence frequency). The same flavor attributes were present, except for sweet-associated and fruity notes. A sensory lexicon and sensory wheels for aroma and palate attributes were constructed from the data. The shelf-life stability of green rooibos was evaluated in moisture-impermeable (pouches) and moisture-permeable (sachets) packaging at 25 and 40 °C at 60% relative humidity over 24 weeks. Green rooibos samples stored in pouches at 4 °C were also evaluated. Storage in sachets led to moisture uptake (~10 g (100 g)<sup>−1</sup> dry basis) and an increase in water activity (&gt;0.6), causing degradation of chlorophyll and dihydrochalcones. Changes in color and sensory profile (decreased vegetal, cereal and cardboard aromas and increased sweet-associated and fruity aromas) were evident and more pronounced at the higher storage temperature.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>Storage at ≤25 °C in moisture-impermeable packaging material is recommended for green rooibos herbal tea. © 2024 The Authors.
