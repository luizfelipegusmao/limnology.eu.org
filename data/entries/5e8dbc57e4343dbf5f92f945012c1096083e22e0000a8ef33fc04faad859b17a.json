Recently, Nion’s monochromated EELS-STEM system has achieved a remarkable combination of an energy resolution of 2.6 meV and a spatial resolution of 1.1 Å at 20 kV [<a href=\"#ozae044.127-B2\">2</a>]. Despite these advancements, the low beam current of the monochromated electron probe leads to a long acquisition time for EELS hyperspectral datasets, from 30 minutes to a few hours, to reach a good signal-to-noise ratio. Consequently, such extended durations introduce noticeable sample drifts, especially in atomic resolution tasks. To address this issue, we propose a rigid image registration-based algorithm. By aligning the vibrational EELS hyperspectral dataset, we can compensate for drift and minimize image distortion due to the effects of thermal drifting and beam charging. As a result, we can now achieve arbitrarily long exposure datasets with improved atomic features.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5e8dbc57e4343dbf5f92f945012c1096083e22e0000a8ef33fc04faad859b17a","category":"Environment"}
