{"title":"Event-Triggered Two-Part Separation Control of Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on Extended Observer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2105/v1","date":1724924074000,"content":"In this paper, we investigated the formation isolation regulation issue regarding multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) characterized by a \"leader-follower\" framework. Considering the cooperative-competitive relationship among the follower AUVs and the impact of unknown external disturbances, an extended state observer was designed based on backstepping to mitigate these disturbances, and an event-triggered control scheme was designed to realize the two-part consensus control within the multi-AUV system. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, it is shown that the system achieves asymptotic steadiness and is free from zeno behavior under the proposed event-triggered control scheme. Finally, numerical simulations confirm the efficiency of the regulation strategy in achieving formation separation within the multi-AUV, where the trajectory tracking errors of individual AUVs gather in a compact vicinity close to the source and the structure converges was achieved, with the absence of zeno behavior also demonstrated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"faea76cc63c9b399c0b597b7ac7e0d2ffb0cacbe63b89202fbb8d65579418809","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
