This study focuses on the controlled synthesis of nanoparticles, particularly in tailoring their morphology to enhance the efficiency of catalysts made from noble metals such as platinum and palladium. Altering the morphology of nanoparticles changes the exposed surface facets, directly impacting their catalytic performance. However, despite advancements in nanoparticle synthesis, achieving perfect uniformity remains a challenge. Individual nanoparticles exhibit slight variations in size and shape, even when synthesized under the same conditions. For this reason, there is a limitation in directly correlating the surface structure of nanoparticles with catalytic activity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8b8e4b00acd9c0da115de19581ef8c5a05430f7c942a4a6bb233b13c5c0d4ba6","category":"Environment"}
