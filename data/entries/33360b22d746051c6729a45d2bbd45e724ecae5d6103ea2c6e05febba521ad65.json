{"title":"237 Disrupted insulin signaling due to an acute immune response in swine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/198/7664868?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Insulin is an anabolic hormone involved in glucose uptake and synthesis of fats, proteins, and glycogen. Altered insulin signaling can occur due to metabolic state, pathogen exposure, and autoimmune disorders. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin secreted produced by gram-negative bacteria, can induce a severe, systemic immune response. In pigs, chronic LPS exposure has induced insulin resistance. However, the effects of acute exposure to LPS on insulin signaling and resistance have not been elucidated. Crossbred nursery pigs [n = 58, initial body weight (BW) = 12.1 kg ± 0.23 kg] were randomly assigned into two experimental subsets, where 10 animals were designated for repeated blood sampling and 48 animals underwent timed euthanasia for tissue collection. For repeated blood sampling, jugular catheters were placed under anesthesia and the animals were given 48 h to recover before being randomly assigned to treatments. These treatments were an intraperitoneal injection of either 15µg/kg BW LPS or an equal volume of 0.9% Saline (n = 5 pigs/treatment). Blood was collected for 48 h followed by euthanasia. The other 48 pigs were randomly assigned to the same treatments, and then randomly assigned to euthanasia timepoints of 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 or 48 h post injection for tissue collection. Among the catheterized pigs, 2-h post LPS challenge there was a decrease in serum insulin concentration (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and mild hyperglycemia (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) post challenge. At 12- and 24-h post LPS challenge there was a decrease in insulin (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and a trend hyperglycemia was also apparent at 24 h (<span>P</span> = 0.063). In liver tissue, insulin related genes exhibited alterations post LPS injection. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs1) expression were decreased at 3 and 6 h (p&lt; 0.05) and protein kinase b (akt) expression were decreased at 3 h (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) post challenge. The expression of insulin inhibitor growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (grb10) was decreased at 6-, 12-, and 24-h after challenge (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Fructose-1-6-bisphosphatase (f16bp) expression was reduced at 3-, 6-, and 12-h (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in the liver while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) expression was decreased at 3- and 6-h (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) post challenge. Other metabolic genes were decreased at 3-, 6-, and 12-h post LPS challenge, including fatty acid synthase (fas; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), carbohydrate response element binding protein (chrebp; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), and acetyl CoA carboxylase (acc; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Protein abundance of Akt 3 h after LPS injection was decreased in the liver (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In skeletal muscle 6 h post LPS injection, insulin receptor (insr), insulin-like growth factor receptor (igfr) and fas were all increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) These results indicate disrupted insulin signaling at various levels after an acute immune response.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"33360b22d746051c6729a45d2bbd45e724ecae5d6103ea2c6e05febba521ad65","category":"Environment"}
