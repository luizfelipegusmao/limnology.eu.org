During the 90-day experiment, typical pollutant removal effects of wastewater and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) accumulation were investigated. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the phase composition and surface morphology to analyze adsorptive property. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of siphon effluent on clogging and depolymerization by measuring the EPS components' evolution within the system. The findings reveal that both the anthracite and shale ceramsite systems exhibit impressive removal efficiencies for total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>-N). However, as the experiment progressed, TP removal rates in both systems gradually declined because of the saturation of adsorption sites on the substrate surfaces. Although the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels remained relatively stable throughout the experiment, pH exhibited distinct patterns, suggesting that the anthracite system relies primarily on chemical adsorption, whereas the shale ceramsite system predominantly utilizes physical adsorption. After an initial period of fluctuation, the permeability coefficient and porosity of the system gradually stabilized, and the protein and polysaccharide contents in both systems exhibited a downward trend. The study underscores that anthracite and shale ceramsite have good effectiveness in pollutant removal as substrate materials. Overall, the hydraulic conditions of the double repeated oxygen coupling siphon in the Sc-VSsFCW system contribute to enhanced re-oxygenation capacity and permeability coefficient during operation. The changes in EPS content indicate that the siphon effluent exerts a certain depolymerization effect on the EPS within the system, thereby mitigating the risk of biological clogging to a certain extent.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe system can still maintain good pollutant treatment effect in long-term operation.\nThe re-oxygenation method of the system can achieve efficient and long-term re-oxygenation effect.\nThe siphon effluent has a certain improvement effect on the permeability coefficient and porosity, but it cannot effectively inhibit the occurrence of clogging.\nThe EPS content did not change significantly during the operation of the system, and there was a risk of biological clogging.\n</p>","author":"Cheng Jiang, \nLin Qiu, \nHao Wu, \nFahui Nie, \nYong Liu, \nWenping Cao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"2ed197d056167e2bc048d6099d1141c0f1c23fab959d2cb1291027856f3757ce","category":"Environment"}
