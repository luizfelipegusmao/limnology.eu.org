{"title":"Black blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) bacterial symbionts inform oviposition site selection by stable flies (Diptera: Muscidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae040/7643336?rss=1","date":1712707200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Larval habitats of blood-feeding stable flies, <span>Stomoxys calcitrans</span> (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), overlap with foraging sites of black blow flies, <span>Phormia regina</span> (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). We tested the hypothesis that bacteria in blow fly excreta inform oviposition decisions by female stable flies. In laboratory 2-choice bioassays, we offered gravid female stable flies fabric-covered agar plates as oviposition sites that were kept sterile or inoculated with either a blend of 7 bacterial strains isolated from blow fly excreta (7-isolate-blend) or individual bacterial isolates from that blend. The 7-isolate-blend deterred oviposition by female stable flies, as did either of 2 strains of <span>Morganella morganii</span> subsp. <span>sibonii</span>. Conversely, <span>Exiguobacterium</span> sp. and <span>Serratia marcescens</span> each prompted oviposition by flies. The fliesâ€™ oviposition decisions appear to be guided by bacteria-derived semiochemicals as the bacteria could not be physically accessed. Oviposition deterrence caused by semiochemicals of the 7-isolate-blend may help stable flies avoid competition with blow flies. The semiochemicals of bioactive bacterial strains could be developed as trap lures to attract and capture flies and deter their oviposition in select larval habitats.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"820ea08459d7c76e9114f3005dd0274ef4c4a3bd3f1ed991fc5359cd55cee43d","category":"Environment"}
