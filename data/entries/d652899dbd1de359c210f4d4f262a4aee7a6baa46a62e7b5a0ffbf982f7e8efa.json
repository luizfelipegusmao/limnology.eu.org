{"title":"Time-series analysis of remotely sensed biophysical parameters and their effects on land surface temperature (LST): a case study of Aligarh region, India","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11600-023-01252-9","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The temporal behaviors of land surface temperature (LST) coupled with its associated parameters play a crucial role in determining the microclimate at the city scale. The increasing pattern of LST and consequent changes in biophysical parameters (parameters specify the amalgamation of living system with their physical characteristics including vegetation, water, built-up, bareness and drought parameters) at monthly, seasonal and annual time spans and from regional to global scale need to be comprehensively evaluated. The present study deals with LST estimation along with other spectral indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) using Landsat series datasets from 1991 to 2022 of Aligarh city, Uttar Pradesh, India. The spatial pattern of LST indicates that the areas having water bodies and dense vegetation are colder such as the Aligarh Muslim University Campus and the catchment of Ganga canal areas, whereas the areas of high urbanization and bare grounds reflect high LST trends. Study finds a positive correlation of LST with NDBI (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>-0.56), NDBaI (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>-0.22) and NDWI (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>-0.22), whereas a negative correlation with NDVI (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>-0.35), MNDWI (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>-0.36) and NMDI (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>-0.41). Land use land cover (LULC)-based change detection in land cover classes was found consistent with the obtained results for spectral indices and LST patterns in the study area. Finally, the cross-validation using Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis-based products of earth skin temperature and rainfall showed a good fit between observed and reanalysis products.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"d652899dbd1de359c210f4d4f262a4aee7a6baa46a62e7b5a0ffbf982f7e8efa","category":"Environment"}
