{"title":"Olive Growing Farming System and Damage by Cicadas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2083/v1","date":1724920848000,"content":"Although cicadas have traditionally been considered pests of little or no importance, since the beginning of this century, an increase in damages is being recorded in olive groves of southern Spain. According to our hypothesis, the new agricultural practices would be behind it. During 2024, Intensive sampling has been carried out in organic grove, with herbaceus cover (VC2), and a second one with mixed vegetation cover (VC1, in which the crushed remains of the annual pruning are added). In both ecological groves, inventories of the vegetation have been carried out, as well as intensive sampling in the olive canopy, with the densities of oviposition injuries being recorded and compared with respect to conventional management (CONV). The objectives of this study: (1) to quantify the density of oviposition lesions under these three different farming systems; (2) to determine priority areas for cicadas oviposition within trees; (3) to develop a sampling method to assess damage over large areas. The results show significant increases in density of injuries in organic groves, with maximum values recorded in the olive grove with mixed cover. Oviposition injuries show an altitudinal gradient distribution, with maximum values in the lower zone. The factors involved are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed893cb56a8112e31f032127d513d33a1fc12bb6f56c9b08dabc2b880de6877a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
