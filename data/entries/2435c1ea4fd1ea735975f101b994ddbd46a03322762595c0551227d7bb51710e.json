{"title":"Combining enhanced spectral resolution of EMG and a deep learning approach for knee pathology diagnosis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302707","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Ateka Khader, Ala’a Zyout, Amjed Al Fahoum</p>\r\n\r\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent, debilitating joint condition primarily affecting the elderly. This investigation aims to develop an electromyography (EMG)-based method for diagnosing knee pathologies. EMG signals of the muscles surrounding the knee joint were examined and recorded. The principal components of the proposed method were preprocessing, high-order spectral analysis (HOSA), and diagnosis/recognition through deep learning. EMG signals from individuals with normal and OA knees while walking were extracted from a publicly available database. This examination focused on the quadriceps femoris, the medial gastrocnemius, the rectus femoris, the semitendinosus, and the vastus medialis. Filtration and rectification were utilized beforehand to eradicate noise and smooth EMG signals. Signals’ higher-order spectra were analyzed with HOSA to obtain information about nonlinear interactions and phase coupling. Initially, the bicoherence representation of EMG signals was devised. The resulting images were fed into a deep-learning system for identification and analysis. A deep learning algorithm using adapted ResNet101 CNN model examined the images to determine whether the EMG signals were conventional or indicative of knee osteoarthritis. The validated test results demonstrated high accuracy and robust metrics, indicating that the proposed method is effective. The medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle was able to distinguish Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients from normal with 96.3±1.7% accuracy and 0.994±0.008 AUC. MG has the highest prediction accuracy of KOA and can be used as the muscle of interest in future analysis. Despite the proposed method’s superiority, some limitations still require special consideration and will be addressed in future research.","author":"Ateka Khader","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2435c1ea4fd1ea735975f101b994ddbd46a03322762595c0551227d7bb51710e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
