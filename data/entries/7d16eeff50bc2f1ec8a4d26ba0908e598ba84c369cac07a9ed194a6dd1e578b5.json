{"title":"PTPN7 mediates macrophage‐polarization and determines immunotherapy in gliomas: A single‐cell sequencing analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24259?af=R","date":1712389509000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 7 (PTPN7) is a signaling molecule that regulates a multitude of cellular processes, spanning cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, the mitotic cycle, and oncogenic metamorphosis. However, the characteristic of PTPN7 in the glioma microenvironment has yet to be elucidated.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The prognostic value, genomic features, immune characteristics, chemotherapy prediction, and immunotherapy prediction of PTPN7 were systematically explored at the bulk sequencing level. The cell evolution trajectory, cell communication pattern, and cell metabolic activity related to PTPN7 were systematically explored at the single-cell sequencing level. HMC3 and M0 cells were cocultured with U251 and T98G cells, and flow cytometry was carried out to investigate the polarization of HMC3 and M0. Transwell assay and CCK-8 assay were performed to explore the migration and proliferation activity of U251 and T98G.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The expression level of PTPN7 is significantly elevated in glioma and indicates malignant features. PTPN7 expression predicts worse prognosis of glioma patients. PTPN7 is associated with genome alteration and immune infiltration. Besides, PTPN7 plays a crucial role in modulating metabolic and immunogenic processes, particularly by influencing the activity of microglia and macrophages through multiple signaling pathways involved in cellular communication. Specifically, PTPN7 actively mediates inflammation-resolving-polarization of macrophages and microglia and protects glioma from immune attack. PTPN7 could also predict the response of immunotherapy.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>PTPN7 is critically involved in inflammation-resolving-polarization mediated by macrophage and microglia and promotes the immune escape of glioma cells.</p>","author":"Xiang Ji, \nJingsong Cheng, \nJing Su, \nRong Wen, \nQi Zhang, \nGuodong Liu, \nYun Peng, \nJinning Mao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"7d16eeff50bc2f1ec8a4d26ba0908e598ba84c369cac07a9ed194a6dd1e578b5","category":"Environment"}
