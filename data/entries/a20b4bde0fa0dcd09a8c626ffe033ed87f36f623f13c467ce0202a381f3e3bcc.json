{"title":"Assessing the Influence of Market Dynamics on Supply Chain Sustainability in the Renewable Energy Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1201/v1","date":1715956008000,"content":"This qualitative research investigates the intricate relationship between market dynamics and supply chain sustainability in the renewable energy sector. Amidst the global energy transition, renewable energy has emerged as a crucial player in mitigating climate change and fostering sustainable development. However, ensuring the sustainability of renewable energy supply chains presents complex challenges shaped by various market forces. Through semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, this study explores how policy frameworks, technological innovation, market competition, consumer preferences, and investor demands influence sustainability practices across the renewable energy supply chain. The findings highlight the critical role of supportive policy environments, technological advancements, and stakeholder collaboration in driving sustainability performance and mitigating risks within renewable energy supply chains. Furthermore, the study identifies challenges such as supply chain complexity, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder engagement, underscoring the need for collaborative efforts and multi-stakeholder partnerships. By addressing these challenges and leveraging opportunities, stakeholders can advance sustainability goals, mitigate climate change impacts, and foster a more resilient and equitable renewable energy sector. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of market dynamics and supply chain sustainability in the renewable energy sector, offering insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and sustainability practitioners to inform evidence-based decision-making and drive positive change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a20b4bde0fa0dcd09a8c626ffe033ed87f36f623f13c467ce0202a381f3e3bcc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
