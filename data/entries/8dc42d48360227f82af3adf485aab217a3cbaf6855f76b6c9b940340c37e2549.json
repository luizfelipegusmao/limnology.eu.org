{"title":"A Cryo-TEM Study of Phase Transition in Lecithin-Water-Ethanol Mixtures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.989/7720336?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The spontaneous organization of amphiphilic molecules in water by self-assembly is a hallmark of biology [<a href=\"#ozae044.989-B1\">1</a>]. The typical amphiphiles in mammalian cells are phospholipids, which are generically termed ‘lecithins’. These lipids have a phosphatidylcholine head that is hydrophilic and two alkyl tails that are hydrophobic [<a href=\"#ozae044.989-B2\">2</a>]. When lecithin is added to water, it assembles into bilayer membranes (so-called because the lipids are arranged in a head-tail-tail-head fashion). These membranes, in turn, can fold to form closed spherical structures, i.e., vesicles. These vesicles (∼100 nm diameter) can be transformed into small micelles (∼5 nm diameter) by a variety of destabilizing agents such as single-tailed surfactants and alcohols [<a href=\"#ozae044.989-B3\">3</a>]. In a surfactant-induced vesicle-micelle transition (VMT), vesicles steadily convert to micelles upon adding the surfactant – and in turn, the turbidity of the solution drops monotonically. Although lecithin-water-ethanol mixtures have been studied for more than 50 years, no detailed research on their phase behavior have yet been published. To understand the nanostructure of lecithin in liquid, a comprehensive study of a simple system of lipid vesicles (e.g., lecithin) in water + ethanol was thus undertaken using a variety of techniques, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). This paper reports the investigation of structural change/phase transition in lecithin-water-ethanol mixture using cryo-TEM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8dc42d48360227f82af3adf485aab217a3cbaf6855f76b6c9b940340c37e2549","category":"Environment"}
