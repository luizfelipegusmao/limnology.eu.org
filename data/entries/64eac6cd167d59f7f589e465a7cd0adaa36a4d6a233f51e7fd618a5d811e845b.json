{"title":"Gender Disparities in Urban Design: A Review of the Impact of Urban Design on Shaping Women's Social Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1525/v1","date":1721314283000,"content":"Urban environments play a crucial role in shaping the lived experiences of women, yet traditional urban design practices often neglect the diverse needs and identities of women, perpetuating social barriers and gender inequalities. This review paper seeks to explore the existing research on how urban design influences women's social challenges in cities. By synthesizing literature from urban planning, architecture, gender studies, and sociology, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of urban design on women's experiences and opportunities in urban spaces. The review highlights gender disparities in urban design, inclusivity in urban planning, and the need for gender-sensitive approaches to address these disparities. Key scholars, including Susan S. Fainstein, Leslie Kern, Sharon Zukin, Daphne Spain, and Vandana Shiva, have contributed significantly to understanding gender disparities in urban spaces and advocating for more inclusive and equitable urban environments. The discussion emphasizes the importance of community engagement, participatory planning processes, and an intersectional lens in urban design to ensure that women's voices and needs are effectively incorporated into decision-making processes. Future research directions include exploring the role of technology, smart city initiatives, and addressing the impacts of gentrification and urban redevelopment on women's access to housing and resources. By advancing research on gender equity in city planning, we can work towards creating more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable urban environments that benefit all residents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64eac6cd167d59f7f589e465a7cd0adaa36a4d6a233f51e7fd618a5d811e845b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
