Findings indicate that a lifestyle program might facilitate glycemic benefits of testosterone therapy and that testosterone treatment might be more effective for the prevention of type 2 diabetes rather than for the treatment of established, longstanding type 2 diabetes. \n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In epidemiological studies, lowered serum testosterone concentrations are common in men with obesity, prediabetes, and established type 2 diabetes (T2D). In men with prediabetes, lowered serum testosterone also predicts a future risk of T2D in men. Administration of testosterone consistently reduces fat mass and increases skeletal muscle massâ€”body compositional changes expected to be metabolically favorable. In men with established T2D, the effects of testosterone treatment on glycemic measures are inconsistent. Irrespective of baseline serum testosterone concentration in men with prediabetes or newly diagnosed early-onset T2D, testosterone treatment prescribed in conjunction with a lifestyle program has been reported to reduce the risk of T2D by 40% after 2 years, suggesting that either a lifestyle program is required to facilitate the glycemic benefit of testosterone treatment and/or that testosterone treatment has more favorable effects on glycemia in men early in the evolution or onset of the disease. The durability of the benefit and longer-term safety of testosterone treatment have not been established. Therefore, more studies are required before testosterone treatment can be recommended for the prevention and/or treatment of men with or at elevated risk of T2D who do not have hypogonadism due to an established disease of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.</p>","author":"Mathis Grossmann, \nGary A.
