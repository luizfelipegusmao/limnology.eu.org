The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether salt-tolerant bacteria or a 60 kg/ha nitrogen amendment could increase the salinity tolerance of alfalfa; 2) assess whether recurrent selections for salt tolerance in alfalfa populations would differentially interact with soil bacteria.</p>\n                  </span>\n                  <span>\n                    <h3>Methods</h3>\n                    <p>Three alfalfa generations sequentially selected for improved salt tolerance were inoculated with either highly salt-tolerant (<em>H. maura</em>), moderately-tolerant (<em>Ensifer meliloti</em>) bacteria, or a 60 kg/ha nitrogen amendment in either non- (0 dS/m), moderate-(8 dS/m), or highly (16 dS/m) saline soil in the greenhouse.</p>\n                  </span>\n                  <span>\n                    <h3>Results</h3>\n                    <p>Recurrent selection of alfalfa in salinity stress causes increased chlorophyll content, stem count, and plant height; however, yield loss occurred under 120 d of moderate salinity stress. Improved alfalfa generations in combination with nitrogen amendments were able to produce the highest biomass yields in moderate salinity stress. <em>E. meliloti</em> had a positive effect during regrowth, and it increased proline content in both shoot and root tissue. In comparison, <em>H. maura</em> provided no discernible benefits to alfalfa under salt stress.</p>\n                  </span>\n                  <span>\n                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n                    <p>Recurrent plant selection combined with N-fixing rhizobium could increase alfalfa growth under a multi-harvest system. As alfalfa positively responded to N fertilizer and N fixing rhizobium, improvement of alfalfa traits related to nitrogen utilization and biological N fixation may be vital to alfalfa salt tolerance.</p>\n                  </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"49ec29358cffc4d184c3f9791aa187777e0246fe2d5d98c9c447aa631803b0b4","category":"Environment"}
