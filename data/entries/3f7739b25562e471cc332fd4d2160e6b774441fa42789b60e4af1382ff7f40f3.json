{"title":"Little Learners Go 360: Evaluating the Impact of 360o Videos on Kindergarten Studentsâ€™ Understanding of Wild Animals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1611/v1","date":1719224003000,"content":"In recent years, 360o videos have gained the attention of researchers investigating their educational potential. Given the ongoing debate about their impact on learning, particularly with young students where existing research is minimal, a comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate their effectiveness relative to other media forms. The study involved 44 kindergarten students learning about wild animals over nine sessions. The 360o videos were compared to printed materials and conventional videos to measure knowledge acquisition, motivation, enjoyment/positive feelings, immersion, and ease of use. The findings suggest that, compared to printed materials, 360o videos enhance knowledge acquisition. However, this advantage does not extend to comparisons with conventional videos. Similarly, while enjoyment and motivation were higher for 360o videos compared to printed materials, they did not surpass those associated with conventional videos. Despite their potential, 360o videos were deemed the least easy to use, likely due to the employment of low-cost HMDs. Immersion emerged as the only factor where 360o videos excelled, demonstrating a notable influence on learning outcomes. The implications of the study are also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f7739b25562e471cc332fd4d2160e6b774441fa42789b60e4af1382ff7f40f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
