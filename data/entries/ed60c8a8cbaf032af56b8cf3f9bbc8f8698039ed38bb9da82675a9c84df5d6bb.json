{"title":"Some Transmembrane Proteins Of Salmonella Typhimurium Are Potential Drug Targets: An In Silico Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1047/v1","date":1715771806000,"content":"Salmonella sp. is a globally prevalent organism responsible for causing salmonellosis, a foodborne illness. Salmonella Typhimurium represents a type of Salmonella sp. not associated with typhoid fever but capable of causing stomach and intestinal inflammation or severe infection. In the present study, 150 uncharacterized proteins of S. Typhimurium were randomly selected from UniProtKB and analyzed using TMHMM, PROSITE, STRING, DEG, and BLASTp. Results indicated that 32 uncharacterized proteins (21%) were predicted to be transmembrane proteins involved in various biological pathways. Among them, 30 transmembrane proteins were predicted to be essential and non-host homologous. This study's findings suggest their potential as drug targets against salmonellosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed60c8a8cbaf032af56b8cf3f9bbc8f8698039ed38bb9da82675a9c84df5d6bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
