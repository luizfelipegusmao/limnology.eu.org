However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying NO<sub>2</sub>-mediated processes in plants, and the involvement of specific molecules in these processes, remain unknown. We measured hypocotyl elongation and the transcript levels of <em>PIF4</em>, encoding a bHLH transcription factor, and its target genes in wild-type (WT) and various <em>pif</em> mutants grown in the presence or absence of 50 ppb NO<sub>2</sub>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to quantify binding of PIF4 to the promoter regions of its target genes. NO<sub>2</sub> suppressed hypocotyl elongation in WT plants, but not in the <em>pifq</em> or <em>pif4</em> mutants. NO<sub>2</sub> suppressed the expression of target genes of PIF4, but did not affect the transcript level of the <em>PIF4</em> gene itself or the level of PIF4 protein. NO<sub>2</sub> inhibited the binding of PIF4 to the promoter regions of two of its target genes, <em>SAUR46</em> and <em>SAUR67</em>. In conclusion, NO<sub>2</sub> inhibits the binding of PIF4 to the promoter regions of genes involved in the auxin pathway to suppress hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis. Consequently, PIF4 emerges as a pivotal participant in this regulatory process. This study has further clarified the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing plant responses to environmental pollutants, thereby advancing our understanding of how plants adapt to changing atmospheric conditions.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"fa2427ba4c7e070a7abe83f7527a13f3b3c11cec611cbf88bc3ef8c02df524ab","category":"Environment"}
