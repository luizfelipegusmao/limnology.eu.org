{"title":"Machine Learning-Driven Design of High-Elastocaloric NiTi-Based Shape Memory Alloys","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1415/v1","date":1724240738000,"content":"In recent years, due to the detrimental impact of traditional gas-liquid refrigerants on the environment, the pursuit of solid-state refrigeration technology based on elastocaloric effect, as a promising sustainable alternative, has been promoted. However, the traditional trial-and-error method is inefficient and difficult to meet the material application requirements. In this work, machine learning (ML) was employed to accelerate the development of NiTi-based shape memory alloy (SMA) with excellent elastocaloric effect. By means of active learning, we identified 9 novel NiTi-based SMAs in four iterations, the phase transformation-induced entropy change (ΔS) of which are as high as over 90 J/kg·K-1. Moreover, the model exhibits good interpretability, allowing us to understand the relevance between the target and features from the aspect of mechanism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7db2519f6286afe207f35961f6beceb1727da685e22a933e77b91e69fd4e5f2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
