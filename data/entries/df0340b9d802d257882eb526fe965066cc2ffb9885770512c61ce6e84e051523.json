This study primarily intends to collect primary data from 143 plant managers and supervisors through the structured questionnaires at select manufacturing companies in south India on the basis of area-cum-purposive sampling technique. The survey questionnaire is designed exclusively to reflect the sustainability assessment dimensions in terms of social, economic and environmental issues to examine the impetus of WCSM implementation on the competitive advantage of manufacturing companies. The empirical findings of this study clearly revealed that sustainable manufacturing practices, sustainability programs, creation of sustainable products, safety for employee, community and product, operational efficiency and integration of sustainability goals in day-to-day manufacturing activities were considered to be the key indicators by the manufacturing firms in their never-ending journey towards becoming the world class. Moreover, the WCSM practices &amp; techniques adopted by sample manufacturers have a substantial positive influence on the achievement of competitive advantage in their manufacturing and business operations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df0340b9d802d257882eb526fe965066cc2ffb9885770512c61ce6e84e051523","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
