{"title":"Knowledge toward quality improvement among Jordanian nursing students: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311786","date":1728396000000,"content":"<p>by Saleh Al Omar, Anas H. Khalifeh, Bahaaeddin M. Hammad, Zakaria M. Abdelrahim</p>\r\nBackground <p>Nurses have a critical role in quality improvement (QI) and patient safety. This necessitates gaining knowledge and mastering QI abilities to lead and participate in QI programs in clinical practice.</p> Aim <p>To assess undergraduate nursing students’ knowledge about QI, and experience of patient safety situation; and examine the relationship between obtaining information on healthcare quality and knowledge about QI in Jordan.</p> Design <p>A descriptive cross-sectional correlational design was used. The study engaged undergraduate nursing students from two Jordanian universities (Public and private universities). A convenient sample of 147 nursing undergraduate students from universities.</p> Methods <p>Data were collected using paper-based self-reported questionnaires. The Quality Improvement Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (QulSKA) survey and the Healthcare Professional Patient Safety Assessment Curriculum Survey (HPPSACS) were used to assess knowledge about QI and patient safety.</p> Results <p>Out of 152 students, 147 completed the study. Overall, QI knowledge was moderate (mean score 57.7). Students from the private university scored significantly higher than public university students. Regarding patient safety, 74.8% of students observed medical errors in clinical areas. However, only 57.1% of the students disclosed a medical error to a faculty member. Also, the results showed a significant positive correlation between knowledge level about QI and obtaining information about QI, quality in healthcare, and patient safety from sources other than the undergraduate nursing program at universities (<i>p</i>≤.001).</p> Conclusions <p>This study suggests a potential gap in QI education. Integrating QI concepts into nursing curricula may be necessary to prepare future nurses for healthcare quality improvement.</p>","author":"Saleh Al Omar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"31ae81a5e9cd4157d55eb955fa12fa67ae1e3b329e309e50c39db9c576859e72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
