Five highly infectious animal disease viruses including goat pox virus (GTPV), sheep pox virus (SPPV), lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), and African swine fever virus (ASFV) were used in this study. After capture, the viruses remained viable and recoverable by virus isolation (VI) using susceptible cell lines. To assess efficacy of recovery, the viruses were serially diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) and then subjected to virus capture using NMAPs. The NMAPs and the captured viruses were clarified on a magnetic stand, reconstituted in PBS or EMEM, and analyzed separately by VI and virus-specific qPCR/RT-qPCR. The results of the qPCR/RT-qPCR showed up to 100-fold increase in the sensitivity of detection of the viruses following virus capture compared to the untreated viruses from the same dilutions. NMAPs were used to capture and concentrate viruses from clinical specimens to determine diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) that were comparable (100%) to the untreated specimens. NMAPs were also used to capture spiked viruses from EDTA whole blood (EWB). Virus capture from EWB was partially blocked, most likely by hemoglobin (HMB), which also binds NMAPs and outcompetes the viruses. The effect of HMB could be removed by either dilution (in PBS) or using HemogloBind™ (Biotech Support Group; Monmouth Junction, NJ) that specifically binds and precipitates HMB. Enhanced recovery and detection of viruses using NMAPs can be applicable to other highly pathogenic animal viruses of agricultural importance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e4a5056fc7ed378b6f98098a43e97f5207535f7b4282a6dd16334ceea1f2c1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
