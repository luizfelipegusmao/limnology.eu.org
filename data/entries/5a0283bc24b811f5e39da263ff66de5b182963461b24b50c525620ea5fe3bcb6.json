{"title":"A Cross-Layer Secure and Energy-Efficient Framework for Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0518/v1","date":1728380471000,"content":"This survey delves into cross layer energy-efficient solutions and cutting-edge security measures for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The conventional security techniques are considered inadequate, leading to the suggestion of AI-powered intrusion detection systems and novel strategies such as blockchain integration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of secure and energy efficient cross-layer framework for IoT.We highlight the significance of developing IoT security for robust and sustainable connected systems. We discuss multi-layered security approaches and ways to enhance energy efficiency of resource-constrained devices in IoT networks. Finally, we identify open research issues and  future research directions in the emerging field ofcross-layer design for secure and energy efficient IoT networks. We expect this study will stimulate further research endeavors to build a secure and energy-efficient framework for next-generation IoT systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a0283bc24b811f5e39da263ff66de5b182963461b24b50c525620ea5fe3bcb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
