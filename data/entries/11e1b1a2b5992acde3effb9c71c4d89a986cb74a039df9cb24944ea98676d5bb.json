However, because of the erosion of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female human pluripotent stem cells, precise disease modeling often leads to failure. In this study, using a mathematical approach and induced pluripotent stem cells retaining XCI derived from patients with PCDH19 missense mutations, we found that heterotypic conditions, which are composed of wild-type and missense PCDH19, led to significant cell-to-cell proximity and impaired neuronal differentiation, accompanied by the aberrant accumulation of doublecortin, a microtubule-associated protein. Our findings suggest that ease of adhesion between cells expressing either wild-type or missense PCDH19 might lead to aberrant cell aggregation in early embryonic phases, causing poor neuronal development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"11e1b1a2b5992acde3effb9c71c4d89a986cb74a039df9cb24944ea98676d5bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
