{"title":"Direct Evidence of Phosphate Binding on Ferritin Based on Quantitative Elemental Analysis at the Single-Particle Level","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.830/7719867?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Field-effect transistor (FET) sensors are at the forefront of revolutionizing detection and analytical technologies, which hinges on the modulation of electrical conductivity through a semiconductor channel by the field effect of charged analytes, enabling the direct transduction of molecular interactions into measurable electrical signals. This unique capability allows for the real-time, label-free detection of a vast array of targets, from ions and small molecules to proteins and nucleic acids, making FET sensors attractive in various critical applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.830-B1\">1</a>]. A key component of a FET sensor is the capturing probe material on the surface of a gate electrode or a semiconductor channel, which plays a role to interact and bind with the target analyte (molecules or ions) to enable specific detection [<a href=\"#ozae044.830-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.830-B2\">2</a>]. For instance, ferritin, an iron-storage protein that is usually found in the liver and spleen of mammals and functions in transporting oxygen [<a href=\"#ozae044.830-B3\">3</a>] and involves in synthesizing phosphorus-containing molecules [<a href=\"#ozae044.830-B4\">4</a>], can be uniquely harnessed as a probe material of FET sensors for highly sensitive detection of phosphate ions [<a href=\"#ozae044.830-B5\">5</a>]. Beyond the detection, the highly selective interaction between ferritin and phosphates also opens an avenue for phosphorus removal and recovery from wastewater [<a href=\"#ozae044.830-B6\">6</a>]. However, the underlying mechanism for interactions between ferritin and phosphate ions has been rarely explored, especially at the level of single ferritin particle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7e3e9266e3eb160db000c1dd48c8e327304236db16a2d832ca8b30dcf139bbed","category":"Environment"}
