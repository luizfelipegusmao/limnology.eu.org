{"title":"From Neural Cords to Complex Brains: The Evolution of the Vertebrate Central Nervous System and Human Cognition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1961/v1","date":1729775993000,"content":"Abstract The evolution of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) represents one of the most remarkable examples of biological complexity emergence. This review traces the developmental trajectory of the CNS from early chordates to modern humans, highlighting key evolutionary innovations. The primitive nerve cord of early chordates evolved into increasingly specialized structures, with major transitions including the development of the tripartite brain, the emergence of the telencephalon, and the progressive elaboration of the cerebral cortex. Critical evolutionary adaptations included the development of neural crest cells, the regionalization of brain structures, and the remarkable expansion of associative areas. The mammalian radiation brought significant advances in brain organization, particularly in the neocortex. The primate lineage witnessed further elaboration of cortical areas, culminating in the human brain's unique features: expanded prefrontal cortex, enhanced connectivity, and sophisticated neural networks supporting advanced cognitive capabilities. This evolutionary journey illuminates how incremental changes in neural organization laid the foundation for human consciousness and cognitive complexity.
