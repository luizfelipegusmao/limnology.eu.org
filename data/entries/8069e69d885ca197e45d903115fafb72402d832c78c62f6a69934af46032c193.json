{"title":"Antioxidant Effect of a Plant‐Derived Extracellular Vesicles&rsquo; Mix on Human Skin Fibroblasts. Induction of a Reparative Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0288/v1","date":1725458822000,"content":"Plant-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (PDEVs) contain high levels of antioxidants, especially when deriving from organic. PDEVs from different vegetal sources has shown an increased antioxidant power, compared to PDEVs from single plants, suggesting a synergistic effect of the bioactives constitutively expressed in the PDEVs from single fruits. With this study we wanted to investigate the beneficial effects of a mix of PDEVs on human skin cells. We found detectable levels of Citric Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Glutathione, Catalase and SOD in a mix of PDEVs deriving from 5 different fruits (Grape, Red Orange, Papaya, Pomegranate and Tangerine). We then treated H2O2-conditioned fibroblasts with the mix of PDEVs. The results showed that the PDEVs ‘mix reverted the H2O2-induced redox imbalance, restoring the mitochondrial homeostasis, with a strong reduction of mitochondrial anion superoxide and increase of sirtuin levels. The antioxidant action was consistent with a wound repair on a lesion produced in a Fibroblasts’ monolayer. This result was consistent with an increased level of Vimentin and Matrix Metalloproteinase-9, whose expression is directly related to the efficiency of the reparative processes. These data support a beneficial role of PDEVs in both preventing and treating skin injuries, through their potent antioxidant and reparative activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8069e69d885ca197e45d903115fafb72402d832c78c62f6a69934af46032c193","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
