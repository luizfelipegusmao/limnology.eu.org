We examined the impact of grazing activities on the survival of the blue-eared pheasant <i>Crossoptilon auritum</i>, a ground-nesting bird endemic to subalpine forests. Using camera-trapping and artificial nest experiments, we compared two sites in Sichuan, China: Wanglang (high grazing intensity) and Jiuzhaigou (no grazing) national nature reserves. The study, conducted from 2017 to 2021, evaluated habitat suitability changes for these pheasants and examined the impact of grazing on nesting success by conducting a nest predation experiment. The results of our study showed that (1) since the significant increase of free-ranging livestock post-2014, the area of most suitable and moderately suitable habitats for blue-eared pheasants in Wanglang decreased by 14.28% (net loss 15.12 km<sup>2</sup>); (2) predominant natural predators of the pheasant, such as yellow-throated martens (<i>Martes flavigula</i>) and leopard cats (<i>Prionailurus bengalensis</i>), were mostly observed to be spatially distant from livestock; (3) the pheasant's nesting failure rate was 2.18 times higher in Wanglang than in Jiuzhaigou; (4) high-intensity livestock disturbance correlated with decreased food resources for pheasants, yet resulted in an increased abundance of Coleopteran insects. These results illustrate a complex dynamic: Although forest pheasants, such as the blue-eared pheasant, may initially benefit from the presence of livestock through increased predator refuge and access to specific food resources, they ultimately face greater risks. These include a significant increase in nest failure rates and remarkable habitat loss and degradation. In light of these results, we advocate for strict control and management of grazing activities inside reserves. Additionally, we recommend the implementation of a systematic monitoring program that focuses on the population dynamics and habitat use of endangered pheasants in Southwest China.</p><p>栖息地是野生动物赖以生存的活动场所，但由于放牧等人为活动，野生动物栖息地的退化和破碎化日益严重。为了解放牧活动对中国特有雉类蓝马鸡（<i>Crossoptilon auritum</i>）生存状况的影响，我们以四川王朗国家级自然保护区为研究区域，于2017-2021年,使用红外相机及样线调查等方法，结合保护区2002-2019年野外巡护监测数据，通过MaxEnt模型和双物种占域模型，分别分析了近20年来保护区内蓝马鸡栖息地适宜度变化和放牧活动对蓝马鸡天敌 (黄喉貂 (<i>Martes flavigula</i>)、豹猫 (<i>Prionailurus bengalensis</i>)) 的空间活动影响。同时，通过模拟实验和样方调查在王朗和九寨沟保护区（无放牧干扰）开展对比研究，，评估不同放牧强度下蓝马鸡营巢及动物性食物资源的差异。结果显示:(1）自2014年以来，王朗保护区散养家畜的活动导致蓝马鸡的潜在适宜栖息地减少了14.28%（15.12 km<sup>2</sup>）；(2）黄喉貂和豹猫在空间上多倾向于远离基础；(3）模拟巢实验表明王朗巢被破坏风险是九寨沟的2.18倍；(4）高强度的放牧活动，降低了雉类的食物资源，但提供了丰度更高的鞘翅目食物。蓝马鸡可能会被家畜活动带来的天敌避难所效应和更丰富的鞘翅目食物资源所吸引，但同时也会面临更大的营巢失败风险以及潜在栖息地的退化；同时，家畜活动给其他哺乳动物带来的负面影响也是不可低估的。基于上述结果，我们建议保护区严格控制区内放牧活动，并持续关注放牧系统的变化对蓝马鸡等濒危雉类种群动态及其天敌的活动情况的影响。</p>","author":"Xing Chen, \nXiao‐Tong Shang, \nFan Fan, \nYong Zheng, \nLian‐Jun Zhao, \nHong‐Ou Sun, \nSheng Li, \nLi Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Integrative Conservation: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b2434e359c647f096191c4befea99097fa9394fd28e02b126976eb35d9219c03","entryHash":"451198ba453a453f2f57cf0cf3cfa479c850ddede62f2d8fd3f96217f7934513","category":"Environment"}
