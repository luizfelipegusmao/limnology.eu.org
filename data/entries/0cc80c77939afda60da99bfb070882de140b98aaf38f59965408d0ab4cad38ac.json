The new species is supported by both morphological and molecular data, including species delimitation methods (Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning, Barcode Index Number, Poisson Tree Process and its Bayesian implementation, and Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent). The species is genetically close to other species that also exhibit the presence of scales on the isthmus, including <i>Characidium litorale</i>, <i>Characidium satoi</i>, <i>Characidium xanthopterum</i>, and <i>Characidium</i> aff. <i>zebra</i>. The high genetic diversity among <i>Characidium</i> species underscores the necessity of employing a complementary perspective in studies of this group. The discovery of a new species in the headwaters of the Rio Itararé further reinforces the importance of this biogeographic region for the conservation of ichthyofauna.</p>","author":"B. H. M.
