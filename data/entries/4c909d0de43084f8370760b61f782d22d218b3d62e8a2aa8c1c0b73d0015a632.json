{"title":"On Efficiency of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Galloping Energy Harvesters with Two Transducers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0733/v1","date":1715492693000,"content":"This paper examines the energy efficiency of three variations of the two-degree-of-freedom transverse galloping energy harvester. These variants differ in the number and placement of electromechanical transducers. By utilizing the harmonic balance method, limit cycles of mathematical models of devices were determined. Analytical expressions derived from models were then used to formulate the efficiency of the systems. It was demonstrated that efficiency depends on flow speed and can be comprehensively characterized by four criteria parameters: peak efficiency, denoting the maximum efficiency of the system, and high efficiency bandwidth, which describes the range of flow velocities within which the efficiency remains at no less than 90% of peak efficiency. The values of these parameters are heavily reliant on the speed at which the system achieves peak efficiencyâ€”referred to as the nominal speed nominal speed, which in turn is related to the critical speed of the system. Comparative analysis revealed that only the two-degree-of-freedom device equipped with two electromechanical transducers can potentially outperform a simple one-degree-of-freedom system in terms of efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c909d0de43084f8370760b61f782d22d218b3d62e8a2aa8c1c0b73d0015a632","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
