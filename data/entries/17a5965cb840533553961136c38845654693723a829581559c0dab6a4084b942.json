{"title":"Multidisciplinary Professional Talent Cultivation in the Internationalization of China&rsquo;s Agri-Sci-Tech Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1070/v1","date":1726216552000,"content":"The advancement of agricultural technology is intrinsically linked to the evolution of the agricultural industry, with the latter being contingent upon technological progress for its sustained enhancement. In the context of China, a nation of significant agricultural stature, the globalization of agricultural science and technology (Agri-Sci-Tech) has emerged as a pivotal narrative within the country's agricultural growth trajectory. The strategic alignment of China's Agri-Sci-Tech industry with its global counterparts is driven by the ambition to assimilate sophisticated agricultural production techniques and managerial acumen from its Western counterparts, thereby catalyzing the international expansion of the nation's Agri-Sci-Tech endeavors. This scholarly discourse delves into the imperative of interdisciplinary convergence, underscoring the paradigm and intrinsic attributes associated with the cultivation of agricultural expertise. It scrutinizes the prevailing state of foreign language instruction within the academic curriculum, positing strategic interventions and recommendations for the development of a robust agricultural foreign language talent cultivation framework. The treatise accentuates the criticality of cultivating a multifaceted agricultural talent pool proficient in foreign languages, advocating for a \"professional+foreign language\" model that facilitates international dialog within China's Agri-Sci-Tech industry and bolsters the creation of globally recognized brands. Moreover, the cultivation of a \"foreign language+professional\" composite talent model is posited as a transformative solution to the existing impasse in foreign language education in China, offering a novel pathway for educational innovation and global competitiveness within the agricultural domain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17a5965cb840533553961136c38845654693723a829581559c0dab6a4084b942","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
