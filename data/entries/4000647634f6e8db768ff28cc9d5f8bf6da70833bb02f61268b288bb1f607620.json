{"title":"Carnivore Diet as Regenerative Immunotherapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Literature Review, A Novel Hypothesis and Experimental Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0108/v2","date":1725454414000,"content":"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possible application of a therapeutic carnivore diet regimen in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Based on current research and anecdotal reports, we hypothesized that the diet might potentially exhibit both anti-inflammatory and microbiome-modulating properties salutary to the IBD patient population. Our hypothesis demands comprehensive clinical validation. Therefore, in this paper, we review theories on ketogenic and carnivore diets, discussing their immunomodulatory effects and propose an experimental study to test the feasibility, safety, and clinical efficacy of the carnivore diet for IBD treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4000647634f6e8db768ff28cc9d5f8bf6da70833bb02f61268b288bb1f607620","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
