When thermal stress exceeds organismal capacity to maintain homeostasis, organism survival becomes time-limited and can result in mass mortality events.\n\nCurrent methods of detecting and categorizing MHWs rely on statistical analysis of historic climatology and do not consider biological effects as a basis of MHW severity. The re-emergence of ectotherm thermal tolerance landscape models provides a physiological framework for assessing the lethal effects of MHWs by accounting for both the magnitude and duration of extreme heat events.\n\nHere, we used a simulation approach to understand the effects of a suite of MHW profiles on organism survival probability across (1) three thermal tolerance adaptive strategies, (2) interannual temperature variation and (3) seasonal timing of MHWs.\n\nWe identified survival isoclines across MHW magnitude and duration where acute (short duration-high magnitude) and chronic (long duration-low magnitude) events had equivalent lethal effects on marine organisms. While most research attention has focused on chronic MHW events, we show similar lethal effects can be experienced by more common but neglected acute marine heat spikes. Critically, a statistical definition of MHWs does not accurately categorize biological mortality.\n\nBy letting organism responses define the extremeness of a MHW event, we can build a mechanistic understanding of MHW effects from a physiological basis. Organism responses can then be transferred across scales of ecological organization and better predict marine ecosystem shifts to MHWs.\n</p>","author":"Andrew R. Villeneuve, \nEaston R.
