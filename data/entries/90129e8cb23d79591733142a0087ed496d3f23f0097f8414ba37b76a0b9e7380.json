{"title":"Research on Electric Vehicle Power Systems Based on Digital Twin Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0360/v1","date":1725441831000,"content":"As a critical component of electric vehicles, the powertrain has a significant impact on the overall performance of the vehicle. In addressing the challenge of lengthy testing cycles, this study develops a para model of the powertrain utilizing digital twin (DT) technology, thereby establishing a framework for simulation testing of multi-controller intermodulation. The research conducts functional definition coverage testing through the design of specific functional requirement use cases, and it validates the failure mechanism via fault injection use cases. The results indicate that the DT testing platform can effectively simulate the operational interactions among various controllers within the powertrain system. In comparison to traditional field testing, the digital twin-based testing methodology offers enhanced operational efficiency and allows for the examination of testing conditions that are impractical to implement in real vehicles, particularly in the context of fault injection testing, thus facilitating the early detection of potential safety risks within the system. The advancement of this technical solution holds significant practical implications for the future mass production and development of electric vehicles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90129e8cb23d79591733142a0087ed496d3f23f0097f8414ba37b76a0b9e7380","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
