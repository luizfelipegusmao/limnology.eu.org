{"title":"Unraveling the Omega-3 Puzzle: Navigating Challenges and Innovations for Bone Health and Healthy Aging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2064/v1","date":1727337310000,"content":"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs, n-3 PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), are essential polyunsatu-rated fats primarily obtained from fatty fish and plant-based sources. Compelling evidence from preclinical and epidemiological studies consistently suggests beneficial effects of ω-3 PUFAs on bone health and healthy aging processes. However, clinical trials have yielded mixed results, with some failing to replicate these benefits seen in preclinical models. This contraindication is mainly due to challenges such as low bioavailability, potential adverse effects with higher doses, and susceptibility to oxidation of ω-3 fatty acids, hindering their clinical effectiveness. This review provides an in-depth analysis of recent findings, focusing on clinical perspectives and encom-passing all relevant published studies to date, including preclinical and epidemiological research, with an emphasis on the role of omega-3 fatty acids in promoting bone health and supporting healthy aging. Additionally, it explores strategies to improve ω-3 PUFA efficacy, including na-noparticle encapsulation and incorporation of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) derived from DHA and EPA, to mitigate oxidation and enhance solubility, thereby improving therapeutic potential. By consolidating evidence from various studies, this review underscores current in-sights and future directions in leveraging ω-3 PUFAs for therapeutic applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dbed32c9c309c769171d7132a07ef30619ac5ce278f165c972d229c89fcc0c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
