{"title":"Cardiovascular disease and testosterone therapy in male hypogonadism","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.15211?af=R","date":1725731262000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This review assesses the evidence of the physiological effects of testosterone on cardiovascular health, the association between male hypogonadism and cardiovascular health, and the effects of testosterone therapy on cardiovascular health in male hypogonadism. Preclinical studies suggest complex effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk by acting on skeletal muscle, cardiomyocytes, vasculature, adipocytes, insulin action, and erythropoiesis. Furthermore, low testosterone has a bi-directional association with cardiometabolic risk. Observational studies have reported worse metabolic profiles in men with organic hypogonadism. However, a consistent association between major cardiovascular events and male hypogonadism has not been established. Hematocrit increases with testosterone therapy; however, most studies do not report an increase in venous thromboembolism risk. Although some observational studies and a small randomized controlled study reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, recent data confirm the medium-term cardiovascular safety of testosterone therapy in middle-aged and older men with low testosterone.</p>","author":"Nipun Lakshitha de Silva, \nBonnie Grant, \nSuks Minhas, \nChanna N.
