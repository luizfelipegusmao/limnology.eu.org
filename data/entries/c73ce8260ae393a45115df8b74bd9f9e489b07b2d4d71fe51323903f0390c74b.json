Grain boundary (GB) and point defect segregation to GBs is relatively understudied in CCOs even though they can govern macroscopic material properties[<a href=\"#ozae044.664-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.664-B7\">7</a>]. For example, GB segregation governs GB chemical order and disorder as well as point defect distribution, so it plays a critical role in GB electrochemical kinetics, which commonly serve as the rate-determined step of electrode reaction, charge transport and mass diffusion. However, compared with conventional oxides, GBs in multi-cation CCO systems are expected to exhibit more complex segregation phenomena and thus prove more difficult to tune through GB design strategies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c73ce8260ae393a45115df8b74bd9f9e489b07b2d4d71fe51323903f0390c74b","category":"Environment"}
