This research analyses the intricate relationship between port organizational ecosystem resilience and the successful implementation of green transitions, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in moving towards a more sustainable future. The research employed a combined focus group interview and participatory observation methodology to gather insights from experts. Analysis revealed that while technological advancements are a primary driver for greening port operations, a lack of managerial capacity is a significant impediment to the successful integration of these innova-tions. It was identified several challenges, including outdated infrastructure, cybersecurity threats, and the need for ongoing investments in new technologies, along with the need to foster a sustainable behaviour culture. Experts emphasized the importance of developing managerial competencies and continuous learning. The research also highlights the role of strong stake-holder partnerships, including collaboration with government agencies, industry associations, and environmental organizations. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, port managers, and other stakeholders seeking to navigate the challenges for ensuring a sus-tainable future for the maritime sport organizational ecosystems and maritime industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e149b9b72d8508c202107d637bc41ff83db1b2fc928408565f2a02f11ae102fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
