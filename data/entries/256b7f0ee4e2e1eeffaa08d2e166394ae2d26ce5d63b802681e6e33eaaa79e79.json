{"title":"Enhanced Extraction of Tanshinones from Salvia miltiorrhiza Using Natural Surfactant-Based Cloud Point Extraction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0424/v1","date":1725512670000,"content":"Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) contains the tanshinones, a compound with various pharmacological effects, and has been extensively studied as a pharmaceutical material. However, conventional methods for extracting tanshinones face challenges such as environmental hazards and high cost. In this study, we aimed to effectively extract tanshinones from SM using cloud point extraction (CPE) with lecithin, a natural surfactant. By optimizing various extraction conditions including the solid-to-liquid ratio, lecithin concentration, NaCl concentration, pH, and equilibrium temperature, the optimal extraction efficiency was achieved using 20 mL of solvent per 1 g of sample, 3% lecithin (w/v), 2% NaCl (w/v), pH 6, and room temperature (25 ± 2°C). The CPE method, which minimizes the use of organic solvent and is eco-friendly demonstrated improvements in extraction efficiency, with a 4.55% increased for dihydrotanshinone I, 8.32% for cryptotanshinone, 15.77% for tanshinone I, and 6.81% for tanshinone IIA compared to the conventional water extraction method. These results suggest that CPE is promising, environmentally friendly, and efficient approach for extracting hydrophobic components from pharmacologically active materials such as SM, with potential applications across various fields of natural product extraction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"256b7f0ee4e2e1eeffaa08d2e166394ae2d26ce5d63b802681e6e33eaaa79e79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
