Analyses were conducted with and without accounting for species size difference.\n\nWe found that 57% of island endemic species evolved towards more unoccupied regions of the global morphospace (i.e. more distinct body sizes compared to the ones of their ancestors), suggesting a tendency for niche filling. When adjusted traits for body size, we found that half of the endemic species (50%) showed more distinct trait values than their ancestors.\n\nResults also revealed that certain dietary niches (terrestrial herbivores and nectarivores) evolved distinct body sizes more frequently. Differences noted between islands and archipelagos suggest that biogeographic factors may influence evolutionary trajectory and interactions between these two hypotheses.\n\nOur study confirms that extinct species occupied specific niches that have been left vacant, suggesting that these evolutionary ‘oddities’ could be more sensitive to extinction. Overall, it calls for a global assessment of the avian functional diversity lost from recent extinctions.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/10/02/niche-filling-predicts-evolutionary-trajectories-in-insular-bird-communities/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Paul Dufour, \nFerran Sayol, \nManuel J.
