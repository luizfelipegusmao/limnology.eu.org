{"title":"Clinical and Metabolic Particularities of a Roma Population with Diabetes- considering Ethnic Disparities in Approaching Healthcare Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1059/v1","date":1715779605000,"content":"The Roma population constitutes the largest ethnic minority in Europe, however, data regarding the prevalence of non- communicable diseases are still scarce in the medical literature. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and metabolic particularities of a Roma population with diabetes, in comparison with a group of Romanian Caucasians. We conducted an observational, transversal study and evaluated 808 adult patients with diabetes mellitus, from a tertiary hospital providing diabetes care, aged between 18 and 89 years old, of whom the majority were men (52.84%). Most of them had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reaching 95.1% the Caucasian group and 87.8% among the Roma patients. 81.1% of the Caucasian patients had hypertension, approximately 15% higher than the Roma group, while more than half of the patients in both groups had obesity. There were no differences concerning myocardial infarction, however, the number of patients with history of stroke was 2.1 times higher in the Roma group compared to Caucasians. Chronic kidney disease was present in 22.1% of the Roma patients, 33.25% had retinopathy, and 72.7% presented polyneuropathy. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications among the study Roma population are quite significant, underscoring the importance of ethnic disparities in approaching healthcare management strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e5a63d57a630305ce786360079065a8c4cb1607d19b2c400b85346cf587b5b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
