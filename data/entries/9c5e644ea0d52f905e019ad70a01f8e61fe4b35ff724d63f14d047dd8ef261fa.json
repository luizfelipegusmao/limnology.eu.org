{"title":"Leaf area predicts conspecific spatial aggregation of woody species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13887?af=R","date":1726646623000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>Addressing how woody plant species are distributed in space can reveal inconspicuous drivers that structure plant communities. The spatial structure of conspecifics varies not only at local scales across co-existing plant species but also at larger biogeographical scales with climatic parameters and habitat properties. The possibility that biogeographical drivers shape the spatial structure of plants, however, has not received sufficient attention.</p>\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>Global synthesis.</p>\n<h2>Time Period</h2>\n<p>1997â€“2022.</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa Studied</h2>\n<p>Woody angiosperms and conifers.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>We carried out a quantitative synthesis to capture the interplay between local scale and larger scale drivers. We modelled conspecific spatial aggregation as a binary response through logistic models and Ripley's <i>L</i> statistics and the distance at which the point process was least random with mixed effects linear models. Our predictors covered a range of plant traits, climatic predictors and descriptors of the habitat.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We hypothesized that plant traits, when summarized by local scale predictors, exceed in importance biogeographical drivers in determining the spatial structure of conspecifics across woody systems. This was only the case in relation to the frequency with which we observed aggregated distributions. The probability of observing spatial aggregation and the intensity of it was higher for plant species with large leaves but further depended on climatic parameters and mycorrhiza.</p>\n<h2>Main Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Compared to climate variables, plant traits perform poorly in explaining the spatial structure of woody plant species, even though leaf area is a decisive plant trait that is related to whether we observe homogenous spatial aggregation and its intensity. Despite the limited variance explained by our models, we found that the spatial structure of woody plants is subject to consistent biogeographical constraints and that these exceed beyond descriptors of individual species, which we captured here through leaf area.</p>","author":"Jingjing Xi, \nGuolin C.
