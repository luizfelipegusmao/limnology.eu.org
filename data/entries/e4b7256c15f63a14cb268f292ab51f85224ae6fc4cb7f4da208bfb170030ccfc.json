{"title":"Optimization of Composite Enzymatic Extraction, Structural Characterization and Biological Activity of Soluble Dietary Fiber from Akebia trifoliata Peel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0760/v1","date":1712836923000,"content":"In order to reduce the waste of Akebia trifoliata peel and maximize its utilization. In this study, on the basis of single factor experiment and response surface method, the optimum technological conditions for the extraction of soluble dietary fiber from Akebia trifoliata peel by compound en-zyme method were obtained. The chemical composition, physical and chemical properties, structural characterization and biological activity of the purified soluble dietary fiber (AP-SDF) from the Akebia trifoliata peel were analyzed. We discovered that that the optimum yield was 20.87 % under the conditions of cellulase addition 600 U/g, enzymolysis time 100 min, solid-liquid ratio 1:24 g/mL and enzymolysis temperature 51 °C. At the same time, AP-SDF was a po-rous network structure cellulose type I acidic polysaccharose mainly composed of arabinoxylan (36.03%), galacturonic acid (27.40%) and glucose (19.00%), which possessed the structural charac-teristic peaks of the infrared spectra of polysaccharides, and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) was 95.52 kDa with good uniformity. In addition, AP-SDF exhibited high oil hold-ing capacity (15.11 g/g), good water holding capacity, swelling capacity, certain antioxidant ca-pacity in vitro, hypoglycemic activity in vitro of α-glucosidase inhibition and hypolipidemic ac-tivity in vitro of the binding ability of bile acids and cholesterol. These results will provide a theoretical basis for the development of functional products with antioxidant, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, it has certain application value in related industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4b7256c15f63a14cb268f292ab51f85224ae6fc4cb7f4da208bfb170030ccfc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
