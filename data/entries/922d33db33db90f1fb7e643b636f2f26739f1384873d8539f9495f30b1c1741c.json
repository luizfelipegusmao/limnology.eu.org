{"title":"Compression Molding of PE Matrix/GF Fabric Reinforced Thick Laminates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0466/v1","date":1725587178000,"content":"Thermoplastic fiberglass has been compression molded in the shape of thick panels with the nominal thickness of 10 mm and the size of 300x300 mm2. A simplified procedure has been adopted to speed up the lamination procedure, and making it adapt to the aim of recycling waste glass fiber fabrics and thermoplastics films. Low density polyethylene has been used as matrix to simplify the laboratory activities, but the same procedure can be extended to any other thermoplastic film, such as polyamide. The final thermoplastic composite shows unique properties in terms of repairability and improves its performances by increasing the number of repairing steps. For this aim, a repairability test has been designed in the bending configuration, and 3 consecutive cycles of bending/repairing/bending have been carried out. Static mechanical properties were, instead, low in comparison with traditional fiberglass, because of the choice of a polyethylene matrix. Bending tests have shown that the maximum strength is lower than 10 MPa and the elastic modulus less than 1 GPa. Nevertheless, the toughness of the thermoplastic composite was very high, and the samples continued to deform under bending for any displacement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"922d33db33db90f1fb7e643b636f2f26739f1384873d8539f9495f30b1c1741c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
