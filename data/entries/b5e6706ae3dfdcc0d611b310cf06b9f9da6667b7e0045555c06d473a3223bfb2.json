Cooling to cryogenic temperatures tended to introduce instabilities such as vibration and drift and can lead to the buildup of carbon contamination or ice reducing contrast [<a href=\"#ozae044.1071-B1\">1</a>]. The need to expand TEM experimental techniques into new fields such as quantum and battery materials led to new efforts to reduce these instabilities while achieving temperatures at or well below liquid nitrogen (77 K). Further, developments in detector and spectrometer technology brought new capabilities for high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and scanning nanodiffraction (4D-STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1071-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1071-B3\">3</a>]. These experimental modalities can require even tighter controls of drift, vibration, and exposure time. This presentation will discuss accomplishing difficult experiments at cryogenic temperatures in honor of the late Dr. Lena Kourkoutis who inspired and led many such experiments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b5e6706ae3dfdcc0d611b310cf06b9f9da6667b7e0045555c06d473a3223bfb2","category":"Environment"}
