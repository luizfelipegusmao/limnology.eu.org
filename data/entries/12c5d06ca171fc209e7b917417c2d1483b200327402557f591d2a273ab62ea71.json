{"title":"A methodological primer of extracellular vesicles isolation and characterization via different techniques","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae009/7607719?rss=1","date":1707782400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We present four different protocols of varying complexity for the isolation of cell culture-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs)/exosome-enriched fractions with the objective of providing researchers with easily conducted methods that can be adapted for many different uses in various laboratory settings and locations. These protocols are primarily based on polymer precipitation, filtration and/or ultracentrifugation, as well as size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and include: (i) polyethylene glycol and sodium chloride supplementation of the conditioned medium followed by low-speed centrifugation; (ii) ultracentrifugation of conditioned medium; (iii) filtration of conditioned media through a 100-kDa exclusion filter; and (iv) isolation using a standard commercial kit. These techniques can be followed by further purification by ultracentrifugation, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, or SEC if needed and the equipment is available. HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell cultures were used to generate conditioned medium containing exosomes. This medium was then depleted of cells and debris, filtered through a 0.2-µM filter, and supplemented with protease and RNAse inhibitors prior to exosomal isolation. The purified EVs can be used immediately or stably stored at 4°C (up to a week for imaging or using intact EVS downstream) or at −80°C for extended periods and then used for biochemical study. Our aim is not to compare these methodologies but to present them with descriptors so that researchers can choose the “best method” for their work under their individual conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"12c5d06ca171fc209e7b917417c2d1483b200327402557f591d2a273ab62ea71","category":"Environment"}
