{"title":"Relocation preference and settlement: Lessons from the Poverty Alleviation Relocation Program in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309534","date":1728050400000,"content":"<p>by Shuai Zhou, Guangqing Chi, Huanguang Qiu, Zhen Lei, Erica A. H. Smithwick, Jiquan Chen</p>\r\n\r\nWe explored the linkages between socioeconomic and demographic factors, relocation preference, and settlement associated with Chinaâ€™s Poverty Alleviation Relocation Program. Using multivariate ordinal logistic regression, panel data modeling, and multilevel methods, we found that outdated infrastructure at places of origin, such as long distances to paved roads or elementary schools, increased the probability of relocation, and the presence of left-behind household members at the origin compromised re-settlement. This study sheds light on the community- and household-level factors that influence relocation preference and settlement, offering valuable insights for future research and informing the design and implementation of relocation projects.","author":"Shuai Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"366aa4e562c7d30613816a9665ede653f790d9ba7fd8d62f8cbc18651cd7d25d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
