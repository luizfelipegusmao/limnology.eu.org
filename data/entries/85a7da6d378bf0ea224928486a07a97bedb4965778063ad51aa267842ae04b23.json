{"title":"Circulating Bacterial DNA in Colorectal Cancer Patients: The Potential Role of Fusobacterium nucleatum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1370/v1","date":1721196698000,"content":"Dysbiosis, as reflected by the altered composition of the microbiome favoring pathogenic species, is a major contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) development, which could lead to bacterial translocation into the bloodstream. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of circulated bacterial DNA (cbDNA) in CRC patients, with or without surgical removal of the primary tumor. In total, 100 participants enrolled in this prospective clinicolaboratory study, equally divided into four groups; healthy controls (Group 1), patients with non-metastatic CRC with surgical removal of the primary tumor (Group 2), patients with metastatic CRC with surgically excised (Group 3) or non-excised (Group 4) primary tumor. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was analyzed using PCR with specific primers targeting 16S rRNA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Only the detection of F. nucleatum in the blood was significantly higher in Group 4 compared to Group 1 (p &lt; 0.001), Group 2 (p = 0.023) and Group 3 (p = 0.023). The association of cbDNA with other clinical parameters or co-morbidities was also evaluated. These results highlighted the importance of bacterial translocation in CRC patients and the role of F. nucleatum as an intratumoral oncomicrobe associated with metastatic CRC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85a7da6d378bf0ea224928486a07a97bedb4965778063ad51aa267842ae04b23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
