{"title":"Control of Charge Transfer Paths in Integrated Aluminum Nanostructures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.559/7719731?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Interaction between plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) leads to electromagnetic coupling, which is essential for various applications such as sensing, catalysis, and energy conversion [<a href=\"#ozae044.559-B1\">1-3</a>]. While localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) are well known for light absorption and scattering, the emergence of low-energy charge transfer plasmons (CTPs) in systems with direct charge transfer between NPs offers new opportunities [<a href=\"#ozae044.559-B2\">2</a>]. Despite extensive research on CTPs in various nanostructures, the effect of junction asymmetry on their properties remains underexplored. Using monolayer graphene as a template [<a href=\"#ozae044.559-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.559-B5\">5</a>], we systematically fabricate interconnected aluminum nanostructures (IAlNs) and modulate the CTPs of IAlNs by controlling their dimensions and introducing nano-trenches within their junctions. Here, we present a method for fabricating and precisely manipulating IAlNs on suspended graphene. Intentional manipulation of the junctions induces asymmetry, enabling novel charge transfer pathways and facilitating the creation of coupled resonators. The nano-trenches are formed either randomly by partial oxidation of junctions or systematically by focused electron beam irradiation. This provides a versatile means of achieving precise interconnect manipulation. Nano-trench dimensions have a profound effect on the resonance energies and lifetimes of CTPs. Adjusting the nano-trench dimensions in IAlNs allows tailored modulation of the charge transfer speed and CTP energy. Furthermore, CTPs excited in IAlNs with nano-trenches exhibit weak coupling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"940058a0d08d5ad19fe74cc9e185e5340c623a40c6ca4d7f557341256b17eb6f","category":"Environment"}
