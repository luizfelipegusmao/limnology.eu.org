{"title":"Two pyridoxal phosphate homeostasis proteins are essential for management of the coenzyme pyridoxal 5′-phosphate in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3689/7703202?rss=1","date":1719878400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Coenzyme management is important for homeostasis of the pool of active metabolic enzymes. The coenzyme pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is involved in diverse enzyme reactions including amino acid and hormone metabolism. Regulatory proteins that contribute to PLP homeostasis remain to be explored in plants. Here, we demonstrate the importance of proteins annotated as PLP homeostasis proteins (PLPHPs) for controlling PLP in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). A systematic analysis indicates that while most organisms across kingdoms have a single <span>PLPHP</span> homolog, Angiosperms have two. PLPHPs from Arabidopsis bind PLP and exist as monomers, in contrast to reported PLP-dependent enzymes, which exist as multimers. Disrupting the function of both <span>PLPHP</span> homologs perturbs vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (pyridoxine) content, inducing a PLP deficit accompanied by light hypersensitive root growth, unlike PLP biosynthesis mutants. Micrografting studies show that the PLP deficit can be relieved distally between shoots and roots. Chemical treatments probing PLP-dependent reactions, notably those for auxin and ethylene, provide evidence that PLPHPs function in the dynamic management of PLP. Assays in vitro show that Arabidopsis PLPHP can coordinate PLP transfer and withdrawal from other enzymes. This study thus expands our knowledge of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biology and highlights the importance of PLP coenzyme homeostasis in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"405cb19669adeeb6cdff7c12994be051586559b976ade6a4f0f632671975db85","category":"Environment"}
