We conducted a trial to investigate the impact of conditional financial incentives and a decision support application, called EPIC-HIV, on HIV testing and linkage to care. We report the findings of the trial process evaluation to explore whether the interventions were delivered as intended, identify mechanisms of impact and any contextual factors that may have impacted the trial outcomes. Between August 2018 and March 2019, we conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with trial participants (n = 31) and staff (n = 14) to examine views on the implementation process, participant responses to the interventions and the external factors that may have impacted the implementation and outcomes of the study. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated where necessary, and thematically analyzed using ATLAS-ti and NVivo. Both interventions were perceived to be acceptable and useful by participants and implementers. EPIC-HIV proved challenging to implement as intended because it was difficult to ensure consistent use of earphones, and maintenance of privacy. Some participants struggled to navigate the EPIC-HIV app independently and select stories that appealed to them without support. Some participants stopped exploring the app before the end, resulting in an incomplete use of EPIC-HIV. While the financial incentive was implemented as intended, there were challenges with eligibility. The convenience and privacy of home testing influenced the uptake of HIV testing. Contextual barriers including fear of HIV stigma and disclosure if diagnosed with HIV, and expectations of poor treatment in clinics may have inhibited linkage to care. Financial incentives were relatively straightforward to implement and increased uptake of home-based rapid HIV testing but were not sufficient as a ‘stand-alone’ intervention. Barriers like fear of stigma should be addressed to facilitate linkage to care.","author":"Thulile Mathenjwa","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"1fc45661dce91692464689aff8cf7f0f636a732dc7eecd17893c84b203e60054","category":"Environment"}
