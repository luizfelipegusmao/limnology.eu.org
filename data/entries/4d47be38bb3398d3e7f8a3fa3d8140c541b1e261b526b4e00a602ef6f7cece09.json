In 2018, spatial interpolations were performed using the removal ratios of the TN, NH<sub>4</sub>-N, and NO<sub>3</sub>-N of the layers of different resolutions, respectively. Based on the mean and the standard deviation, the area, shape, and position were obtained for four levels related to the removal ratios of the three nitrogen forms. The linear and 6th function fitting methods were used to reveal the differences in nitrogen removal in wetland water at different spatial resolutions. The results showed that a resolution of 25 times the original was the key scale of the spatial effects. Due to the fact that 52 of the 72 functions did not reach a significant level (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), the spatial scale effect of the nitrogen removal was mainly characterized by disorderly fluctuations. The results have a certain extrapolation value for the analysis of spatial scale effects.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe resolution difference was not sufficient to change the spatial pattern of the geographic phenomena.\nThe resolution of 25 times the original was the important scale for determining spatial effects.\nWhen studying the spatial scale effects caused by differences in resolution, it was necessary to comprehensively consider various resolutions.\n</p>","author":"Xiao‐Dong Wang, \nJin‐Feng Ma, \nHao‐Rui Jiang, \nYu An, \nMei Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"4d47be38bb3398d3e7f8a3fa3d8140c541b1e261b526b4e00a602ef6f7cece09","category":"Environment"}
