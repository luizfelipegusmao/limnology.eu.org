Improved protocols for enhanced membrane and cell contrast as well as sample conductivity in conventional [<a href=\"#ozae044.483-B2\">2</a>] and cryo-fixed [<a href=\"#ozae044.483-B3\">3</a>] plant samples have enabled reliable imaging of the cell sub-structure of entire single plant cells and/or large tissue areas at sub-10nm voxel size. Such improvements supported our near-term goal to quantify and understand the distribution of a variety of unique nanoscopic plant cell features such as plasmodesmata, grana, mitochondria, plastoglobuli and the cell wall under various, developmental, biotic and abiotic experimental conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e3545e4f80469f0e9c3e967c343c09daa36b2f33fc1b2e992ae9617b134e5fb5","category":"Environment"}
