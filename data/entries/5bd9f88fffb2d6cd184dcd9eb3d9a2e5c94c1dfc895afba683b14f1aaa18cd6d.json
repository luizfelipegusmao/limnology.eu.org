{"title":"Demographic and conservation genomic assessment of the threatened marbled teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13639?af=R","date":1715151600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Genetic assessment of species that have experienced dramatic population declines provides critical information that is instrumental for the design of conservation recovery programs. Here, we use different sources of molecular data (mtDNA and ddRAD-seq) to evaluate the genetic status of wild and captive populations of marbled teal (<i>Marmaronetta angustirostris</i>), a duck species classified as critically endangered in Spain and near threatened at a global scale. First, we determined the evolutionary and demographic trajectories of the wild population from Spain and the currently much larger population from Iraq, which is also the documented source of European zoo stocks. Second, we evaluated the suitability of the different captive populations for ongoing restocking programs in Spain and assessed their potential impact on the genetic composition of wild populations. Populations from Spain and Iraq were assigned to distinct genetic clusters, albeit with an overall low level of genetic differentiation, in line with their recent divergence (&lt;8000 years ago) and lack of phylogeographic structure in the species. Demogenomic inferences revealed that the two populations have experienced parallel demographic trajectories, with a marked bottleneck during the last glacial period followed by a sudden demographic expansion and stability since the onset of the Holocene. The wild population from Spain presented high levels of inbreeding, but we found no evidence of recent genetic bottlenecks compatible with the human-driven decline of the species during the past century. The captive populations from the two Spanish centers involved in restocking programs showed genetic introgression from European zoos; however, we found limited evidence of introgression from the zoo genetic stock into the wild population from Spain, suggesting captive-bred birds have limited breeding success in the wild. Our study illustrates how ex situ conservation programs should consider the genetic distinctiveness of populations when establishing breeding stocks and highlights the importance of genetically assessing captive populations prior to reinforcement actions.</p>","author":"Joaquín Ortego, \nVioleta Muñoz‐Fuentes, \nRaquel López‐Luque, \nAlex D.
