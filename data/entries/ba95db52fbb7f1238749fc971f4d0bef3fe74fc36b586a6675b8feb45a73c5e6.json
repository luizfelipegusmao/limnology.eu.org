{"title":"Path Analysis of Agro Technological Traits Associated with Sugar Yield in Different Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris L.) Monogerm Cultivars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0749/v1","date":1725962815000,"content":"Understanding the relationship between sugar yield and related traits is crucial for successfully breeding this important industrial crop. Thirteen sugar beet monogram cultivars were evaluated during 2018-2019. The study used a split-factorial design with two planting dates as the main plot, while cultivars and harvesting dates were laid out as CRBD as subplots. Significant differences were observed among the cultivars for all measured traits. The genetic correlation coefficients showed the highest positive and significant correlations between sugar yield and white sugar yield (WSY) (0.88**), sugar content (SC) (0.71**), and white sugar content (0.65**). Conversely, the highest negative and significant correlations were found between sugar yield and molasses sugar content (-0.62**), alkalinity coefficient (-0.58**), and root potassium content (-0.52**). In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, white sugar content (WSC), sugar content (SC), root Î±-amino nitrogen content, and root yield were included in the regression model, explaining 84% of the total variance in the sugar yield. Path analysis revealed that sugar content (1.12) and root yield (1.03) had the highest direct effects on sugar yield. These traits can be used as key criteria for developing superior hybrids with high economic productivity, thereby accelerating the selection process in various breeding programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba95db52fbb7f1238749fc971f4d0bef3fe74fc36b586a6675b8feb45a73c5e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
