{"title":"The microbiota of <i>Amblyomma americanum</i> reflects known westward expansion","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304959","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Luis Martinez-Villegas, Paula Lado, Hans Klompen, Selena Wang, Caleb Cummings, Risa Pesapane, Sarah M. Short</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Amblyomma americanum</i>, a known vector of multiple tick-borne pathogens, has expanded its geographic distribution across the United States in the past decades. Tick microbiomes may play a role shaping their host’s life history and vectorial capacity. Bacterial communities associated with <i>A</i>. <i>americanum</i> may reflect, or enable, geographic expansion and studying the microbiota will improve understanding of tick-borne disease ecology. We examined the microbiota structure of 189 adult ticks collected in four regions encompassing their historical and current geographic distribution. Both geographic region of origin and sex were significant predictors of alpha diversity. As in other tick models, within-sample diversity was low and uneven given the presence of dominant endosymbionts. Beta diversity analyses revealed that bacterial profiles of ticks of both sexes collected in the West were significantly different from those of the Historic range. Biomarkers were identified for all regions except the historical range. In addition, Bray-Curtis dissimilarities overall increased with distance between sites. Relative quantification of ecological processes showed that, for females and males, respectively, drift and dispersal limitation were the primary drivers of community assembly. Collectively, our findings highlight how microbiota structural variance discriminates the western-expanded populations of <i>A</i>. <i>americanum</i> ticks from the Historical range. Spatial autocorrelation, and particularly the detection of non-selective ecological processes, are indicative of geographic isolation. We also found that prevalence of <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</i>, <i>E</i>. <i>ewingii</i>, and <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i> ranged from 3.40–5.11% and did not significantly differ by region. <i>Rickettsia rickettsii</i> was absent from our samples. Our conclusions demonstrate the value of synergistic analysis of biogeographic and microbial ecology data in investigating range expansion in <i>A</i>. <i>americanum</i> and potentially other tick vectors as well.","author":"Luis Martinez-Villegas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"70666e79772e2d09b2a2a8304e6d5feb6a8c0ab6aa44e077ed51b6967794dc07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
