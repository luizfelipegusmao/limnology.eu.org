{"title":"Estimating Specimen Height Using SEM Working Distance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.199/7719555?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>As the number of semiconductor device stack increases, the mold height also increases [<a href=\"#ozae044.199-B1\">1</a>]. There are various structural analysis methods available, including Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), to understand the morphology of interior structure of semiconductor devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.199-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.199-B3\">3</a>]. Among all, mass image analysis by SEM plays a pivotal role in the analysis of semiconductor at the nanaoscale, involving segmented images of the oblique-angle polished mold from bottom to top. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find out which height correspond to the information at a specific location, thus the current analysis only relied on data plotted against segmented image numbers. Therefore this study explores a method for estimating the height of a specimen with oblique-angle polished based on SEM working distance to improve the plausibility of mass image analysis using SEM. The reliability of this method is assessed through experiments conducted using oblique-angle polished samples, with results validated by comparing them to known heights obtained from TEM images. The approach involves capturing SEM images at various working distances, employing auto-sweep focus, and correcting for deviations arise from sample tilt. The precision of the method is contingent upon factors such as auto-focus horizontal field width and auto-focus range. Findings suggest that optimizing the SEM parameters is essential for accurate height estimation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d31fd82dd79709246fb5934fdd3d8f98312212a0b26f291f5c5b0390f6b32bdc","category":"Environment"}
