{"title":"Uropathogenic E. coli and Hybrid Pathotypes in Mexican Women with Urinary Tract Infections: A Comprehensive Mo-lecular and Phenotypic Overview.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0446/v1","date":1715175850000,"content":"Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the main etiologic agent of urinary tract infections (UTI) and possesses virulence and resistance determinants commonly harbored in mobilizable genetic elements such as plasmids or pathogenicity islands (PAI). UPEC belongs to the group of Ex-traintestinal pathogenic E. coli, however the existence of hybrid strains has been described; these possess both diarrheagenic (DEC) and extraintestinal (ExPEC) E. coli traits and are considered as \"hypervirulent strains,\" which represents a significant health problem. This study aimed to de-termine the prevalence of UPEC PAI, ExPEC sequence types (ST), DEC genes, carbapenemase and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes, fluoroquinolones/aminoglycosides resistance genotypes and the presence of plasmids in 40 clinical isolates previously characterized as UPEC. A 72.5% of the isolates presented PAI, mainly PAI IV536 (53%). Sixty-five percent of the β-lactam-resistant isolates were positive for ESBL phenotype, and 100% of the car-bapenem-resistant isolates were carbapenemase producers. The most prevalent ESBL-associated gene was blaCTX-M-2 (60%), while among isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides the most frequent resistance gene was aac(6')Ib (93%). Plasmid bands were present in 57% of the isolates. Seventy percent belonged to the ST131 clonal group. The presence of molecular markers associated with DEC pathotypes was detected in 20 isolates; 60% were classified as hybrid pathotypes. These data suggest, in addition to an important pathogenic potential, the existence of hybrid pathotypes in clinical isolates of E. coli causing UTI in the Mexican population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56abce67b9092c1491b45166cabe2e00ce97c47ceec3ed95ba6bd06fa4e0f50f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
