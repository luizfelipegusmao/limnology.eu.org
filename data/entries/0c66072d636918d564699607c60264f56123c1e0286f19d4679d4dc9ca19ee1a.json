{"title":"4 Utilizing SmartFeed Pro and SuperSmart Feeders for applied beef cattle research","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/79/7618022?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Designing research for applied beef cattle production systems has always presented challenges for Land Grant University and USDA Scientist. Specifically, creating study designs that have enough replication for statistical inference has often prompted scientists to use designs that do not closely replicate actual production systems. Past research has often used multiple replications (pens/paddocks/pastures) that utilize replication (group averages; 4 â€“ 8 animals) means as the experimental unit. While effective in measuring average treatment responses, these types of study designs do little to describe the actual individual animal behavior and performance in a more practical production environments. Approaches to increasing statistical observations in actual production environments will be discussed in this presentation. Embracing new technologies such as GPS, activity monitors, EID tags, and feed intake monitors (C-Lock Inc, GrowSafe) combined with multiple regression modeling tools can aid in designing and publishing beef cattle production research in actual beef production environments. Research at Montana State University has utilized SmartFeed Pro and SuperSmart Feeders for strategic supplementation research on extensive rangelands and dry-land pastures for the past seven years. Results of these studies have evaluated self-fed (salt-limited; loose, pelleted, and baked molasses blocks) as well as hand-fed supplements where daily intakes are limited by the locking gate on the feeder. This presentation will summarize these studies with a focus on research designs that were successful and/or unsuccessful in respect to characterizing beef cattle performance in production settings. Our goal will be to assist the audience in the application of feed intake technology in designing future applied beef cattle research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0c66072d636918d564699607c60264f56123c1e0286f19d4679d4dc9ca19ee1a","category":"Environment"}
