{"title":"Fluoroquinolones Resistance among Uropathogens Causing Community Acquired Urinary Tract Infections: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2008/v1","date":1721893400000,"content":"Abstract: Community Acquired Urinary Tract Infections account for 15% of all outpatient use of antibiotics, women are primarily affected; major causative microorganisms are uro-pathogenic E. Coli. Treatment is indicated for cystitis and pyelonephritis and includes B-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or third generation cephalosporins), fluoroquin-olones (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trime-thoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to antibiotic treatment is of concern, several mecha-nisms have been associated with the acquisition of genes that confer antimicrobial re-sistance to fluoroquinolones, which often are associated with other patterns of resistance, especially in extended spectrum beta lactases (ESBL) producers. Several studies have ad-dressed the prevalence of uropathogens producing ESBL, but only a few have focused on resistance against fluoroquinolones and to our knowledge, none has been addressing the prevalence of isolates mutations that confer antimicrobial resistance to fluoroquinolones. The focus of the present review was to analyze recent published papers that describe the E. coli phylotype causing community acquired UTIs in association to fluoroquinolones re-sistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6086351132dfb09aaf337a4f7911749b63c013eceb01d3b460af8918b4a24826","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
