{"title":"Efficacy and residual toxicity of chitosan for Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/442/7640067?rss=1","date":1712188800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chitosan is a naturally derived polymer that has significant potential for use as a bioinsecticide. Despite this, there is a lack of research as to the efficacy of chitosan for many insect pest species. The apple maggot fly, <span>Rhagoletis pomonella</span> (Walsh) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is one such pest for which chitosan toxicity has not been explored. In this study, the toxicity of chitosan for <span>R. pomonella</span> adults was tested via no-choice feeding assays. An aging trial was further used to test the mortality of flies provided dried chitosan-sucrose treatments (CST), which were aged for 0 or 3 days in greenhouse conditions. This study found that the CST is toxic for <span>R. pomonella</span> adults when ingested, leading to a significant increase in the rate of mortality compared to control groups. The use of dried chitosan, however, did not change the mortality of flies, suggesting this will not be an effective delivery mechanism. Effective biopesticide delivery systems have not been defined for chitosan use outside of a laboratory, indicating the need for further research testing delivery mechanisms. It is suggested that an effective method of delivery can be as a food-based bait in attract-and-kill traps, as chitosan must be ingested to kill flies. Forming a viscous solution, chitosan may be best suited to these lure systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"e67f54c933f9f55d69170d13119e7d7d913d431a16d3d9c351fde996bf360a49","category":"Environment"}
