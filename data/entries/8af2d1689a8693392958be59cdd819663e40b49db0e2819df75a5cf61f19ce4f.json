{"title":"Evaluation of an Automatic Signal Detection of In Situ Hybridization for Detecting HPV DNA in Cervical Tissue Derived from Patients with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0980/v1","date":1726133850000,"content":"Cervical cancer is 4th the most common cancer in women worldwide. Due to the prevalence of HPV in the population (80-90%), the scientists are likely to discover even more associations of this pathogen with other diseases in the future. In recent years, ISH assays that use automated signal-detecting methods in ormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cervical tissue, such as the enzyme-categorized signal-detecting system, have shown a higher sensitivity. To evaluate automatic signal detection of in situ hybridization (ISH) assay for detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, we compared the ability of an ISH probe, Inform HPV II and III (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ), to that of PCR assays to detect HPV DNA in cervical tissue specimens with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN; CIN 1, 28 cases; CIN 2, 22 cases; and CIN 3, 20 cases) and normal cervix (2 cases). Our findings showed significant relation was confirmed between ISH III level and HPV outcome (positive/negative). Patients with positive HPV outcomes had significantly lower ISH III levels, MD = -7961.82 CI95 [-17230.00; -199.21], p = 0.005. Automatic signal detection of ISH assay is not particularly applicable to cervical tissue material. A more useful method of confirming the presence of HPV in the cervix is ​​the HPV test with genotyping, as it allows for collecting a larger amount of material from the cervical disc and canal. The interpretation of a positive or negative ISH test must be guided in the context of clinical history and morphology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8af2d1689a8693392958be59cdd819663e40b49db0e2819df75a5cf61f19ce4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
