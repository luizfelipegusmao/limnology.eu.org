{"title":"Flow resistance law in channels with emergent rigid vegetation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2646?af=R","date":1722317571000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Flow resistance estimate is a challenging topic for establishing flooding propensity of streams, designing river restoration works, and evaluating the use of soil bioengineering practices. In this paper, flume measurements with rigid cylinders set in two arrangements (aligned, staggered) were used to evaluate the effect of rigid emergent vegetation on flow resistance. A well-known theoretical flow resistance equation was firstly reviewed. Then, it was calibrated and tested by measurements performed for these arrangements with six concentrations (0.53–11.62 stems dm<sup>−2</sup>). The analysis was conducted using three approaches: (i) distinguishing the experimental runs corresponding to different arrangements and stem concentrations; (ii) using only a scale factor representing the effect of the stem concentration; and (iii) joining all available data. The results demonstrated that the flow resistance equation gives an accurate estimate of the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor <i>f</i>, characterized, for the best approach among the tested ones, by errors less than or equal to ±5% for 95.9% of the examined cases for the aligned arrangement and for the staggered arrangement less than or equal to ±5% for 94.2% of the examined cases. For both arrangements, the measurements demonstrated that, for a given longitudinal distance between vegetation elements, flow resistance increases for decreasing values of the transverse distance and, for a given transverse distance, <i>f</i> decreases for increasing values of the longitudinal distance between elements. Finally, in the range of the investigated stem concentrations, the influence of the arrangement on flow resistance resulted negligible.</p>","author":"Alessio Nicosia, \nVincenzo Palmeri, \nVito Ferro","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"ebc2c63f8eaaa1496b5d9dc43a00a6c803c69ecb118d10e0bc5e611ee2fe7307","category":"Environment"}
