In the context of this investigation, the research population comprises 300 international culinary tourists who have ventured to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Employing SPSS software, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to rigorously assess construct validity, reliability, and the discriminant and convergent validity of the research model. The findings of this research study underscore the positive relationships that exist between various dimensions of gastronomy, namely involvement in gastronomy, knowledge of gastronomy, and previous gastronomic experiences, and the perceived attractiveness of gastronomy. These findings enhance our understanding of how culinary elements affect tourists' perceptions and experiences, highlighting the crucial role of gastronomy in destination appeal and visitor satisfaction. This research is a significant step towards enhancing our comprehension of the dynamic nexus between gastronomy and the tourism industry, ultimately benefiting destination management and strategy development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26318ac0c5a6f494c3bc375cd5f26d2f15a93cdcca50ff1ee98660e5a3b6ff61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
