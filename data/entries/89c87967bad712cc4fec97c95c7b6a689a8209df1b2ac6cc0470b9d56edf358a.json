{"title":"Arsenic exposure induced renal fibrosis via regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the NLRP3‐TGF‐β1/SMAD signaling pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24196?af=R","date":1711024833000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Environmental arsenic exposure is one of the major global public health problems. Studies have shown that arsenic exposure can cause renal fibrosis, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Integrating the <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models, this study investigated the potential molecular pathways for arsenic-induced renal fibrosis. In this study, SD rats were treated with 0, 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L NaAsO<sub>2</sub> for 8 weeks via drinking water, and HK2 cells were treated with different doses of NaAsO<sub>2</sub> for 48 h. The <i>in vivo</i> results showed that arsenic content in the rats' kidneys increased as the dose increased. Body weight decreased and kidney coefficient increased at 100 mg/L. As a response to the elevated NaAsO<sub>2</sub> dose, inflammatory cell infiltration, renal tubular injury, glomerular atrophy, tubulointerstitial hemorrhage, and fibrosis became more obvious indicated by HE and Masson staining. The kidney transcriptome profiles further supported the protein–protein interactions involved in NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-induced renal fibrosis. The <i>in vivo</i> results, in together with the <i>in vitro</i> experiments, have revealed that exposure to NaAsO<sub>2</sub> disturbed mitochondrial dynamics, promoted mitophagy, activated inflammation and the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway, and finally resulted in fibrosis. In summary, arsenic exposure contributed to renal fibrosis via regulating the mitochondrial dynamics and the NLRP3-TGF-β1/SMAD signaling axis. This study presented an adverse outcome pathway for the development of renal fibrosis due to arsenic exposure through drinking water.</p>","author":"Miaomiao Ren, \nJing Li, \nZehua Xu, \nBingru Nan, \nHongying Gao, \nHeng Wang, \nYi Lin, \nHeqing Shen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"89c87967bad712cc4fec97c95c7b6a689a8209df1b2ac6cc0470b9d56edf358a","category":"Environment"}
