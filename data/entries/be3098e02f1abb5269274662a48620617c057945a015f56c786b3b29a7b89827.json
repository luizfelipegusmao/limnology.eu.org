{"title":"Integrating LiDAR Sensor Data to Microsimulation Model 2 Calibration for Proactive Safety Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1448/v1","date":1718886686000,"content":"Studies have shown that vehicle trajectory data are effective for calibrating microsimulation mod-els. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology offers high-resolution 3-D data, allowing for detailed mapping of the surrounding environment, including road geometry, roadside infrastruc-tures, and moving objects such as vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. This research presents a comprehensive framework for integrating LiDAR sensor data into simulation models and accu-rately calibrating for proactive safety analysis. Vehicle trajectory data were extracted from LiDAR point cloud collected at six urban signalized intersections in Lubbock, Texas in USA. Each study intersection was modelled with PTV VISSIM and calibrated to replicate the observed field scenarios. The Directed Brute Force method was used to calibrate two car-following and two lane-change parameters of Wiedemann 1999 model in VISSIM, resulting in an average accuracy of 92.7%. Rear-end conflicts extracted from the calibrated models combined with a ten-year historical crash dataset were fitted into a Negative Binomial (NB) model to estimate the model's parameters. In all the six intersections, rear-end conflict count is a statistically significant predictor (p-value &lt; 0.05) of observed rear-end crash frequency. The outcome of this study provides a framework for the com-bined use of LiDAR-based vehicle trajectory data, microsimulation and surrogate safety assessment tools to transportation professionals for proactive safety evaluation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be3098e02f1abb5269274662a48620617c057945a015f56c786b3b29a7b89827","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
