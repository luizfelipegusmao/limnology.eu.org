{"title":"Characterisation of Al-alloy EN AW-5454","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1989/v1","date":1724830825000,"content":"A complementary characterisation of the Al-alloy EN AW-5454 was carried out, intended for obtaining the laser hybrid welding parameters of sub-assemblies in the automotive industry. The investigation included a microstructural examination, and determination of the alloy's properties using several analytical methods (HV5 hardness measurement, tensile test, Charpy impact toughness, fracture mechanics analysis). Samples were prepared in the longitudinal and transverse directions of a cold-rolled sheet of EN AW-5454 with thicknesses of 3.5 mm and 4 mm. The measured hardness on the thinner sheet was 5% higher than on the thicker sheet. The tensile and yield strength were nominal, while the elongations were smaller by 2.2 - 3.2% for the longitudinal samples and by 2.7 - 13.7% for the transverse samples. The smaller deviations from the nominal values are for the thinner sheet metal. A precise topographical analysis showed brittle fractures of the samples. The Charpy impact toughness results on the thicker plate showed a 20% greater work needed to break it in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction. With the thinner sheet metal, 40% greater work was needed. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) analysis has shown that the intermetallic Al6(Mn,Fe) particles in the longitudinal samples were mostly intact, with evidence of tough areas on the upper part of the fracture, indicating a better toughness than the specimens in the transverse direction. More crushed intermetallic particles were observed at the fractures of the transverse samples, and their distribution appeared to be more oriented in the direction of rolling. Fracture mechanics SENB (single edge notch bending) tests and their analysis showed that the resistance of the material to crack propagation in the longitudinal sample was about 50% greater than that in the transverse sample. SEM analysis of the fractures showed that the state of the intermetallic particles in the fracture mechanics testing, and the fracture mechanism differed from the one in the Charpy fractures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20950f809f7de1b4d8bc9ec4b5faf8c0e84832e8215729192d2b6f4edfff3184","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
