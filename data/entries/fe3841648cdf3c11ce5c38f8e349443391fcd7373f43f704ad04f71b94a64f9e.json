Diabetics should constantly measure their blood sugar. There are also many common methods used to measure blood sugar levels, and this project significantly accelerates diabetes monitoring, academic research and maintenance. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of several intrinsic properties is of fundamental importance because it contains effects that affect the behavior of the aqueous solution and the safety of the diabetic patient. The dielectric constant of the aqueous solution of different samples of raw sugar is also are make able property in this context. \nThe electrical properties of any material vary according to the properties of the insulating material. Accurate measurement so these properties will be useful for many electronics applications, and these measurements of dielectric materials affect the data values of basic design parameters. For example, both the frequency and impedance of microwaves are affected by the properties of the dielectric material. Additionally, this knowledge can be applied to improve the basic design.\nThrough this research, we will discuss the electrical insulation properties in terms of permittivity and permeability. But it is necessary to address microwave resistance. Permittivity and permeability are not fixed values, as they are affected by many factors such as frequency, temperature, direction, mixing, pressure, and different samples of sugar in the aqueous solution","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe3841648cdf3c11ce5c38f8e349443391fcd7373f43f704ad04f71b94a64f9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
