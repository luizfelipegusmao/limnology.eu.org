{"title":"Melatonin extends shelf life in postharvest okra via delaying fruit softening and reducing weight loss","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13773?af=R","date":1721730556000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Melatonin, a hormone present in animals and some plants, has garnered attention for its potential in preserving harvested produce. Softening due to changes in cell wall composition and wilting caused by weight loss are the major reasons for the loss of commercial value in postharvest okra. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of melatonin on the softening and weight loss of postharvest okra.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results revealed that the application of melatonin had a significant influence on the maintenance of fruit firmness by inhibiting the breakdown and dissolution of cell wall polysaccharides by suppressing the expression of specific genes responsible for cell wall degradation in okra. Conversely, melatonin treatment positively influenced the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of cell wall components. Furthermore, the treatment exhibited notable benefits in reducing weight loss in okra, which was accomplished by promoting the closure of stomata – the tiny pores on the surface of the fruit.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Melatonin could serve as a novel approach to reduce water loss, delay fruit softening and extend the shelf life of okra. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Liyu Shi, \nMengze Cao, \nXiaotian Lu, \nWanqi Dong, \nQingqing Lan, \nWei Chen, \nZhenfeng Yang, \nXuewen Li, \nShifeng Cao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3e1dc14182c69c60e227e21f2d8f1acbfa514df88499cf8a2d1b92049e6ac5f9","category":"Environment"}
