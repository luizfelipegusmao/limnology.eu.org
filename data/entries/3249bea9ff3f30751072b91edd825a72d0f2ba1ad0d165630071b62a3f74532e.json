{"title":"52 Differences in body composition measurements for developing Angus heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/83/7757208?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The profitability of beef cow-calf operations relies on the reproductive ability of females to calve at 2 yr of age and provide a calf each subsequent year for her lifetime. The management of replacement heifers could affect her ability to conceive early, calve, and rebreed. Common management practices use heifer body weight (BW) (and body condition score (BCS) as indicators of puberty onset but do not indicate body composition and fat deposition. The objective of this study was to use ultrasound measurements of carcass traits to compare the effect of different diet management practices on muscle development and fat deposition of post-weaning heifers. The heifers placed on a higher energy diet are expected to have greater mean carcass trait measurements than the lower energy diet heifers. A total of 124 purebred Angus heifers from the Iowa State University McNay Memorial Research and Demonstration Farm were used for this study. Two diets were administered in this study. One group of heifers (G1; n = 61) was developed on a low-energy roughage diet to reach a target BW of 55% of mature BW at the time of breeding. The second group (G2; n = 63) was developed on a grain diet to reach the target BW of 65% mature BW at breeding. Body weight and ultrasound measurements for backfat (BFAT), ribeye area (REA), and intramuscular fat (IMF) were collected over three time points (0-d, 55-d, and 123-d) during the study to quantify the development of body composition characteristics. The initial measurements were collected 1 wk post-weaning. Significant mean differences between the two groups were observed for BW, BFAT, and REA at 55-d (<span>P</span> = 0.027, <span>P</span> = 0.008, and <span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001, respectively), and 123-d (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). The mean differences for BW, BFAT, and REA at 123-d between G1 and G2 were 30.98 kg, 0.10 cm, and 7.81 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively No significant difference was found between the groups for IMF measurements at 55-d (<span>P</span> = 0.927) or 123-d (<span>P</span> = 0.169). This suggests IMF is not significantly influenced by diet during the early, post-weaning heifer developmental stage. Although further research is needed, the results from this study suggest the development of weight, BFAT, and REA in early post-weaning beef heifers is influenced by the energy concentration of the diet.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3249bea9ff3f30751072b91edd825a72d0f2ba1ad0d165630071b62a3f74532e","category":"Environment"}
