Marine ecosystems are both victim to this human behaviour as a  recipient of human pollution as well as being  a source of medicinal chemicals which can cure a variety of diseases. In this paper, we review the chemical basis of water-based treatments and their effects on human health, while focusing on the threats to marine ecosystems and the potential benefits of balneotherapy, thalassotherapy, and bioactive chemical species. We found that seawater has potential benefits for skin health, demonstrating emollient properties, protection against skin barrier disruption, and inhibition of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions. We present the putative mechanisms by which minerals, salts, and marine organic matter can slow down disease progression, through their numerous activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound healing properties. Water-living organisms also have an impact on such mechanisms by producing biologically active compounds with beneficial effects on human health.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"2be6a5a060ac3dd245cb2b17fc19ac512c4cc241d4f589f5bd41de34bb43e315","category":"Environment"}
