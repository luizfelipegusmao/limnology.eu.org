{"title":"Metasurface-based dual-sense circularly polarized antenna for MIMO/full-duplex applications","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304983","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Duc-Nguyen Tran-Viet, Hong Nguyen Tuan, Dinh Nguyen Quoc, Dat Nguyen Tien, Hung Tran-Huy</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces a two-element antenna array with dual-sense circular polarization, wideband operation, and high isolation characteristics. The antenna consists of two conventional truncated corner patches and an extra layer of metasurface (MS) located above the radiating patches. The overall dimensions of the proposed antenna are 0.92 λ<sub>0</sub> × 0.73 λ<sub>0</sub> × 0.05 λ<sub>0</sub> and the element spacings are 0.02 λ<sub>0</sub> and 0.39 λ<sub>0</sub> with respect to edge-to-edge and center-to-center spacings. For validation, measurements on a fabricated antenna prototype are carried out. The measured data demonstrate that the presented MS-based antenna has a wide operating bandwidth of 14.5% with high isolation of better than 26 dB. The excellent performance could be concluded from the results of the investigation, which indicates that the proposed MS-based antenna could be a good candidate for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and full-duplex applications.","author":"Duc-Nguyen Tran-Viet","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"268e6f57ff860537aa708cbd18790b61d535087d1ed88c3aeec205cafea3f139","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
