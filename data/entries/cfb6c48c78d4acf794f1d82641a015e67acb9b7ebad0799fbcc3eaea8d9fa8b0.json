{"title":"Effects of Lignin on the Thermal and Morphological Properties and Damages Mechanisms after UV Irradiation of Polypropylene Biocomposites Reinforced with Flax and Pine Fibres: Acoustic Emission Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1242/v1","date":1710950634000,"content":"Various wood fibres, including pine and flax, are used in wood–plastic composites (WPCs). This paper studies the effect of the lignin content on the morphological and thermal degradation and damage due to the ultraviolet (UV) aging of polypropylene/flax (PP-flax) and polypropylene/pine (PP-pine) fibres composites. Flax and pine fibres exhibited distinct densities of 1.51 and 1.47 g/cm³, respectively, potentially influenced by growth factors and varying compositions of light substances, such as hemicellulose, lignin, and impurities. The thermal decomposition mass loss increased proportionally with the percentage of lignin in the fibre. From 238°C to 390°C, the pine fibre exhibited a 72% mass loss compared to flax fibre, which showed a 54% mass loss, owing to the higher lignin content in pine fibres. Based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the fibre composition affected the material melting temperature. Moreover, DSC curves revealed a higher degree of crystallinity in the case of the PP-flax biocomposite (12%) compared to pure polypropylene (9%) and PP-pine (6%). This result can be attributed to the high content of crystalline components in flax fibres, such as cellulose. Acoustic emissions analysis confirmed that the high lignin content delays degradation and mitigates the appearance of microcracks on the surface of the PP-pine biocomposite. Overall, the study provides valuable data for understanding the UV degradation phenomenon in biocomposites and highlights the influence of fibre composition on material performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfb6c48c78d4acf794f1d82641a015e67acb9b7ebad0799fbcc3eaea8d9fa8b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
