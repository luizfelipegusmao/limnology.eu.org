{"title":"Plant-based Diets and Phytochemicals in the Management of Diabetes Mellitus and Prevention of its Complications: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1739/v1","date":1724662809000,"content":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is currently regarded as a global public health crisis for which lifelong treatment with conventional drugs present limitations in terms of side effects, accessibility and cost. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), usually associated with obesity, is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, hyperlipidemia, chronic inflammation, impaired Î²-cell function and insulin resistance. If left untreated or when poorly controlled, DM increases the risk of vascular complications such as hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy that can be severely debilitating or life-threatening. Plant-based foods represent a promising natural approach for the management of T2DM due to the vast array of phytochemicals they contain. Numerous epidemiological studies have highlighted the importance of a diet rich in plant-based foods (vegetables, fruits, spices, condiments) in the prevention and management of DM. Unlike conventional medications, such natural products are widely accessible, affordable, and generally free from adverse effects. Integrating plant-derived foods into the daily diet not only helps control the hyperglycemia observed in DM, but also supports weight management in obese individuals and has broad health benefits. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathogenesis and current therapeutic management of DM, with a particular focus on the promising potential of plant-based foods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b03b59a6866bd00fb774103a52b513e964bac81daa539b08664147525aa5629","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
