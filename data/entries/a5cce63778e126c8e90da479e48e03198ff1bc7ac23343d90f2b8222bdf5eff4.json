{"title":"Impacts of knowledge and trust on consumer perceptions and purchase intentions towards genetically modified foods","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311257","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Thi Thuy An Ngo, Thi Yen Nhi Phan, Thi Ngoc Trang Le</p>\r\n\r\nGenetically Modified Foods (GMF) have emerged as a significant topic within the global food industry, provoking extensive debates over their safety and impact on consumer choices. This research aims to explore the impact of knowledge and trust in GMF on Vietnamese consumers’ perceptions and their subsequent purchase intentions. By employing a quantitative methodology, this study gathered data from 424 valid respondents. The research model focuses on five constructs: knowledge, trust, perceived benefits, perceived risks, and purchase intentions. The data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test hypotheses and examine the interrelationships among these constructs. The results showed that increased knowledge of GMF is linked to heightened perceptions of benefits and reduced perceptions of risks, thereby elevating purchase intentions. Trust in GMF significantly enhances perceived benefits but does not significantly affect risk evaluation, although it is positively correlated with purchase intentions. Moreover, perceptions of greater benefits are positively associated with higher purchase intentions, whereas increased risk perceptions negatively influence them. These results underscore the complex relationship among knowledge, trust, perceived benefits, and perceived risks in shaping consumer purchase intentions toward GMF. The study proposes a comprehensive model delineating how knowledge and trust impact Vietnamese consumers’ perceptions and purchase intentions regarding GMF. These findings provide implications for policymakers, business managers, and marketers, emphasizing the importance of disseminating transparent information, prioritizing trust-building, and adopting nuanced communication strategies. By effectively enhancing perceived benefits and addressing perceived risks, these strategies aim to foster positive consumer intentions and behaviors toward GMF.","author":"Thi Thuy An Ngo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a5cce63778e126c8e90da479e48e03198ff1bc7ac23343d90f2b8222bdf5eff4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
