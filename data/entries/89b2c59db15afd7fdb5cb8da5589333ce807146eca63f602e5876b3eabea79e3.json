{"title":"Improvement of Fatigue Strength of Additively Manufactured Aluminum Alloy AlSi10Mg by Submerged Laser Peening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2522/v1","date":1722412407000,"content":"As fatigue properties of as-built components of additively manufactured (AM) metals are considerably weaker than those of wrought metals because of rougher surface, post-processing is necessary to improve fatigue properties. To demonstrate improvement of fatigue properties of AM metals by post-processing, powder bed fusion (PBF) using laser sintering (LS) AlSi10Mg, i.e., PBF-LS/AlSi10Mg was treated by “submerged laser peening (SLP)” using a fiber laser and/or a Nd:YAG laser, then evaluated by plane bending fatigue tests. At SLP, “laser ablation (LA)” is generated by a pulsed laser, and a bubble is generated after LA, which behaves like a cavitation bubble that is named as “laser cavitation (LC)”. In the present paper, LA-dominated SLP is called as “laser treatment (LT)”, while LC-collapse-dominated SLP is called as “laser cavitation peening (LCP)”, as impact at LC collapse is used for peening. It was revealed that SLP using the fiber laser was LT rather than LCP. It was demonstrated that the fatigue strength at N = 10^7 was 85 MPa for LCP, and 103 MPa for combined process of blasting (B) + LT + LCP, whereas the fatigue strength of as-built specimen was 54 MPa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89b2c59db15afd7fdb5cb8da5589333ce807146eca63f602e5876b3eabea79e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
