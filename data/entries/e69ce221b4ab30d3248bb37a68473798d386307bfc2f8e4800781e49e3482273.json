{"title":"Diaphragm Muscle Atrophy Contribute to Low Physical Capacity in COVID-19 Survivors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1232/v1","date":1718703874000,"content":"Fatigue and dyspnea are the most commonly presented long-term complaints in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of the study was to comprehensively evaluate diaphragm muscle function in COVID-19 survivors, as well as investigate whether potential diaphragm dysfunction will contribute to physical functioning impairment. 46 patients qualified to pulmonary rehabilitation were examined. Diaphragm muscle function parameters were evaluated using ultrasonography, while severity of dyspnea, aerobic capacity and amount of energy used by the body during physical activity were assessed by 6-minute walk test, mMRC scale and Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET), respectively. We identified 69.5% patients with diaphragm atrophy and 6.5% with diaphragm paralysis. Percentage of atrophy was not related to age, gender, BMI index, oxygen therapy use during COVID-19 infection course and severity of disease. Patients with presence of cough, fever and without loss of smell during COVID-19 course had a significantly greater values of diaphragm inspiratory thickness, while patients with cough and no smell disorders had a significantly lower percentage of diaphragm atrophy. Diaphragm functional parameters were strongly associated with selected variables of person's exercise tolerance, such as distance in 6-minute walk test, saturation level, fatigue and exertion in Borg scale. In conclusion, diaphragm muscle dysfunction is a serious long-term post-COVID aftermath and can be viewed as a major contributing factor of prolonged functional impairments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e69ce221b4ab30d3248bb37a68473798d386307bfc2f8e4800781e49e3482273","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
