{"title":"Grain Structure Engineering in Screen-Printed Silver Flake-Based Inks for High-Temperature Printed Electronics Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0077/v1","date":1725334606000,"content":"We extensively studied serigraphic screen-printed commercial silver flake inks loaded with silicon inclusions in order to achieve pinning at the grain boundaries. Based on grain size measurements using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), commercial silver ink with silicon microparticle content of 5 wt.% shows a significant grain growth retardation compared to the pristine silver ink, which stabilizes electrical conductivity up to 700 ◦C via Zener pinning mechanism. The modified silicon-loaded silver ink experiences a two times increase in grain size when heated up to 700 ◦C, compared to a seven times increase for the pristine silver ink. In turn, this enables operation temperatures significantly higher than the conventional operational window of microparticle-based silver inks, which are usually limited to 400 ◦C. Using isothermal exposures of 10 minutes up to 4 hours this phenomenon is observed at temperatures ranging from 250 ◦C to 900 ◦C. The electrical conductivity stability, grain size evolution and oxide contents were studied up to 4 hours. The activation energy of silver ink with silicon inclusions is 54% lower than for the pristine silver ink due to pining effect, which retards grain growth via the Zener mechanism. Most importantly, the electrical resistivity becomes stable up to 700 ◦C, which is more than twice the operation limit for off-the-shelf screen-printable silver flake inks. Hence, we demonstrate that adding controlled amounts of silicon particles to silver inks towards grain structure engineering can open new vistas of possibilities for screen-printed metallic inks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d84c774b3099f06a83cbefce164bca5186f53e2b63832b86ab621e79352e5ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
