{"title":"A compact topic: How ethylene controls crown root development in compacted soil","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2063/7634540?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span>Compacted soil is an often-overlooked problem in agriculture, as it does not show at the soil surface but rather occurs under the tilled soil layers. It is considered one of the biggest environmental problems arising from agriculture, caused by the deployment of heavy machinery and by tillage practices (<a href=\"#koae091-B1\">Hamza and Anderson 2005</a>). Soil compaction limits the availability and transport of water and nutrients and makes the penetration of roots into deeper soil layers more difficult (<a href=\"#koae091-B1\">Hamza and Anderson 2005</a>). Recently, it was shown that roots can sense the level of soil compaction through the volatile hormone ethylene: compacted soil reduces gas diffusion through a reduction of air-filled pores. This hinders the diffusion of ethylene, which then accumulates in the root tissue, resulting in an inhibition of root growth (<a href=\"#koae091-B4\">Pandey et al. 2021</a>). At the same time, ethylene is also known as a developmental signal promoting the outgrowth of crown roots in rice (<a href=\"#koae091-B3\">Lin and Sauter 2018</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"166e56e61572d378d92a7f250de9655499566cd55eb3df7b5043534a8185633d","category":"Environment"}
