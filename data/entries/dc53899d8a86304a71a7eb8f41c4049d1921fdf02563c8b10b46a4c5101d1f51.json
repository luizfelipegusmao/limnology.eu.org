{"title":"An Overview of Current and New Data Quality Dimensions under a Common Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1076/v1","date":1726216768000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of Data Quality terminology, revealing a significant lack of standardisation in the field. We propose a novel approach to aggregating disparate Data Quality terms used to describe the multiple facets of Data Quality, under common umbrella terms, with a focus on the ISO 25012 standard. Our aim is to design a Data Quality Data Model that serves as a universally applicable framework for Data Quality assessment. We introduce four additional Data Quality dimensions: Governance, Usefulness, Quantity, and Semantics, enhancing specificity, complementing the framework established by the ISO 25012 standard, and understanding of Data Quality aspects. The ISO 25012 standard, while tailored for software development, offers a foundation for the development of our proposed Data Quality Data Model. This is due to the prevalent nature of software development across a multitude of domains. In contrast, frameworks like ALCOA+ that are specific to certain domains lack the ability to be generalised. The model we propose can be seen as a \"Rosetta Stone\" for Data Quality terminology, facilitating a seamless communication of Data Quality between different domains when collaboration is required to tackle cross-domain projects or challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc53899d8a86304a71a7eb8f41c4049d1921fdf02563c8b10b46a4c5101d1f51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
