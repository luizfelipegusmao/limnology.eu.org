{"title":"Wheat Cybrid Plants, OryzaWheat, Regenerated from Wheat–Rice Hybrid Zygotes via in Vitro Fertilization System Possess Wheat–Rice Hybrid Mitochondria","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1344/7728159?rss=1","date":1722988800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hybridization generates biodiversity, and wide hybridization plays a pivotal role in enhancing and broadening the useful attributes of crops. The hybridization barrier between wheat and rice, the two most important cereals, was recently overcome by in vitro production of allopolyploid wheat–rice hybrid zygotes, which can develop and grow into mature plants. In the study, genomic sequences and compositions of the possible hybrid plants were investigated through short- and long-read sequencing analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based visualization. The possible hybrid possessed whole wheat nuclear and cytoplasmic DNAs and rice mitochondrial (mt) DNA, along with variable retention rates of rice mtDNA ranging from 11% to 47%. The rice mtDNA retained in the wheat cybrid, termed <sup>Oryza</sup>wheat, can be transmitted across generations. In addition to mitochondrial hybridization, translocation of rice chromosome 1 into wheat chromosome 6A was detected in a F1 hybrid individual. <sup>Oryza</sup>Wheat can provide a new horizon for utilizing inter-subfamily genetic resources among wheat and rice belonging to different subfamilies, Pooideae and Ehrhartoideae, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"8d0150cb89bf059ec52155c5ee4f02354e46b60b89ab3fa47fa0e3df6ecaeb7e","category":"Environment"}
