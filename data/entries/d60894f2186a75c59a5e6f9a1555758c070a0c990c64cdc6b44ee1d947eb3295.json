{"title":"Predictive Analysis of Osteoarthritis and Chronic Pancreatitis Comorbidity: Complications and Risk Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1125/v1","date":1721031970000,"content":"Osteoarthritis and chronic pancreatitis comorbidity are insufficiently studied, and the reciprocal impact of these conditions remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate potential predictors for the development of osteoarthritis and chronic pancreatitis comorbidity, as well as complications associated with this comorbidity. A cohort of 150 patients was categorized into three groups: a control group (n=30), patients with osteoarthritis (n=68), and patients with comorbid osteoarthritis and chronic pancreatitis (n=52). Potential predictors for comorbidity development and associated complications were explored. The study revealed that concurrent osteoarthritis and chronic pancreatitis exacerbate each other's progression and contribute to malnutrition. Body Mass Index (BMI) emerged as a potential predictor for chronic pancreatitis development in osteoarthritis patients. In osteoarthritis patients, fecal elastase-1 levels were identified as potential predictors for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Factors such as WOMAC total score, fecal elastase-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, retinol, tocopherol, 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, and BMI were found to influence comorbidity development between osteoarthritis and chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Diarrhea Syndrome (GSRS-DS), Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Constipation syndrome (GSRS-CS), Qualitative Assessment of the Symptoms and Impact of Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency domain A (PEI-Q-A), retinol, tocopherol, and iron were identified as potential predictors for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in osteoarthritis patients. In conclusion, the comorbidity of osteoarthritis and chronic pancreatitis exacerbates disease progression and complications, necessitating further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d60894f2186a75c59a5e6f9a1555758c070a0c990c64cdc6b44ee1d947eb3295","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
