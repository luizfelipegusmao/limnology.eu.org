{"title":"Neuromorphic Sensor Based on FSR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1245/v1","date":1713442497000,"content":"This work introduces a neuromorphic sensor based on force-sensing resistors (FSR) and spiking neurons for robotic systems. The proposed sensor integrates the FSR in the schematic of spiking neuron in order to make the sensor to generate spikes with frequency that depends on the applied force. The performance of the proposed sensor is evaluated for the control of a SMA-actuated ro-botic finger by monitoring the force during steady state when the finger pushes on a tweezers. For comparison purposes, we performed similar evaluation when the SNN receives input from a widely used compression load cell (CLC). The results show that the proposed FSR based neuro-morphic sensor has very good sensitivity to low forces and the function between the spiking rate and the applied force is continuous with good variation range. However, when compared to the CLC, the proposed sensor has lower linearity of the response, but it benefits from two orders of magnitude lower power consumption. These aspects imply that the neuromorphic sensor based on FSR are useful for bioinspired control of humanoid robotics representing a low power and low cost alternative the widely used sensors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"763c1c71462e767fae076b1998a5c223d0505ecbd8fc69a76846fbf09fdbcf6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
