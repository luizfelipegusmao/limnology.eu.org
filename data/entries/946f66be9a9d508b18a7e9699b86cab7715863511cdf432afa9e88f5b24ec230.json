{"title":"Expanding the scope and roles of social sciences and humanities to support integrated ecosystem assessments and ecosystem-based management","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/1/22/7337019?rss=1","date":1698883200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding social-ecological systems (SESs) is an important part of ecosystem-based management (EBM). One of the main decision support frameworks to develop scientific advice for EBM is integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs). Human dimensions in SESs are primarily captured through indicators derived from three social sciences: economics, anthropology, and sociology. The breadth of social sciences and humanities (SSH) research is much greater than those three fields, but they are generally underused in natural science-based decision support processes such as IEAs. Greater contributions of SSHs can enhance IEAs through various direct (e.g. to develop indicators) and indirect ways (e.g. to establish and maintain ethical practices). We examine a wider range of SSH disciplines and conclude that scientific advice processes that inform EBM can benefit from broader integration of SSH theories and methods through themes of contextualizing, facilitating, communicating, evaluating, and anticipating. We see this an opportunity to both widen the vocabulary used to describe social scientists and those who work in humanities in IEAs, and apply the underlying worldviews used to conduct SSH research to fundamentally enhance the IEA process and to further progress in EBM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"946f66be9a9d508b18a7e9699b86cab7715863511cdf432afa9e88f5b24ec230","category":"Environment"}
