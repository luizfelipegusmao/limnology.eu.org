{"title":"Green finance improves enterprisesâ€™ environmental, social and governance performance: A two-dimensional perspective based on external financing capability and internal technological innovation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302198","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Hongfeng Zhang, Shuying Wei</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper takes the establishment of the Green Financial Reform and Innovation Pilot Zone (GFPZ) in 2017 as a natural experiment, adopts the data of a-share industrial listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2020, and utilizes the difference-in-differences (DID) method to carry out empirical tests. The results show that (1) GFPZ policy significantly improves the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of enterprises, and the positive effect is mainly realized by improving the external financing ability and green-technology innovation level of enterprises. (2) There is heterogeneity in the impact of GFPZ policy on the ESG performance of firms with different equity natures and internal control levels. (3) Green finance promotes active corporate social responsibility, and it can further improve environmental governance in the regions where it operates. This paper provides a useful supplement to the comprehensive understanding of green-finance policy effects and ESG impact factors, and it is of great significance in mitigating the negative environmental and social externalities caused by the excessive pursuit of economic benefits by enterprises.","author":"Hongfeng Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"505b9bc2d52ac80e167b6deecb34698ac47debbdf6cb6649276167ad7994f377","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
