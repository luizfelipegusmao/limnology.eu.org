{"title":"Smart Governance among Smart Cities for Legal Consideration to International Data Migration in Cloud Using Machine Learning , Nlp and Blockchain Smart Contract","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1028/v1","date":1723683336000,"content":"Legal consideration hold significant importance in the cloud migration process, encompassing contractual arrangements, data sovereignty concerns, and liability matters. Organizations need to make sure that their contracts with cloud service providers (CSPS) cover important aspects such as data ownership, usage rights, and indemnification clauses. In the ever-changing world of smart cities, the importance of ensuring secure, compliant, and efficient data migration across international borders has become more crucial than ever. This paper introduces a new framework that combines natural language processing (NLP), and blockchain smart contracts to tackle the intricate legal issues involved in moving data across borders in cloud settings. The framework starts by utilizing an NLP model to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, and DPDPA, which are specific to the destination jurisdiction of the data. After confirming the verification, the smart contract initiates the data transfer process, securely recording metadata such as file hash, timestamp, and transfer details on the blockchain, guaranteeing transparency and immutability. After the transfer, an international vendor at the destination verifies the data against the relevant legal requirements, guaranteeing compliance before storing it in the destination cloud. By adopting this approach, we can ensure the legal validity of cross-border data transfers, while also promoting trust and accountability among all parties involved in smart city ecosystems. The findings indicate that this framework has the potential to greatly reduce the risks associated with data sovereignty, liability, and contractual obligations when moving data to the cloud.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44eedefa2f9c783139292f83a6db59e40e1607fa5d9deb9bd4fc8b0eaff59871","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
