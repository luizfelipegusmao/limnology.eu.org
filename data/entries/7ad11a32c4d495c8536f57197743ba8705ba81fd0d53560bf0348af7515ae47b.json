{"title":"Conjugated Diphenylaniline&ndash;Azulene Co-Oligomers with Intense Absorption and Emission in the Visible Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1077/v1","date":1728953824000,"content":"New conjugated 2,6-diphenylaniline-azulene co-oligomers of linear and branched structure were synthesized by the interaction of borylazulenes with diphenylaniline bromides under Suzu-ki-Miyaura cross-coupling conditions. The obtained diphenylaniline-azulene co-oligomers inten-sively absorb and emit visible light (410-700 nm region), in particular, exhibits strong emission in the green as well as orange range with maxima of 510 / 590 nm. It is shown that such properties appear as a result of the positive resonance exposure to ani-line fragments significantly rearranging the electronic structure of azulene, in particular, the lev-els and energy gaps of frontal HOMO - LUMO orbitals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ad11a32c4d495c8536f57197743ba8705ba81fd0d53560bf0348af7515ae47b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
