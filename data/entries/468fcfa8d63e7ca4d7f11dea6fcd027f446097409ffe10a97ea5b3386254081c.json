However, the low level of omega-3 fatty acids in its body makes this species less attractive compared with marine fish. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different oils on growth performance, body composition, and fatty acids in striped catfish juveniles. A basal diet (T0) was formulated to contain no oil, while four other diets (T1, T2, T3, and T4) were supplemented at 4% with different oils, including salmon oil (SALO), soybean oil (SBO), linseed oil (LSO), and rapeseed oil (RSO). Catfish juveniles with initial body weight (23–24 g/fish) were randomly stocked in 500-L fiberglass tanks, divided into five treatments, three replicates for each, and fed the experimental diets for 60 days. Results from this study revealed that fish fed the LSO-supplemented diet had significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) improved whole body omega-3 (alpha-linoleic acid, 18:3n3) fatty acid levels (7.86%), total n-3 fatty acids (9.12%), and higher growth than those fed the other diets. In conclusion, the findings suggest that linseed oil can be used to improve growth, omega-3 fatty acid, C18:3–3 (ALA), and total n-3 PUFA deposition in the whole body of striped catfish juveniles.</p>","author":"Nguyen Van Nguyen, \nPham Nhu Hao, \nPham Duy Hai, \nLe Thanh Hung","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"468fcfa8d63e7ca4d7f11dea6fcd027f446097409ffe10a97ea5b3386254081c","category":"Environment"}
