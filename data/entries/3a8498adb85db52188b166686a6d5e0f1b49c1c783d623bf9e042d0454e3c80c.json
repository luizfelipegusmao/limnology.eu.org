{"title":"Phosphate Uptake and Its Relation with Arsenic Toxicity in Lactobacilli","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0652/v1","date":1710172546000,"content":"Use of probiotic lactobacilli has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate damage associated to exposure to toxic metals. Their protective effect against cationic metal ions, such as those of mercury or lead, is believed to stem from their chelating and accumulating potential. However, their retention of anionic toxic metalloids, such as inorganic arsenic, is generally lower. Through the construction of mutants in phosphate transporter genes (pst) in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strains, coupled with arsenate [As(V)] uptake and toxicity assays, we determined that the incorporation of As(V), which structurally resembles phosphate, is likely facilitated by phosphate transporters. Surprisingly, inactivation in Lc. paracasei of PhoP, the tran-scriptional regulator of the two-component system PhoPR, a signal transducer involved in phosphate sensing, led to an increased resistance to arsenite [As(III)]. In comparison to the wild type, the phoP strain exhibited no differences in the ability to retain As(III), and there were no observed changes in the oxidation of As(III) to the less toxic As(V). These results reinforce the idea that specific transport, and not unspecific cell retention plays a role in As(V) biosorption by lactobacilli, while they reveal an unexpected phenotype for the lack of the pleiotropic regulator PhoP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a8498adb85db52188b166686a6d5e0f1b49c1c783d623bf9e042d0454e3c80c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
