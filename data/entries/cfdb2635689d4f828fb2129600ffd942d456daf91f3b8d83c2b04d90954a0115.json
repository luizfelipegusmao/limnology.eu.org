{"title":"Visual Fixation of Skull Vibration Induced Nystagmus in Patients with Peripheral Vestibulopathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0418/v1","date":1715154366000,"content":"Nystagmus induced by applying an intense vibratory stimulus to the skull (SVIN) indicates vestibular functional asymmetry. In unilateral vestibular loss, a 100-Hz bone-conducted vibration given to either mastoid immediately causes a primarily horizontal nystagmus. Test is performed in darkness to avoid visual fixation (VF) but there is no data about how much VF affects the often-intense SVIN. The aim is to analyze the amount of reduction of SVIN when VF is allowed during testing. Thus, all patients seen in a tertiary hospital for vertigo or dizziness with positive SVIN were included. SVIN was recorded for 10 seconds for each condition: without VF (aSVINwo) and VF (aSVINw). We obtained an aSVINwo and aSVINw as average slow-phase velocities (SPV) without and with VF. VF index (FISVIN) was calculated as the ratio of SPV. Among the 124 patients included, spontaneous nystagmus (SN) was found in 25% and the mSPV (without VF) of SN was 2.62.4ยบ/s. Mean FISVIN was 0.270.29. FISVIN was 0 in 42 patients and &amp;gt;0 FISVIN &amp;lt;1 in 82 (mean FISVIN 0.390.02). Fixation suppression was found in all patients with SVIN in cases of peripheral vestibulopathy. FISVIN clearly delineates two populations of patients: with or without complete visual reduction of nystagmus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfdb2635689d4f828fb2129600ffd942d456daf91f3b8d83c2b04d90954a0115","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
