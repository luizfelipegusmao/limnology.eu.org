Currently, there exist two systems that have already delivered mm<sup>3</sup>-sized synaptic resolution electron microscopy stacks: Multi-beam scanning electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.328-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.328-B2\">2</a>] (mSEM) and Gridtape-based automated transmission electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.328-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.328-B4\">4</a>] (Gridtape-TEM). Both techniques currently rely on collecting and imaging thousands of ultrathin serial sections (30 - 40 nm) being cut with a diamond knife on an ultramicrotome and collected on a tape, silicon wafer or gridtape. However, serial collection of ultrathin sections is delicate and inherently prone to failures and artefacts such as section loss, folds, cracks or knife marks. More than 50% of the errors of today's state-of-the-art automated neuron segmentation algorithms can be attributed to missing information due to serial sectioning. Consequently, more than 40 hours of manual segmentation proofreading by human experts are currently required to reconstruct a single cortical pyramidal cell accurately.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9554039e6a2eea34a01afaf74d8f4d5e5af7249ab1a88768ff3790c6ee6e196c","category":"Environment"}
