{"title":"A New Rotary Magnetorheological Damper for a Semi-Active Suspension System of low-Floor Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1103/v1","date":1710828572000,"content":"This study explores the significance of active suspension systems for vehicles with lower chassis compared to conventional ones, aiming at the development of future automobiles. Conventional linear MR (Magneto-Rheological) dampers were found inadequate in ensuring sufficient vibration control because the vehicle's chassis becomes lowered in the unmanned vehicles or purposed based vehicles. As an alternative, a rotary type of MR damper is proposed in this work. The proposed damper is designed based on pre-specified design parameters through mathematical modeling and magnetic field analyses. Subsequently, a prototype of the rotary MR damper identical to the design is fabricated, and effectiveness is shown through experimental investigations. In configuring the experiments, a proportional-integral (PI) controller is employed for current control to reduce the response time of the damper. The results presented in this work provides useful guidelines to develop a new type of MR damper applicable to various types of future vehiclesâ€™ suspension systems with low distance from the tire to the body floor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9408d0ac004fd54d71e0f5541a8fbca96426c014c7f558d27d9424ed8a24b86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
