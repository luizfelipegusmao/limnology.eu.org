{"title":"A life in the surf zone: Age and feeding habits of the pompano (Trachinotus ovatus, Linnaeus, 1758) on the beaches of the Gulf of Cádiz (south‐west Iberian Peninsula)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15661?af=R","date":1705481938000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Surf zones are crucial habitats for many fish species, where they spend the initial stages of their lives, finding food and shelter. One such species is the pompano (<i>Trachinotus ovatus</i>). The aim of this study was to examine the age and diet of the pompano within the surf zone, along with any potential variations in the environment. The average size of the specimens was 10.61 ± 4.91 cm. The length–weight relationship was total weight (TW) = 0.0136*total length (TL)<sup>2.8512</sup> (parameter <i>a</i>: 95% <span>C.I.</span>: 0.0130–0.0142 and parameter <i>b</i>: 95% <span>C.I.</span>: 2.8318–2.8705). The most abundant age classes were 0+ and 1+, making up 97% of the captured specimens, with significant differences in the abundance of age classes depending on the time of the day and season. The pompano primarily fed on clupeiforms, copepods, and mysids, with significant variations in diet based on the time of the day, season, and size of the specimens. This study contributes new information about the use of the surf zone by <i>T. ovatus</i> in its early years of life, underscoring the importance of these areas and their role as an additional ecosystem service.</p>","author":"Carlos Rodríguez‐García, \nIsabel Abad‐Rodríguez, \nJesús López‐Báez, \nRemedios Cabrera‐Castro","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"bc63b3ec39b8680da4468dae11371af761c97a02bb7e9d95bc436cc9139ecae8","category":"Environment"}
