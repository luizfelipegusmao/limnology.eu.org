{"title":"Bond performance between hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete and BFRP bars under freeze-thaw cycle","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303327","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Yanming Su</p>\r\n\r\nThis study applied the pull-out test to examine the influence of freeze-thaw cycles and hybrid fiber incorporation on the bond performance between BFRP bars and hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete. The bond-slip curves were fitted by the existing bond-slip constitutive model, and then the bond strength was predicted by a BP neural network. The results indicated that the failure mode changed from pull-out to splitting for the BFRP bar ordinary concrete specimens when the freeze-thaw cycles exceeded 50, while only pull-out failure occurred for all BFRP bar hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete specimens. An increasing trend was shown on the peak slip, but a decreasing trend was shown on the bond stiffness and bond strength when freeze-thaw cycles increased. The bond strength could be increased significantly by the incorporation of basalt fiber (BF) and cellulose fiber (CF) under the same freezing and thawing conditions as compared to concrete specimens without fibers. The Malvar model and the Continuous Curve model performed best in fitting the ascending and descending sections of the bond-slip curves, respectively. The BP neural network also accurately predicted the bond strength, with relative errors of predicted bond strengths ranging from 3.75% to 13.7%, and 86% of them being less than 10%.","author":"Yanming Su","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"94df9c98fb06874cfb9f721f6484a25d0984d9bf3449bea61195d1d5eb76bccf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
