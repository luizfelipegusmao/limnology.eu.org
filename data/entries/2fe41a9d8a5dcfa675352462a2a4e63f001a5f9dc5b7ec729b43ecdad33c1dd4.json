{"title":"Hamman&rsquo;s Syndrome after Vaginal Delivery: A Case of Postpartum Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum with Subcutaneous Emphysema and Review of the Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1376/v2","date":1716469447000,"content":"Hamman’s syndrome is a rare condition that mostly affects young males, often with a predisposition of asthma. It includes the presence of free air in the mediastinum and subcutaneous emfysema with no other underlying cause such as trauma or infection. It occurs spontanously and often in association with prolonged valsalva manouvre. This might explain why there are some cases of Hamman syndrome among young females giving birth.  Here we present a case report of a 24-year- old primigravida with Hamman’s syndrome. She presented with symptoms a few hours after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 40+1 pregnancy week. The symptoms resolved spontanously after a few days of observation. We also give a systemic review of reported cases since 2000 to provide overview on pathomechanism, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment and management of this condition. Hamman’s syndrome is a rare, usually benign, but potentially serious complication that can occur during the second stage of labour. Diagnostics include inquiring about typical symptoms, clinical examination and chest x-ray or CT scan. Treatment is usually conservative with oxygen, bronchodilators and pain relief. The reccurence rate is low and there is no contraindication to vaginal delivery in future pregnancies. However, it is suggested that physicians and midwives be cautious and consider low threshold for instrumental delivery or caesarean section to avoid excessive valsalva manoeuvre.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fe41a9d8a5dcfa675352462a2a4e63f001a5f9dc5b7ec729b43ecdad33c1dd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
