{"title":"Are Gamers Prone to eThrombosis during Long Gaming Sessions?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1565/v1","date":1711437093000,"content":"During the last two decades several cases of venous thrombosis (VTE) after a prolonged period at a computer has been described, denominated “eThrombosis”. Video gaming on a computer has become very popular and can be a social activity where several players are gathered to play against each other or in a virtual environment for several days (“LAN (i.e., Local Area Network) parties”) where the participants are sedentary and consuming calorie-rich food items. The aim of this study was to investigate a potential coagulation activation during a 42 hour LAN party.\nNine male gamers volunteered for the LAN party. Citrated blood was sampled before and every 6 hours, and plasma was analyzed for thrombin generation, and Thrombin-antithrombin-complexes (TAT), prothrombin Fragment 1+2 (F1+2), and D-dimer.\nThrombin generation increased slightly but not significantly during the LAN party, whereas the coagulation activation markers were unchanged.\nThese results do not indicate that the coagulation system is activated significantly during 42 h gaming with minimal physical activity. Although an increased activity cannot be excluded, it does not directly indicate a risk of VTE in general. It may be specific and particularly susceptible in-dividuals who are prone to thrombosis and, therefore, are at risk of developing e-thrombosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd33a59cb39aff0b33f47c6b6e1d893c6ad024854c0629300de852023c7a1609","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
