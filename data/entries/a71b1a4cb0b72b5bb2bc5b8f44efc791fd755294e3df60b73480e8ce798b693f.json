{"title":"Organizing the Chaos: Novel Insights into the Regulation of Z-3-Hexenal Production in Damaged Maize Leaves","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0176/v1","date":1725343728000,"content":"Green leaf volatiles (GLV) are important signaling compounds that help to regulate plant defenses against pests and pathogens. Made through the hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathway, they are rapidly produced upon damage and can signal this to other parts of the same plant or even plants nearby, where they can induce rapid defense responses directly or prime them against the impending danger. In this primed state plants can respond faster and/or stronger should pests or pathogens attack. However, while all proteins and genes involved in the biosynthesis of GLV have been identified, little is still known about how the first two steps in the pathway, e.g., oxygenation by a lipoxygenase (LOX) and subsequent cleavage by HPL are facilitated within the damaged tissue, resulting in the production of Z-3-hexenal (Z3al) as the first committed product of the pathway. Here, we provide evidence that several factors might be involved in the production of Z3al including pH, Ca2+, and an environment that is highly hydrophobic. We present a model in which the extraordinary circumstances that are present at the site of Z3al production are considered and shine new light on potential regulatory mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a71b1a4cb0b72b5bb2bc5b8f44efc791fd755294e3df60b73480e8ce798b693f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
