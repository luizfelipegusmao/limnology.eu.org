{"title":"Lifetime of Long-Lived Sunspot Groups","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0839/v1","date":1718187677000,"content":"Recurrent sunspot groups were studied by using the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) which covers more than 40 years. For this task it is necessary to make unambiguous the identification of the returning solar active regions. It starts with an algorithmic listing of possible returns, then the candidates of the algorithmic identifications are checked by the unique HTML-feature of the DPD. The final check is the application of an asymmetric Gaussian function introduced in previous articles to describe the development of short-lived sunspot groups observed continuously from start to end on the visible solar disc. The data of correctly identified recurrent sunspot groups fit surprisingly well to this function throughout the rotations enabling the reconstruction of the development also on the far side of the sun. The primary goal was to find any relationship between the maximum area and the lifetime deduced from the data of the asymmetric curves. This relationship is more complex than earlier results in the literature for short-lived groups. The lifetimes exhibit weak dependencies on the heliographic latitude and solar cycle phase. An apparently returning active area is rather an active nest if its data do not fit to the asymmetric Gaussian.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11cffd5ed23ad988aac6ded6ffad2ee6d5e56b0eef20cf8919569bce50436c65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
