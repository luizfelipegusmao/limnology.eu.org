{"title":"Events Sequence Beyond mRNA Spike (S) Protein Vaccine and Long COVID: Simply Targeting Brain?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0616/v1","date":1710158362000,"content":"The intricate mechanisms of the immune response elicited by vaccines and the interplay between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly understood. This review explores these mechanisms, emphasizing the interplay between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). A critical aspect is the examination of how vaccine-induced immune responses can interact with the CNS, influencing neuroinflammation and neuroimmune interactions. Furthermore, the link between vaccination and persistent symptoms observed in long-COVID patients is discussed. Vaccination initiates a complex cascade of events, starting with the production of specific proteins, such as S1/S2 spike proteins, leading to robust immune activation in the axillary lymph nodes. The role of macrophages and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in cytokine production, antigen presentation, and the stimulation of B and T cells highlights the sophistication of the adaptive immune response. The migration of immune cell-derived exosomes to the brain plays a dynamic role in CNS inflammation, neurodegenerative processes and long COVID. On the other hand, the prolonged presence of viral and vaccine-derived spike proteins may contribute to the complex pathophysiology of Long-COVID, shedding light on the delicate balance between beneficial immune responses and possible adverse neurological outcomes of vaccination. It is worth rigorous monitoring and further research to understand the mechanisms of neuroinflammation and the persistence of spike proteins and their long-term effects on the brain, emphasising the importance of a nuanced approach to vaccine safety and efficacy in the context of COVID-19 and beyond.Principio del formulario","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8fc3420105cb851ee743232922a2368678e0af94d77a9ad05e615ea9e2ccd6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
