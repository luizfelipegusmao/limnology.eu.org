{"title":"Reintroduction of Legacy Antibiotics in Neonatal Sepsis. The Special Role of Fosfomycin and Colistin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.1717/v2","date":1710392458000,"content":"Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, particularly in low and middle-income countries. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a rapidly growing global problem. A significant proportion of the pathogens that commonly cause neonatal sepsis are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Therefore, for the empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis, the repurposing of older antibiotics that are effective against multidrug-resistant pathogens is being investigated. This review aims to provide an overview of current research and experience using the repurposed antibiotics, Colistin and Fosfomycin, for the empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis. Based on current knowledge, Colistin and Fosfomycin may be potentially helpful for the empirical treatment of sepsis in neonates due to their efficacy against a wide range of pathogens and acceptable safety profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52fbf6a659fa21beb797385b780902e18ee11764310e7531246333b66ee89bcb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
