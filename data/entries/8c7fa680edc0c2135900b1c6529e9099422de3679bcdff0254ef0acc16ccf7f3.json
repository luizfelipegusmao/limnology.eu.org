{"title":"An Inquiry into the Application of Biophilic Design Principles in Contemporary University Designs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0050/v2","date":1722235281000,"content":"Human beings are positively or negatively affected by their environment. This effect has been a topic of interest for environmental psychologists, who have strived over years to understand the environmental attributes, which would be favourable to people in physical, mental, and psychological terms. The present study focusses on biophilic design, one of the popular theories in the architectural literature aimed to create high quality and liveable environments. The positive effects of biophilic design have been investigated from different perspectives and thus it has become a well-accepted approach in the relevant architectural literature. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate to what extent biophilic design principles were put into practice. In the context thereof, contemporary university structures were analysed within the framework of biophilic design principles. The results were suggestive of the fact that although biophilic elements were encountered in the design of these structures, they were not meant to be biophilic, nevertheless, there was an approach based on human-nature interaction. Accordingly, the principles of biophilic design were equivalent to the required parameters of a good design and that architects considered nature as an important design input.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c7fa680edc0c2135900b1c6529e9099422de3679bcdff0254ef0acc16ccf7f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
