Thus, development of efficient, environmentally friendly, catalyst materials is a central area of technological development and research. Optimization of these materials requires meticulous characterization of the underlying nanoscale processes and mechanisms which control the catalystsâ€™ selectivity, activity, and stability. High-resolution characterization of the atomic structure is typically carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), however, conventional, static TEM imaging lacks the temporal, dynamic information necessary to accurately interpret active-state catalyst behavior [<a href=\"#ozae044.829-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f2b04985b13ecf01e73756fd8cc9246fa86e6cd00f82e0840d12cd336fbcf10c","category":"Environment"}
