{"title":"Effect of a stranded hole type on the performance of corn stover composite pipe","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301590","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Jie Yang, Yang Guan, Dongdong Gu, Yuzhong Zhang, Zheng Zhang, Jinfa Shi</p>\r\n\r\nTo promote the comprehensive utilization of corn stover and the development of field water-saving irrigation technology, a method of returning corn stover to the field was prosed; in this method, the crop stalks were crushed, mixed with soil in different proportions of adulteration, and then extruded to form hollow round tubes. To compare the influence of the winch blade with or without a diameter change on the composite pipe molding performance, two composite pipe molding devices were theoretically designed, simulated, and analyzed using discrete element simulation software, and a composite pipe molding bench test was performed. The simulation test revealed that the composite pipe molding rate of the winch blade without the reducer molding device was 3.45 kg/s, the output power of the winch shaft was 20.7 kW, the composite pipe molding rate of the winch blade with the reducer molding device was 1.20 kg/s, and the output power of the winch shaft was 18.75 kW. By calculating the weighted average of two indices, the composite pipe forming rate and the winch shaft output power, the comprehensive performance index of the composite pipe forming device without a reducer was greater than that of the device with a reducer. The composite pipe forming bench test revealed two kinds of molding devices with an extrusion molding with an outer diameter of 100 mm and an inner diameter of 30 mm. The composite pipe density test average was greater than 1.30 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and met the requirements of composite pipe molding; the winch blade without a reducer molding device had an average composite pipe molding rate of 3.23 kg/s, and the winch blade with an average reducer molding rate of 2.07 kg/s. The forming rate of the composite pipe without a reducer was faster. Therefore, a winch blade without a reducer composite pipe molding device is more conducive to improving the composite pipe molding performance.","author":"Jie Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8e268269919ebfa9e7ad1df4ef35aeff1de40cd2f95690d6bbd5d53c5be12dc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
