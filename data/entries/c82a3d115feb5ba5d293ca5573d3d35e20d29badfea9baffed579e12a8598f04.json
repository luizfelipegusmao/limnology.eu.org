{"title":"Trends in the Learning Sciences From 2005 to 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1656/v1","date":1714029276000,"content":"This research paper presents our investigation of the evolving trends in the field of Learning Sciences (LS) from 2005 to 2021. LS is a multidisciplinary field that integrates various scientific disciplines to study and support learning in real-world contexts (Hoadley, 2018). Our paper aims to understand how LS practices, methods, and disciplines of interest have changed over time, considering factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and the call for more equity-based research. We collected data from the International Society of Learning Sciences (ISLS) repository, which serves as one major platform that showcases LS research. We analysed the proceedings of the ISLS annual meetings and conferences, focusing on variables such as title, abstract, issue date, publisher, and collection using web scraping tools and the RStudio software for data collection and analysis. Our findings indicate several trends in LS research. In terms of methods and practices, design-based research (DBR) and participatory methods were commonly used in LS studies. However, there was a decline in the adoption of DBR in 2021, possibly due to the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Project-based learning, embodied interaction, and game-based learning were the most frequently used techniques among LS researchers. When examining the population of interest and domain focus in LS research. Learners were the primary focus, with a significant increase in the number of studies focusing on students over the years. However, there was also a noticeable increase in studies focusing on teachers in more recent years. In terms of subject disciplines, science and mathematics were the primary areas of focus, but there has been increasing attention to the arts and technology in recent years. Concerning equity-based research in LS, the finding revealed a significant increase in this area from 2005 to 2021, with ICLS studies tending to focus more on equity compared to CSCL studies. These findings contribute to understanding the current status and future development of the learning sciences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c82a3d115feb5ba5d293ca5573d3d35e20d29badfea9baffed579e12a8598f04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
