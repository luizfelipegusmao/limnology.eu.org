{"title":"Catechin promotes the germination of Pistacia chinensis seeds via GA biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/2/233/7659625?rss=1","date":1714348800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Chinese pistachio (<span>Pistacia chinensis</span>), an important horticultural plant species, holds great ornamental value with beautiful leaves and fruits. Seedling propagation of this tree species is restricted by its erratic seed germination; however, the germination mechanism is ambiguous. The aim of this study was to determine the germination mechanism from a novel perspective based on the multi-omics data.<div>Methods</div>The multi-omics technique combined with hormone content measurement was applied to seed germination of Chinese pistachio.<div>Key Results</div>Due to its great accumulation during seed germination, catechin stood out from the identified metabolites in a broadly targeted metabolomic analysis. Exogenous catechin at 10 mg L<sup>−1</sup> significantly improved the germination of Chinese pistachio seeds. An interesting result of hormone analysis was that the improving effect of catechin could be attributed to an increase in gibberellic acid 3 (GA<sub>3</sub>) content rather than a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content before germination. Treatments with paclobutrazol (PAC, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor) and PAC + catechin also showed that the promoting effect of catechin on seed germination depends on GA biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis and qRT‒PCR further revealed that catechin induced the expression of <span>PcGA20ox5</span> to activate GA biosynthesis. Several transcription factors were induced by catechin and GA treatments, such as TCP, bZIP and C3H, which may play an important regulatory role in GA biosynthesis in a catechin-mediated way.<div>Conclusions</div>Catechin promotes seed germination via GA biosynthesis in Chinese pistachios. This study proposes a novel mechanism by which catechin promotes seed germination via the GA pathway, which provides new insight into a comprehensive understanding of seed dormancy and germination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"7bac9811fc02c8b79ec5c8f00f300d9e3294fc5692f85b945dcfe8db9a61d518","category":"Environment"}
