{"title":"PSLBII-15 The impacts of phyto-chemo-immuno therapeutic agents on cure of bovine brucellosis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/655/7757741?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bovine brucellosis is a very important zoonotic disease of economic interest throughout the world. The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of phyto-chemo-immune therapeutic agents (antibiotics vs. herbal product) against bovine brucellosis in cattle. For this purpose, crossbred cows (n = 20) were divided into 4 groups (i.e., A, B, C and D; n = 5 in each group). The animals in group A, B and C included brucella positive cows, while group D had control negative (healthy) animals. Cows of group A were treated with antibiotics (oxytetracyclin and streptomycin), fluxin meglumin, vitamin E and selenium, and immunized with brucella RB-51 (Bivishot) and FMD oil-based vaccine; group B cows were treated with a herbal product Safi, instead of antiobiotics; group C cows were only treated with flunixin meglumin and vitamin E and selenium, and immunized with RB-51 and FMD vaccines, while cows in group D were only immunized with RB-51 and FMD vaccines. All cows were evaluated for brucella antibodies through ELISA on d 0, 30, 90 and 180 post-treatments, and for antigens through real time PCR on d 180 post-treatment. Moreover, the treated cows were also observed for retention of fetal membranes and birth weight of calves. According to the results, titers of antibodies (OD values) against brucella abortus on d 180 post-treatment were found to be less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in groups A (0.83 ± 0.2) and D (0.60 ± 0.1) cows compared with group B (1.09 ± 0.2) and C (1.15 ± 0.2) cows. Moreover, no difference (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) was found between OD values of group A and D cows. The Ct values, determined through Real time PCR, were greater in group A (37.2 ± 0.9) and D (&gt; 40) cows compared with B (35.0 ± 2.5) and C (32.5 ± 1.2) cows. Furthermore, birth weight of calves was greater in A and D cows compared with B and C cows. Placenta dropping time was shorter in A and D animals compared with group B and C cows. In conclusion, combination of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents and immune boosters (Group-A) may be used as a therapeutic approach to overcome bovine Brucellosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b203be7d13c003f5ddad6103f7c83fad09a0c05d6843eddb6abd7cb859d3b687","category":"Environment"}
