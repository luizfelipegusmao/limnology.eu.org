{"title":"Non-isocyanate Synthesis of Aliphatic Polyurethane by BiCl3-Catalyzed Transurethanization Polycondensation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0086/v1","date":1712018229000,"content":"Non-isocyanate polyurethane synthesis by non-Sn catalysis is an essential challenge toward green polyurethane synthesis. Bismuth compounds are attractive candidates due to their low cost, low toxicity, and availability to urethane chemistry. We applied various Bi catalysts to the self-polycondensation of a bishydroxyurethane monomer and found BiCl3 to be an excellent catalyst through optimization. The catalytic activity and price of BiCl3 are comparable to those of Bu2SnO, while its toxicity is significantly low. BiCl3 is, therefore, a promising alternative to Sn-based catalysts in non-isocyanate polyurethane synthesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"716d7b193f98d3d449ddc722230d55596eaa4ccbe4a5ffa4da370e70eb0e8f80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
