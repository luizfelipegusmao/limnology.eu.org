{"title":"A New Tool for Extracting Static and Dynamic Parameters from [18F]F-DOPA PET/CT in Pediatric Gliomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0299/v1","date":1725466283000,"content":"PET imaging with [18F]F-DOPA has demonstrated high potential for the evaluation and management of pediatric brain gliomas. Manual extraction of PET parameters is time-consuming, lacks reproducibility, and varies with operator experience. In this study, we tested whether a semi-automated image processing framework could overcome these limitations. Pediatric patients with available static and/or dynamic [18F]F-DOPA PET studies were evaluated retrospectively. We developed a Python software to automate clinical index calculations, including preprocessing to delineate tumor volumes from structural MRI, accounting for lesions with low [18F]F-DOPA uptake. 73 subjects with treatment-na√Øve low and high-grade gliomas, who underwent brain MRI within two weeks of [18vF]F-DOPA PET, were included and analyzed. Static analysis was conducted on all subjects, while dynamic analysis was performed on 32 patients. For 68 subjects, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for T/S between manual and ground truth segmentation was 0.91. Using our tool, ICC improved to 0.94. Our method demonstrated good reproducibility in extracting static tumor-to-striatum ratio (p = 0.357), though significant differences were observed in tumor slope (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found in time-to-peak (p = 0.167) and striatum slope (p = 0.36). Our framework aids in analyzing [18F]F-DOPA PET images of pediatric brain tumors by automating clinical score extraction, simplifying segmentation and Time Activity Curve extraction, reducing user variability, and enhancing reproducibility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"442ecee1d68a914166174ab9411137b0a19d5efecfc8c84818e90b60d7fd799c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
