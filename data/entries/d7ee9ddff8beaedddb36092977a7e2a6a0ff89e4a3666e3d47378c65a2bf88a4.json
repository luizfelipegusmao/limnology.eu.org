{"title":"Challenges in Teaching Practices in Science Education at the University Level","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1449/v1","date":1729235824000,"content":"This study explores the challenges faced by science educators at the university level, with a focus on teaching practices and classroom management. A total of 100 faculty members, including Associate Professors, Professors, and Heads of Departments, were surveyed to gather insights. Data was collected using a two-point rating scale, examining three core areas: the future challenges in higher education, teaching methodologies, and effective classroom management. Key findings from the study highlight several pressing concerns. Financial burdens, including high tuition costs, continue to create barriers to access for students, while systemic issues hinder equitable opportunities in higher education. The study also identified the need for ongoing professional development for faculty to keep pace with evolving teaching methodologies, particularly in science education. Additionally, the increasing integration of AI tools into academic environments has raised concerns about maintaining academic integrity. Other challenges identified include the difficulties in transitioning to online or hybrid teaching formats, especially in the context of science education, and the growing reliance on adjunct faculty, which can impact the continuity and quality of instruction. The study concludes with recommendations aimed at addressing these challenges, emphasizing the importance of institutional support and faculty training to strengthen teaching practices, enhance classroom management, and adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of higher education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7ee9ddff8beaedddb36092977a7e2a6a0ff89e4a3666e3d47378c65a2bf88a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
