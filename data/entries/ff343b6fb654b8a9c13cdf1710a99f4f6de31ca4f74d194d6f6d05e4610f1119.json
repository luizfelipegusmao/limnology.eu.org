{"title":"Studying Nanomaterial Transformations in the Movie-Mode Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscope at INRS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.725/7719636?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The dynamic transmission electron microscope (DTEM) belongs to the class of high-speed pulsed beam electron microscopes that have been developed to study phase transformations materials at the nanoscale [<a href=\"#ozae044.725-B1\">1</a>]. The DTEM stands out from other instruments in its capability to capture nanosecond single-shot images, which has allowed for studies of irreversible transformations like rapid crystallization [<a href=\"#ozae044.725-B2\">2-4</a>], transitent structural ordering [<a href=\"#ozae044.725-B5\">5</a>] and photoreduction. [<a href=\"#ozae044.725-B6\">6</a>] Furthermore, the movie-mode DTEM (MM-DTEM) has been developed to capture a series of images at megahertz framerates for insights into the kinetics of such stochastic events [<a href=\"#ozae044.725-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.725-B8\">8</a>]. The MM-DTEM at INRS is based on a JEOL<sup>®</sup> 2100Plus electron microscope that was modified to couple in the fourth harmonic of a Nd:YAG IDES<sup>®</sup> cathode laser ( λ = 266nm ) to generate high-charge electron pulses via photoemission. This design is different than other DTEMs, which oftern use the fifth harmonic. Furthermore, this instrument consists of a Northurp Grumann Nd:YAG nanosecond pump laser and a Gatan Image Filter (GIF) system, enabling the full characterization of laser induced transformations by combining nanosecond time-resolved imaging, diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements. This work will give a survey of the operational performance of this novel instrument including trends in photoemission yield, electron energy distribution and imaging resolution as a function of cathode laser pulse energy. Furthermore, a demonstration of the movie-mode capabilities studying laser sintering of nanoparticles is planned. Finally, future experimental studies of nanomaterial transformations in different environments, such as temperature or applied electric field, by coupling this system with available in situ sample holders will be discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ff343b6fb654b8a9c13cdf1710a99f4f6de31ca4f74d194d6f6d05e4610f1119","category":"Environment"}
