{"title":"Two auxins are better than one: BiAux joins forces with auxin to enhance lateral root formation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1114/7623100?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span>The iterative formation of lateral roots (LRs) during plant life span allows the exploration of new sources of nutrients and water. Auxin plays a key role in all major stages of LR formation. Auxin signal is required for priming pericycle cells into LR founder cells (FC), LR primordium initiation, morphogenesis, and emergence (<a href=\"#kiae132-B1\">Du and Scheres 2018</a>). In <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, LRs are set along the primary root by a mechanism known as “root clock,” where a periodic gene expression in phase and antiphase with an auxin signal peak oscillates in a position close to the primary root tip, named the oscillation zone (OZ). This oscillatory behavior results in the establishment of a pre-branch site, a position where pericycle cells with a memorized priming signal initiate an LR primordium later on (<a href=\"#kiae132-B6\">Reyes-Hernández and Maizel 2023</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a56184d069c6cd093758c50422e6150d30288fc8630b88c83639fea7713fb699","category":"Environment"}
