{"title":"Inhibition of A&beta; Aggregation by Cholesterol-End-Modified PEGs Vesicle and Micelle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0979/v1","date":1728789415000,"content":"We evaluated the inhibitory effects of our developed Chol-PEG2000 micelles and Chol-PEG500 vesicles on amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease. ThT assay proved that Chol-PEG2000 delayed Aβ fibril elongation by 17 hours and Chol-PEG500 by 40 hours at 10-times molar ratio against Aβ40 peptide. At 50-times molar ratio, both Chol-PEG2000 and Chol-PEG500 significantly inhibited Aβ aggregation, as shown by minimal fluorescence intensity increase over 48 hours.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5d31012a734c45a15de595491dae1519faae32388129ee1788df9290eae13d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
