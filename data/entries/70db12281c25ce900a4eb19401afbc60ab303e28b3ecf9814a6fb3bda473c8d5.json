To meet with these demands, Terauchi et al. developed a soft X-ray emission spectrometer (SXES) equipped with varied-line-spacing diffraction grating and they demonstrated high energy resolution with SXES combined with a transmission electron microscope [<a href=\"#ozae044.102-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.102-B2\">2</a>]. Based on their work, JEOL Ltd. have commercialized a soft X-ray emission spectrometer (SXES) which can be installed in general-purpose SEM/EPMA in 2013 [<a href=\"#ozae044.102-B3\">3</a>]. This instrument has been contributed to the popularization of chemical state analysis of various bulk samples including practical samples containing Li utilized in the second batteries [<a href=\"#ozae044.102-B4\">4</a>]. However, the limitation of energy range of the current SXES (JEOL SS-94000SXES) with the JS50XL grating [<a href=\"#ozae044.102-B5\">5</a>] prevented the observation of spectra in lower energy than 50 eV and it regarded as a bottleneck to chemical state analysis of lithium compounds, especially for lithium oxides for their larger chemical shift.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"70db12281c25ce900a4eb19401afbc60ab303e28b3ecf9814a6fb3bda473c8d5","category":"Environment"}
