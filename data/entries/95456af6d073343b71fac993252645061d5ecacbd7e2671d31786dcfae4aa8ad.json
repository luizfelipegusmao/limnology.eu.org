{"title":"Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3) and Suicide: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1378/v1","date":1724077670000,"content":"IntroductionGlycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) has been associated with a lot of diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and diabetes. Its role in depression is connected to stress and neuroinflammation. Lithium is an essential inhibitor of GSK-3. Some studies have suggested that the use of this psychiatric medication may lower suicide rates. Here, we outline the current understanding and discoveries regarding the link between GSK-3 and suicide. MethodWe used the PRISMA statement and defined the PECOS strategy, such as Population (P) = individuals; exposure (E) = GSK-3 alteration function; comparison (C) = without GSK-3 alteration function; outcome (O) = suicide; and study design(S) = all kinds of studies with an association between GSK-3 and suicide.ResultsTwelve studies were included in this review. GSK-3 appears to be related to suicidal behavior by activating inflammatory pathways, activating genes, altering neurotransmission, and increasing impulsivity. Clinical studies do not present robust results that allow defining an epidemiological profile of greater risk for suicidal behavior in association with changes in the functioning of GSK-3.ConclusionThe interference of GSK-3 functioning in suicidal behavior seems inevitable, with solid evidence from laboratory animal studies. However, there is a need for further clinical studies on this crucial topic to answer better some questions about the association between GSK-3 and suicide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95456af6d073343b71fac993252645061d5ecacbd7e2671d31786dcfae4aa8ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
