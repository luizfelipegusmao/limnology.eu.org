{"title":"Geochemistry and geochronology of the Ordovician Qianhe metabasalt in Northwest China: implications for the northern boundary of Qinling Orogenic Belt in heavily loess-covered regions","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12303-024-0017-1","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The scientific question of precisely determining the northern boundary of the Qinling Orogenic Belt (QOB) with regard to the southern segment of the North China Craton (S-NCC) has been controversial and unresolved, as it is heavily covered by loess and lacks some geological evidence. In order to identify the concrete northern boundary of the QOB, this paper first reports the metabasalt discovered in the Qianhe River Basin in Northwestern China, on the foundation of petrography, mineralogy, geochronology and geochemistry analyses. Detailed regional geological survey presents that the Qianhe metabasalt (QMB) is in unconformable contact with the Mesoproterozoic Gaoshanhe Group. Moreover, there is the new laser ablation (LA) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) U-Pb dating for magmatic zircons that yielded a weighted mean age of 450 ± 9 Ma, revealing that the QMB occurred in the Late Ordovician rather than that in the Mesoproterozoic period as previously considered. Both major and trace elements show that the samples are characterized by the back-arc basin (BAB) basalt affinity. In addition, combined with the regional geology analysis, it stands to reason that the QMB is very similar to those of Ordovician Caotangou Group along the northern QOB (N-QOB). Accordingly, it is illuminated that the QMB belonging to the N-QOB, is more likely originated from the back-arc basin setting, and truly defines the QOB’s northern boundary in this segment, which has prominent geoscientific significance for determining the tectonic boundary in the heavily loess-covered regions.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"56e659fb3f13929ca3b91f3296f54a5cac5747447267b957571cf67077b2d7db","category":"Environment"}
