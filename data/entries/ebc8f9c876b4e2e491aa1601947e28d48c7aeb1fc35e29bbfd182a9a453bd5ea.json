{"title":"Advances in the Neural Network Quantization: A Comprehen-sive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0076/v1","date":1719838980000,"content":"Artificial intelligence technologies based on deep convolutional neural networks and large lan-guage models have made significant breakthroughs in many tasks such as image recognition, target detection, semantic segmentation and natural language processing, but also face the problem of contradiction between the high computational capacity of the algorithms and the limited deployment resources. Quantization, which converts floating-point neural networks into low-bit-width integer networks, is an important and essential technique for efficient deploy-ment and cost reduction in edge computing. This paper analyze various existing quantization methods, showcase the deployment accuracy of advanced techniques, and discuss the future challenges and trends in this domain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ebc8f9c876b4e2e491aa1601947e28d48c7aeb1fc35e29bbfd182a9a453bd5ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
