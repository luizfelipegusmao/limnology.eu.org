First, we show the interactions between different battery components during the first few charge and discharge cycles of a battery, the so-called formation cycles. How these cycles are performed has a huge impact on the lifetime, capacity and overall quality of Li-ion batteries. During these cycles the solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI), a thin layer on the surface of the electrode material, is formed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ee02cb9c29274668f7e7ae3b43d75e301ff6d5312877bf090867d9747580afcc","category":"Environment"}
