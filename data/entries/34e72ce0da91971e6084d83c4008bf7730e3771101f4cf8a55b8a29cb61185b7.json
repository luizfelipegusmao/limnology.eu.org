{"title":"A Novel Regional‚ÄêMinima Image Segmentation Method for Fluid Transport Simulations in Unresolved Rock Images","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036855?af=R","date":1719059414000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Unresolved digital rock images are often used to avoid high computational costs and limited field of views associated with processing fine-resolution rock images. However, segmentation of unresolved images using classical methods is suboptimal due to the presence of the partial-volume effect. Suboptimal segmentations can significantly influence the geometry and effective properties of the reconstructed models. This study reveals that partial-volume pixels with high pore fractions remain as regional minima in intensity levels in unresolved images. By identifying these regional-minima pixels, we can effectively extract pore space obscured by the partial-volume effect. Based on this observation, we propose a novel segmentation method capable of identifying these regional-minima partial-volume pixels and converting them to pure pore pixels, thereby binarizing the digital rock images. The method is validated on sandstone and carbonate rock samples. Our method demonstrates a notable improvement in modeled permeability accuracy, surpassing 50% compared to the thresholding method and over 30% compared to the watershed method. Moreover, models segmented by this approach exhibit smaller pore and throat sizes compared to the substantially overestimated results obtained by classical methods. These findings suggest that the regional-minima segmentation method effectively corrects for the partial-volume effect and preserves more detailed pore structures. Consequently, it enhances the quality of binarized rock geometries, leading to improved accuracy in fluid-flow simulations.</p>","author":"Rui Li, \nYi Yang, \nYuxuan Zhang, \nWenbo Zhan, \nJianhui Yang, \nYingfang Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"34e72ce0da91971e6084d83c4008bf7730e3771101f4cf8a55b8a29cb61185b7","category":"Environment"}
