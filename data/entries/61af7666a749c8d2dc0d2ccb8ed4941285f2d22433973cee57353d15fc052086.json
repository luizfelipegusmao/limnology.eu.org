{"title":"Reconciling Environmental Safety and Economic Feasibility: A Review of Soil Fluorine Management Strategies in the Republic of Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1403/v1","date":1718865159000,"content":"Fluorine naturally occurs in soil and rocks; however, concerns arise when human activities or specific compounds increase its levels or bioavailability. South Korea faces challenges in managing soil fluorine contamination even though existing regulations based on total fluorine content are stricter than those in many developed countries. However, these regulations can be economically impractical because of Korea's naturally high background levels of fluorine in the soil. This study examined the international landscape of soil fluorine management and explored potential solutions that balance environmental protection with economic considerations. We propose a shift towards regulating specific and harmful fluorine compounds and prioritizing remediation based on bioavailability assessments. This approach can guide Korea towards a more effective and sustainable strategy for managing soil fluorine contamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61af7666a749c8d2dc0d2ccb8ed4941285f2d22433973cee57353d15fc052086","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
