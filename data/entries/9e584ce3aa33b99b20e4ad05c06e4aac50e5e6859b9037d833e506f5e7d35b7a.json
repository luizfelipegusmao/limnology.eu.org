A detailed characterization of a sampleâ€™s structural and electronic properties across phase transitions necessitates a sample holder with double tilt capability and a continuous temperature control of the specimen while maintaining a sample stability that enables atomic resolution imaging. Temperature control is achieved using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based heating and biasing chips [<a href=\"#ozae044.687-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.687-B5\">5</a>] in combination with a dedicated cryo TEM sample holder.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9e584ce3aa33b99b20e4ad05c06e4aac50e5e6859b9037d833e506f5e7d35b7a","category":"Environment"}
