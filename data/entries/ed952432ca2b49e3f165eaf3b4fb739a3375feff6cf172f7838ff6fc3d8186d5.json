These small components consist of varied materials stacked together with different mechanical properties and ablation behavior leading to difficult sample preparation for example for failure analysis. To qualify these components a large cross section is needed to reveal all the structural features in combination with a sufficient quality of the cross section for further analysis. Preparation of large cross sections can be done quickly making use of laser ablation but remains challenging because of the layered structure of the components.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ed952432ca2b49e3f165eaf3b4fb739a3375feff6cf172f7838ff6fc3d8186d5","category":"Environment"}
