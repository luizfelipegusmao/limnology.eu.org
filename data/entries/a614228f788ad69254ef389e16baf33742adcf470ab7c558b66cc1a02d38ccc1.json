{"title":"Determinants of stillbirth among women who delivered in hospitals of North Wollo Zone, Northeast Ethiopia: A case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301602","date":1712844000000,"content":"<p>by Atnaf Alem Abriham, Eyob Shitie, Sisay Melese, Anteneh Mengist Dessie, Asmamaw Demis Bizuneh</p>\r\nBackground <p>Stillbirth is a silent tragedy that shatters the lives of women, families, and nations. Though affecting over 2 million infants globally in 2019, it remains overlooked, with no specific targets dedicated to its reduction in the sustainable development goals. Insufficient knowledge regarding the primary risk factors contributing to stillbirths hinders efforts to reduce its occurrence. Driven by this urgency, this study focused on identifying the determinants of stillbirth among women giving birth in hospitals across North Wollo Zone, Northeast Ethiopia.</p> Methodology <p>This study employed an institution-based unmatched case-control design, involving a randomly selected sample of 412 women (103 cases and 309 controls) who gave birth in hospitals of North Wollo Zone. Data were collected using a structured data extraction checklist. Data entry was conducted using Epi-data version 3.1, and analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.0. Employing a multivariable logistic regression model, we identified independent predictors of stillbirth. The level of statistical significance was declared at a p-value &lt; 0.05.</p> Results <p>Our analysis revealed several critical factors associated with an increased risk of stillbirth. Women who experienced premature rupture of membranes (AOR = 5.53, 95% CI: 2.33–9.94), induced labor (AOR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.24–4.07), prolonged labor exceeding 24 hours (AOR = 3.80, 95% CI: 1.94–7.45), absence of partograph monitoring during labor (AOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.41–4.26) were all significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirth. Preterm birth (AOR = 3.46, 95% CI: 1.87–6.39), post-term birth (AOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.35–8.91), and carrying a female fetus (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.02–3.22) were at a higher risk of stillbirth.</p> Conclusion <p>These findings highlight the importance of early intervention and close monitoring for women experiencing premature rupture of membranes, prolonged labor, or induced labor. Additionally, consistent partograph use and enhanced prenatal care for pregnancies at risk of preterm or post-term birth could potentially contribute to reducing stillbirth rates and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the observed association between fetal sex and stillbirth risk.</p>","author":"Atnaf Alem Abriham","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a614228f788ad69254ef389e16baf33742adcf470ab7c558b66cc1a02d38ccc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
