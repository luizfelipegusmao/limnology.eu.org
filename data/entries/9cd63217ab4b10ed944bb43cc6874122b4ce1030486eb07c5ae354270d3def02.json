Secondary outcome measures were number of B-Lines, thickness of the pleural line and subjective image quality. Furthermore, correlation between NPLUS results and clinical data was assessed.</p> Results <p>A total of 1584 video loops from 66 patients, with a mean corrected gestational age of 33.8 weeks (SD 4.23) and weight of 1950g (SD 910), respectively, were analyzed. NPLUS score was estimated lower with the echo- and microconvex probe compared to the linear probe, with a coefficient of -2.95 (p &lt; 0.001) and -1.09 (p = 0.19), respectively. Correlation between the pulse oximetric saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio and NPLUS score was moderately strong and best using the microconvex probe (Spearman’s rho = -0.63, p&lt;0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Our results not only confirm the current recommendations, but also demonstrate the extent of the varying results when different probes are used. The differences we discovered call for caution in interpreting scores, especially in the context of guiding therapies and communicating prognoses. Finally, the correlation between NPLUS score and clinical parameters contributes to validating the use of this diagnostic tool.</p>","author":"Lukas Aichhorn","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9cd63217ab4b10ed944bb43cc6874122b4ce1030486eb07c5ae354270d3def02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
