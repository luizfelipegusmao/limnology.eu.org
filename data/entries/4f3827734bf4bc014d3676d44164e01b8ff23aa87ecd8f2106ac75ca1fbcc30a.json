Cavity-nesting birds prospecting for nest sites are often forced to investigate unfamiliar, dark holes that may be dangerous to enter because they may conceal an aggressive nesting bird or a predator. The Fear of Feathers Hypothesis posits that some birds such as blue tits <i>Cyanistes caeruleus</i>, add large, conspicuous feathers on top of their own nest to exploit the fear of potential nest usurpers or brood parasites. Feathers may trigger fear in prospecting birds either because the feathers obstruct the view of the cavity interior, and/or because the feathers may be perceived as recent prey remains and suggest the predator will return. Here I studied the prospecting behaviour of unmated male pied flycatchers <i>Ficedula hypoleuca</i> by letting them choose between a dyad of nest boxes where one contained a nest of a great tit <i>Parus major</i> and one a nest of a blue tit. The objective was to test whether the presence of feathers would have a stronger repelling effect than the species that had built the nest. Great tits are larger than blue tits and may represent a greater threat to intruding flycatchers. However, blue tits but not great tits, often decorate their nest with large, conspicuous feathers. Consistent with the Fear of Feathers Hypothesis, flycatchers hesitated longer to enter blue tit than great tit nests but only if the blue tit nest contained feathers. The study has relevance to many species of birds that decorate their nest with feathers. It shows that a landscape may include aspects of fear that are important to animal behaviour although they may seem subtle and are easily overlooked.</p>","author":"Tore Slagsvold","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"4f3827734bf4bc014d3676d44164e01b8ff23aa87ecd8f2106ac75ca1fbcc30a","category":"Environment"}
