{"title":"Oral Administration of Berberine Hydrochloride Based on Chitosan/Carboxymethyl-&beta;-Cyclodextrin Hydrogel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1733/v1","date":1721662615000,"content":"In this study, a novel oral formulation of berberine hydrochloride (BBH) hydrogel was successfully synthesized through physical cross-linking using chitosan (CS) and carboxymethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (CMCD). The characterization results confirmed the successful synthesis of CS/CMCD hydrogel and the subsequent loading of BBH into this composite (CS/CMCD/BBH) was effectively accomplished. BBH was used as a model drug and the resulting hydrogel demonstrated a sustained drug release profile. In addition to its improved solubility and sustained release characteristics, the hydrogel exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against common pathogens such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Candida albicans (C. albicans). Additionally, in vitro studies indicated that the hydrogel was not cytotoxic to NIH3T3 and HaCaT cells, suggesting its safety for biomedical applications. This lack of cytotoxic effects, combined with the mechanical strength, solubility improvements, and antibacterial properties of the hydrogel, positions the CS/CMCD/BBH hydrogel as a promising candidate for effective oral delivery of BBH. By addressing the solubility and delivery challenges of BBH, this hydrogel offers a viable solution for the oral administration of berberine hydrochloride, with potential applications in various biomedical fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"005fdef685553eb0c1540e19ebba66228a442b836046ddf65bac04a26556dab7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
