{"title":"Downstream passage performance of silver eel at an angled rack: effects of behavior and morphology","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05530-5","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The European eel is critically endangered due to heavy impact of anthropogenic factors, such as habitat fragmentation, overexploitation and climate change. During downstream migration, silver eels may encounter hydropower plants, which often result in delay or mortality from impingement on trash-racks or turbine passage. These problems can be mitigated with downstream passage solutions, such as angled racks that guide downstream-migrating eels to safe passage routes. The importance of bar spacing and phenotypic diversity for passage performance is, however, largely unknown. In this study, we investigated how morphological parameters (body mass, eye and fin indices) and behavioral score (open field test) influenced passage rate at an experimental intake equipped with a bypass and angled racks with either 15 or 30Â mm bar spacing. Both racks were efficient in guiding eels into a bypass. There was a strong positive effect of body mass and a weak positive effect of open field test score on passage rate. Other factors such as eye and fin indices played a minor role. These results demonstrate the performance of angled racks with bypasses and form a useful starting point for further research regarding the relationships between individual variation in behavior, morphology and passage solutions for silver eels.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"a78e9d6339217ab07d4ca4d3e324f42d226f59acf7e42cad1cbeb12e981e7efc","category":"Environment"}
