{"title":"Multilayer Networks and Public Digital Health Scalability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1819/v1","date":1719383887000,"content":"Interoperable multilayer networks are pivotal and transformative in public digital health. They not only enhance the delivery of healthcare services but also contribute significantly to improving public health outcomes. Through better accessibility, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making, these networks are revolutionizing how we approach public health. The seamless data exchange and integration they facilitate across different healthcare systems and providers can lead to substantial cost savings for public healthcare systems. These networks pave the way for a more efficient and effective healthcare system by reducing redundancies, optimizing resource allocation, and minimizing unnecessary procedures. This study combines the pressing issues of public digital health with the innovative interpretation of multilayer network theory, proposing practical solutions that inspire academics and practitioners alike.Public digital health is not just about improving care access and patient engagement. It is also about ensuring the financial sustainability of our healthcare systems. Innovative multilayer network analysis is critical in this game, improving interoperability and reducing spatial and temporal constraints. These networks streamline processes and improve efficiency by easing complex interactions within healthcare systems. This process, in turn, allows healthcare providers to deliver high-quality care at a lower cost, transforming, whenever possible, in-patients and out-patients into home-patients. Networks are a cornerstone and a beacon of hope for transforming public digital health. They are increasing the Value for Money and enhancing a patient-centric approach, making us optimistic about the future of healthcare.This study shows that revolutionizing digital healthcare methodologies has a profound impact on crucial elements like resilience, interoperability, and patient well-being within public health. The enhancement of interoperability facilitates the smooth flow of data exchange across various platforms and healthcare providers, fostering improved collaboration and decision-making processes and elevating the safety of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6aaffefd16a1bef18f2b15dd258399d55a9fc01abbc0aabec7260de015be3f7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
