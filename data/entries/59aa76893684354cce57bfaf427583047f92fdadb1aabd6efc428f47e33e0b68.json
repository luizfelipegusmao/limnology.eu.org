{"title":"Advances in Yeast Probiotic Production and Formulation for Preventative Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0039/v1","date":1727785744000,"content":"The use of probiotics has been gaining popularity in terms of inclusion into human diets over recent years. Based on properties exerted by these living organisms, several benefits have been elucidated and conferred to the host. Bacteria has been more commonly used in probiotic preparations, in comparison to yeast candidates, however, yeast exhibit several beneficial properties such as the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, production of antimicrobial agents, prevention of pathogen adherence to intestinal sites, maintain microbial balance, modulation of the immune system, resistant to some antibiotics, amongst others. This review details the use of yeast organisms as biotherapeutics and has a special focus on production considerations and their formulation into different delivery formats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59aa76893684354cce57bfaf427583047f92fdadb1aabd6efc428f47e33e0b68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
