The use of inexpensive, abundant, non-toxic, biodegradable, and reusable lignocellulosic materials might be an alternative to conventional sorbents, with obvious positive impact on sustainability and circular economy. The present study subsequently utilizes the well-established process, of converting grape molasses - a byproduct of the winemaking industry that represents a typical and abundant source of biomass – into a laser-assisted graphene-like product (LA-B). Comparative experiments were carried out with two additional materials that are similarly produced by the same laser-assisted method, yet use synthetic polyimide (PI) foil and tape polymers as precursors, namely LA-F and LA-T. The results showed that diesel oil adsorption capacity of LA-B was 33.5 g/g, while the ultra-oleophilic LA-T adsorbed 57 g/g and LA-F adsorbed 41 g/g. Furthermore, the crude oil uptake was 31.1, 56.0 and 38.6 g/g for LA-B, LA-T and LA-F respectively. The adsorption of oil on the used materials could be well-described by pseudo-second order kinetics, showing that over 80% of oil was removed from water within 15 min.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
