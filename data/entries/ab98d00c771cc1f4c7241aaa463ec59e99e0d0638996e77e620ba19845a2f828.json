{"title":"CUAD (Contact Unmodified Antisense DNA) Biotechnology: List of Pest Species Successfully Targeted by Oligonucleotide Insecticides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1465/v1","date":1711412655000,"content":"The idea of CUAD (contact unmodified antisense DNA) biotechnology and the use of oligonucleotide insecticides (briefly, olinscides, or DNA insecticides) was proposed on lepidopterans and gradually disseminated on hemipteran pests. As the next-generation platform for creation of insecticides, it has a number of unique characteristics (short unmodified antisense DNA as contact insecticide, insect rRNAs as target, DNA containment as mechanism of action) that distinguish it from existing classes of chemical insecticides. Oligonucleotide insecticides possess low carbon footprint, high safety for non-target organisms, rapid biodegradability, avoidance of target-site resistance, ensuring prosperity for agricultural countries that will implement this innovation. As the next-generation class of insecticides olinscides create opportunities that have never existed before in crop protection. Using flexible CUAD platform, any farmer, botanical garden or pest control company is capable of creating its own unique arsenal of insecticides, well-tailored for a particular population of insect pest. Most technological innovations start out very expensive and don't work well, but eventually start working well and become very cheap. CUAD biotechnology has come a long way for 16 years and is very close to the point to be implemented on a large scale against certain groups of pests. In this article we provide basic knowledge of use of oligonucleotide pesticides and list pests (mainly from suborder Sternorrhyncha, Hemiptera) which were successfully controlled by us recently.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab98d00c771cc1f4c7241aaa463ec59e99e0d0638996e77e620ba19845a2f828","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
