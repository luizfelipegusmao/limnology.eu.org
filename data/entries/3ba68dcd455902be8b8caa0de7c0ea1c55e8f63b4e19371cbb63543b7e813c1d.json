{"title":"Connecting the Riparian Phyllosphere to Water Microbial Communities in a Freshwater Stream System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0436/v1","date":1717739123000,"content":"The role that aquatic aerosols might play in inter-ecosystem exchange in freshwater riparian environments has largely been understudied. In these environments, where freshwater streams are used both as drinking water and for treated waste disposal, water features like waterfalls, downed trees, and increased streamflow can serve as bioaerosol producers. Such water features could have an important role in the bacterial colonization of surrounding surfaces, including the riparian phyllosphere. In this study, we explore the influence of a freshwater streamâ€™s bacterial community composition and micropollution on riparian maple leaves exposed to bioaerosols produced from the stream. Using culture-based and non-culture-based techniques, we compared phylloplane microbial communities in riparian zones, adjacent non-riparian forested zones, and the surface waters of the stream. In this system, riparian zone maple leaf surfaces had higher bacterial counts than non-riparian zone trees. Using metagenomic profiling of the 16S rRNA gene, we found that, while microbial communities on leaves in both riparian zone and forested sites were diverse, riparian zone bacterial communities were significantly more diverse. In addition, we found that riparian leaf bacterial communities shared more amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with stream bacterial communities than forest leaves, indicating that the riparian zone phyllosphere is likely influenced by bioaerosols produced from water surfaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ba68dcd455902be8b8caa0de7c0ea1c55e8f63b4e19371cbb63543b7e813c1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
