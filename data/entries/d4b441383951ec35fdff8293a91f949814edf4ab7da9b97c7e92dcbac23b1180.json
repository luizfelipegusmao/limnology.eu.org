{"title":"A deeply supervised adaptable neural network for diagnosis and classification of Alzheimer’s severity using multitask feature extraction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297996","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Mohsen Ahmadi, Danial Javaheri, Matin Khajavi, Kasra Danesh, Junbeom Hur</p>\r\n\r\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent form of dementia, which is a gradual condition that begins with mild memory loss and progresses to difficulties communicating and responding to the environment. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques have resulted in large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data, leading to an increased interest in using deep learning for the early diagnosis and automated classification of Alzheimer’s disease. This study uses machine learning (ML) methods to determine the severity level of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI images, where the dataset consists of four levels of severity. A hybrid of 12 feature extraction methods is used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease severity, and six traditional machine learning methods are applied, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, linear discrimination analysis, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble learning methods. During training, optimization is performed to obtain the best solution for each classifier. Additionally, a CNN model is trained using a machine learning system algorithm to identify specific patterns. The accuracy of the Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Linear discrimination classifier, Decision tree, Ensembled learning, and presented CNN architecture are 67.5%, 72.3%, 74.5%, 65.6%, 62.4%, 73.8% and, 95.3%, respectively. Based on the results, the presented CNN approach outperforms other traditional machine learning methods to find Alzheimer severity.","author":"Mohsen Ahmadi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d4b441383951ec35fdff8293a91f949814edf4ab7da9b97c7e92dcbac23b1180","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
