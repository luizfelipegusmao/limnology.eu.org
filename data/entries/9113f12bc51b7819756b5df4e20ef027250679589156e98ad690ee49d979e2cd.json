{"title":"Biomarker Profiling by Targeted Metabolomic Analysis of Plasma and Urine Samples in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients and Early Diabetic Kidney Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0043/v1","date":1719814381000,"content":"The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to rise worldwide and one of the most serious microvascular complications is diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Current bi-omarkers such as urinary albumin excretion rate have limitation for early detection of DKD. In our study we used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-ESI+-MS) techniques to quantify previously analyzed metabolites, such as tryptophan, kynurenic acid, taurine, l-acetylcarnitine, glycine, and tiglylglycine. We performed the targeted analy-sis of metabolites from urine and serum samples, collected from 110 subjects. Of these, 90 patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) were divided according to the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) into normoalbuminuria 300 mg/g groups, respectively, while 20 subjects were rep-resented by healthy controls. Through various validation methods, we identified several metabolites as potential biomarkers, such as kynurenic acid, glycine, and l-tryptophan in serum and l-acetylcarnitine, tiglylglycine, and tau-rine in urine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9113f12bc51b7819756b5df4e20ef027250679589156e98ad690ee49d979e2cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
