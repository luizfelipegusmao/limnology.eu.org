{"title":"Optimizing nutrient transporters to enhance disease resistance in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2799/7618643?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fertilizers and plant diseases contribute positively and negatively to crop production, respectively. Macro- and micronutrients provided by the soil and fertilizers are transported by various plant nutrient transporters from the soil to the roots and shoots, facilitating growth and development. However, the homeostasis of different nutrients has different effects on plant disease. This review is aimed at providing insights into the interconnected regulation between nutrient homeostasis and immune responses, and it highlights strategies to enhance disease resistance by optimal manipulation of nutrient transporters in rice. First, we highlight the essential roles of six macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, calcium, magnesium) and eight micronutrients (iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum, silicon, nickel), and summarize the diverse effects of each on rice diseases. We then systematically review the molecular mechanisms of immune responses modulated by nutrient transporters and the genetic regulatory pathways that control the specific nutrient-mediated immune signaling that is regulated by the pathogens and the host plant. Finally, we discuss putative strategies for breeding disease-resistant rice by genetic engineering of nutrient transporters.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"841f6cda1cba6fce489f4b68dc8b6b914600fc1e8bd92258f5e04c0c0e3695f9","category":"Environment"}
