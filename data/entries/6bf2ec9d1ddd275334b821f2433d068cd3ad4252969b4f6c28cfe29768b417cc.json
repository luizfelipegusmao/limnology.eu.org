{"title":"Predictive Modelling of Sea Debris around Maltese Coastal Waters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1625/v1","date":1721620351000,"content":"The accumulation of sea surface debris around the coastal waters of Malta poses significant ecological and environmental challenges, negatively affecting marine ecosystems and human activities. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of an effective system tailored to predict surface debris movement specifically for the Islands of Malta. To address this gap, a pipeline that combines a machine learning (ML) based prediction system with a physics-based model is proposed. This pipeline uses historical sea surface currents (SSC) velocities data to forecast future conditions and visualise debris movement. Central to this system are LSTM and GRU models, trained to predict SSC velocities for the next 24 hours for a specific area. These predictions are then utilised by a Lagrangian model to simulate and visualise the debris movement, providing insights into future dispersion patterns. A comparative evaluation of the models showed that the LSTM model outperformed the GRU model, with lower error metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), alongside narrower interquartile ranges (IQR). This method offers a tailored approach to addressing sea surface debris around Malta by accurately predicting SSC velocities and visualising debris movement, improving cleanup operations, and marine conservation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bf2ec9d1ddd275334b821f2433d068cd3ad4252969b4f6c28cfe29768b417cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
