{"title":"The Functional Significance of Cardiac Looping: Comparative Embryology, Anatomy, and Physiology of the Looped Design of Vertebrate Hearts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0983/v1","date":1720776395000,"content":"The anatomy of mature vertebrate hearts is marked by a looped design, which is roughly characterized by two components: (1), s-shaped (sigmoid) routing of the cardiac flow path(s), and (2,) bilaterally asymmetric (chiral) routing of the cardiac flow path(s). The looped heart design is regarded as a phylogenetically conserved feature among vertebrates and is thought to represent a significant determinant of the cardiac pumping function. It evolves during the embryonic period of development by a morphogenetic process called “cardiac looping”. During the past decades, remarkable progress has been made in the uncovering of the genetic, molecular, and biophysical factors contributing to cardiac looping. Thereby, a special focus was directed on the evolution of a bilaterally asymmetric (chiral) heart configuration, which is said to play a central role in the determination of the alignments and separations of the pulmonary and systemic flow paths in the multi-chambered hearts of tetrapods. In contrast to the recent progress made in uncovering of the biological driver of cardiac looping, our present knowledge about the functional consequences of cardiac looping is at an immature state. This article provides an overview and discussion of the currently available information about the looped design of vertebrate hearts and its functional implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c9bc66a75fad754df3ca0ca907afb92890f04bb6272b1880a151b9a169c256b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
