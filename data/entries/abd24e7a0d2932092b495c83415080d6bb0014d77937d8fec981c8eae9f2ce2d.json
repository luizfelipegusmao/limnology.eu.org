{"title":"Fractional Flow Reserve Implications for Clinical Decision Making in Coronary Artery Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2033/v1","date":1724845249000,"content":"Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is regarded as the gold standard for assessing the functional significance of coronary artery lesions, yet it remains underutilized in clinical practice. Our objective was to investigate whether FFR results have the potential to alter treatment decisions for coronary lesions compared to visual assessments of angiographic images made by three operators at a high-volume interventional center. In this retrospective study, we aimed to reassess the angiographic images of 63 patients presenting with chronic coronary syndrome (n=39, 61.9%) and acute coronary syndrome (n=24, 38.1%) who underwent FFR. Three experienced interventional cardiologists (with &gt;300 PCI procedures per year) reevaluated, blinded to FFR results, 105 ambiguous lesions in 63 patients to determine angiographic significance and treatment strategy. The observers reached a concordant agreement (≥2 operators made the same decision) to perform PCI in 60 (57.1%) of the lesions based on angiographic evaluation. Interestingly, 9 (15%) of these lesions were functionally non-significant (FFR &amp;gt;0.80). The observers agreed to defer PCI in 45 (42.9%) of the lesions; however, 4 (8.9%) of these were functionally significant (FFR ≤0.80) and required PCI. Thus, inter-observer concordance in visual-guided therapeutic decision-making is variable and not always confirmed by the functional significance of coronary lesions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abd24e7a0d2932092b495c83415080d6bb0014d77937d8fec981c8eae9f2ce2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
