Whether LicA has such effects on endometrial cancer (EMC) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the antitumor effects of LicA on EMC. Our results show that LicA significantly reduced the viability and induced apoptosis of EMC cells and EMC-7 cells from EMC patients. LicA was also found to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to increased expression of ER-related proteins (GRP78/PERK/IRE1α/CHOP) in EMC cell lines. Suppression of GRP78 expression in human EMC cells treated with LicA significantly attenuated the effects of LicA, resulting in reduced ER-stress mediated cell apoptosis and decreased expression of ER- and apoptosis-related proteins. Our findings demonstrate that LicA induces apoptosis in EMC cells through the GRP78-mediated ER-stress pathway, emphasizing the potential of LicA as an anticancer therapy for EMC.</p>","author":"Min‐Hua Wu, \nYi‐Hsien Hsieh, \nChia‐Liang Lin, \nTsung‐Ho Ying, \nShih‐Min Hsia, \nShu‐Ching Hsieh, \nChien‐Hsing Lee, \nChu‐Liang Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"129667b1df8a1051123e6dd75dc75fb344f4b3d868e388ede5d10087ad1f409f","category":"Environment"}
