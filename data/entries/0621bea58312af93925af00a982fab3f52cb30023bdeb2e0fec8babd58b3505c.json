{"title":"Single-stage Image-guided Percutaneous Ablation with Thoracoscopic Resection for Multiple Pulmonary Lesions in a Hybrid Operating Room: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1356/v1","date":1726651770000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Different approaches are required in treating patients with multiple pulmonary lesions. A multistage procedure may increase the risk of complications and patient discomfort. This study provides an initial experience with single-stage management of multiple lung lesions using percutaneous ablation with thoracoscopic resection in a hybrid operating room (HOR). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent combined ablation and resection in a HOR between May 2022 and July 2024. All patients received a single anesthesia via endotracheal tube intubation. Clinical data, operative findings, and pathological characteristics of the lung nodules were recorded. Results: A total of 23 patients were enrolled in this study. Twenty patients underwent unilateral procedures, and the other three patients underwent bilateral procedures. Ablations were performed before lung resection in 22 patients; only one patient underwent surgery first. The median global operating room time was 227.0 min. The median total radiation dose (dose area product) was 14076 Î¼Gym2. The median hospital postoperative length of stay was 2 days. Conclusion: The single-stage procedure of percutaneous ablation with thoracoscopic resection under general anesthesia in a HOR is feasible and safe. This procedure is an alternative method for managing multiple pulmonary lesions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0621bea58312af93925af00a982fab3f52cb30023bdeb2e0fec8babd58b3505c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
