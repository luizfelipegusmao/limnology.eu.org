We tested a bunch to find the best Thunderbolt 3 and 4 and USB-C docks available to owners of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thunderbolt 3, 4 or USB-C</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The connectors all look the same (technically known as a Type-C connector), but there are significant differences, particularly on speed—with USB-C maxing out at 10Gbps (usually 5Gbps) compared to the 40Gbps of Thunderbolt 3 and 4. That extra bandwidth allows not just for faster data transfer but higher frame rates to external displays, plus some other smart benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of Apple’s current laptop range, the M1 and M2 MacBook Air and 13in M1 MacBook Pro feature two Thunderbolt 3 (TB3) ports, while the 14in and 16in M1 Pro or M1 Max MacBook Pro models come with three Thunderbolt 4 (TB4 ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s older 12in MacBook features one 5Gbps Gen 1 USB-C port, while the later Intel MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (from 2016) boast either two or four 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your MacBook is equipped with Thunderbolt 4, then you really should buy a TB4 dock if you need more ports than those 14/16in laptops already possess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a Thunderbolt 4 dock is a wise decision based on future-proofing even for owners of TB3 Macs as the standard is backwards compatible with TB3 and USB-C. That said, there are still some great—and often more affordable—TB3 docks available, and most Apple users won’t see much difference between TB3 and TB4—the Thunderbolt 4 standard was mainly about getting Windows laptops up to speed, although there are technical benefits for MacBook Pro users, such as smarter daisy-chaining and faster PCI hard-drive connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have included some cheaper non-Thunderbolt USB-C docks. If you don’t require the ultimate bandwidth for the fastest data transfer and best screen frame rates or resolutions, a USB-C dock might suit your purposes and save you money. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Add external displays to your MacBook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use your laptop as your principal computer, you would do well to consider attaching at least one larger display to create a hybrid desktop/laptop setup (with a keyboard, mouse and printer all available via a single connection to your MacBook). You can turn that 13in laptop screen into an iMac-sized 27in or even larger monitor by adding an extra display—or connect two large screens to extend your screen across your whole desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to connect more than one external display to your MacBook you’ll need a Thunderbolt dock, rather than a USB-C dock. Natively over USB-C, Macs can only connect to one external display in <strong>Extended mode</strong> (where the screen extends beyond what you can see on the laptop screen, as opposed to <strong>Mirrored mode</strong> that replicates exactly what you get on the laptop screen) but you’ll get two Extended mode screens over a Thunderbolt connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple’s MacBooks featuring the company’s own M1 or M2 Silicon chip are super speedy compared to the models sporting Intel processors, early models come with an incredible limitation: they don’t support more than one external display in Extended Mode even via their Thunderbolt 3 ports. This means that when using any docking station, M1 MacBook users cannot extend their desktop over two or more displays, and will be limited to either dual Mirrored displays or one external display—although there are software workarounds and dedicated docks that allow you to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\" target=\"_blank\">add more than one external monitor to an M1 or M2 MacBook</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the superior M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pro models can support multiple displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need a docking station?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new M1 Pro/Max MacBook Pro models boast a wider range of built-in ports, so lighter users might not need a docking station at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With three TB4 and an HDMI port, a MacBook with an M1 Max could connect to up to four external displays without the need for a dock, although such a power user would likely require extra Thunderbolt ports for other devices to make up for using all the laptop ports for multiple monitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These MacBooks also have an SD card reader. Although this is rated as UHS-II (312MBps), Apple has pegged it back at 250MBps, so for the fastest speeds (and a microSD slot if you need one), a dock will likely be a better choice for memory-card use if it is rated at UHS-II rather than UHS-I (104MBps).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacBooks also lack wired Internet access via a Gigabit Ethernet port, so if you want to escape flaky Wi-Fi, buy a dock with at least Gigabit Ethernet, although you could add a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668894-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HJKF2ZM/A/belkin-usb-c-to-gigabit-ethernet-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter</a> if you have a spare TB port. Some later docks include faster 2.5Gb Ethernet but you’ll need a 2.5GbE router or other device to get the benefit. As Gigabit Ethernet’s speed is 1Gbps, a cheaper 5Gbps <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ethernet-PowerExpand-Aluminum-Portable/dp/B08CK9X9Z8?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">USB-C to Ethernet adapter</a> will work just as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just need a few extra ports, a USB-C hub or Thunderbolt 4 hub might be your best choice. If you require a bunch of fast ports including Gigabit Ethernet, then look for a docking station that fulfils your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>USB-C and Thunderbolt speeds</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/thunderbolt-usb-c-dock-speeds.jpg\" alt=\"Thunderbolt 3 Thunderbolt 4 USB-C speeds\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thunderbolt vs USB-C dock compatibility</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plain <strong>USB-C</strong> runs at either 5Gbps or 10Gbps, while <strong>Thunderbolt</strong> (TB3 and TB4) hits speeds of 40Gbps. You can hook up a Thunderbolt laptop to a USB-C dock but you won’t access the faster speeds unless you buy a true Thunderbolt dock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/feature/pc-peripheral/usb-speeds-types-features-explained-3801975/\" target=\"_blank\">USB and Thunderbolt speeds explained</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docks with a <strong>Titan Ridge</strong> or <strong>Goshen Ridge</strong> chipset will work with both Thunderbolt and USB-C laptops. Other Thunderbolt docks won’t work with USB-C laptops, such as the 12in MacBook. With Titan Ridge and Goshen Ridge, you get all the benefits of a Thunderbolt dock, but can use it with non-Thunderbolt laptops, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the review list below, we state at the top which type of laptop (USB-C or Thunderbolt) each docking station is compatible with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our sister website Tech Advisor has separately tested all the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/test-centre/accessories/best-thunderbolt-4-usb4-hubs-docks-3809388/\" target=\"_blank\">best Thunderbolt 4 hubs and docks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>USB PD: Power Delivery for your laptop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look out for a dock with USB PD. The <strong>PD</strong> stands for <strong>Power Delivery</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charging the laptop</strong>: The M1 and M2 MacBook Air require a PD charger with at least 30W power. You’ll need 67W for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and 14-inch MBP (with M1 Pro with 8-core CPU), 96W for 14-inch MBP (with M1 Pro with 10-core CPU or M1 Max), 96W (preferably 140W) for the 16-inch MBP. 13in MacBook Air. The older 15in MacBook Pro requires a 87W PD charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An 85W/96W MacBook Pro can be charged by a 30W or 60W charger, but slower than it would be with its native charger. A larger MacBook with a heavy workload might start fading on a lower wattage charger and not last all day even when plugged into a power source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own a larger MacBook Pro, buy a dock with a PD (Power Delivery) potential of at least 90W if you can. More portable hubs are usually rated at lower power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charging the docked devices</strong>: Some docks don’t feature an external power supply but actually use your laptop to draw power from. Add too many devices to one of these docks and you may well experience power issues, as USB-C can handle just 7.5W bus-device power while Thunderbolt can pass back 15W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just need a spare charger, we’ve tested the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MacBook chargers</a> for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Whole lotta ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need one (“upstream”) Thunderbolt port for connecting to and charging your laptop (although the 14/16in MacBooks can also power via the MagSafe port), and likely at least another (“downstream”) to attach further devices (hard drives, external display, and others).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many cheap adapters that let you add more devices to a USB-C or Thunderbolt MacBook (see our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac-2022.html\" target=\"_blank\">best USB-C adapters for Macs</a>), but for maximum flexibility check out these docking stations that take care of all your extra port requirements, and allow you to simply attach it to your laptop with just one cable when you get to the office or come home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we concentrate on Thunderbolt docks, but also include cheaper USB-C docks—which Thunderbolt MacBooks can use, but at the cost of reduced bandwidth and display limitations.

Mac mini (2018 and later) and iMac (2017 and later) owners may also consider expanding their ports with a Thunderbolt docking station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inclusion of an SD or microSD card reader isn’t just for camera buffs. It’s a convenient and affordable way to add storage to your laptop setup. We found a 512GB Samsung Evo microSD card on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MKSGZM6/ref=twister_B071R715MZ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon for around $100 in the US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-microSDXC-Adapter-MB-ME512HA-EU/dp/B085FGJDP9/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">under £100</a> in the UK. That’s a very cheap way of adding half a terabyte of portable storage.

Its nearest competitor is the excellent Caldigit TS4, reviewed below. Sonnet clearly targeted the TS4 and the specs are remarkably similar—but the cheaper Echo 20 has a useful SSD enclosure that means you can add up to 8TB of internal storage via the dock. If you don’t need this feature and prefer DisplayPort to HDMI, or you need the most powerful ports on offer, the TS4 is still a great contender, although it costs a fair amount more.</p>\n\n<p>Even if your MacBook is Thunderbolt 3, as a Thunderbolt 4 dock the Echo 20 is backward compatible and will work with your next laptop when it’s time to upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>While you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays, Sonnet has swapped one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated HDMI port. You can add up to two 4K displays at 60Hz or a single 6K screen at 60Hz—Macs packing a M2 Pro/Max/Ultra chip and at least macOS Monterey support up to 8K for the single display option. Unless your second display can connect directly with its USB-C port, you’ll need a USB-C-to-DisplayPort or HDMI adapter cable.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the right router, you can take advantage of super-fast wired Internet access with the Echo 20’s 2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet–2.5x faster than standard Gigabit Ethernet, with which it also works on standard networks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 4 upstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 100W PD)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two Thunderbolt 4 downstream ports </strong>(40Gbps, 15W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Up to two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>HDMI 2.1 port </strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Four USB-C ports </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Four USB-A ports </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>SD Card Reader </strong>(SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>3.5mm Combo Audio In/Out port (front</strong>)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two (right and left channels) line out RCA jacks (back)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>3.5mm microphone jack (back)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>150W power supply</strong></li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1978555/sonnet-echo-20-thunderbolt-4-superdock-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalDigit TS4 – most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2050\" height=\"1518\" alt=\"CalDigit TS4 - most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/caldigit_tb_hub_review_4.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThunderbolt 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t18 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t98W PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t2.5 Gigabit Ethernet\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t230W power supply\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly two downstream TB4 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://shop.caldigit.com/us/Docking%20Stations/Thunderbolt%20Station%203?product_id=212\" target=\"_blank\">$399.95 at  CalDigit</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GK8LBWS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$399.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/1285387/9383?prodsku=1014466844&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCALDIGIT-TS4-THUNDERBOLT-DOCK-0-8M-TBT4-CABLE-230W-PSU%2F1014466844&amp;intsrc=CATF_9768&amp;subid1=1-1-668894-6-664966-11713\" target=\"_blank\">$525.79 at  Walmart Affiliate Program</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Works with Thunderbolt and USB-C laptops (TB at full bandwidth)</strong></p>\n\n<p>With 18 top-rated ports and Thunderbolt 4 certified, it’s difficult to look past the Caldigit Thunderbolt Station 4, aka TS4. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s an impressive docking sttaion.</p>\n\n<p>It compares well to the Sonnet Echo 20 with just one fewer port—the Echo 20’s integrated SSD enclosure. For port speeds the TS4 matches the Echo 20, and it boasts the highest power supply (a whopping 230W to be spread among the ports, including a front-mounted 20W USB-C and 98W laptop PD charging) that we’ve seen on any dock that we’ve tested. </p>\n\n<p>We also love this dock’s flexible vertical or horizontal format.</p>\n\n<p>As with the Echo 20, while you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays, Caldigit swaps one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated video port—in this case, DisplayPort. You’ll need an adapter if your monitor requires HDMI.

Its compact shape and 15 ports made it our favorite top-end Thunderbolt 3 docking station for its sheer functional flexibility and power at a great price.</p>\n\n<p>Other docks boast faster USB ports, but few have seven like the TS3 Plus—except its successor, the TS4, which makes even the TS3 Plus look underpowered. if you can afford the extra, we recommend the TS4.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a better choice than the Anker 577 dock as it works with all modern Macs that use M1 or M2 chips.</p>\n\n<p>The TS3 Plus shows its age by not having a Titan Ridge or Goshen Ridge chipset. It’s therefore unsuitable for non-Thunderbolt laptops—but as most MacBooks have at least T3, that shouldn’t matter unless you work in a mixed Mac/Windows environment.</p>\n\n<p>And while Thunderbolt 4 is the latest connection standard, its top-end benefits won’t be noticed by most MacBook owners as TB3 matches TB4 on data-transfer speed.</p>\n\n<p>To add the second external display you will require an HDMI or DisplayPort USB-C video adapter to run from the USB-C port unless you have a USB-C monitor. To avoid this need for an adapter, look for a dock with two video ports. </p>\n\n<p>Both connected displays can run 4K displays at 60Hz. You could also run one 5K display at the same frame rate.</p>\n\n<p>The TS3 Plus’s digital audio ports set it apart from most other Thunderbolt docks.</p>\n\n<p>It charges your laptop at 87W so makes it a great companion to Apple’s 15in or 16in MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n<p>This dock is dinky so won’t take up too much space on your desk. Available in Silver and Space Gray, it matches the colors of Apple’s laptops. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 3 upstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 87W PD)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 3 downstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 15W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Up to two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>DisplayPort 1.2 port </strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Five USB-A ports </strong>(5Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One USB-C </strong>(10Gbps)<strong> port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>One USB-C </strong>(5Gbps)<strong> port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>SD Card Reader </strong>(SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Front-facing 3.5mm Audio In &amp; Out ports</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>One Digital Optical Audio </strong>(S/PDIF)<strong> port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>180W power supply</strong></li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667861/caldigit-thunderbolt-station-3-plus-ts3-plus-dock-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCalDigit Thunderbolt Station 3 Plus (TS3 Plus) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalDigit Thunderbolt 3 mini Dock – Best portable Thunderbolt 3 dock\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 mini Dock - Best portable Thunderbolt 3 dock\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/caldigit-minidock.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPortable\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDual display ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThunderbolt 3 not 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo downstream TB3 port\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUnpowered\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $149.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079H4WTR4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$149.95 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=CD500374&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fcd500374.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Adorama</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668894-6-661420-11713&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMX02ZM/A/caldigit-thunderbolt-3-mini-dock\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Works with Thunderbolt laptops (TB at full bandwidth)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 mini Dock offers dual-4K HDMI display support at 60Hz in a lightweight portable form.

It’s fairly expensive, at $399/£399.99, but it’s designed to provide an all-in-one desktop system for people who do a lot of video-conferencing when working at home or in the office.</p>\n\n<p>The compact dock (3.34-x-6.3-x-5.18 inches) will fit neatly on your desk alongside your Mac’s display. The Logi Dock’s chunky power adaptor means that this is very much a dock that’s designed to stay on your desk the whole time. </p>\n\n<p>There’s one USB-C upstream port that is used to connect the Logi Dock to your Mac, and both HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces for external display. Significantly, you can only connect one 4K display if you’re using Extended mode, although you can connect two 4K displays in Mirrored mode.</p>\n\n<p>The Logi Dock can work as a speaker for voice and video calls, or you can just listen to some music while you’re working using either the USB-C connection with your Mac, or using Bluetooth to connect to your mobile devices. It sounds pretty good too, with a set of 55mm stereo speakers that deliver a nice firm bass thud on Kate Bush’s <em>Running Up That Hill</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use Logitech’s Tune app to link the Logi Dock with conferencing apps such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and there’s a set of buttons on the top of the Logi Dock that allow you to quickly mute the mic and turn off the camera. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1x USB-C upstream port</strong> (5Gbps, 100W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>2x USB-C downstream ports</strong> (5Gbps, 4.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1 x USB-C downstream ports</strong> (5Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1x USB-A</strong> (5Gbps, 4.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1x USB-A</strong> (5Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1x HDMI 2.0</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>1x DisplayPort 1.4</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>2x 55mm speakers</strong> (stereo)</li>\n\n<li><strong>6x noise-cancelling microphones</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>230W power supply</strong></li>\n\n<li>Certified for Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHyperDrive GEN2 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"HyperDrive GEN2 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/hyperdrive-tb3_thunderbolt-3-dock.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t14 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t85W PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTitan Ridge\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDigital audio\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThunderbolt 3 not 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive outside US\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$349.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.hypershop.com/collections/thunderbolt-compatible/products/hyperdrive-gen2-thunderbolt-3-docking-station-1&amp;xcust=1-1-668894-6-663750-17683&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$349.99 at  Hyper</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Works with Thunderbolt and USB-C laptops (TB at full bandwidth)</strong></p>\n\n<p>This Titan Ridge (Thunderbolt and USB-C) docking station is bristling with 14 high-performance ports.</p>\n\n<p>Its compact form is neat (just like the Caldigit TS4 and TS3 Plus or the Anker PowerExpand Elite), and it can lie either upright or horizontal depending on your needs and preference.</p>\n\n<p>There are six USB-A ports in total: four USB-A ports at 5Gbps and a further two at 10Gbps, plus one fast-charging QC 3.0 USB-A port.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this is one 10Gbps USB-C port that you’ll need if you want to supplement the DisplayPort for a second external display.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also get more professional-level digital audio ports, as well as the analogue 3.5mm headphone/mic jack at the front.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 3 upstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 85W PD)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 3 downstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 15W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Titan Ridge chipset </strong>(USB-C and TB3)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Up to two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One DisplayPort 1.4 ports </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Three USB-A ports </strong>(5Gbps, 4.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two USB-A ports </strong>(10Gbps, 4.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One USB-A port </strong>(QC 3.0, 36W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One USB-C port </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Front-facing 3.5mm Analogue Audio In &amp;

This means that if you want two external screens, you lose two of the three downstream TB4 ports, plus you will need HDMI or DisplayPort adapters unless the displays have a USB-C connection.</p>\n\n<p>If your external displays use HDMI, you don’t need any USB-C adapters to connect displays. One downside is that there’s just one downstream TB4 port, but that’s all you’d have left if you connected two displays to one of the other docks or hubs.</p>\n\n<p>The other is more significant for Mac users. There are ways around the limitation but, out of the box, Macs can’t use both HDMI ports with Extended mode displays; only Mirrored. And Anker warns off owners of Macs that boast an M1 or M2 processor.</p>\n\n<p>If you aren’t planning on adding two screens, this dock is less flexible than other hubs and docks where the TB4 ports can be used for display or whatever else you desire.</p>\n\n<p>We are fans of the inclusion of a power button so that your laptop isn’t receiving a potential charge when it’s not needed, and keeping the dock’s temperature down at night.</p>\n\n<p><strong>• One upstream Thunderbolt 4 port </strong>(40Gbps, 90W PD)<br /><strong>• One downstream Thunderbolt 4 port </strong>(40Gbps, 15W)<br /><strong>• One USB-C port </strong>(10Gbps, 20W)<br /><strong>• Two USB-A ports </strong>(10Gbps, 4.5W)<br /><strong>• Two USB-A ports </strong>(480Mbps, 4.5W)<br /><strong>• Two HDMI 2.0 ports </strong>(4K at 60Hz)<br /><strong>• Gigabit Ethernet </strong><br /><strong>• SD Card reader </strong>(UHS-II, 312MBps)<br /><strong>• 3.5mm audio jack</strong><br /><strong>• 120W power supply</strong></p>\n\n<p>Read our full \n<a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/review/anker-apex-thunderbolt-4-docking-station-review-3809187/\">Anker Apex Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station review</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 Dual-4K Docking Station – Packed with ports\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 Dual-4K Docking Station - Packed with ports\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/startech-thunderbolt-3-dock.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t12 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t85W PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThunderbolt 3 not 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$329.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078PLPSTV?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$292.81 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Works with Thunderbolt laptops (TB at full bandwidth)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 Dual-4K Docking Station is, as the name suggests, for laptops that sport the fast (40Gbps) Thunderbolt 3 version of USB-C.

You’ll likely need an adapter to connect the second port via the spare Thunderbolt 3 port unless the display has a USB-C port too.</p>\n\n<p>The list price is steep, but you’ll find it cheaper at Amazon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 3 upstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 85W PD)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 3 downstream port </strong>(40Gbps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Up to two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>DisplayPort 1.2 port </strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>One USB-C port </strong>(5Gbps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Five USB-A ports </strong>(5Gbps; one at 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>SD Card Reader </strong>(SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Front-facing combination 3.5mm Audio In &amp; Out port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>180W power supply</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read our full \n<a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/review/startech-thunderbolt-3-dual-4k-docking-station-review-3695797/\">StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 Dual-4K Docking station review</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinedock – Best USB-C dock for desk space\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Linedock - Best USB-C dock for desk space\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/linedock-13-macbook.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t10 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExtra battery\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExtra SSD storage options\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUSB-C not Thunderbolt\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $479\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://linedock.co/products/macbook-16in-docking-station&amp;xcust=1-1-668894-6-663234-19146&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$479 at  Linedock</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Works with USB-C and Thunderbolt laptops (TB at reduced bandwidth)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Linedock looks different to most USB-C docks. In fact, you’ll hardly notice it as it sits beneath a 13in, 15in or 16in MacBook Pro or Air.</p>\n\n<p>It looks just like a closed MacBook, except for a row of ports on either side, and a charging USB-C port at the back (it requires a separate charger, but the one that shipped with your MacBook will be fine).</p>\n\n<p>It connects to the MacBook with a nifty little U-shaped connector, with one USB-C connector for the dock and another for the laptop.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a desk-space saver but not a money saver. It doesn’t just look like an Apple product, it’s priced like one, and is the most expensive dock on test here. </p>\n\n<p>But it does have two unique and incredibly useful features missing from other docking stations: up to a 27,000mAh battery and the option to add up to 2TB of SSD memory within it – an almost unbelievable amount of battery capacity and storage for a laptop. You can leave the Linedock with no SSD, or add a 256GB, 1TB or 2TB SSD depending on the model.</p>\n\n<p>These are great ideas, but in other ways the Linedock seems a little out of date in places.</p>\n\n<p>The 13in model has a Mini DisplayPort (as well as the more common HDMI) but no Gigabit Ethernet, for example. Adding a fat Ethernet port would maybe make this flat dock too high for its purpose.</p>\n\n<p>While the 13in Linedock can support only one external display, the 15in and 16in models can handle two—although, for now, all M1 Apple laptops can support only one external monitor anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The newer 16in model is aimed at M1 / M1 Pro / M1 Max ditches the MiniDP for full-size DisplayPort and HDMI ports, although it could have dispensed with video ports entirely if users were recommended to use a USB-C-to-USB-C cable for compatible displays or an adapter for HDMI or DisplayPort monitors.</p>\n\n<p>And it’s USB-C rather than Thunderbolt, so nowhere near the top-end 40Gbps bandwidth of the Apple laptops. This is meant to keep costs down, and the Linedock is already plenty expensive enough.</p>\n\n<p>If you can afford it, the Linedock is a great hybrid of dock, battery and storage. The lack of Thunderbolt won’t bother lighter users, and decent Wi-Fi will mean the missing Ethernet port won’t matter either.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pass-through laptop charging at up to 100W</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>HDMI 2.0 port </strong>(on all models)</li>\n\n<li><strong>DisplayPort </strong>(on 15in and 16in model)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Mini DisplayPort 1.4 </strong>(on 13in model)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Three USB-C </strong>(5Gbps) <strong>ports (13in)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Three USB-C </strong>(10Gbps)<strong> ports (15/16in)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Three USB-A </strong>(5Gbps)<strong> ports (13/15/16in)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>SD Card Reader </strong>(UHS-I, 104MBps)<strong> on 13in</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Two SD Card Readers </strong>(UHS-II, 312MBps) <strong>on 15/16in</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>19,350mAh battery </strong>(13in)</li>\n\n<li><strong>27,000mAh battery </strong>(13in)</li>\n\n<li><strong>0GB, 256GB or 1TB SSD options </strong>(13in)</li>\n\n<li><strong>0GB, 1TB or 2TB SSD options </strong>(15/16in)</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668011/linedock-review-slim-docking-station-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLinedock review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoshi Symbus Q Compact USB-C Dock – Best USB-C dock with wireless charging\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Moshi Symbus Q Compact USB-C Dock -
