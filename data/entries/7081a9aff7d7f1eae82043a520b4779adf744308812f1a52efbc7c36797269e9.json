We tested a bunch to find the best Thunderbolt and USB-C docks available to owners of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thunderbolt 3, 4, USB4 or USB-C</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The connectors all look the same (technically known as a “Type-C connector”), but there are significant differences, particularly on data-transfer speed—with USB-C maxing out at 10Gbps (usually 5Gbps) compared to the 40Gbps of Thunderbolt 3 and 4. More like Thunderbolt than USB-C, USB4 can be either 20Gbps or 40Gbps. That extra bandwidth allows not just for faster data transfer but higher frame rates to external displays, plus some other smart benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of Apple’s current laptop range, the M1 and M2 MacBook Air and 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro feature two ports that Apple specifies as “Thunderbolt 3 / USB 4” ports, while the 14in and 16in M1 Pro or M1 Max MacBook Pro models come with three Thunderbolt 4 (TB4) ports. Ignore Apple’s dual designation of TB3 and USB4—it just means that the ports don’t certify as pure TB4, and that shouldn’t worry most users except for the number of external displays each supports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s older 12in MacBook features one 5Gbps Gen 1 USB-C port, while the later Intel MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (from 2016) boast either two or four 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your MacBook is equipped with Thunderbolt 4, then you really should buy a TB4 dock if you need more ports than those 14/16in laptops already possess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a Thunderbolt 4 dock is a wise decision for everyone, based on future-proofing even for owners of Thunderbolt 3 (TB3) Macs as TB4 is backwards compatible with TB3 and USB-C. That said, there are still some great—and often more affordable—TB3 and USB-C docks available, and most Apple users won’t see much difference between TB3 and TB4—the Thunderbolt 4 standard was mainly about getting Windows laptops up to speed, although there are technical benefits for MacBook Pro users, such as smarter daisy-chaining and faster PCI hard-drive connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more detail, read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675887/thunderbolt-4-vs-thunderbolt-3-vs-usb-4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbolt 4 vs Thunderbolt 3 vs USB4 explainer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have included some cheaper (non-Thunderbolt) USB-C docks. If you don’t require the ultimate bandwidth for the fastest data transfer and best screen frame rates or resolutions, a USB-C dock might suit your purposes and save you money. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Add external displays to your MacBook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use your laptop as your principal computer, you would do well to consider attaching at least one larger display to create a hybrid desktop/laptop setup (with a keyboard, mouse and printer all available via a single connection to your MacBook). You can turn that 13in laptop’s screen real-estate into an iMac-sized 27in or even larger monitor by adding an extra display—or connect two large screens to extend your screen across your whole desk. Take a look at our recommended <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668700/best-mac-monitors-displays.html\" target=\"_blank\">best monitors and displays for Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to connect more than one external display to your MacBook without adding third-party software you’ll need a Thunderbolt dock, rather than a USB-C dock. Natively over USB-C, Macs can only connect to one external display in <strong>Extended mode</strong> (where the screen extends beyond what you can see on the laptop screen, as opposed to <strong>Mirrored mode</strong> that replicates exactly what you get on the laptop screen) but you’ll get two Extended mode screens over a Thunderbolt connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple’s MacBooks featuring the company’s own M1 or M2 Silicon chip are super speedy compared to the models sporting Intel processors, models with plain (non-Pro or Max) M1, M2 and M3 chips come with an incredible limitation: they don’t support more than one external display in Extended Mode even via their Thunderbolt 3 ports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that when using any docking station, M1/M2/M3 MacBook users cannot extend their desktop over two or more displays, and will be limited to either dual Mirrored displays or one external display—although adding third-party DisplayLink or InstantView software to the Mac and connecting to a dedicated USB-C dock will allow you to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\" target=\"_blank\">add more than one external monitor to an M1 or M2 MacBook</a>. Follow that link for our roundup of the best USB-C DisplayLink docks, and we’ve included our favorite in our roundup below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the superior M1/M2/M3 Pro and M1/M2/M3 Max MacBook Pro models can support multiple displays. Below our list of the best MacBook docking stations, we’ve listed the native external display options for each MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need a docking station?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All the latest MacBook Pro models boast a wider range of built-in ports, so lighter users might not need a docking station at all. Below the list of our recommended Mac docks is a detailed look at the ports that each recent MacBook includes as standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With three TB4 and an HDMI port, a MacBook with a Max chip could connect to up to four external displays without the need for a dock, although such a power user would likely require extra Thunderbolt ports for other devices to make up for using all the laptop ports for multiple monitors. See below our list of recommended docking stations for more detail on the external display options with each recent MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacBook Pros also have an SD card reader. Although this is rated as UHS-II (312MBps), Apple has pegged it back at 250MBps, so for the fastest speeds (and a microSD slot if you need one), a dock will likely be a better choice for memory-card use if it is rated at UHS-II rather than UHS-I (104MBps).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacBooks also lack wired Internet access via a Gigabit Ethernet port, so if you want to escape flaky Wi-Fi, buy a dock with at least Gigabit Ethernet, although you could add a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668894-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HJKF2ZM/A/belkin-usb-c-to-gigabit-ethernet-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter</a> if you have a spare TB port. Some later docks include faster 2.5Gb Ethernet but you’ll need a 2.5GbE router or other device to get the benefit. As Gigabit Ethernet’s speed is 1Gbps, a cheaper 5Gbps <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ethernet-PowerExpand-Aluminum-Portable/dp/B08CK9X9Z8?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">USB-C to Ethernet adapter</a> will work just as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just need a few extra ports, a USB-C hub or Thunderbolt 4 <strong>hub</strong> might be your best choice. If you require a bunch of fast ports including Gigabit Ethernet, then look for a full <strong>dock</strong> that fulfils your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>USB-C and Thunderbolt speeds</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Thunderbolt-USB-C-Dock-Speeds.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"USB-C vs Thunderbolt 3 vs Thunderbolt 4 specs\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Thunderbolt-USB-C-Dock-Speeds.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Thunderbolt-USB-C-Dock-Speeds.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Thunderbolt-USB-C-Dock-Speeds.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"774\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thunderbolt vs USB-C dock compatibility</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plain <strong>USB-C</strong> runs at either 5Gbps or 10Gbps, while <strong>Thunderbolt</strong> (TB3 and TB4) hits speeds of 40Gbps. You can hook up a Thunderbolt laptop to a USB-C dock but you won’t access the faster speeds unless you buy a true Thunderbolt dock. (By the way, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064049/intel-thunderbolt-5-bandwidth-speeds.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbolt 5</a>, offering 80Gbps, won’t be seen on a Mac until well into 2024.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/feature/pc-peripheral/usb-speeds-types-features-explained-3801975/\" target=\"_blank\">USB and Thunderbolt speeds explained</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>USB PD: Power Delivery for your laptop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look out for a dock with USB PD. The <strong>PD</strong> stands for <strong>Power Delivery</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charging the laptop</strong>: The M1/M2 MacBook Air requires a PD charger with at least 30W power, but you can fast-charge an M2 Air with a charger rated at over 70W. You’ll need 67W for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and 14-inch MBP (with 8-, 10- or 11-core CPU), 96W for 14-inch MBP (with 12-core CPU), and 96W (preferably 140W) for the 16-inch MBP. The older 15in MacBook Pro requires a 87W PD charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An 85W/96W MacBook Pro can be charged by a 30W or 60W charger, but slower than it would be with its native charger. A larger MacBook with a heavy workload might start fading even while being charges on a lower wattage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own a larger MacBook Pro, buy a dock with a PD (Power Delivery) potential of at least 85W if you can. Portable hubs are usually rated at a lower power such as 60W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>USB PD 3.0</strong> maxes at 100W, while <strong>USB PD 3.1</strong> can support up to 240W of power. The 16-inch MacBook Pro requires 140W to fast-charge via its MagSafe 3 cable, so owners of that laptop should look for a PD 3.1 charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just need a spare charger, we’ve tested the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MacBook chargers</a> for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dock, hub or dongle: Whole lotta ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need one (“upstream”) Thunderbolt port for connecting to and charging your laptop (although the 14/16in MacBooks can also power via the MagSafe port), and likely at least another (“downstream”) to attach further devices (hard drives, external display, and others).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many inexpensive <strong>USB-C dongles/hubs</strong> that let you add more devices to a MacBook (see our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac-2022.html\" target=\"_blank\">best USB-C adapters for Macs</a>) or a <strong>Thunderbolt hub</strong> offering a few extra ports might be all your need, but for maximum flexibility check out a <strong>docking station</strong> that takes care of all your extra port requirements, and allows you to simply attach it to your laptop with just one cable when you get to the office or come home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we concentrate on Thunderbolt docks, but also include cheaper USB-C docks—which Thunderbolt MacBooks can use, but at the cost of reduced bandwidth and display limitations. We’ve also included our favorite Thunderbolt hubs for smaller and cheaper alternatives.

Mac mini (2018 and later) and iMac (2017 and later) owners may also consider expanding their ports with a Thunderbolt docking station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inclusion of an SD or microSD card reader isn’t just for camera buffs. It’s a convenient and affordable way to add storage to your laptop setup. We found a 512GB Samsung Evo microSD card on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MKSGZM6/ref=twister_B071R715MZ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon for around $100 in the US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-microSDXC-Adapter-MB-ME512HA-EU/dp/B085FGJDP9/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">under £100</a> in the UK. That’s a very cheap way of adding half a terabyte of portable storage.

Its nearest competitor is the excellent Caldigit TS4, reviewed below. Sonnet clearly targeted the TS4 and the specs are remarkably similar—but the cheaper Echo 20 has a useful SSD enclosure that means you can add up to 8TB of internal storage via the dock. If you don’t need this feature and prefer DisplayPort to HDMI, or you need the most powerful ports on offer, the TS4 is still a great contender, although it costs a fair amount more.</p>\n\n<p>The Satechi Dual Dock Stand, reviewed below, is a cheaper non-Thunderbolt option if the idea of an integrated SSD enclosure is appealing.</p>\n\n<p>Even if your MacBook is Thunderbolt 3, as a Thunderbolt 4 dock the Echo 20 is backwards compatible and will work with your next laptop when it’s time to upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>While you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays, Sonnet has swapped one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated HDMI port. You can add up to two 4K displays at 60Hz or a single 6K screen at 60Hz—Macs packing a M2/M3 Pro/Max/Ultra chip and at least macOS Monterey support up to 8K for the single display option. Unless your second display can connect directly with its USB-C port, you’ll need a USB-C-to-DisplayPort or HDMI adapter cable to connect to one of the downstream TB4 ports.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the right router, you can take advantage of super-fast wired Internet access with the Echo 20’s 2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet—2.5x faster than standard Gigabit Ethernet, with which it also works on standard networks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 4 upstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 100W PD)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two Thunderbolt 4 downstream ports </strong>(40Gbps, 15W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Up to two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>HDMI 2.1 port </strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Four USB-C ports </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Four USB-A ports </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>SD Card Reader </strong>(SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>3.5mm Combo Audio In/Out port (front</strong>)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two (right and left channels) line out RCA jacks (back)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>3.5mm microphone jack (back)</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>150W power supply</strong></li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1978555/sonnet-echo-20-thunderbolt-4-superdock-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSatechi Dual Dock Stand – Best USB-C dock for Macs\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Satechi Dual Dock Stand - Best USB-C dock for Macs\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Satechi_Dual-Dock-Stand-Docking_StationSSD-enclosure.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t9 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tBuilt-in speedy SSD enclosure\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tZero-footprint docking station\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUSB-C not Thunderbolt\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUSB ports can’t charge devices\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo card reader\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRequires USB-C charger\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$149.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://satechi.net/products/dual-dock-stand-docking-station-with-nvme-ssd-enclosure&amp;xcust=1-1-668894-6-2029843-14639&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$149.95 at  Satechi</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFWX61HL?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> 10Gbps USB-C Dock</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ports:</strong> 19</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> 100W PD 3.0; 150W max</p>\n\n<p><strong>External displays:</strong> 2x 4K at 60Hz or 1x 6K at 60Hz</p>\n\n<p>Another dock with an SSD enclosure is the Satechi Dual Dock Stand that doubles up as an open-MacBook stand that raises the keyboard to a more comfortable angle..</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the Thunderbolt 4 Sonnet Echo 20, reviewed above, this is a USB-C dock with a 10Gbps rather than 40Gbps bandwidth, but it’s significantly cheaper as a result. The MSRP of the Satechi Dual Dock Stand is $150, which is a very reasonable price for a dual 4K 60Hz USB-C docking station.</p>\n\n<p>With one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports, you can connect up to two 4K displays in Extended mode at a decent 60Hz refresh rate. The Echo 20 has just one video port. Although that port is the superior HDMI 2.1, you have to add a second external screen via one of the Thunderbolt ports, which will require an adapter.</p>\n\n<p>The SSD enclosure is the star of the show. Placed on the underside of the dock, this is easily accessed and supports both NVMe and SATA SSDs. You need to buy the SSD separately. Amazon is selling <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=NVME+SSD&amp;geniuslink=true&amp;tag=mwgenius-21&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">NVME SSDs</a> for around $50 (1TB), $80 (2TB) or $300 (4TB).</p>\n\n<p>One USB-C port is for passthrough PD power at up to 75W to the laptop, which is enough for all but the 16-inch MacBook Pro at full pelt. Even that model will charge fine—just slower than smaller MacBooks. Note that you will need to connect your own USB-C charger to the dock: check out our recommended MacBook chargers.</p>\n\n<p>If you use your MacBook’s own keyboard and desire up to two quality external displays, plus need to increase your base storage with fast SSD drives, the Satechi Dual Dock Stand is a neat, zero-footprint docking station that matches your MacBook for style and adds nine useful ports.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dual-USB-C upstream connector to laptop</strong> (10Gbps, 75W PD 3.0)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Passthrough power USB-C port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Two USB-C </strong>(one at 10Gbps, one at 5Gbps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two USB-A</strong> (one at 10Gbps, one at 5Gbps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One DisplayPort 1.4</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Two HDMI 2.1 ports</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong></li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2029842/satechi-dual-dock-stand-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSatechi Dual Dock Stand review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalDigit TS4 – most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2050\" height=\"1518\" alt=\"CalDigit TS4 - most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/caldigit_tb_hub_review_4.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThunderbolt 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t18 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t98W PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t2.5 Gigabit Ethernet\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t230W power supply\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://shop.caldigit.com/us/Docking%20Stations/Thunderbolt%20Station%203?product_id=212\" target=\"_blank\">$399.95 at  CalDigit</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GK8LBWS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$399.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 Dock</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ports:</strong> 18</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> 98W PD 3.0; 230W max</p>\n\n<p><strong>External displays:</strong> 2x 4K at 60Hz or 1x 8K at 60Hz</p>\n\n<p>With 18 top-rated ports and Thunderbolt 4 certified, it’s difficult to look past the Caldigit Thunderbolt Station 4, aka TS4. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s an ultra-impressive dock.</p>\n\n<p>It compares well to the Sonnet Echo 20 with just one fewer port—the Echo 20’s integrated SSD enclosure. For port speeds the TS4 matches the Echo 20, and it boasts the highest power supply that we’ve seen on any dock that we’ve tested—a whopping 230W to be spread among the ports, including a front-mounted 20W USB-C that can fast-charge an iPhone and 98W laptop PD charging. </p>\n\n<p>We also love this dock’s flexible vertical or horizontal format.</p>\n\n<p>As with the Echo 20, while you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays. Caldigit swaps one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated video port—in this case, DisplayPort. You’ll need an adapter if your monitor requires HDMI. You can add up to two 4K displays at 60Hz or a single 8K screen at 60Hz. </p>\n\n<p>The TS4 also matches the Echo 20 with super-fast 2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet–2.5x faster than standard Gigabit Ethernet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Thunderbolt 4 upstream port </strong>(40Gbps, 98W PD)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two Thunderbolt 4 downstream ports </strong>(40Gbps, 15W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Up to two external displays </strong>(4K at 60Hz)</li>\n\n<li><strong>DisplayPort 1.4 port </strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Five USB-A ports </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>One USB-C port </strong>(10Gbps, 20W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Two USB-C ports </strong>(10Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>SD Card Reader </strong>(SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>microSD Card Reader </strong>(SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps)</li>\n\n<li><strong>2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet port</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>3.5mm Combo Audio In/Out port at front</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>3.5mm Audio In &amp;

Its compact shape and 15 ports made it our favorite top-end Thunderbolt 3 docking station for its sheer functional flexibility and power at a great price.</p>\n\n<p>Other docks boast faster USB ports, but few have seven like the TS3 Plus—except its successor, the TS4, which makes even the TS3 Plus look underpowered. if you can afford the extra, we recommend the TS4.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a better choice than the Anker 577 dock as it works with all modern Macs that use M1/M2/M3 chips.</p>\n\n<p>The TS3 Plus isn’t unsuitable for non-Thunderbolt laptops—but as most MacBooks have at least TB3, that shouldn’t matter unless you work in a mixed Mac/Windows environment.</p>\n\n<p>And while Thunderbolt 4 is the latest connection standard, its top-end benefits won’t be noticed by most MacBook owners as TB3 matches TB4 on data-transfer speed.</p>\n\n<p>To add the second external display you will require an HDMI or DisplayPort USB-C video adapter to run from the USB-C port unless you have a USB-C monitor.

The Logi Dock’s chunky power adaptor means that this is very much a dock that’s designed to stay on your desk the whole time. </p>\n\n<p>There’s one USB-C upstream port that is used to connect the Logi Dock to your Mac, and both HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces for external display. Significantly, you can only connect one 4K display if you’re using Extended mode, although you can connect two 4K displays in Mirrored mode.</p>\n\n<p>The Logi Dock can work as a speaker for voice and video calls, or you can just listen to some music while you’re working using either the USB-C connection with your Mac, or using Bluetooth to connect to your mobile devices. It sounds pretty good too, with a set of 55mm stereo speakers that deliver a nice firm bass thud on Kate Bush’s <em>Running Up That Hill</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use Logitech’s Tune app to link the Logi Dock with conferencing apps such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and there’s a set of buttons on the top of the Logi Dock that allow you to quickly mute the mic and turn off the camera. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1x USB-C upstream port</strong> (5Gbps, 100W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>2x USB-C downstream ports</strong> (5Gbps, 4.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1 x USB-C downstream ports</strong> (5Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1x USB-A</strong> (5Gbps, 4.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1x USB-A</strong> (5Gbps, 7.5W)</li>\n\n<li><strong>1x HDMI 2.0</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>1x DisplayPort 1.4</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>2x 55mm speakers</strong> (stereo)</li>\n\n<li><strong>6x noise-cancelling microphones</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>230W power supply</strong></li>\n\n<li>Certified for Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHyperDrive GEN2 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"HyperDrive GEN2 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3693087/hyperdrive-tb3_thunderbolt-3-dock.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t14 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t85W PD\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDigital audio\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThunderbolt 3 not 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExpensive outside US\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$349.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P5BMJ9D?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$199.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.hypershop.com/collections/thunderbolt-compatible/products/hyperdrive-gen2-thunderbolt-3-docking-station-1&amp;xcust=1-1-668894-6-663750-17683&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$349.99 at  Hyper</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 Dock</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ports:</strong> 14</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> 85W PD 3.0; 180W max</p>\n\n<p><strong>External displays:</strong> 2x 4K at 60Hz</p>\n\n<p>This Titan Ridge (Thunderbolt and USB-C) docking station is bristling with 14 high-performance ports.</p>\n\n<p>Its compact form is neat (just like the Caldigit TS4 and TS3 Plus or the Anker PowerExpand Elite), and it can lie either upright or horizontal depending on your needs and preference.</p>\n\n<p>There are six USB-A ports in total: four USB-A ports at 5Gbps and a further two at 10Gbps, plus one fast-charging QC 3.0 USB-A port.
