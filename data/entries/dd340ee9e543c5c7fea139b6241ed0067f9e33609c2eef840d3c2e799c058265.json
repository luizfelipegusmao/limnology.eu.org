{"title":"Development and Implementation of a Smart Charging System for Electric Vehicles based on the \nISO 15118 Standard","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0340/v1","date":1715095256000,"content":"There is currently an exponential growth in the electric vehicle market, which will require an increase in the electrical grid capacity to meet the demand of charging. If, on the one hand, the introduction of energy generation from renewable sources can be used to meet that requirement, the intermittent nature of some of these sources poses challenges to the required real time equilibrium between generation and consumption. The impossibility of controlling generation from some of these sources leads to the attempt of controlling and manage the consumption of electricity, according with the levels of generation. In this context, the emergence of smart grids has introduced mechanisms that guarantee a balance between consumption and generation of electricity. One of these mechanisms is the smart charging of electric vehicles. Effective smart charging relies on communication between the supply equipment and the electric vehicle, en-abling the adjustment of the energy transfer according with the generation levels. Thus, there is a necessity for a standardised system that guarantees this communication. In this context, the ISO 15118 standard, allows high level communication mechanisms, much beyond the basic control solutions offered by the IEC 61851-1 specification. In this context, this paper presents the development of a charge emulation system, based on the ISO 15118 communication protocol and discusses its application for demand response purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd340ee9e543c5c7fea139b6241ed0067f9e33609c2eef840d3c2e799c058265","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
