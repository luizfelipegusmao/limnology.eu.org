{"title":"Robotics Applications In Criminal Investigations â€“ A Novel Proposal Of Robots Potential For Assisting In Crime Suspects Interrogations and Human Questioning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1231/v1","date":1729008785000,"content":"Criminal acts deprive humanity of peace and safety. Therefore, all societies, including both governments and ordinary people tries to fight and minimize crimes. And it goes without saying that societies have developed post-crime mitigation for justice insurance and criminals trials. Moreover, one of the essential post-crime procedures is suspect interrogations and witness questioning. Nevertheless, interrogations take a lot of time and effort, and it requires high qualification from the interrogators. Thus, we propose a robust solution to implement robotics in the field of interrogations and questioning where our design could be implemented in police departments, schools, airports, and anywhere that requires human interaction and questioning for security or criminal investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"101374fd11a01437529ab436c188c4bb9cf877c42d19b6fea3424f9f630f7606","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
