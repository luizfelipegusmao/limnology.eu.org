{"title":"&quot;The Interplay between Microbiome and Cancer Metabolism: A New Perspective on the Warburg Effect&quot;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0058/v1","date":1727780470000,"content":"This review explores the intricate relationship between the microbiome and cancer metabolism, focusing on the Warburg effectâ€”a shift where cancer cells rely on glycolysis for energy even in oxygen-rich environments. This metabolic reprogramming fuels tumor growth and alters the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies highlight the microbiome's influence on cancer metabolism, suggesting that microbial imbalances can either promote or hinder the Warburg effect. Microbiome alterations impact metabolic pathways, immune responses, and gene expression, which can accelerate or mitigate cancer progression. We examine how dysbiosis affects the Warburg effect and its implications for tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Additionally, we discuss the potential of microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplants, to modulate cancer metabolism. These interventions offer the possibility of reversing or controlling the metabolic shifts in cancer cells, enhancing the efficacy of traditional treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Despite promising developments, challenges remain in identifying key microbial species and pathways, as well as in validating microbiome-targeted therapies through large-scale clinical trials. Nonetheless, the intersection of microbiome research and cancer metabolism presents an exciting frontier for innovative therapies. This review offers a fresh perspective on cancer metabolism by integrating microbiome insights, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary research to enhance our understanding of cancer progression and treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8721dab6a69907b83c232ecb98f3c609e530b9acd492bbe97f881b4b0e022fe7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
