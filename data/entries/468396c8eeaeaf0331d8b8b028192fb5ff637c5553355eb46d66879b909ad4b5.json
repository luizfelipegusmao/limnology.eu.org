{"title":"Activated NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis pathway induces olaparib resistance in <i>BRCA1</i> knockout pancreatic cancer cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302130","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Yuka Sasaki, Takuma Inouchi, Ryusuke Nakatsuka, Amane Inoue, Mitsuko Masutani, Tadashige Nozaki</p>\r\n\r\nPARP inhibitors have been developed as anti-cancer agents based on synthetic lethality in homologous recombination deficient cancer cells. However, resistance to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib remains a problem in clinical use, and the mechanisms of resistance are not fully understood. To investigate mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance, we established a <i>BRCA1</i> knockout clone derived from the pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 cells, which we termed C1 cells, and subsequently isolated an olaparib-resistant C1/OLA cells. We then performed RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis on olaparib-treated C1 and C1/OLA cells. Our results revealed activation of cell signaling pathway related to NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in the olaparib-resistant C1/OLA cells, with increased expression of genes encoding the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes NAMPT and NMNAT2. Moreover, intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels were significantly higher in C1/OLA cells than in the non-olaparib-resistant C1 cells. Upregulation of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels by the addition of nicotinamide also induced resistance to olaparib and talazoparib in C1 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that upregulation of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> is one of the factors underlying the acquisition of PARP inhibitor resistance.","author":"Yuka Sasaki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"468396c8eeaeaf0331d8b8b028192fb5ff637c5553355eb46d66879b909ad4b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
