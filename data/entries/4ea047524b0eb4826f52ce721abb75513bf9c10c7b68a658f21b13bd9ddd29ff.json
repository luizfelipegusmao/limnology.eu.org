{"title":"The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cardiomyopathies in the Light of New Guidelines: A Focus on Tissue Mapping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1108/v1","date":1710989998000,"content":"Cardiomyopathies (CMPs) are a group of myocardial disorders that are characterized by structural and functional abnormalities of the heart muscle. These abnormalities occur in the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, valvular disease, and congenital heart disease. CMPs are an increasingly important topic in the field of cardiovascular diseases due to the complexity of their diagnosis and management. In 2023, the ESC guidelines on cardiomyopathies were first published, marking significant progress in the field. The growth of techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and genetics has been fueled by the development of multimodal imaging approaches. For the diagnosis of CMPs, a multimodal imaging approach, including CMR, is recommended. CMR has become the standard for non-invasive analysis of cardiac morphology and myocardial function. This document provides an overview of the role of CMR in CMPs, with a focus on tissue mapping. CMR enables the characterization of myocardial tissues and the assessment of cardiac functions. CMR sequences and techniques, such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parametric mapping, provide detailed information on tissue composition, fibrosis, edema, and myocardial perfusion. These techniques offer valuable insights for early diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and therapeutic guidance of CMPs. The use of quantitative CMR markers enables personalized treatment plans, improving overall patient outcomes. This review aims to serve as a guide for the use of these new tools in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ea047524b0eb4826f52ce721abb75513bf9c10c7b68a658f21b13bd9ddd29ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
