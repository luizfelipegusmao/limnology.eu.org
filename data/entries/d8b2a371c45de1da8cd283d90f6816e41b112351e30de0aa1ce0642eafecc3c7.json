{"title":"The Evolution, Assembly, and Dynamics of Marine Holobionts","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-marine-022123-104345?TRACK=RSS","date":1705449600000,"content":"<div><p>The holobiont concept (i.e., multiple living beings in close symbiosis with one another and functioning as a unit) is revolutionizing our understanding of biology, especially in marine systems. The earliest marine holobiont was likely a syntrophic partnership of at least two prokaryotic members. Since then, symbiosis has enabled marine organisms to conquer all ocean habitats through the formation of holobionts with a wide spectrum of complexities. However, most scientific inquiries have focused on isolated organisms and their adaptations to specific environments. In this review, we attempt to illustrate why a holobiont perspective—specifically, the study of how numerous organisms form a discrete ecological unit through symbiosis—will be a more impactful strategy to advance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine life. We argue that this approach is instrumental in addressing the threats to marine biodiversity posed by the current global environmental crisis.</p></div>","author":"Raúl A. González-Pech, Vivian Y.
