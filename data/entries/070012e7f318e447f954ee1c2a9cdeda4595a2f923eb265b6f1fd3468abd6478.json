Among the leading candidates for quantum computation, superconducting qubits, particularly those based on transmon designs, have shown promising advances with coherence times reaching hundreds of microseconds [<a href=\"#ozae044.758-B2\">2</a>]. However, to fully unlock the potential of scalable quantum computing, further enhancements in coherence are necessary. The intricate structure-coherence relationship within these devices, especially at critical interfaces such as metal-air, metal-dielectric, and metal-substrate in Josephson junctions (JJs), poses a significant challenge due to the potential for two-level-system loss channels. Here, we detail our pioneering efforts to understand these structure-coherence relationships utilizing advanced electron microscopy techniques. Focusing on the Al-AlOx and Al-Si substrate interfaces in Josephson Junctions, we employ a combination of low-loss and core-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) conducted at room and ultra-low temperatures (sub-6 K). This approach allows for an unprecedented examination of the chemical composition, bonding environments, and nanoscale structures of key surfaces and interfaces critical to the quantum coherence. Figure 1 presents a typical superconducting architecture at the chip level; each superconducting qubit consists of a Josephson Junction in parallel with an ultra-low-loss capacitor to create a resonant structure in the 3-6GHz range. JJs are highlighted in the area boxed in Fig. 1A and can be observed in detail in Fig. 1B.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"070012e7f318e447f954ee1c2a9cdeda4595a2f923eb265b6f1fd3468abd6478","category":"Environment"}
