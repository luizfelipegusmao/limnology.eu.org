This work presents an analysis of the use of EBSD to investigate the microstructure of the AA7050 alloy, exploring aspects such as phase distribution, grain orientation, presence of defects, and phase interactions. Understanding the microstructure of the AA7050 alloy through EBSD is essential for optimizing its performance and developing new processing strategies to meet the increasing demands for more efficient and resistant materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"37f3a80b82596600f45a578f9b70440daf8a4cb4d80e39c193fc9e517d44ab2a","category":"Environment"}
