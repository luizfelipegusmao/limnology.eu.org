{"title":"Comparison of Peptidomes Extracted from Healthy Tissue, Tumour Tissue of the Parotid Glands and Saliva Samples","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1555/v1","date":1719216625000,"content":"Salivary gland tumors are highly variable in clinical presentation and histology. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies 22 types of malignant and 11 types of benign tumors of the salivary glands. Diagnosis of salivary gland tumors is based on imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging) and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, but the final diagnosis is based on histopathological examination of the removed tumor. In this pilot study, we are testing a new approach to identifying peptide biomarkers in saliva that can be used to diagnose salivary gland tumors. The research material for the peptidomic studies was extracts from washings of neoplastic tissues and healthy tissues (control samples). At the same time, saliva samples from patients and healthy individuals were analysed. The comparison of the peptidome composition of tissue extracts and saliva samples may allow the identification of potential peptide markers of salivary gland tumors in patients' saliva. The peptidome composition extracted from 18 tumor and 18 healthy tissue samples, patient (11 samples) and healthy saliva samples (8 samples) was analysed by LC-MS tandem mass spectrometry. A group of 109 peptides were identified that were present only in the tumor tissue extracts and in the patient saliva samples. Some of the identified peptides were derived from proteins previously suggested as potential biomarkers of salivary gland tumors (ANXA1, BPIFA2, FGB, GAPDH, HSPB1, IGHG1, VIM) or tumors of other tissues or organs (SERPINA1, APOA2, CSTB, GSTP1, S100A8, S100A9, TPI1). Unfortunately, none of the identified peptides were present in all samples analysed. This may be due to the high heterogeneity of this type of cancer. The surprising result was that extracts from tumor tissue did not contain peptides derived from salivary gland-specific proteins (STATH, SMR3B, HTN1, HTN3). These results could suggest that the developing tumor suppresses the production of proteins that are essential components of saliva.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6979883f034236af26dc46d26eb26437972db2e067c3ef9efbc958f2b0ebbad6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
