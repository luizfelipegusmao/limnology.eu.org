{"title":"Interpopulation variation in dispersal behavior of fat minnow Rhynchocypris oxycephalus jouyi juveniles inhabiting fragmented habitats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15917?af=R","date":1724758223000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In many organisms, including fishes, downstream dispersal is often phenotype-dependent. Phenotype-dependent downstream dispersal can generate evolutionary pressure via spatial sorting, which non-randomly removes phenotypes enhancing downstream dispersal from upstream populations. Spatial sorting due to downstream dispersal could accumulate in fish populations in above-barrier habitats to which dispersed individuals cannot return, resulting in functional traits that reduce downstream dispersal. This evolutionary mechanism may be more important in smaller above-barrier habitats where downstream emigration occurs over shorter dispersal distances. This study observed the dispersal behavior of fat minnow <i>Rhynchocypris oxycephalus jouyi</i> juveniles in an experimental tank to examine whether juveniles from small above-barrier habitats show more behaviors favorable for reducing downstream dispersal than those from large above-barrier habitats. Juveniles from small above-barrier habitats avoided downstream dispersal for longer durations than those from large above-barrier habitats, but there was no difference in the frequency of ascending attempts. These results support the notion that behavioral traits of juveniles in small above-barrier populations have been refined by spatial sorting to reduce downstream dispersal. The finding that interpopulation variation in dispersal behavior occurred only for certain dispersal directions implies that the behavioral consequences of habitat fragmentation are more complex than previously assumed.</p>","author":"Hiroyuki Yamada","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"dcaa310523da1a2e3d98af766b8d3031bba8356eea873d0cb1e53557d9252748","category":"Environment"}
