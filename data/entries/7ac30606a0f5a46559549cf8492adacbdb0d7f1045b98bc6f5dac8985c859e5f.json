{"title":"CYTOSOLIC INVERTASE2 regulates flowering and reactive oxygen species-triggered programmed cell death in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1110/7712421?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cytosolic invertase (CIN) in plants hydrolyzes sucrose into fructose and glucose, influencing flowering time and organ development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Through expressional, genetic, and histological analyses, we identified a substantially role of SlCIN2 (localized in mitochondria) in regulating flowering and pollen development in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>). The overexpression of <span>SlCIN2</span> resulted in increased hexose accumulation and decreased sucrose and starch content. Our findings indicated that SlCIN2 interacts with Sucrose transporter2 (SlSUT2) to inhibit the sucrose transport activity of SlSUT2, thereby suppressing sucrose content in flower buds and delaying flowering. We found that higher levels of glucose in <span>SlCIN2-</span>overexpressing anthers result in the accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby disrupting programmed cell death (PCD) in anthers and delaying the end of tapetal degradation. Exogenous sucrose partially restored fertility in <span>SlCIN2-</span>overexpressing plants. This study revealed the mechanism by which <span>SlCIN2</span> regulates pollen development and demonstrated a strategy for creating sugar-regulated gene male sterility lines for tomato hybrid seed production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7ac30606a0f5a46559549cf8492adacbdb0d7f1045b98bc6f5dac8985c859e5f","category":"Environment"}
