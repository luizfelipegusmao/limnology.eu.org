{"title":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis, or as Therapeutics Molecules in Neurodegenerative Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0366/v1","date":1712218363000,"content":"Neurodegenerative diseases that include Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), arise due to numerous causes like protein accumulation and autoimmunity, characterized by neurologic depletion which lead to incapacity in normal physiological function such as thinking and movement in these patients. Glial cells perform a critical role in protective neuronal function; in the case of neuroinflammation, glial cell dysfunction can promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases. MiRNA participates in gene regulation and plays a vital role in many biological processes in the body; in the central nervous system (CNS), it can play an essential part in neural maturation and differentiation. In neurodegenerative diseases, miRNA dysregulation occurs, enhancing the development of these diseases. In this review, we discuss neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS)) and how miRNA is preserved as a diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic agent in these disorders. Finally, we highlighted miRNA as therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"893c1cfe3778e213aef6e7b0825235a67126066b07a3fa0339af10c4a8698f86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
