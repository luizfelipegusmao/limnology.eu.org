{"title":"A Roadmap for the Certification of Polyurethane Flexible Connectors Used as Envelope Products in the Next Generation of Healthy, Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1757/v1","date":1729660607000,"content":"Currently, in Europe, producers of building materials are implementing innovative solutions that provide a chance for the widespread construction of zero-emission and zero-energy build-ings. However, they encounter legal barriers related to the lack of standardization procedures enabling the rapid placing of innovative construction products on the market. The European project Horizon 2020: Measuring Envelope products and systems contributing to the next gener-ation of healthy nearly Zero Energy Buildings (MEZeroE), is to support producers of innovative envelope products used in zero-energy buildings, including in the field of certification, CE marking and placing them relatively quickly on the market.\nThe article presents one of the research procedures developed and tested by Pilot Measurement &amp; Verification Lines (PM&amp;VL7) as part of the MEZeroE project for FLEX&amp;ROBUST polyurethane flexible connectors. This procedure takes into account applicable legal requirements regarding CE marking and also indicates a certification path for this type of products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3602a1e4acb058bb1ccff01b69d9435c3531e0f580b2e734657c6f6259603c55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
