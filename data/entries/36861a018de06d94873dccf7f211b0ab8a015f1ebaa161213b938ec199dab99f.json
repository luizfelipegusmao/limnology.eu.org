{"title":"Job burnout, cognitive functioning, and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression among hospital Mexican nurses","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304092","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Nadia Yanet Cortés-Álvarez, Alfredo Lara-Morales, Elizabeth Bautista-Rodríguez, Leticia Gabriela Marmolejo-Murillo, Alejandra Díaz Jiménez, Lourdes Alejandra Vergara Hernández, Monserrat Fernández Moya, César Rubén Vuelvas-Olmos</p>\r\nAim <p>To analyze the relationship between burnout syndrome, cognitive functions, and sBDNF (Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor) in Mexican nurses.</p> Method <p>A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. This study target staff nurses working in hospitals in Guanajuato, México. Demographic and working condition data were collected via questionnaire. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to evaluate burnout. A blood sample were collected and processed by ELISA technique to measure sBDNF. Finally, the General Cognitive Assessment (CAB) of the Cognifit© neuropsychological battery was used to evaluated cognitive functions.</p> Results <p>Findings showed that there are sociodemographic characteristics and working conditions associated with burnout syndrome among nurses. Furthermore, the data demonstrated a significant decrease in sBDNF levels in burnout nurses and a negative correlation between BDNF levels and burnout syndrome. Additionally, these burnout nurse also revealed significant cognitive impairment in reasoning, memory, and attention as well as total scores of CAB. Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between sBDNF levels and the cognitive deficits in burnout nurse.</p> Conclusion <p>Reduced BDNF levels could be a biological indicator or part of the pathological process of burnout, which could affect cognitive abilities. Reduced cognitive function in nurses has relevant implications and emphasizes the need for specialized preventive strategies because nurses make clinical decisions concerning their patients, whose situations are constantly changing.</p>","author":"Nadia Yanet Cortés-Álvarez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"36861a018de06d94873dccf7f211b0ab8a015f1ebaa161213b938ec199dab99f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
