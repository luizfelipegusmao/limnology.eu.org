{"title":"Emerging Trends in Flavonoid Research: Advances in Understanding and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1309/v1","date":1726627451000,"content":"Flavonoids are secondary plant metabolites involved in biological activity that are present in plentiful proportions in many plant origin foods and beverages. Owing to their chemical difference and qualities that make them beneficial for human health, they have received a lot of focus in research. This review therefore presents an account on the chemical structure of flavonoids, food sources and their metabolism with emphasis on bioavailability. And they also examine their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cardiovascular protective, neuroprotective, and antimicrobial properties and reveal related molecular processes. In addition, it overviews the clinical data concerning their possible use in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Some of the problems that attend current flavonoid research are also dealt with; such issues as variation in the bioactivity of flavonoids and scarcity of clinical studies. This review is designed to present current state of knowledge and to provoke further research concerning the further potential of flavonoids in enhancing human health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02875a4c7912b1eb37fc4cb491211425ee16a0753b0e6b566645fa9b8f3d61b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
