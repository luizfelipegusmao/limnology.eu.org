In the present study off stoichiometric Heusler alloys with nominal composition Χ<sub>50</sub>Υ<sub>25+x</sub>Ζ<sub>25-x</sub> (X = Ni; Y = Mn; Z = Sn; <i>x</i> = 13,14) were prepared by arc melting followed by thermal treatment. Structural properties were analyzed with X-ray diffraction at room temperature (RT) and at elevated temperatures, above the martensite – austenite transition area, in order to determine the relevant crystallographic parameters and observe the transition. Martensite stabilization at RT appears to be a challenge, coexistence of martensite – austenite phases was observed and calculated for both 38-12 and 39-11 (16% and 12% austenite respectively). Magnetization measurements versus temperature and field were recorded in the areas of interest where 1<sup>st</sup> order transitions were expected (355 K for <i>x</i>=13 and 408 K for <i>x</i>=14), and the magnetic entropy's changes (ΔS<sub>m</sub>) were determined (0.4 (J/kgK) for <i>x</i>=13 and 0.3 J/(kgK) for <i>x</i>=14; H<sub>max</sub>=1T). The complex character of the magnetic properties and their dependence on Mn-Sn ratio and on the distance between Mn atoms is discussed. The structure and the lattice parameters were determined using an anisotropic strain broadening model; stress and strain were detected in the structure due to crystal phase coexistence.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
