{"title":"Eletrospun Nanofiber Dopped with TiO2 and Carbon Quantum Dots for the Photocatalytic Degradation of Antibiotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2308/v1","date":1727599478000,"content":"Novel photocatalysts were synthesized through the association of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with commercial (P25) titanium dioxide (TiO2) by sonication. The resulting TiO2/CQDs compo-site was then incorporated into the polyamide 66 (PA66) biopolymer nanofibers using the elec-trospinning technique, considering a composite nanoparticles-to-polymer ratio of 1:2 in the elec-trospinning precursor solution. The produced nanofibers presented suitable morphology and were tested for the photocatalytic degradation under simulated solar radiation of 10 mg/L of amoxicillin (AMX) and sulfadiazine (SDZ), in phosphate buffer solution (pH 8.06) and river wa-ter, using 1.5 g/L of photocatalyst. The presence of the photocatalyst increased the removal of AMX in phosphate buffer solution by 30 times, reducing the AMX degradation half-life time from 62 ± 1 h (without catalyst) to 1.98 ± 0.06 h. Moreover, SDZ degradation half-life time in phosphate buffer solution was reduced from 5.4 ± 0.1 h (without catalyst) to 1.87 ± 0.05 h in the presence of the photocatalyst. Furthermore, the PA66/TiO2/CQDs were also efficient in river wa-ter samples, and maintained their performance in at least three cycles of SDZ photodegradation in river water. The presented results evidence that the produced photocatalyst can be a promis-ing and sustainable solution for antibiotics’ efficient removal from water.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"024ab49e50b087c651ee42f503a93e1f1fbc6a7a24ee841b9d55e560c186394f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
