{"title":"A Study of Underground Pipeline System: Holistic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2153/v1","date":1724981751000,"content":"Pipes have been utilized since ancient times and have seen significant renewal, modification, and replacement to improve their effectiveness and efficiency in the modern era. As early as 4000 BC, Egyptians used clay pipes for drainage systems. The U.S. has the largest network of energy pipelines in the world. The ASCE 2017 Infrastructure Report Card assigned grades of D and D+ to water and wastewater pipelines, highlighting a substantial need for improvement. The paper investigates the infrastructure required for the sustainability of pipeline systems, as well as the construction of underground systems using both open-trench and trenchless technologies, along with the associated risks in the US. It concludes that trenchless methods are increasingly preferred for pipeline construction due to technological advancements, reduced surface disruptions, shorter construction times, and lower social costs. Tackling this challenge will necessitate strategic investment, decisive leadership, thorough planning, and meticulous preparation for future demands. Enhancing pipeline infrastructure can stimulate the U.S. economy, whereas postponing action will lead to higher costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7696f3c6ce5ac2f8b29d2704951289332bd35d0bf29ef3dbdf5b1349753edde4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
