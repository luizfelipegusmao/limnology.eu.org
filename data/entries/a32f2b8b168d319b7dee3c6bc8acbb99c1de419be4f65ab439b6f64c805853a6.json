{"title":"Exploring a Right to Submit Environmental Information Under International Environmental Law","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jel/article/35/3/401/7246364?rss=1","date":1692403200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Discussions on how the public engages with environmental information within environmental governance matters are primarily centred around the supply of environmental information to the public by the state. However, this focus downplays the importance of environmental information held by members of the public and the difficulties that individuals can experience when submitting such information to the state outside formal environmental decision-making procedures. This article examines the benefits of guaranteeing a general right to submit environmental information before considering the extent to which environmental law, specifically the Aarhus Convention, supports the creation of such a right. The article then concludes by constructing a hypothetical regime to implement the proposed right, identifying how the proposed right can be balanced against the needs of the state and points of divergence between this hypothetical regime and the current environmental information regime set out in the Aarhus Convention.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Environmental Law Current Issue","siteHash":"d0caeee440a105ac55789e8609e0b01f5d84cefdaed670832b152a3f460f0e91","entryHash":"a32f2b8b168d319b7dee3c6bc8acbb99c1de419be4f65ab439b6f64c805853a6","category":"Environment"}
