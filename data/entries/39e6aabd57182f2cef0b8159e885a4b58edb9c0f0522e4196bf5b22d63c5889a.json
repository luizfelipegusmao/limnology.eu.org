Effectiveness of stocking should involve marking and evaluating growth and survival of juveniles. Chemical marking with alizarin red S (ARS) was evaluated to establish optimal ARS staining approaches for juvenile sterlet. Bathing in a 100–200 mg l<sup>−1</sup> ARS concentration for 12 h had no affect on fish mortality or growth. Use of a green laser on the upper five external structures (dorsal, lateral, and ventral scutes and rostral and anal plates) allowed easy detection for at least a year. Simultaneous use of multiple external structures was effective for distinguishing stocked from wild fish without harm or sacrifice. We conclude that ARS staining enabled a cost-effective, quick, and labour-nonintensive way to mark sterlet, with a high-field detectability and minimal previous experience required.</p>","author":"Martin Šindler, \nMiloš Buřič, \nMartin Plesch, \nPavel Franta, \nBořek Drozd","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"39e6aabd57182f2cef0b8159e885a4b58edb9c0f0522e4196bf5b22d63c5889a","category":"Environment"}
