Inadequate management has led to a decline in water quality and a mismatch between the availability and usage of city water resources. In this period of significant growth, improving urban water efficiency and reinforcing water resource protection are especially important. Leadership is essential in developing and carrying out urban water resource policies. This research investigates how leadership influences the operational efficiency of water resources protection policies. The study seeks to fill the gap in understanding the relationship between leadership, member trust, and policy effectiveness in water resource management by constructing a theoretical model and conducting empirical analysis through questionnaire surveys. The findings of this study are expected to provide valuable insights into the significance of leadership in driving improvements in water conservation policies. By establishing a link between leadership, member trust, and operational efficiency, the research contributes to both theoretical knowledge and practical implications for enhancing water resource management strategies.</p>","author":"Meng Meng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resource Modeling: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3719477483f67b16afdbb60e07461dbbb5827188dd5d72806069fb36caa95c59","entryHash":"68ea1fc3be79bf892479fad68df8cac41588ff1e657253df62373e3790038a6f","category":"Environment"}
