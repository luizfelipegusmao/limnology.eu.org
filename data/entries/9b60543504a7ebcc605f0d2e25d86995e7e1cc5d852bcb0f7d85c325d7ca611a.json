{"title":"Illustrating land cover change associated with erosion management of the Little Blue River, Kansas, USA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.59?af=R","date":1703089729000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Erosion is a concern due to environmental degradation, loss of valuable cropland, increased sediment loads in aquatic systems, and reduced reservoir capacity. To manage erosion, riparian forest buffers and bendway weirs were installed in the Little Blue River, Kansas, during years 2002–2010. To illustrate land cover changes associated with management for upland and streambank erosion, indicated through terrestrial land gains, particularly of permanent tree cover relative to short-lived crop cover, we digitized 1 m orthoimagery. For the pretreatment interval of 1991–2002, we digitized streambank edges to approximate change in river area. Due to river dynamics, for the 2002 and 2014 interval before and after treatment, we used land ownership parcels as fixed locations to assess changes in land area and land classes for 24 treated and 24 untreated parcels, each parcel group totaling 1575 ha. We appraised two extents of the unified streambank for both years and all land in parcels rather than isolating the river from the surrounding watershed. During 1991 to 2002, treated land parcels lost terrestrial land, whereas untreated land parcels gained land. During 2002–2014, treated land had greater river and crop cover, and less tree cover than untreated land. For the entire extent, with similar trends for the unified streambank extent, by 2014, treated parcels gained 27.3 ha of terrestrial land compared to 4.6 ha gained by untreated parcels. Gains occurred in tree cover and losses in river water and sediments cover. In treated parcels crop cover decreased, whereas in untreated parcels crop cover increased. Streamflows decreased over time, likely contributing to streambank stability. Despite lack of documented cost-share agreements, in untreated parcels, landowners managed land by increasing tree cover to protect soil from erosion. All measurements were consistent with erosion followed by management for erosion through terrestrial land gains of tree cover.</p>","author":"Brice B.
