Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions in many inflammatory diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of GSPE in UC using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse UC model and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage model. In this study, we found that the GSPE markedly prevented DSS-induced weight loss and colon length shortening in UC mice. Further investigations showed that GSPE significantly attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and elevated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the colon tissues and serum of DSS-induced colitis mice by suppressing NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells was also reversed by GSPE. Taken together, our results confirm that GSPE can ameliorate inflammatory response in experimental colitis via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway. This study advances the research progress on a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel diseases.</p>","author":"Lei Chu, \nShaoru Zhang, \nWeidong Wu, \nYuqing Gong, \nZhenshi Chen, \nYanting Wen, \nYong Wang, \nLihui Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"80b66234d1d46884bdbbdf7c39058662b36e3442c9bbd983f5bd64f7cd92d3a7","category":"Environment"}
