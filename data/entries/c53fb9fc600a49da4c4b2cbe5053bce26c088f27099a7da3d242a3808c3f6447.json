{"title":"In Vitro Evaluation of Surface Roughness and Color Variation after Two Brushing Protocols with Toothpastes Containing Different Whitening Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1201/v1","date":1713441765000,"content":"The aim was to evaluate the effect of different whitening toothpastes on the enamel surface roughness and color variation. Twenty-four molars were sectioned and divided into eight groups (n = 3), considering the two factors under study: toothpaste type (Colgate® Total Original, Oral B® 3D White Luxe Perfection, Curaprox® Black is White, and Signal® White Now) and brushing protocol (short-term and a long-term). Surface roughness was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and color change (ΔE) was measured using the CIE L*a*b* system. Data were statistically analyzed using comparative parametric tests at a 5% significance level. In the short-term protocol, only the Signal® White Now toothpaste increased surface roughness (p = 0.038) compared to the Colgate® Total Original group. No significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed in surface roughness in the long-term protocol. Regarding color variation, no statistically significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed in either protocol. Overall, the whitening toothpastes did not affect enamel surface roughness or color, except for Signal® White Now causing increased roughness in the short-term protocol. However, all toothpastes induced a visual change in color.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c53fb9fc600a49da4c4b2cbe5053bce26c088f27099a7da3d242a3808c3f6447","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
