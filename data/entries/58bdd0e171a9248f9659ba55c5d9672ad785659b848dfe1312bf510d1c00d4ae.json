{"title":"Administrative management and service quality in the dental offices within the context of an upper middle-income country","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307773","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Miriam Maribel Ramírez Altamirano, Luis Alexander Orrego-Ferreyros</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examined the correlation between administrative management and service quality in dental offices in an upper middle-income country. An applied research approach with an observational, cross-sectional, and exploratory design was used. The sample included 100 patients aged 18 and older from dental offices in Peru, during 2023. Convenience sampling was employed. Spearman correlation and linear regression analyses were conducted. Results showed a positive and moderately strong correlation between administrative management and service quality (Spearman’s rho = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001). Effective organizing (β = 2.11, p &lt; 0.001) and controlling (β = 1.58, p = 0.034) in administrative management were significantly associated with improved service quality. The study concludes that better administrative management positively impacts the quality of service in dental offices.","author":"Miriam Maribel Ramírez Altamirano","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"58bdd0e171a9248f9659ba55c5d9672ad785659b848dfe1312bf510d1c00d4ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
