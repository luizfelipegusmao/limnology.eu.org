{"title":"Determination of Microplastics in Omega-3 Oil Supplements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0185/v1","date":1712047150000,"content":"The ubiquitous presence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment poses a threat to ecosystems and increases concerns about their exposure to the human body. However, despite being consumed for health improvement, limited research has been conducted on MPs in functional foods. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of MPs and the relation of the source of raw material or the manufacture in various omega-3 oil in the Korean market. MPs in omega-3 capsule and raw oil, sourced from both plant-based (PB) and animal-based (AB) sources, were investigated. We developed the method by direct filtration with acetone washing and analyzed MPs greater than 5 μm using microscope-Raman spectroscopy. The average number of MPs was found to be 1.2 ± 1.7 MPs/g for PB raw oil, 2.2 ± 1.7 MPs/g for AB raw oil, 3.5 ± 3.9 MPs/g for PB capsule oil, and 10.6 ± 8.9 MPs/g for AB capsule oil. Polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate were major specious (83-95 %) found in omega-3 oil. The ratio of size range remained consistent across all groups, with a trend of higher detection rates as the size diminished. The results reveal that the main reason of MPs contamination is not the source of raw material but the manufacturing and packaging process for omega-3 oil.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d913d2d41fe326d54fa35c46a8b139af8c738c992911082bce691d4dd6a8ab47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
