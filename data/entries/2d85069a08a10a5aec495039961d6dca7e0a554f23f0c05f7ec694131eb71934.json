R.</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Pregnancy exerts a detrimental effect on womenâ€™s mental health. Maternal mental health is considered as one of the public health concerns as it impacts the health of both mother and the child. One in five people in developing countries experience serious mental health issues during pregnancy and after giving birth. In India, postpartum depression (PPD) affects 22% of women, according to a research by WHO. The available data on mental health literacy among women, showed that only 50.7% of the postpartum mothers who were attending paediatric tertiary care centres had adequate knowledge about PPD. It is crucial to diagnose early and adequately manage postpartum depression to avoid long-term consequences. It is also essential to seek help and utilise the available resources and services to avoid worsening of the condition and to aid in the recovery. This demonstrates the need to promote awareness, improve help seeking, reduce stigma and treatment gap associated with PPD through educational video intervention specific to cultural context and beliefs.</p> Materials and methods <p>This is a quasi-experimental study without a control group that attempts to improve the awareness among the mothers about postpartum depression to understand better about the condition and also its management through video intervention. The video intervention will be developed in regional language specific to the cultural context of the setting. The video script will be finalised from the findings of the available literature and also through focus group discussion among mothers and health care professionals which will be analysed qualitatively using thematic identification. The study will use a standardized Postpartum Depression Literacy Scale (PoDLIS) which will be quantitatively analysed using paired t test before and after the intervention. Repeated measures of ANOVA will also be used to analyse the changes in literacy scale scores with respect to socio demographic variables. The mothers will also be screened for PPD using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ 9) and feedback will be collected and analysed to find the overall usefulness of video.</p> Discussion <p>If it becomes apparent that this video intervention is successful in raising awareness of PPD among postpartum mothers and reducing stigma, it can be used to aid early identification of mothers with PPD which can result in early management and improved health outcome for both mothers and children. The major goals of the video intervention are to raise awareness, lessen stigma, and prevent PPD through strong family support, adopting healthy lifestyles, having access to information, practising self-care, and enhancing help-seeking.</p> Trial registration <p>The trial is registered under the Clinical Trial Registry- India (CTRI) (CTRI/2023/03/050836). The current study adheres to the SPIRIT Guidelines [See S1 Checklist: SPIRIT Guidelines].</p>","author":"Latha K.","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2d85069a08a10a5aec495039961d6dca7e0a554f23f0c05f7ec694131eb71934","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
