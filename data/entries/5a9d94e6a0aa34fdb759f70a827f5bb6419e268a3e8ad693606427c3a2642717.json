{"title":"Mapping and Omics Integration: Towards Precise Rice Disease Resistance Breeding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0425/v1","date":1712322108000,"content":"Rice, as a staple crop feeding billions, faces constant threats from various diseases jeopardizing global food security. Precise understanding of disease resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing resilient rice varieties. Traditional genetic mapping methods, such as QTL mapping, provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of diseases. However, the complex nature of rice diseases demands a holistic approach to gain accurate knowledge of it. Omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, enable a comprehensive analysis of biological molecules, uncovering intricate molecular interactions within the rice plant. Integration of various mapping techniques using multi-omics data has revolutionized our understanding of rice disease resistance. By overlaying genetic maps with high-throughput omics datasets, researchers can pinpoint specific genes, proteins, or metabolites associated with disease resistance. This integration enhances the precision of disease-related biomarkers with better understanding of their functional roles in disease resistance. Improvement of rice breeding for disease resistance through this integration represents a significant stride in agricultural science because better understanding of the molecular intricacies and interactions underlying disease resistance architecture leads to more precise and efficient development of resilient and productive rice varieties. In this review, we explore how the integration of mapping and omics data can give a transformative impact on rice breeding for enhancing disease resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a9d94e6a0aa34fdb759f70a827f5bb6419e268a3e8ad693606427c3a2642717","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
