{"title":"Comparison of Different Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Methods Based on a Severe Rainfall Event in Tuscany, Italy, November 2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1355/v1","date":1726628150000,"content":"Accurate Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) is fundamental for a large number of hydrometeorological applications, especially when addressing extreme rainfall phenomena. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of various rainfall estimation methods, specifically those relying on weather radar data, rain gauge data, and their fusion. The study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of each method in estimating rainfall for a severe event that occurred in Tuscany, Italy. The obtained results indicate that merging radar and rain gauge data outperform both individual approaches by reducing errors and improving the overall reliability of precipitation estimates. The study highlights the importance of data fusion in enhancing the accuracy of QPE and also supports its application in operational contexts, providing evidence for the greater reliability of merging methods","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30f2a17db7c9d694dd20f02a45a0b038870b663fb10ead3e054ba46033be1489","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
