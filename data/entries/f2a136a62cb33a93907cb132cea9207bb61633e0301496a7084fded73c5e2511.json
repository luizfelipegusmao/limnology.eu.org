{"title":"Interlaminar Fracture Toughness Enhancement of Fine Short Fibre Z-pin Reinforced Carbon Fibre Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1404/v1","date":1713835030000,"content":"In the history of high-performance polymer composite parts with continuous in-plane fibre reinforcement, the comparatively moderate structural-mechanical properties in their out-of- plane-z-direction and the limited load carrying capability between individual reinforcement layers within the laminated structures have always been one of the greatest challenges. Plenty of research work has been carried out to improve load transfer capability as well as fracture toughness for crack opening events between the reinforcement layers by means of out-of-plane fibre reinforcement implementation, for example by sewing or z-pinning technologies. However, the results have not become established across a wide range of applications so far, because the technologies used have led to considerable losses of in-plane strength properties. In this paper first results are presented for a new method of a low fraction z-fibre reinforcement by means of very thin diameter laser drilled holes filled with short carbon fibres, demonstrating potential to improve Mode II fracture toughness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2a136a62cb33a93907cb132cea9207bb61633e0301496a7084fded73c5e2511","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
