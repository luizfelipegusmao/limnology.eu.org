{"title":"Synergic Origin and Evolution of TDS, Mg and Fluoride in Groundwater As Relative to Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0803/v1","date":1715575636000,"content":"The rural population in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka is largely affected by Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown etiology (CKDu). According to the multidisciplinary research carried out so far, quality of groundwater was considered one of the possible causative factors for CKDu. Therefore, the assessment of water quality variations and evolution mechanism of water quality parameters of drinking water sources is important for identifying any relationships between CKDu and the drinking water quality. The current study aimed to perform a detailed hydrogeochemical investigation using isotopic and chemical methods on selected groundwater sources in the CKDu-endemic, non-endemic and control areas. \nTDS, hardness, Mg2+, Na+ and F- are the main parameters that cause water quality deterioration but, their derived mechanism in these three regions are completely different. The excess concentrations of F- and Mg2+ in the CKDu endemic area, low F- and high Mg2+in the CKDu non-endemic sedimentary formation, and either combinations of low F- and low Mg2+, high F- and low Mg2+ or low F- with high Mg2+ in the control area are the distinct features. \nThe primary processes that regulate the evolution of groundwater types in CKDu endemic and control area is the weathering of silicates. Similarly, in the CKDu endemic area, carbonate dissolution and reverse ion exchange are prominent. Cation exchange and evaporite dissolution are more pronounced in the control area. Shallow groundwaters are evapo-concentrated hence it further deteriorates quality when compared to the deep groundwater with non-mixed, non-evaporated, and higher elevation recharge effect (from 100 m altitude) in the CKDu endemic area. Dilution decreases the ion content in the CKDu endemic area while evaporite dissolution further increase it in the control area after the rainy season. Evaporation, and seawater mixing affected the quality of groundwater in the non-endemic sedimentary formation. \nA statistically significant difference of F- ionic ratio with Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ in the endemic and control areas. Intense rock weathering combined with the desorption added excess F- to the groundwater in the CKDu endemic area while the cation exchange and fluorite dissolution is contributing factor in CKDu control area.\nAll the groundwater samples analyzed have exceeded the moderate hardness threshold. However, prominent Mg hardness proportion together with excess F- in the CKDu endemic area may produce nephrotoxic MgF2 complexes that may trigger renal damage. In contrast, produced NaF complexes in the CKDu control area leads to reduction of F- toxicity in the human body.\nTherefore, increased levels of magnesium, fluoride and TDS in the shallow groundwater, along with geochemical, hydrogeological and climatic factors, may contribute to the CKDu in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b01d903cfda68396b684f7919d386f1172c9638e0770f2adc0dcfb09211f5b54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
