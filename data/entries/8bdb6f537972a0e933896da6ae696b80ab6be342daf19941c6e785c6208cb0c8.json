{"title":"Exploring mental health services for youth experiencing homelessness in East Asia Pacific regions: A systematic scoping review.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1371/v1","date":1716288883000,"content":"Background: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) in East Asia Pacific (EAP) represent one of the most at-risk populations due to cultural and geographical factors. Effective mental health interventions, primarily researched in Western contexts, may not fully apply to YEH in EAP. Their lack of stable shelter, disrupted social networks, and limited access to mental health services elevate their susceptibility to adverse mental health, making urgent interventions essential to address their needs. Objective: To explore and provide systematic evidence on the types of mental health services and interventions for YEH in EAP and their impact on overall quality of life and wellbeing. Methods: Electronic databases(e.g., Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus) were systematically searched(publication dates between 01/01/1990-13/05/2023), as well as additional online resources specific to homelessness. Articles were screened, and a critical appraisal assessed the quality of the included studies. Results: Eight studies with different interventions were identified in Indonesia(n = 2), Malaysia(n = 1), South Korea(n = 3), and The Philippines(n = 1). These were thematically clustered into six categories: art, cognitive behavioural therapy, life skills education, resilience enhancement, family strengthening and government interventions/services. Conclusion: This review highlights effective mental health interventionsâ€™ positive impact on YEH mental health outcomes and quality of life in EAP, stressing the urgent need to implement socio-culturally sensitive services. Future research should address knowledge gaps through comprehensive studies covering diverse EAP regions and populations, prioritising socio-culturally specific psychological measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8bdb6f537972a0e933896da6ae696b80ab6be342daf19941c6e785c6208cb0c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
