{"title":"Occurrence and eco‐toxicological risk assessment of primary aromatic amines in hookah wastewater","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14466?af=R","date":1724734785000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study was conducted for the first time to discern the levels of primary aromatic amines (PAAs) in hookah wastewater resulting from the consumption of fruit-flavored and traditional tobacco. The ecological risk of PAAs laden hookah wastewater and its toxic effects on crustaceans and fish have also been evaluated. The mean concentrations of PAAs in hookah wastewater resulting from consumption of Al-Mahmoud, Al-Ayan, Al-Fakher, and Mazaya brands were 1075.56, 1033.25, 986.94, and 946.58 ng/L, respectively, while it was determined as 355.91 ng/L in traditional tobacco. The concentration of PAAs in the hookah wastewater of fruit-flavored tobacco was significantly higher than the traditional one (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Aniline (ANL) had the maximum level in hookah wastewater from fruit-flavored (679.83–802.50 ng/L) and traditional (316.53 ng/L) tobacco consumption. The RQ value of the mean concentration of PAAs in hookah wastewater for all samples was in the range of medium to low-risk (RQ &lt; 1). In addition to PAAs, other dangerous chemicals in hookah wastewater can increase its ecological and health risk, so it is necessary to manage such wastewater before discharging it into the environment.</p>","author":"Gholamreza Heydari, \nMahbubeh Tangestani, \nFarshid Soleimani, \nBahman Ramavandi, \nFarshad Bahrami Asl, \nRoshana Rashidi, \nHossein Arfaeinia","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"42ae1646af67156141a73339ad3c86eab3e236b5bf7fe3fe9181e3180ceae4dd","category":"Environment"}
