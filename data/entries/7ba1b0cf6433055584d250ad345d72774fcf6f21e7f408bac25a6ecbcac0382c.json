{"title":"Exploring the Application of Wearable Technologies in Creating Emotional Connections Between Human Brands and Customers: An Exploratory Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0250/v1","date":1728021724000,"content":"This exploratory study investigates the role of wearable technologies in fostering emotional connections between human brands and customers. Given the rapid growth of the wearable technology market and the increasing importance of emotional connections in marketing, this research aims to uncover the potential of these technologies in strengthening the affective bond between brands and consumers. The mixed-method approach included semi-structured in-depth interviews with 25 marketing experts and an online survey of 300 consumers. Data analysis was conducted using thematic coding and statistical tests including Pearson correlation and multiple regression. Results indicated that wearable technologies can enhance emotional connections through personalized interactions (r=0.72, p&lt;0.001), creating a sense of proximity (β=0.65, p&lt;0.01), and facilitating two-way communications (β=0.58, p&lt;0.01). These findings offer new perspectives for marketing strategies and customer relationship management in the digital age, highlighting the potential of wearable technologies as a powerful tool for building and maintaining emotional bonds between human brands and their audiences. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on technology-mediated brand relationships and provides practical implications for marketers seeking to leverage wearable technologies in their brand communication strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ba1b0cf6433055584d250ad345d72774fcf6f21e7f408bac25a6ecbcac0382c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
