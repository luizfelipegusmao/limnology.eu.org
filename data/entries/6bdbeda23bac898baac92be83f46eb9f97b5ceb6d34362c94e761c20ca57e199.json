A review of Pleistocene Balanidae of northern Central Europe","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3603?af=R","date":1708447864000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The bay barnacle <i>Amphibalanus improvisus</i> (Darwin, 1854) has been found in Northern Germany in brackish marine sediments of the Holsteinian interglacial. Whereas the cause of the contemporary distribution of this species is anthropogenic and there is evidence that it has resulted mainly from shipping, the fossil findings demonstrate that <i>A. improvisus</i> had also already reached Europe naturally during the Pleistocene in Europe, probably via the Gulf Stream system of the Atlantic. Today, <i>A. improvisus</i> is considered one of the most successful aquatic invasive species worldwide and it is characterized by a high environmental tolerance. The ingression of the Holsteinian Sea, during the Pleistocene, took place during the climate optimum from the North Sea into the ‘Elbe Estuary’ through the Hamburg region and far to the south-east into Brandenburg. It has been possible to reconstruct the palaeo-ecological conditions based in particular on molluscs. Accordingly, environmental conditions ranged from normal marine in the north, via brackish in the transitional area to limnic–fluviatile in the Berlin region. The morphological features of the bay barnacles and their ecological parameters are described here in detail. In addition, we provide a general review of the known Pleistocene Balanidae in northern central Europe.</p>","author":"Stefan Meng, \nJaqueline Strahl, \nAndreas Börner, \nKay Krienke, \nMICHAEL L.
