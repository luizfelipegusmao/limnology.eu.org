{"title":"Alpha-boswellic acid accelerates acute wound healing via NF-κB signaling pathway","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308028","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Fang Dong, Lijuan Zheng, Xuanfen Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Boswellic acids (BAs) showed promising effects in cancer treatment, immune response regulation, and anti-inflammatory therapy. We aimed to assess the roles of alpha-BA (α-BA) in treating acute wound healing.</p> Methods <p>In vivo wound-healing models were established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of α-BA. Cell assays were conducted to assess the impact of α-BA on cellular biological functions. Western blot analysis was employed to validate the potential mechanisms of action of α-BA.</p> Results <p>Animal models indicated that wound healing was notably accelerated in the α-BA group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.01). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay preliminarily suggested that α-BA may accelerate wound healing by inhibiting excessive inflammatory reactions and increasing the protein levels of growth factors. Cell function experiments demonstrated that α-BA suppressed the proliferation and migration ability of human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFBs), thereby favoring wound healing. Additionally, α-BA exerted a significant impact on cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, the protein levels of key genes in nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling pathway, including cyclin D1, p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα, were downregulated by α-BA.</p> Conclusions <p>α-BA demonstrated the ability to counteract the abnormal proliferation of skin scar tissues, consequently expediting wound healing. These findings suggest its potential for development as a new agent for treating acute wound healing.</p>","author":"Fang Dong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"40b6e8bda336221a8439301cce48203a8a3967bf3ea4a4bda253a3a75cef044d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
