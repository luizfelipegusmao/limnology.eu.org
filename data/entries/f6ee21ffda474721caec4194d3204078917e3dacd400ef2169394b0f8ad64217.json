{"title":"Case Report: Pulmonary Vein Stenosis 2 Years Following Catheter Ablation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0874/v1","date":1726037515000,"content":"This case report demonstrates the rare but potentially serious complication of pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) diagnosed several years after radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary vein stenosis can remain asymptomatic until significant occlusion occurs, after which it can present with a variety of symptoms, mimicking numerous cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies. Early diagnosis and treatment rely on consistent follow-up using appropriate diagnostic imaging modalities, which are paramount in preventing severe complications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6ee21ffda474721caec4194d3204078917e3dacd400ef2169394b0f8ad64217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
