{"title":"Risk Management and Assessment Hybrid Framework for Business Process Reengineering Projects: Application in Auto-Motive Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0094/v1","date":1717415320000,"content":"This study introduces an integrated method for managing process risks in a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) project, using Robust Data Envelopment Analysis (RDEA) and machine learning (ML). The goal is to prioritize risks based on three standard factors of PFMEA: Severity, Occurrence, and Detection (S-O-D), and incorporating two additional factors (Breakdown Cost and Breakdown Duration) seen as undesirable outputs. The model also accounts for the effect of uncertainty on expert-estimated values by applying disturbance percentages in the linear PFMEA-RDEA model. A machine learning model is proposed to predict new values if partial or total modifications have been made to the processes. The approach was implemented in an au-tomotive sector company, and the results showed the impact of uncertainty on values by com-paring different approaches such as RPN, PFMEA-DEA, and PFMEA-RDEA. A new reduced risk categorization was achieved, who allowed for decision-makers to focus on necessary actions for reengineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6476f300706b8e6182ee9ae5dd291543499d84f0218b4bbd47a69b5a8563e71a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
