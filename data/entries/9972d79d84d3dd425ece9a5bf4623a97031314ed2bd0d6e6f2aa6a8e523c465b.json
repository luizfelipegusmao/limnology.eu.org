{"title":"Photocatalytic Reactions over TiO2-Based Interfacial Charge Transfer Complexes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0899/v1","date":1728636438000,"content":"The present review is related to the novel approach for improvement of the optical properties of wide bandgap metal oxides, in particular TiO2, based on the formation of the inorganic-organic hybrids that display absorption in the visible spectral range due to the formation of interfacial charge transfer (ICT) complexes. We outlined the property requirements of TiO2-based ICT complexes for efficient photo-induced catalytic reactions, emphasizing the simplicity of the synthetic procedure, the possibility of the fine-tuning of the optical properties supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and the formation of a covalent linkage between inorganic and organic components of hybrids, i.e., the nature of the interface. In addition, this study provides a comprehensive insight into potential applications of TiO2-based ICT complexes in photo-driven catalytic reactions (water splitting and degradation of organic molecules), including the identification of reactive species that participate in photocatalytic reactions by the spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique.Â Considering the practically limitless number of combinations between inorganic and organic components capable of forming oxide-based ICT complexes and with the knowledge that this research area is unexplored, we are confident it is worth studying, and we emphasized some further perspectives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9972d79d84d3dd425ece9a5bf4623a97031314ed2bd0d6e6f2aa6a8e523c465b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
