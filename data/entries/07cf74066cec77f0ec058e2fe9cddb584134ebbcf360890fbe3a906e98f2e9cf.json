{"title":"Agony of Choice: Caudal Block versus Inguinal Block in Unilateral Orchidopexy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1703/v1","date":1716792974000,"content":"Objective: This prospective study aimed to compare the efficacy of caudal block (CB) and inguinal block (IB) for providing additional analgesia during unilateral orchidopexy. Methods: Seventy-two boys aged &amp;lt;48 months, classified as ASA I/II, were assigned into CB (n=37) and IB (n=34) groups. Outcome measures included intra- and postoperative analgesic requirements, pain scores, and administration duration. Additional intraoperative analgesia was administered for a 10% increase in heart rate, while postoperative pain was assessed using the Children's and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS), with scores &amp;gt;4 prompting supplementary analgesia. Monitoring extended for 24 hours post-surgery. Results: CB significantly reduced the need for intraoperative (p&amp;lt;0.001) and early postoperative (p=0.008) analgesia compared to IB. Although the CB group exhibited a slightly higher but non-significant analgesic requirement on the ward. No clinically relevant side effects were observed in either group. Conclusion: Both CB and IB are effective and safe methods for providing regional analgesia during orchidopexy. CB demonstrated superior efficacy intraoperatively and in the early postoperative period, while IB may offer advantages in the later recovery phase. However, additional analgesia is often required for orchidopexy, particularly in outpatient settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07cf74066cec77f0ec058e2fe9cddb584134ebbcf360890fbe3a906e98f2e9cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
