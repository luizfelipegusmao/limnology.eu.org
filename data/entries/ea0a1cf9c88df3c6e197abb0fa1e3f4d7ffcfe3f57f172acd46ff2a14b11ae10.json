{"title":"AGAMOUS-LIKE24 controls pistil number in Japanese apricot by targeting the KNOTTED1-LIKE gene KNAT2/6-a","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/566/7606714?rss=1","date":1707696000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The formation of multi-pistil flowers reduces the yield and quality in Japanese apricot (<span>Prunus mume</span>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the formation of multi-pistil flowers remains unknown. In the current study, overexpression of <span>PmKNAT2/6-a</span>, a class I <span>KNOTTED1-like homeobox</span> (<span>KNOX</span>) member, in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) resulted in a multi-pistil phenotype. Analysis of the upstream regulators of <span>PmKNAT2/6-a</span> showed that AGAMOUS-like 24 (PmAGL24) could directly bind to the <span>PmKNAT2/6-a</span> promoter and regulate its expression. PmAGL24 also interacted with Like Heterochromatin Protein 1 (PmLHP1) to recruit lysine trimethylation at position 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to regulate <span>PmKNAT2/6-a</span> expression, which is indirectly involved in multiple pistils formation in Japanese apricot flowers. Our study reveals that the PmAGL24 transcription factor, an upstream regulator of <span>PmKNAT2/6-a</span>, regulates <span>PmKNAT2/6-a</span> expression via direct and indirect pathways and is involved in the formation of multiple pistils in Japanese apricot.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ea0a1cf9c88df3c6e197abb0fa1e3f4d7ffcfe3f57f172acd46ff2a14b11ae10","category":"Environment"}
