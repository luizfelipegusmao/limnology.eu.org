{"title":"Igniting taxonomic curiosity: The amazing story of Amazonocrinis with the description of a new genus Ahomia gen. nov. and novel species of Ahomia, Amazonocrinis, and Dendronalium from the biodiversity‐rich northeast region of India","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13421?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Five cyanobacterial strains exhibiting <i>Nostoc</i>-like morphology were sampled from the biodiversity hotspots of the northeast region of India and characterized using a polyphasic approach. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA gene indicated that the strains belonged to the genera <i>Amazonocrinis</i> and <i>Dendronalium</i>. In the present investigation, the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny clearly demarcated two separate clades of <i>Amazonocrinis</i>. The strain MEG8-PS clustered along with <i>Amazonocrinis nigriterrae</i> CENA67, which is the type strain of the genus. The other three strains ASM11-PS, RAN-4C-PS, and NP-KLS-5A-PS clustered in a different clade that was phylogenetically distinct from the <i>Amazonocrinis</i> sensu stricto clade. Interestingly, while the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny exhibited two separate clusters, the 16S–23S ITS region analysis did not provide strong support for the phylogenetic observation. Subsequent analyses raised questions regarding the resolving power of the 16S–23S ITS region at the genera level and the associated complexities in cyanobacterial taxonomy. Through this study, we describe a novel genus <i>Ahomia</i> to accommodate the members clustering outside the <i>Amazonocrinis</i> sensu stricto clade. In addition, we describe five novel species, <i>Ahomia kamrupensis</i>, <i>Ahomia purpurea</i>, <i>Ahomia soli</i>, <i>Amazonocrinis meghalayensis</i>, and <i>Dendronalium spirale</i>, in accordance with the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). Apart from further enriching the genera <i>Amazonocrinis</i> and <i>Dendronalium</i>, the current study helps to resolve the taxonomic complexities revolving around the genus <i>Amazonocrinis</i> and aims to attract researchers to the continued exploration of the tropical and subtropical cyanobacteria for interesting taxa and lineages.</p>","author":"Sagarika Pal, \nAniket Saraf, \nNaresh Kumar, \nPrashant Singh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"4428efdbfaf0a69efab70c6a12cada6227bae4b9041f2b37343dae4647816b90","category":"Environment"}
