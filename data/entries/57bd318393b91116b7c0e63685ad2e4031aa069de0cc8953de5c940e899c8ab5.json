{"title":"Exploring the Plastic Surgery Related Experiences, Needs, Confidence and Knowledge Gaps of Foundation Year Doctors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1399/v1","date":1726652730000,"content":".Plastic surgery is a diverse speciality, relevant to non-plastic doctors, as plastic surgeons frequently collaborate with other specialities and itsâ€™ basic principles are transferable across multiple specialities. Foundation year (FY) doctors are the most junior doctors in the workforce and may need to apply plastic surgery knowledge and principles during their clinical duties. Despite this, formal plastic surgery education for junior doctors is limited, resulting in an educational gap. This study gains insight into the perceived confidence, knowledge gaps, skills, educational activities and needs related to plastic surgery. This qualitative study uses phenomenology through semi-structured individual interviews with 8 FY doctors. Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This study revealed that plastic surgery features diversely in the work life of FYs, who often manage patients with a lack of knowledge and confidence, influencing patient care and FY wellbeing. FYs primarily acquire knowledge and confidence through experiential learning and individual initiative. A need for curriculum improvements was expressed.  FYs are an essential part of the workforce who exhibited educational gaps and a lack of confidence in plastic surgery knowledge. We suggest improved integration of plastic surgery into the FY curriculum for improved FY knowledge and patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57bd318393b91116b7c0e63685ad2e4031aa069de0cc8953de5c940e899c8ab5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
