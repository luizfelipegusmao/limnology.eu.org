{"title":"A Review of Gateway Selection and Gateway Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0363/v1","date":1728315392000,"content":": Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are gaining popularity due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness. However, selecting appropriate gateways to connect these networks to external networks remains a key challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive review of gateway selection methods in WMNs, classifying them into network-centric, user-centric, and hybrid approaches. Key factors such as network topology, traffic volume, quality of service, and available resources are considered in evaluating these methods. The effectiveness of different strategies is assessed using metrics like throughput, latency, energy usage, and fairness. The impact of mobility, node heterogeneity, and security concerns on gateway selection is also explored. In addition to reviewing existing methods, the paper identifies research gaps and proposes future directions. Advanced methods that can adapt to changing network environments and support large-scale deployments are highlighted. This survey offers valuable insights for researchers and network designers to improve the efficiency and reliability of WMNs in real-world applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49629b4f860a276de30a1ddf106bc1012533e5565fd656b7ea0130c80d80be62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
