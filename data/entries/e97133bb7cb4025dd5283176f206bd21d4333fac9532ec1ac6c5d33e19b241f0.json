{"title":"Comparison of Six Measures of Genetic Similarity of Interspecific Brassicaceae Hybrids F2 Generation and Their Parental Forms Estimated on the Basis of ISSR Markers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2493/v1","date":1722422034000,"content":"Genetic similarity determines the extent to which two genotypes share common genetic material. It can be measured in various ways, such as comparing DNA sequences, proteins, or other genetic markers. The significance of genetic similarity is multifaceted and encompasses various fields, including evolutionary biology, medicine, forensic science, animal and plant breeding, and anthropology. Genetic similarity is an important concept with wide application across different scientific disciplines. In the presented study, six measures for calculating genetic similarity were compared: Euclidean, Jaccard, Kulczy≈Ñski, Sokal and Michener, Nei, and Rogers. The research material included 21 rapeseed genotypes (ten interspecific Brassicaceae hybrids of F2 generation, and 11 of their parental forms) and 146 alleles, obtained using 21 ISSR molecular markers. The results indicate that the research material was divided into two identical groups using any of the proposed methods, despite differences in the values of genetic similarity coefficients. Two of the presented measures of genetic similarity (Sokal and Michener, and Euclidean) were the same.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e97133bb7cb4025dd5283176f206bd21d4333fac9532ec1ac6c5d33e19b241f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
