{"title":"Droplet-Based Microfluidic Photobioreactor (&micro;-PBR) as a Growth Optimization Tool for Cyanobacteria and Microalgae","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0943/v1","date":1728659653000,"content":"Microalgae and cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms with significant biotechnological potential for the production of bioactive compounds, making them a promising resource for diverse industrial applications. This study presents the development and validation of a modular, droplet-based microfluidic photobioreactor (µ-PBR) designed for high-throughput screening and cultivation under controlled light conditions. The µPBR, based on PTFE tubing and a 4-channel LED illumination system, enables precise modulation of light intensity, wavelength, and photoperiod, facilitating dose-response experiments. Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and Chlorella vulgaris were used to demonstrate the system's capacity to support photosynthetic growth under various conditions. The results indicate that continuous illumination, particularly under blue and mixed blue-red light, promotes higher autofluorescence and chlorophyll-a content in cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus UTEX2973, while Chlorella vulgaris achieved optimal growth under a 16:8 light-dark cycle with moderate light intensity. This µ-PBR offers not only a flexible, scalable platform for optimizing growth parameters but also investigating highly resolved dose response screenings of environmental stressors such as salinity. The findings highlight its potential for advancing microalgal biotechnology research and applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d26c69deca65fa7d083657107b58e7e6d2a5c70527fb73ce9a34b29270b464a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
