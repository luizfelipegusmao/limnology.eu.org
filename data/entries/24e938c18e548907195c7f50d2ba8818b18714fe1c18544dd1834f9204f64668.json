{"title":"Why does the number of antenatal care visits in Ethiopia remain low?: A Bayesian multilevel approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302560","date":1714744800000,"content":"<p>by Daniel Atlaw, Tesfaye Getachew Charkos, Jeylan Kasim, Vijay Kumar Chatu</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Antenatal care (ANC) visit is a proxy for maternal and neonatal health. The ANC is a key indicator of access and utilization of health care for pregnant women. Recently, eight times ANC visits have been recommended during the pregnancy period. However, nearly 57% of women received less than four ANC visits in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify factors associated withthe number of ANC visits in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 21 to June 28/2019. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires from reproductive age groups. A stratified cluster sampling was used to select enumeration areas, households, and women from selected households. A Bayesian multilevel negative binomial model was applied for the analysis of this study. There is an intra-class correlation (ICC) = 23.42% and 25.51% for the null and final model, respectively. Data were analyzed using the STATA version 17.0. The adjusted incidence risk ratio (IRR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) was used to declare the association.</p> Result <p>A total of 3915 pregnant women were included in this study. The mean(SD) age of the participants was 28.7 (.11) years. Nearly one-fourth (26.5%) of pregnant women did not have ANC visits, and 3% had eight-time ANC visits in Ethiopia. In the adjusted model, the age of the women 25–28 years (IRR:1.13; 95% CrI: 1.11, 1.16), 29–33 years (IRR: 1.15; 95% CrI: 1.15, 1.16), ≥34 years (IRR:1.14; 95% CrI: 1.12, 1.17), being a primary school (IRR: 1.22, 95% CrI: 1.21, 1.22), secondary school and above (IRR: 1.26, 95% CrI: 1.26, 1.26), delivered in health facility (IRR: 1.93; 95% CrI: 1.92, 1.93), delivered with cesarian section (IRR: 1.18; 95% CrI: 1.18, 1.19), multiple (twin) pregnancy (IRR: 1.11; 95% CrI: 1.10, 1.12), richest (IRR:1.23; 95% CrI: 1.23, 1.24), rich family (IRR: 1.34, 95% CrI: 1.30, 1.37), middle income (IRR: 1.29, 95% CrI: 1.28, 1.31), and poor family (IRR = 1.28, 95% CrI:1.28, 1.29) were shown to have significant association with higher number of ANC vists, while, households with total family size of ≥ 5 (IRR: 0.92; 95% CrI: 0.91, 0.92), and being a rural resident (IRR: 0.92, 95% CrI: 0.92, 0.94) were shown to have a significant association with the lower number of ANC visits.</p> Conclusion <p>Overall, 26.5% of pregnant women do not have ANC visits during their pregnancy, and 3% of women have eight-time ANC visits. This result is much lower as compared to WHO’s recommendation, which states that all pregnant women should have at least eight ANC visits. In this study, the ages of the women 25–28, 29–33, and ≥34 years, being a primary school, secondary school, and above, delivered in a health facility, delivered with caesarian section, multiple pregnancies, rich, middle and poor wealth index, were significantly associated with the higher number of ANC visits, while households with large family size and rural residence were significantly associated with a lower number of ANC visits in Ethiopia.</p>","author":"Daniel Atlaw","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"24e938c18e548907195c7f50d2ba8818b18714fe1c18544dd1834f9204f64668","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
