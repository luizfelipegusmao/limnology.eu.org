{"title":"Identification of Risk Factors Linked to Diabetic Foot Ulcers from Multimodal Electronic Health Records and Transcriptomics Using Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1212/v1","date":1723790500000,"content":"Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), often leading to hospitalization and non-traumatic amputations in the United States. It is particularly prevalent among individuals of Hispanic descent, with a prevalence rate exceeding 10% [1, 2]. The target of this study is to identify markers of severity of DFU. This work follows a strategy that uses first Electronic Health Records and machine learning to identify risk factors reported as measurements of blood tests, such as cholesterol, blood sugar, and specific proteins in a cohort of thousands of patients. After this RNA risk factors are predicted using samples of bulk and single-cell gene expression across patients with different levels of DFU severity. We found the Albu-min/Creatinine Ratio (ACR) test as a key factor in severe DFUs. We also found a cluster of cells that harbor high expression of Apolipoprotein E protein (APOE) and it is significant in non-healing DFU cases. Overall, the study shows how the use of hundreds of thousands of EHR can reduce and inform the search space of molecules in a few samples of bulk-single cell transcriptomics and identify molecular markers of severity of DFU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a259df11e5181df0f3ef003b5d1b6a16eb008606719653be5ffdfc30ab09f05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
