{"title":"On Certain Rough Marcinkiewicz Integral Operators with Grafakos-Stefanov Kernels on Product Spaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1672/v1","date":1719223446000,"content":"In this paper, several classes of rough Marcinkiewicz integral operators along surfaces of revolution on product spaces are investigated. We prove the Lp boundedness of these operators when their kernels functions belong to a class of functions related to a class of functions introduced by Grafakos-Stefanov. The results in this paper extend and improve several known results on Marcinkiewicz integrals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f09586c491ff8a905c723c91bd1db6bb6c62539226c43c6bcef8842b2215a869","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
