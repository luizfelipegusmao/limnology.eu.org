A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms necessitates a profound insight into the atomic structure and electrostatic properties at the surface interface. Leveraging advanced four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), a technique acknowledged for its capability to concurrently reconstruct atomic structures and electric field maps, as previously demonstrated in other material systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.1065-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1065-B2\">2</a>], provides a valuable avenue for elucidating these intricate phenomena.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"31c1db05ad72b13c0c61cc8d04942d94ea3783453453f95076e433be25838edb","category":"Environment"}
