{"title":"Access to healthcare among transgender and non-binary youth in Sweden and Spain: A qualitative analysis and comparison","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303339","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by María del Mar Pastor Bravo, Ida Linander</p>\r\nBackground <p>Transgender and non-binary (TGNB) people tend to report worse health than cis people, however, despite an increased need for care, they face several barriers when trying to access healthcare. These barriers might be exacerbated when young age intersects with a trans identity, and so there is a need for studies highlighting the experiences of TGNB youth.</p> Aims <p>To explore and compare how TGNB youth (15–26 years old) in Sweden and Spain experienced their access to healthcare, in order to shed light on the strengths and limitations of different kinds of healthcare systems and improve healthcare provision and policy development.</p> Methods <p>This study was based on a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with TGNB youth living in Sweden (n = 16) and Spain (n = 18). Of these, 22 identified as male or transmasculine, six as non-binary, and six as women or transfeminine; 25 had undergone some type of gender-affirming care, and the rest were on the waiting list or undergoing preparatory visits and had not started hormonal treatment. The interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. An abductive approach was applied, and the Levesque conceptual framework was used to compare the analyses of each set of materials.</p> Results <p>We present our findings using the structure of the accessibility framework, focusing on approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability, and appropriateness. The conceptualization of accessibility in combination with the concept of cisnormativity illustrates how specific ideals and normative expectations affect access to healthcare for TGNB people across contexts, with most barriers arising from the appropriateness of the services.</p> Discussion <p>Young TGNB people experience barriers to accessing healthcare both in the Spanish and the Swedish contexts. Strategies to reduce these barriers should be framed within the critique of and resistance to cisnormativity and should focus on users with intersecting marginalized identities to promote health equity.</p>","author":"María del Mar Pastor Bravo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d257508f53d5feab9bc22c5b6fae5097986332042e11e064d257d8528b0edc5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
