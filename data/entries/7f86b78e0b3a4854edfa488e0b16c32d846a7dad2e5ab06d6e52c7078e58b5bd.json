{"title":"Unbound Low-Energy Nucleons As Semiclassical Quantum Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0932/v1","date":1715673456000,"content":"We propose that quarks and gluon flux tubes emerge from networks of standing vacuum waves. Each unbound nucleon, in its ground state, may be electromagnetically modeled as massless quantized charge on two pairs of orbiting arcs. Each charge arc is associated with a superposition of radially-oriented vacuum fundamental harmonics. These quantum superpositions of radial waves are coupled to nucleon mass-energy. The charge arcs orbit on the two surfaces of a spindle torus with polar charge-exclusion zones. These ground-state models of unbound nucleons may be interpreted as pairs of virtual Möbius bands. The optimal triangular Möbius band may explain proton uniqueness. These unbound proton and neutron models are shown to be precisely connected via a parameter dependent on neutron mass and the sum of the up and down bare quark masses. Due to this precise connection, and the relatively high experimental precision of proton magnetic moment, neutron magnetic moment is calculated about two orders of magnitude more precisely than the most accurate experiments to date. This quantum network-based approach to modeling unbound low-energy nucleons calculates several other measurable parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f86b78e0b3a4854edfa488e0b16c32d846a7dad2e5ab06d6e52c7078e58b5bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
