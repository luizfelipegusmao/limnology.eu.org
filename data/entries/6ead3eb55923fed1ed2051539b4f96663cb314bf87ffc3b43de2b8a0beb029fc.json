{"title":"Anthropogenic noise interacts with the predation risk assessment in a free-ranging bird","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/70/3/277/7147654?rss=1","date":1682985600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Anthropogenic noise can affect a number of behavioral, physiological, and ecological aspects of animals from major taxonomic groups, raising serious conservation concerns. For example, noise pollution impacts communicative behavior and perception of signals, movements and distribution, as well as predator–prey interactions, such as hunting success or predator detection and predation risk assessment. We have carried out an experimental playback study, in which we investigated whether exposure to anthropogenic noise (sound of a tractor) distracts free-ranging barn swallows <span>Hirundo rustica</span> from paying attention to an approaching human “predator” (the “cognitive distraction” hypothesis), or whether noise leads to increased responsiveness to this “predator” (the “increased threat” hypothesis). The subjects were male barn swallows attending their breeding territories during the time when the females were incubating. We found that barn swallow males initiated flight at significantly greater distances to the approaching human “predator” in the noise treatment than during the quiet control trials. These results suggest that anthropogenic noise causes increased vigilance and reactivity rather than a distraction, enabling birds to avoid the “predator” more quickly. We further discuss the mechanism behind the increased alertness in response to noise and contrast the “increased threat” mechanism, usually tested in previous studies, with an alternative “cognitive sensitization” mechanism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"6ead3eb55923fed1ed2051539b4f96663cb314bf87ffc3b43de2b8a0beb029fc","category":"Environment"}
