{"title":"MMM and MMMSynth: Clustering of heterogeneous tabular data, and synthetic data generation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302271","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Chandrani Kumari, Rahul Siddharthan</p>\r\n\r\nWe provide new algorithms for two tasks relating to heterogeneous tabular datasets: clustering, and synthetic data generation. Tabular datasets typically consist of heterogeneous data types (numerical, ordinal, categorical) in columns, but may also have hidden cluster structure in their rows: for example, they may be drawn from heterogeneous (geographical, socioeconomic, methodological) sources, such that the outcome variable they describe (such as the presence of a disease) may depend not only on the other variables but on the cluster context. Moreover, sharing of biomedical data is often hindered by patient confidentiality laws, and there is current interest in algorithms to generate synthetic tabular data from real data, for example via deep learning. We demonstrate a novel EM-based clustering algorithm, MMM (“Madras Mixture Model”), that outperforms standard algorithms in determining clusters in synthetic heterogeneous data, and recovers structure in real data. Based on this, we demonstrate a synthetic tabular data generation algorithm, MMMsynth, that pre-clusters the input data, and generates cluster-wise synthetic data assuming cluster-specific data distributions for the input columns. We benchmark this algorithm by testing the performance of standard ML algorithms when they are trained on synthetic data and tested on real published datasets. Our synthetic data generation algorithm outperforms other literature tabular-data generators, and approaches the performance of training purely with real data.","author":"Chandrani Kumari","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d2f385ebf9e125dc3ca1e8485d6d80d4d93e932731d9f1a29c2dbbada6ea1912","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
