{"title":"TCP transcription factor StAST1 represses potato tuberization by regulating tuberigen complex activity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1347/7629768?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Potato (<span>Solanum tuberosum</span> L.) is cultivated worldwide for its underground tubers, which provide an important part of human nutrition and serve as a model system for belowground storage organ formation. Similar to flowering, stolon-expressed FLOWERING LOCUS T-like (FT-like) protein SELF-PRUNING 6A (StSP6A) plays an instrumental role in tuberization by binding to the bZIP transcription factors StABI5-like 1 (StABL1) and StFD-like 1 (StFDL1), causing transcriptional reprogramming at the stolon subapical apices. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the widely conserved FT-bZIP interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified a TCP transcription factor StAST1 (StABL1 and StSP6A-associated TCP protein 1) binding to both StSP6A and StABL1. <span>StAST1</span> is specifically expressed in the vascular tissue of leaves and developing stolons. Silencing of <span>StAST1</span> leads to accelerated tuberization and a shortened life cycle. Molecular dissection reveals that the interaction of StAST1 with StSP6A and StABL1 attenuates the formation of the alternative tuberigen activation complex (aTAC). We also observed StAST1 directly activates the expression of potato GA 20-oxidase gene (<span>StGA20ox1</span>) to regulate GA responses. These results demonstrate StAST1 functions as a tuberization repressor by regulating plant hormone levels; our findings also suggest a mechanism by which the widely conserved FT-FD genetic module is fine-tuned.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"dc4e2641245d36d51268ce8d3d434a5bbee77d2b76c62b69b5682bdb4476174a","category":"Environment"}
