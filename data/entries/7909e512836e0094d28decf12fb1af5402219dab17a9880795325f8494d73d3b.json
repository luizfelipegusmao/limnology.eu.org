{"title":"Trapping strategy and diel periodicity affect capture rate of Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in agroecosystems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/2/237/7613951?rss=1","date":1708819200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The polyphagous pest, <span>Halyomorpha halys</span> (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), damages fruit in orchards and field crops and is often found within nearby woodlands. Pheromone-baited traps can be used to monitor <span>H. halys.</span> However, the efficiency of trapping <span>H. halys</span> may vary depending on trapping strategy (live vs. dead capture), location (ground or canopy), and diel periodicity of captures. We compared <span>H. halys</span> capture within fruiting hosts for: (i) live and kill traps on the ground vs. traps in the canopy of black cherry (<span>Prunus serotina Ehrh.</span>) (Rosales: Rosaceae), sugarberry (<span>Celtis laevigata</span> Willdenow) (Rosales: Cannabaceae), and pecan (<span>Carya illinoinensis</span> (Wangenh.) K. Koch) (Fagales: Juglandaceae) trees, (ii) ground and canopy-live traps in sassafras (<span>Sassafras albidum</span> (Nutt.) Nees) (Laurales: Lauraceae), and (iii) whether diel periodicity was detected for live capture in sassafras and cotton. More <span>H. halys</span> adults and nymphs were captured in kill traps than in live traps. More nymphs were captured in kill traps in black cherry and sugarberry on the ground than in the canopy. Live adult capture was significantly greater in sassafras and pecan canopies than on the ground. In cotton and sassafras, more live adults were captured from 8 PM—noon, with the fewest captured from noon—6 PM. A better understanding of stink bug activity in the field allows for improved trapping and, possibly, improved timing of treatment applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"7909e512836e0094d28decf12fb1af5402219dab17a9880795325f8494d73d3b","category":"Environment"}
