{"title":"Streptomyces virginiae XDS1‐5, an antagonistic actinomycete, as a biocontrol to peach brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13573?af=R","date":1716550526000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Peach brown rot, caused by the pathogen <i>Monilinia fructicola</i>, represents a significant postharvest infectious disease affecting peach fruit. This disease is responsible for a substantial increase in fruit decay rates, leading to significant economic losses, often exceeding 50%. Currently, there is a growing interest in identifying biocontrol agents to mitigate peach brown rot, with a predominant interest in <i>Bacillus</i> species.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this investigation, we isolated 410 isolates of actinomycetes from non-farmland ecosystem soil samples. Subsequently, 27 isolates exhibiting superior inhibitory capabilities were selected. Among these, strain XDS1-5 demonstrated the most robust fungistatic effect against brown rot disease, achieving an 80% inhibition rate <i>in vitro</i> and a 66% inhibition rate <i>in vivo</i>. XDS1-5 was identified as belonging to the <i>Streptomyces virginiae</i> species. Furthermore, a fermentation filtrate of XDS1-5 exhibited the ability to metabolize 34.21% of the tested carbon sources and 7.37% of the tested nitrogen sources. Particularly noteworthy was its capacity to disrupt the cell membrane structure directly, leading to increased cell membrane permeability and cytoplasmic leakage. Additionally, our investigation indicated that indoline, a metabolite produced by XDS1-5, played a pivotal role in inhibiting the growth of <i>M. fructicola</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In summary, our study has identified a biocontrol actinomycete, XDS1-5, with the potential to effectively inhibit postharvest brown rot disease in peaches. This finding holds great significance for the biological control of peach brown rot, offering promising prospects for mitigating the economic losses associated with this devastating disease. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Meijun Chen, \nFan Jia, \nShan Chen, \nYang Zheng, \nYan Hu, \nWeina Liu, \nChangyun Liu, \nXianchao Sun, \nJinwei Lu, \nGuokang Chen, \nGuanhua Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ce116763a9d27cce3c22cf4dfd9def51d35a86ffe2abf6f60a9ae0a1b537ab86","category":"Environment"}
