{"title":"Exploring the Efficacy of Chemical Antiscalant in Mitigating Silica Scaling: A Pilot Study in Geothermal Energy Production Sites in Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1896/v1","date":1719482917000,"content":"This research evaluates the technical and financial feasibility of using Inhibitor A for brine treatment in geothermal energy production, comparing it with traditional brine acidification. Conducted at a geothermal site in Central Java, Indonesia, the study uses Decision Tree Analysis and risk Expected Monetary Value (EMV) to assess both methods. Inhibitor A demonstrates a 70% reduction in scaling compared to untreated brine, with laboratory tests indicating a 10 ppm dosage as optimal for minimizing silica scaling. Despite higher initial costs, Decision Tree Analysis shows that Inhibitor A has a lower overall risk profile than acidification. EMV analysis confirms its cost-efficiency when considering potential risks and benefits. This research advocates for the adoption of Inhibitor A, highlighting its long-term benefits and sustainability over traditional methods. The findings emphasize the importance of innovative solutions in enhancing geothermal energy systemsâ€™ efficiency and sustainability. By integrating technical performance with financial analysis, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation to inform decision-making in the geothermal sector, promoting more effective and sustainable brine treatment practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9884eede957ac4b201543c963a8c38068a95fc69ade077f884e6329522a91b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
