{"title":"Bacterial aetiology, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and factors associated with urinary tract infection among under-five children at primary health facility, North-Western Tanzania","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303369","date":1715004000000,"content":"<p>by Roza Ernest, Nsiande Lema, Sued Yassin, Agricola Joachim, Mtebe Majigo</p>\r\nBackground <p>Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in under-five children, with significant consequences leading to bacteremia, dehydration, kidney scarring, and renal failure. The incidence of UTI varies with patients’ demographics and geographic location. Limited studies have addressed UTI issues, particularly in children. We determined the proportion of UTI, bacterial aetiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and associated factors among under-five children at the district hospital between March and April 2023</p> Methods <p>We conducted a cross-sectional study using a convenient non-probability sampling technique to collect urine samples from participants with signs and symptoms of UTI. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians. We collected Participants’ information using a pretested structured questionnaire. Urine samples were processed at the Regional Referral Hospital. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 15.0. We determined the factors associated with UTI using a modified Poisson model multivariable analysis of the modified Poisson model. The results were presented as a prevalence ratio and 95% confidence interval. The level of significance was specified at 0.05.</p> Result <p>The study recruited 368 under-five children; 194 (52.7%) were males, and the median age (interquartile range) was 24 (13–36) months. Of all, 28.8% (95% CI-24.3–33.6) had culture-confirmed UTI. One hundred and six pathogens were isolated, the majority being <i>Escherichia coli (E</i>. <i>coli)</i>, 37 (34.9%), and <i>Staphylococcus aureus (S</i>. <i>aureus)</i>, 26 (24.5%). The susceptibility of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> to cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, nitrofurantoin, and meropenem ranged from 81.1% to 97.3%. <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> was most susceptible to nitrofurantoin (96.2%) and ciprofloxacin (92.3%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 33.0% of isolates. The proportion of Methicillin-resistant <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was 23.1% and 25%, respectively. UTI was observed more in patients presenting with vomiting, dysuria, and abdominal pain, patients below 24 months of age, nappy users, and uncircumcised males.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study found a relatively high proportion of UTI among under-five children associated with vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain, nappy use, and uncircumcision in males. The pathogens were least susceptible to (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamycin, ampicillin, and penicillin) the commonly used antibiotic. We advocate a thorough clinical analysis to detect the predictors of UTI and a periodic review of empirical treatment of UTI based on the antibiotic susceptibility pattern.</p>","author":"Roza Ernest","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3e542d0f5119cd8263b2be0ea4e014ff346ba7c3e18af18b2b890517c3edf6bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
