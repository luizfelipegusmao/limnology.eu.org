{"title":"Motor and Respiratory Tele-Rehabilitation in Long COVID-19 Patients after Hospital Discharge: An Interventional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0424/v1","date":1717739852000,"content":"The persistence of symptoms following COVID-19 infection represents a significant challenge in healthcare management. During the outbreak, tele-rehabilitation emerged as a new tool to support healthcare structures in providing rehabilitation services. This study assessed the effectiveness and the feasibility of a 3-week home-based motor and respiratory rehabilitation program for long COVID-19 individuals after traditional rehabilitation. Twenty-three patients completed the program and underwent functional tests at different time points (i.e. baseline, after hospital discharge, and after tele-rehabilitation). Motor function was evaluated using the instrumented Six-Minutes Walking Test (i6MWT), with monitored heart rate and oxygen saturation. Conversely, respiratory function was measured via forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) tests. Significant improvements (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in motor and respiratory function were observed throughout the intervention, including an 18.3% increase in walked distance from the baseline. The findings suggest that a home-based tele-rehabilitation can enhance motor and respiratory function in post-COVID patients. Despite limitations such as sample size and lack of control group, the positive outcomes seem to support the feasibility of the proposed tele-rehabilitation program in managing long COVID symptoms and promoting functional recovery. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore tele-rehabilitationâ€™s potential in broader patient populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b475ee567d02b9c960731f10ba4cb7319b73204a337b3c48ee89f1e5221e3d03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
