{"title":"Nighttime Harvesting of OrBot (Orchard roBot)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0298/v1","date":1712141882000,"content":"The Robotics Vision Lab of Northwest Nazarene University has developed Orchard Robot (OrBot), which was designed for harvesting fruits. OrBot is composed of a machine vision system to locate fruits on the tree, a robotic manipulator to approach the target fruit, and a gripper to remove the target fruit. Field trials conducted at commercial orchards for apples and peaches during the harvesting season of 2021 yielded a harvesting success rate of about 85% and had an average harvesting cycle time of 12 seconds. Building upon this success, the goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of OrBot during nighttime harvesting. The idea is to have OrBot harvest at night, and then human pickers continue the harvesting operation during the day. This human and robot collaboration will leverage the labor shortage issue with a relatively slower robot working at night. The specific objectives are to determine the artificial lighting parameters suitable for nighttime harvesting and to evaluate the harvesting viability of OrBot during the night. LED lighting was selected as the source for artificial illumination with a color temperature of 5600 K and 10% intensity. This combination resulted with the lowest noise in the images. OrBot was tested in a commercial orchard using twenty Pink Lady apple trees. Results showed an increased success rate during the night, with OrBot gaining 94%. compared to 88% during the daytime operations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ceb62f5d8bb8c00f56444455c23300a1dc79bd0688f6b269371059d1dd45f9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
