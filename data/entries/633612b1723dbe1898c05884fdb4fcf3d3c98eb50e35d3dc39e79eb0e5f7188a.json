A combination of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) and dispersion strengthening by stable oxides (ODS) opens up new opportunities to improve performance of additively manufactured alloys. Impressive macroscopic behavior (high temperature creep strength, oxidation resistance, etc.) of ODS-MPEAs results from a carefully optimized hierarchical microstructure where the homogeneous dispersion of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide particles interacts with the complex network of various lattice defects in the solid solution matrix. In order to identify critical mechanisms which determine the performance of 3D printable ODS-MPEAs and further optimize their design, it is important to characterize interactions between the oxide particles and the crystal lattice defects over a range of length scales. Here, we report on a new efficient approach based on stereo-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction contrast imaging (DCI) cross-correlated with high spatial resolution energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"633612b1723dbe1898c05884fdb4fcf3d3c98eb50e35d3dc39e79eb0e5f7188a","category":"Environment"}
