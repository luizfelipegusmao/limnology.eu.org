{"title":"Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of drug resistance in <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> isolates in Gansu, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311042","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Yousheng Peng, Chenchen Li, Xueke Hui, Xiaoning Huo, Nigus Abebe Shumuyed, Zhong Jia</p>\r\n\r\nTuberculosis has posed a serious threat to human health. It is imperative to investigate the geographic prevalence of tuberculosis and medication resistance, as this information is essential for informing strategies for its prevention and treatment. Drug resistance was identified using a proportion method. Drug-resistant genes and pathways were predicted using whole genome sequencing. The drug resistance range of bedaquiline was identified using the microporous plate two-fold dilution method, and drug resistance genes were studied using sequencing. The study revealed that 19.99% of the tuberculosis cases had multidrug resistance. The genes of <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> are predominantly involved in the synthesis of ABC transporters, two-component systems, and bacterial secretion systems, as well as in energy production and conversion, and lipid transport and metabolism. The genes encode for 82.45% of carbohydrate-related enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl transferases, and carbohydrate esterases. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bedaquiline against clinical strains was approximately 0.06 Î¼g/mL, with identified mutations in drug-resistant genes Rv0678, atpE, and pepQ, specifically V152A, P62A, and T222N, respectively. The multidrug resistance tuberculosis development was attributed to the strong medication resistance exhibited. It was concluded that tuberculosis had presented a high level of drug resistance. Phenotypic resistance was related to genes, existing potential genetic resistance in <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>. Bedaquiline was found to possess effective antibacterial properties against <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>.","author":"Yousheng Peng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"891d3a4eb55416ce5664d3c8170345c5c1753afe347f4607d2d0b107988fc1ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
