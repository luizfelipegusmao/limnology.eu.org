{"title":"How Rapid-Eye-Movement Dreams May Facilitate Learning and Creativity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0684/v1","date":1710235211000,"content":"The importance of sleep for healthy brain function is widely acknowledged. However, it re- mains mysterious how the sleeping brain, disconnected from the outside world and plunged into the fantastic experiences of dreams, is actively learning. In this perspective article, we review a computational approach inspired by modern artificial intelligence that suggests a role of dreams occurring during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. REM dreams are characterized by an adver- sarial process between feedforward and feedback pathways generating new virtual experiences from the combination of old memories. Such an adversarial dreaming process is shown to facilitate the emergence of semantic, cortical representations. We further discuss the potential contributions of adversarial dreaming beyond learning, such as maintaining a balance between fantasy and reality, and facilitating the occurrence of creative insights. Finally, we characterize non-REM (NREM) dreams, replaying individual memories, that may serve a complementary role by improving the robustness of cortical representations to environmental perturbations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97cbaa2429eaae6d15e9a76d7d73f3aceac5956591d3495131ad48a569dc97e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
