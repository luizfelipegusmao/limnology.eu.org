{"title":"A century of studying plant secondary metabolism—From “what?” to “where, how, and why?”","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/advance-article/doi/10.1093/plphys/kiad596/7499152?rss=1","date":1704153600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Over the past century, early advances in understanding the identity of the chemicals that collectively form a living plant have led scientists to deeper investigations exploring <span>where</span> these molecules localize, <span>how</span> they are made, and <span>why</span> they are synthesized in the first place. Many small molecules are specific to the plant kingdom and have been termed plant secondary metabolites, despite the fact that they can play primary and essential roles in plant structure, development, and response to the environment. The past 100 yr have witnessed elucidation of the structure, function, localization, and biosynthesis of selected plant secondary metabolites. Nevertheless, many mysteries remain about the vast diversity of chemicals produced by plants and their roles in plant biology. From early work characterizing unpurified plant extracts, to modern integration of ‘omics technology to discover genes in metabolite biosynthesis and perception, research in plant (bio)chemistry has produced knowledge with substantial benefits for society, including human medicine and agricultural biotechnology. Here, we review the history of this work and offer suggestions for future areas of exploration. We also highlight some of the recently developed technologies that are leading to ongoing research advances.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0002049a033d8eef6f40a4d4d812baae6acb091ad5b3a7e224445e29fdeb20b8","category":"Environment"}
