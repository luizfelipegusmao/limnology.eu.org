{"title":"First genetic evaluation of a wild population of <i>Crocodylus intermedius</i>: New insights for the recovery of a Critically Endangered species","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311412","date":1727964000000,"content":"<p>by Nicolás Castillo-Rodríguez, Ana M. Saldarriaga-Gómez, Rafael Antelo, Mario Vargas-Ramírez</p>\r\n\r\nDuring the second third of last century, the Orinoco Crocodile (<i>Crocodylus intermedius</i>) underwent a hunting process driven by the demand from the North American, European, and Japanese leather industry, resulting in a sharp decline of its populations. Currently, only two known remaining populations of this Critically Endangered species persist in the Colombian Orinoquía: in the Guayabero-Duda-Lozada and the Cravo Norte-Ele-Lipa River Systems. The latter has been the only population subject of study, including recent surveys and local conservation initiatives such as egg and hatchling ranching. Despite suggestions for population recovery based on the observed increase in clutches in the area, information regarding its genetic status has been pending assessment. This research aims to provide a genetic characterization of this remaining population and to evaluate the diversity recovered during a period of the egg ranching initiative. For this purpose, we utilized variable molecular markers, specifically 17 microsatellite loci, nuclear DNA. Despite revealing intermediate levels of genetic diversity, we identified an effective population size of 11.5–17, well below the minimum values proposed for short-term subsistence. While no evidence of inbreeding was found, it is acknowledged as a potential risk based on the population’s history. Additionally, we detected a historical bottleneck possibly influenced by arid periods affecting the region since the Pleistocene. While the evaluated population presents a unique opportunity for <i>C</i>. <i>intermedius</i> conservation, it also exposes a high risk of entering the extinction vortex. The primary action to be taken is to support the egg and hatchling ranching program, which successfully recovered most of the genetic diversity present in the population.","author":"Nicolás Castillo-Rodríguez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cf88c9d988cffb561267678fbefdb961ce41753f022969944a5ca694f41cb9c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
