{"title":"Stream Restoration Effects on Habitat and Abundance of Native Cutthroat Trout","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4373?af=R","date":1725959607000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Restoration practitioners spend more than $1 billion each year restoring US rivers and streams but commit comparatively few resources to evaluating project effectiveness. Meanwhile, monitoring and disseminating the outcomes of restoration projects remains our best opportunity to learn from past successes and failures and to, ultimately, improve the cost effectiveness of restoration. We monitored the physical and biological outcomes of a stream restoration project in the Rocky Mountains, the goals of which were to improve habitat for and productivity of native Colorado River Cutthroat Trout (CRCT) and the scope of which included three contiguous reaches under different restoration treatments. Moreover, we evaluated the efficacy of the restoration project relative to its stated goals and objectives. To test for restoration effects on physical and biological indicators we coupled a before-after, control-impact (BACI) study design with (generalized) linear mixed models. Over the course of 7 years, we detected restoration-related increases in floodplain connectivity, streambank stability, and riparian shrub cover, as well as decreases in summer stream temperature. Despite measured improvements in native trout habitat, we detected no evidence of a restoration effect on density or biomass of age-1 and older CRCT. Although our study was somewhat limited in scope, our findings contribute toward a relatively small body of work on monitoring and effectiveness of river restoration.</p>","author":"Brian W.
