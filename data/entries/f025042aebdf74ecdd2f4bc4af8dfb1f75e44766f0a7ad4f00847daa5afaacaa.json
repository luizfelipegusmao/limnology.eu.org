{"title":"Osteopontin predicts late-time salience network-related functional connectivity in multiple sclerosis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309563","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Zsofia Kakucs, Zsolt Illes, Zsofia Hayden, Timea Berki, Gergely Orsi</p>\r\n\r\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely utilized to investigate plasticity mechanisms and functional reorganization in multiple sclerosis (MS). Among many resting state (RS) networks, a significant role is played by the salience network (SN, ventral attention network). Previous reports have demonstrated the involvement of osteopontin (OPN) in the pathogenesis of MS, which acts as a proinflammatory cytokine ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. Concentration of serum OPN was related to MRI findings 10.22Â±2.84 years later in 44 patients with MS. Local and interhemispheric correlations (LCOR, IHC), ROI-to-ROI and seed-based connectivity analyses were performed using serum OPN levels as independent variable along with age and gender as nuisance variables. We found significant associations between OPN levels and local correlation in right and left clusters encompassing the central opercular- and insular cortices (p-FDR = 0.0018 and p-FDR = 0.0205, respectively). Moreover, a significant association was identified between OPN concentration and interhemispheric correlation between central opercular- and insular cortices (p-FDR = 0.00015). Significant positive associations were found between OPN concentration and functional connectivity (FC) within the SN (FC strength between the anterior insula ventral division and 3 other insular regions, F(2,13) = 7.84, p-FDR = 0.0117). Seed-based connectivity analysis using the seven nodes of the SN resulted in several positive and inverse associations with OPN level. Serum OPN level may predict FC alterations within the SN in 10 years.","author":"Zsofia Kakucs","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f025042aebdf74ecdd2f4bc4af8dfb1f75e44766f0a7ad4f00847daa5afaacaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
