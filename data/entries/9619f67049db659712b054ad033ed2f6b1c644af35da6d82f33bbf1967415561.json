{"title":"Efficient Eye State Detection for Driver Fatigue Monitoring Using Optimized YOLOv7-Tiny","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0925/v1","date":1710526252000,"content":"This study demonstrates the efficacy of structured pruning and architectural fine-tuning on the YOLOv7-tiny model for eye state detection, emphasizing optimization for real-time applications. Structured pruning significantly reduced the model's complexity and storage size while maintaining high detection accuracy, as evidenced by stable precision, recall, and mAP@.5 metrics across iterations. Further fine-tuning adjusted the model's width and depth, optimizing efficiency and processing speed without compromising performance. These optimizations yielded YOLOv7-tiny variants that are both computationally efficient and accurate, suitable for resource-constrained environments. The findings highlight the critical role of model optimization in deploying effective neural networks for specific detection tasks in real-time scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9619f67049db659712b054ad033ed2f6b1c644af35da6d82f33bbf1967415561","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
