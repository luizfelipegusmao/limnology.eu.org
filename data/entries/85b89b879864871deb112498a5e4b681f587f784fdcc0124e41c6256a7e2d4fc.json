{"title":"The Set of Serine Peptidases of the Tenebrio molitor Beetle: Transcriptomic Analysis on Different Developmental Stages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1450/v1","date":1713852381000,"content":"Serine peptidases (SPs) of the chymotrypsin S1A subfamily are an extensive group of enzymes found in all animal organisms, including insects. Here we provide analysis of SPs in the yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor transcriptomes and genomes datasets and profile their expression pattern at various stages of ontogeny. A total of 269 SPs were identified, including 137 with con-served catalytic triad residues, while others 125 lacking conservation were proposed as non-active serine peptidase homologs (SPHs). Seven deduced sequences exhibit a complex do-main organization with two or three peptidase units (domains), predicted both as active or non-active. The largest group of 84 SP and 102 SPH had no regulatory domains in the propep-tide, and the majority of them were expressed only in the feeding life stages, larvae and adults, presumably playing an important role in digestion. The remaining 53 SP and 23 SPH had differ-ent regulatory domains, showed constitutive or upregulated expression at eggs or/and pupae stages, participating in regulation of various physiological processes. The majority of polypep-tidases was mainly expressed at the pupal and adult stages. The data obtained expand our knowledge on SPs/SPHs and provide a foundation for further research on the functions of this gene family in T. molitor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85b89b879864871deb112498a5e4b681f587f784fdcc0124e41c6256a7e2d4fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
