{"title":"Development of Bio-Products to Enhance Growth-Promoting and Disease Control of Economic Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2150/v1","date":1724926774000,"content":"The use of biological methods to control plant disease is an option to reduce the pesticide residues in an environment. The objective of this research is to develop the bio-products for the elimination and/or replacement of pesticides. All the 182 strains of beneficial bacteria were screened from 20 samples of chili. The samples were divided into 8 groups. The strain SP-TU6, SP-TU7, and SP-TU3 were high efficacy inhibited mycelium growth of Colletotrichum capsici P-TU008 with 98.93, 94.62, and 95.69%, respectively as chemical control (carbendazim). The development of 3 bio-products that can promote the growth of economic crops are including Bioproduct 1 = talcum: CaCO3: CMC (9.75:1.5:1), Bioproduct 2 = corn flour: talcum: CaCO3: CMC (10:87.5:1.5:1), and Bioproduct 3 = corn flour: talcum: CaCO3: CMC (20:87.5:1.5:1). All bioproducts showed the best level of solubility in water, distribution, and sedimentation. Found that, the bioproduct 1 was suitable for survival of beneficial bacteria SP-TU3 and SP-TU6 with a population of 4.5x1012 and 3.2x1013 cfu/g respectively, and bioproduct 2 was suitable for strain SP-TU7 (2.4x1012 cfu/g) after storage for 3 months. The strain SP-TU3 in bioproduct 1 can induce seed germination and growth parameter of chili (Capsicum spp.) were 95% and 1.86, respectively, and SP-TU7 in in bioproducts 2 had the highest efficiency to induce seed germination and growth parameter of ruzi grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis) with 62% and 6.51 respectively, and strain SP-TU6 was the most effective germination and growth parameter of B. chinesis and B. oleracea with 98%, 88%, and 3.62, 88.00, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e050949d708665b546b8a60be0f40921f19729222db017e6bf8f84a68f0cd6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
