{"title":"Molecular Mechanism of VSV Recombinant ASFV Antigen Gene Activating Immune Response of DCs in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1450/v1","date":1726724784000,"content":"The VSV recombinant ASFV antigen gene live vector vaccines can induce efficient immune response, but the detailed mechanism remains unsolved yet. In order to investigate the efficacy of recombinant viruses (VSV-p35, VSV-p72) mediated dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and the mechanism of inducing T cells immune response, the functional effects of recombinant viruses to DCs activation and target antigens presentation were explored in this study. The results showed that surface marked molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, and MHC-II) and secreted cytokines (IL-4, TNF-α, IFN-γ) were highly expressed in DCs that treated with recombinant viruses. The mixed lymphocyte reaction experiment results showed that the naive lymphocytes and polarized the CD4+T lymphocytes towards Th1 and Th17 cells were effectively activated when DCs were treated with recombinant viruses. In conclusion, the study indicated that VSV recombinant ASFV antigen gene live vector vaccine activated the maturation of DCs and the Th1 and Th17 type immune response, which provided a theoretical basis for the development of novel ASF vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f197a9ba8154c82d2d5a1ff60153abc71c5113c17cc389650bb28ae87d9d3246","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
