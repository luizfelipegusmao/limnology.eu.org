In a rapidly evolving market characterized by complex supply chains and dynamic consumer demands, SCV offers a transformative capability by providing real-time data and insights into supply chain operations. Through semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners, the research identifies several key themes: enhanced demand forecasting, increased consumer trust through transparency, improved marketing agility, and the integration of advanced technologies. Findings suggest that SCV significantly improves the accuracy of demand forecasts by providing timely insights into inventory levels, production schedules, and market conditions. This enhanced forecasting aligns supply chain capabilities with marketing efforts, reducing stockouts and optimizing promotional activities. Moreover, SCV fosters consumer trust by enabling transparency regarding product sourcing and ethical practices, which can be effectively communicated in marketing campaigns to build brand loyalty. The agility provided by SCV allows companies to quickly adjust their marketing strategies in response to market disruptions and shifts in consumer preferences, making their campaigns more resilient and responsive. Advanced technologies such as IoT, blockchain, and analytics further enhance the benefits of SCV, providing deeper insights and more sophisticated capabilities for marketing. The study also highlights the importance of cross-functional collaboration between supply chain and marketing teams in leveraging SCV data effectively. Despite challenges such as the need for significant investment and organizational change, the advantages of SCV in enhancing marketing strategies and overall organizational performance are substantial. The research underscores SCV's critical role in shaping effective marketing strategies, offering FMCG companies a path to greater efficiency, agility, and consumer engagement in a competitive landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa07c9029b576b1b3199625236e2e7871661324a522876ae41fa12f801fbcfe8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
