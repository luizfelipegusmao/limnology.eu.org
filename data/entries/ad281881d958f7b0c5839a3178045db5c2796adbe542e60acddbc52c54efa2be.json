{"title":"Root topological order drives variation of fine root vessel traits and hydraulic strategies in tropical trees","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2951/7617102?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Vessel traits contribute to plant water transport from roots to leaves and thereby influence how plants respond to soil water availability, but the sources of variation in fine root anatomical traits remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the variations of fine root vessel traits along topological orders within and across tropical tree species. Anatomical traits were measured along five root topological orders in 80 individual trees of 20 species from a tropical forest in southwestern China. We found large variations for most root anatomical traits across topological orders, and strong co-variations between vessel traits. Within species, theoretical specific xylem hydraulic conductivity (<span>K</span><sub>th</sub>) increased with topological order due to increased mean vessel diameter, size heterogeneity, and decreased vessel density. Across species, <span>K</span><sub>th</sub> was associated with vessel fraction in low-order roots and correlated with mean vessel diameter and vessel density in high-order roots, suggesting a shift in relative anatomical contributors to <span>K</span><sub>th</sub> from the second- to fifth-order roots. We found no clear relationship between <span>K</span><sub>th</sub> and stele: root diameter ratios. Our study shows strong variations in root vessel traits across topological orders and species, and highlights shifts in the anatomical underpinnings by varying vessel-related anatomical structures for an optimized water supply.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"ad281881d958f7b0c5839a3178045db5c2796adbe542e60acddbc52c54efa2be","category":"Environment"}
