{"title":"Overcoming Waste Management Challenges in Costa Rica: Evaluating Practices, Government Initiatives, and Future Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0274/v3","date":1724123416000,"content":"Costa Rica, despite its global recognition for environmental sustainability, is grappling with a critical waste management crisis that threatens its ecological and public health achievements. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of Costa Rica's waste management system, focusing on the acute challenges in urban areas like San José, where nearly 47% of the nation’s waste is generated. The research highlights significant issues, including inadequate landfill capacities, low recycling rates, and regional disparities in waste management practices. Employing a hybrid modeling approach that integrates Linear Regression and ARIMA models, the study forecasts trends in waste minimization practices from 2024 to 2050, underscoring the importance of public engagement in recycling programs. Key findings reveal that Costa Rica's recycling rate remains alarmingly low at 9.6%, far below the global average and significantly less than countries like Germany and South Korea. The analysis critiques current government initiatives, such as the Environmental Health Route policy and the National Circular Economy Strategy, noting their limited success in improving recycling rates, particularly in rural areas. The study underscores the necessity for enhanced infrastructure, targeted public education, and the adoption of innovative technologies like AI and blockchain to achieve sustainable waste management. The findings contribute valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders, offering strategic recommendations to bolster Costa Rica's efforts in aligning with global best practices and advancing its environmental sustainability goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5327ba38ad0c29110225a2efc58fe85ad9b3bc244e5f6a2fb57ad6f110f099a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
