{"title":"Respiratory Symptoms Among Adolescens in Poland: A Study on Cigarette Smokers, E-Cigarette Users, and Dual Users","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0884/v1","date":1715605002000,"content":"In recent years, the prevalence of tobacco and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among adolescents has raised significant public health concerns worldwide. This study aims to investigate respiratory symptoms among Polish adolescents. We conducted an online survey among Polish school students from all provinces, collecting data over two months in Spring 2021. Students voluntarily complete the anonymous survey, answering questions about respiratory symptoms, smoking habits (both traditional and electronic cigarettes), and demographic information. Analysis focused on four subgroups: non-tobacco users, traditional cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users, and dual users, totaling 10,388 pupils aged 12-18 years, predominantly attending secondary technical and comprehensive schools. A total of 10388 pupils participated in the study, 55.6 % (5778) of whom were girls and 44.4 % (4610) boys. Adolescents, who admitted using both e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes experienced more frequent episodes of cough during the day (39.70%) and at night (18.40%) compared to their peers in other groups. Chest discomfort, including pain and pressure, was also reported more often by adolescents, who used e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes concurrently (27.60%) compared to their peers in other groups. Chest pressure was experienced less commonly by non-smoking adolescents (14.40%) than by smokers (18.90%). Higher severity of cough during the day and at night was observed in the group of adolescents using traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes concurrently compared to the other groups. The adolescents in the dual user group experienced more severe dyspnoea and wheezing compared to the other groups included in the comparison. The results of this study confirm the correlation between the occurrence of respiratory symptoms in adolescents who smoke cigarettes, use e-cigarettes and in dual users. The respiratory symptoms occur most frequently and are the most severe in the group of adolescents who use e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b684dd0f274a733057fb6679b30215c0389f1e2c4d70e703a93de2c036f33ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
