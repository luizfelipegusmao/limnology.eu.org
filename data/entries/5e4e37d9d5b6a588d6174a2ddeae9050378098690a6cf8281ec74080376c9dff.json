{"title":"Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Tests of Working Parameters of Piston-Radial Pumps in Hydraulic Systems of Mobile Machines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2071/v1","date":1727335205000,"content":"Modern methods of designing and constructing hydraulic pumps can no longer be imagined without the use of appropriate mathematical models, phenomena and processes that take place in concrete constructions. A mathematical model of a process represents an analytical interpretation with certain assumptions. Obtaining a mathematical model requires detailed theoretical research, based on knowledge of the laws of fundamental sciences and scientific disciplines in order to fully understand and interpret the process, based on which assumptions are adopted and model equations are defined. As mobile machines continue to evolve, so do the demands on their hydraulic systems. Efficiency, automation and other major industry trends present ongoing development opportunities for hydraulic systems used in mobile applications. Hydraulic systems remain an important component in a range of mobile applications, from construction and agricultural equipment to heavy trucks because of the power density they can provide for a range of work functions. The power density of hydraulics remains unmatched in many applications. The pump, as an essential hydraulic component, converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy with a relatively small amount and speed of fluid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e4e37d9d5b6a588d6174a2ddeae9050378098690a6cf8281ec74080376c9dff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
