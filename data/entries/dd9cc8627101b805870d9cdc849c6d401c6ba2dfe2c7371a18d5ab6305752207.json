{"title":"Fundamental Mechanisms Underlying the Effectiveness of Nanoparticle Additives to Lubricants: 25 Examples Linking Nano- to Macroscale Friction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0768/v1","date":1715580939000,"content":"Studies of the fundamental origins of friction have undergone a rapid acceleration in recent years by providing valuable information on the nanoscale mechanisms responsible for the friction at the macroscopic level. Significant efforts have been directed into developing composite nanofluids and nanoparticle additives to unlock new tribological properties unattainable by traditional lub-ricants. The studies are now further evolving by developing methods to achieve active control of the nano- and/or mesoscale friction by application of magnetic and electric fields external to the contact. These methods constitute an area of rapidly growing interest, and they also are illumi-nating how the performance of conventional lubricants could be enhanced through synergistic addition of nanoparticles (NPs). This mini-review highlights 25 publications that collectively re-veal significant progress, as well as important outstanding challenges, to a fundamental under-standing of how the addition of NPs impacts the lubricant performance. The first two sections focus on the use of Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM), a technique that spans atomic to mac-roscale length and time scales. Subsequent sections expand to complimentary methods comparing results at the macro and atomic scale for similar materials. These studies highlight the pivotal role of the nanoparticle charge and surface treatment, while also indicating that rolling of nano-particles is ineffective and/or detrimental.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd9cc8627101b805870d9cdc849c6d401c6ba2dfe2c7371a18d5ab6305752207","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
