{"title":"Impaired Development of Collagen Antibody-Induced Arthritis in Rab44-Deficient Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1444/v1","date":1726665063000,"content":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell-mediated joint inflammation and subsequent osteoclast-dependent bone destruction. Collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) is a useful mouse model for examining the inflammatory mechanisms in human RA. Previously, we identified the novel gene Rab44, which is a member of the large Rab GTPase family and is highly expressed in immune-related cells and osteoclasts. In this study, we induced CAIA in Rab44-knockout (KO) mice to investigate the effects of Rab44 on inflammation, cell filtration, and bone destruction. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, Rab44 KO mice showed reduced inflammation in arthritis under CAIA-inducing conditions. Rab44 KO CAIA mice exhibited reduced cell filtration in the radiocarpal joints. Consistent with these findings, Rab44-KO CAIA mice showed decreased mRNA levels of arthritis-related marker genes including inflammation, cartilage turnover, bone formation, and bone absorption markers. Rab44-KO CAIA mice exhibited predominant infiltration of M2-type macrophages at inflammatory sites and reduced bone loss compared to WT CAIA mice. These results indicate that Rab44 deficiency reduces the progression of inflammation in CAIA in mice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7d0399a7391436408f64625ecb4b3fd6c9b20e06974e3141906a112be45784d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
