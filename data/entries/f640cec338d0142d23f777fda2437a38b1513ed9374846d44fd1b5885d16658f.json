{"title":"Properties and Photocuring Behavior of Ceramic Polymer Composite Slurries with Varying Concentration of Silane Coupling Agent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1936/v1","date":1727230981000,"content":"In this study, 3-trimethoxy-silylpropane-1-thiol (MPTMS) was used as a surface modifier for Al2O3 powder to systematically analyze the effects of MPTMS concentration on the rheological properties, photocuring characteristics, and 3D printing performance of photocurable composite slurries. MPTMS concentration significantly influenced the rheological behavior of the slurry. Slurries containing 2 wt.% and 5 wt.% MPTMS exhibited a wide linear viscoelastic range (LVR). However, at concentrations of 10 wt.% and 20 wt.%, the LVR range narrowed, which led to reduced dispersion stability. In dispersion stability tests, the slurry with 2 wt.% MPTMS showed the most stable dispersion, while the 5 wt.% MPTMS concentration exhibited the highest photocuring rate. In 3D printing experiments, the 5 wt.% MPTMS concentration resulted in the most stable printed structures, whereas printing failures occurred with the 2 wt.% concentration. At 10 wt.% and 20 wt.%, internal cracking was observed, leading to structural defects. In conclusion, MPTMS forms silane bonds on the Al2O3 surface, significantly impacting the stability, rheological properties, and printing quality of Al2O3-acrylate composite slurries. An MPTMS concentration of 5 wt.% was found to be optimal, contributing to the formation of stable and robust structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f640cec338d0142d23f777fda2437a38b1513ed9374846d44fd1b5885d16658f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
