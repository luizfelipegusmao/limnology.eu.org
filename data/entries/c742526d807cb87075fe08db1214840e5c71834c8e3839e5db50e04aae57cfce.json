{"title":"Exploring the Interface of Microwave Technology, Quantum Computing and Neuroscience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0982/v1","date":1718346022000,"content":"Microwave technology, foundational in quantum computing, utilizes precise control of quantum states via microwave pulses to manage quantum bits (qubits). This review explores the potential of leveraging these principles in neuroscience, where such technology could enable novel approaches to imaging, diagnosing, and treating neurological disorders. By comparing the techniques used in quantum computing with potential applications in neural circuit manipulation and brain activity monitoring, we highlight both the promising synergies and the significant challenges at the intersection of these fields. This interdisciplinary exploration not only underscores the transformative potential of microwave technology in neuroscience but also addresses the ethical considerations and technological hurdles that accompany the integration of advanced quantum mechanics into biological contexts. The convergence of microwave technology with neural science opens a pathway for breakthroughs in understanding and treating complex brain disorders, advocating for a cautious yet optimistic approach towards future research and application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c742526d807cb87075fe08db1214840e5c71834c8e3839e5db50e04aae57cfce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
