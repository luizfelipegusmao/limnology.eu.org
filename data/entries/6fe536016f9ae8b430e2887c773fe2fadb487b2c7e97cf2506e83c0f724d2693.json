{"title":"Multifaceted bioactivity of marine fungal derived secondary metabolite, xyloketal B -a review","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae156/7775625?rss=1","date":1727308800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>A growing number of findings have focused on the distinctive physiochemical characteristics that marine microorganisms have acquired as a result of their adaptation to the challenging conditions inherent in the marine environment. It has been established that the marine environment is a very rich source of bioactive substances with a variety of biological effects and structural diversity. A major discovery was the extraction of xyloketals from <span>Xylaria</span> sp. Numerous thorough studies have subsequently been carried out to determine the medicinal potential of these bioactive components. Xyloketals are thought to be a very promising and significant class of naturally occurring substances with a wide range of potent biological activities, such as radical scavenging, suppression of cell proliferation, reduction of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, antioxidant activity, inhibition of acetylcholine esterase, inhibition of L-calcium channels, and others. Xyloketal B is one of the most potent molecules with significant therapeutic properties among the numerous variants discovered.<div>Conclusion</div>This review summarizes the structural characterization of all naturally occurring xyloketal compounds, especially the B derivative with an emphasis on their bioactivity and provides an outline of how xyloketals operate in diverse disease scenarios.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"6fe536016f9ae8b430e2887c773fe2fadb487b2c7e97cf2506e83c0f724d2693","category":"Environment"}
