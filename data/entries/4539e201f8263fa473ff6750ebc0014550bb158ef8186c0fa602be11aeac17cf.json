{"title":"The Relationship between COVID-19 and Retinal Vascular Occlusive Diseases: A Systemic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2296/v1","date":1722245437000,"content":"This systematic examines research into patients diagnosed with retinal vascular occlusive diseases (RVODs) secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or vaccination. RVODs include central retinal vein occlusion, branch retinal vein occlusion, central retinal artery occlusion, and branch retinal artery occlusion. Previous studies have posited a possible link between RVODs and COVID-19. RVODs are of two types: retinal vein occlusion and retinal artery occlusion. These disorders develop when retinal blood vessels become clogged by thrombi or fat deposition. The retina is an important component of the visual apparatus. Its photoreceptors are stimulated by the light hitting the eye and record its pattern. The retina then relays this visual information to the brain. When retinal blood vessels become clogged, the damage can range from slightly reduced vision to complete blindness. COVID-19 causes endothelial dysfunction and increased levels of von Willebrand factor antigens in the blood. Elevation of von Willebrand factor activates the coagulation process and platelet aggregation. The treatment methods and visual prognosis in COVID-19-related RVODs do not differ from conventional RVODs. However, ophthalmologists need to be aware of the possible relationship and should consider RVODs when they encounter patients with vision loss following COVID-19 infection or vaccination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4539e201f8263fa473ff6750ebc0014550bb158ef8186c0fa602be11aeac17cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
