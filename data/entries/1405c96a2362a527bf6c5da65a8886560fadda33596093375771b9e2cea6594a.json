{"title":"Static palpation ain’t easy: Evaluating palpation precision using a topographical map of the lumbar spine as a reference","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304571","date":1717077600000,"content":"<p>by Inge Strøh Hvidkær, Steen Harsted, Maliheh Hadizadeh, Søren O’Neill, Gregory Neil Kawchuk, Casper Nim</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Clinicians commonly use manual therapy to treat low back pain by palpating the spine to identify the spinous processes. This study aims to evaluate the ability of experienced clinicians to consistently locate the spinous processes from S1 to T12 through palpation. The results will be compared to topographical data representing the lumbar lordosis at baseline and four follow-up time points.</p> Materials and methods <p>In a prior prospective randomized trial, experienced clinicians used palpation to locate the lumbar spinous processes (S1—T12) and then digitized these locations in three-dimensional space. The same digitizing equipment was then used to continuously collect three-dimensional position data of a wheel that rolled along the back’s surface through a trajectory that connected the previously digitized locations of the spinous processes. This process was repeated at 4 days, 1, 4, and 12 weeks.The resulting lordosis trajectories were plotted and aligned using the most anterior point in the lordosis to compare the locations of the spinous processes identified in different trials. This way, spinous palpation points could be compared to surface topography over time. Intra- and interrater reliability and agreement were estimated using intraclass correlations of agreement and Bland-Altman limits of agreement.</p> Results <p>Five clinicians palpated a total of 119 participants. The results showed a large degree of variation in precision estimates, with a mean total value of 13 mm (95%CI = 11;15). This precision error was consistent across all time points. The smallest precision error was found at L5, followed by S1 File, after which the error increased superiorly. Intra- and interrater reliability was poor to moderate.</p> Conclusions <p>Comparison of palpation results to a topographic standard representing the lumbar lordosis is a new approach for evaluating palpation. Our results confirm the results of prior studies that find palpation of lumbar spinous processes imprecise, even for experienced clinicians.</p>","author":"Inge Strøh Hvidkær","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1405c96a2362a527bf6c5da65a8886560fadda33596093375771b9e2cea6594a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
