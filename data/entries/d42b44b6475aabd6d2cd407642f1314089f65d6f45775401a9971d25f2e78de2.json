{"title":"Natural Farming: A Sustainable Alternative to Chemical Fertilizers for Marigold (Tagetes erecta cv. Siracole) Cultivation under Mid-Hills of Himalayan Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0563/v1","date":1720403686000,"content":"Using desi-cow waste products like Jeevamrit, natural farming is widespread among farmers for improving soil biology and productivity. Jeevamrit enhances soil chemical and microbiological properties without needing large quantities of farmyard manure (FYM), as a sustainable farming practice with a reduced carbon footprint. Despite its traditional use, Jeevamrit faces criticism due to a lack of scientific evidence. This study investigated the comparative effect of Jeevamrit and chemical fertilizers on the growth and yield of marigold cv. Siracole. In this study mother block of marigold was raised for both summer and winter seasons. The cuttings were harvested from the mother block and then kept for rooting. The rooted cuttings were planted at monthly intervals and evaluated for flowering parameters and compared to those treated with RDF (30:20:20 N, P, and K g/m2). Soil supplied with Jeevamrit enhanced bacteria (26.33%), fungi (18.92%), and actinomycetes (31.21%) populations compared over the recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) (i.e. N:P: K @ 30:20:20 g m-2). Jeevamrit-treated plants have marketable flower yield per square meter (3.98 %) and shelf life (9.93 %) compared to RDF. The study concludes that Jeevamrit @ 2 liter m-2 is a sustainable and effective alternative to traditional fertilizers for enhancing marigold production in the mid-hills of the Himalayan region, where natural farming is already accepted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d42b44b6475aabd6d2cd407642f1314089f65d6f45775401a9971d25f2e78de2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
