{"title":"Allostasis as a consequence of high heat load in grain-fed feedlot cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae133/7747588?rss=1","date":1725235200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Heat wave intensity, frequency, and duration are increasing in many regions of the world, including locations where highly productive livestock are raised. There are animal health and welfare, as well as economic impacts from these events. In this study, the physiological responses of grain-fed steers during a high heat load challenge through to recovery in climate-controlled rooms (<strong>CCR</strong>) were intensively evaluated. Two cohorts of 12 Black Angus steers (BW, 615.4 ± 40.1 kg) sequentially underwent a simulated heatwave event that consisted of 3 phases in the CCR: PreChallenge (5 d duration and temperature humidity index (<strong>THI</strong>) range of 65 to 71), Challenge (7-d duration and THI 66 to 95 with diurnal cycling), and Recovery (5 d duration and THI 65 to 70). The Challenge period was modeled on a severe heat wave, characterized by 3 very hot days. Individual rumen temperature (<strong>RumT</strong>, °C) was collected every 10 min, and respiration rate (<strong>RR</strong>, breaths per minute), panting score (<strong>PS</strong>), and water usage (L·steer<sup>−1</sup>·day<sup>−1</sup>) were obtained at multiple time points daily, by trained observers. Individual animal daily DMI was also determined. Morning (0700 hours) rectal temperature (<strong>RecT</strong>, °C) was measured on days 3, 5, 7 to 13, 15, and 17. Not unexpectedly, RumT, RecT, RR, and PS rose during Challenge and fell rapidly as conditions eased. Conversely, DMI was reduced during Challenge. During the transition between PreChallenge and Challenge, there were abrupt increases in RumT, and RR. It was also very apparent that during Recovery the steers did not return to the baseline PreChallenge state. Compared to PreChallenge, Recovery was characterized by persistent lowered daily mean RumT (<span>P </span>= 0.0010), RecT (<span>P </span>= 0.0922), RR (<span>P </span>= 0.0257), PS (<span>P </span>≤ 0.0001), and DMI (<span>P </span>≤ 0.0001). These results provide evidence that these steers have undergone an allostatic response in response to high heat load, and the new adjusted physiological state post-heat event may not be transient.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"c9fc7f9d536f5ddcf01a166191a26874b028b87313f6a68aab7c8a9110fde622","category":"Environment"}
