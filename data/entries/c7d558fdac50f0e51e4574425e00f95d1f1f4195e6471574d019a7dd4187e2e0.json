{"title":"Double burden of gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311110","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Eyob Girma Abera, Esayas Kebede Gudina, Ermias Habte Gebremichael, Demisew Amenu Sori, Daniel Yilma</p>\r\nBackground <p>The coexistence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) amplifies the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and complications, leading to more severe adverse pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the double burden of GDM and PIH (GDM/PIH) among pregnant women in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in the databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Embase, and Google Scholar, covering studies published up to May 14, 2023. The analysis was carried out using JBI SUMARI and STATA version 17. Subgroup analyses were computed to demonstrate heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of a single study on the overall estimate. Publication bias was assessed through inspection of the funnel plot and statistically using Egger’s regression test.</p> Result <p>Of 168 retrieved studies, 15 with a total of 6391 participants were deemed eligible. The pooled prevalence of GDM/PIH co-occurrence among pregnant women in Ethiopia was 3.76% (95% CI; 3.29–4.24). No publication bias was reported, and sensitivity analysis suggested that excluded studies did not significantly alter the pooled prevalence of GDM/PIH co-occurrence. A statistically significant association between GDM and PIH was observed, with pregnant women with GDM being three times more likely to develop PIH compared to those without GDM (OR = 3.44; 95% CI; 2.15–5.53).</p> Conclusion <p>This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed a high dual burden of GDM and PIH among pregnant women in Ethiopia, with a significant association between the two morbidities. These findings emphasize the critical need for comprehensive antenatal care programs in Ethiopia to adequately address and monitor both GDM and PIH for improved maternal and perinatal health outcomes.</p>","author":"Eyob Girma Abera","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c7d558fdac50f0e51e4574425e00f95d1f1f4195e6471574d019a7dd4187e2e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
