{"title":"Unveiling Stage Zero Conditions in the New Forest National Park: A UAV‐Based Structure‐From‐Motion Photogrammetry and LiDAR Approach for Reconstructing an Anastomosing Wet Woodland at the Avon Water","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4382?af=R","date":1726734318000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>In recent years, there have been significant technological advances in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and in particular the use of lightweight consumer-grade ‘drones’. This combined with the development of structure-from-motion (SfM) technology has provided river restoration practitioners with a new tool that can be used to give an affordable, repeatable and objective assessment of river restoration projects. In this study, a combined SfM photogrammetry and LiDAR approach is utilised on a section of the Avon water, a small watercourse in the New Forest National Park. Victorian-era straightening and channelisation has significantly altered the ecological and morphological state of the river system, but recent river restoration projects aim to reverse these effects. Whilst historic maps may be used as a guide to reveal the former alignment, changes in river planform occurred much earlier and these maps may not represent the natural course of the river. High-resolution orthophotos and 3D photogrammetric models of the site are created that reveal a palaeolandscape consisting of a mosaic of anabranching channels. These are interpreted to represent a former anastomosing wet woodland and ‘Stage Zero’ of the river system. It is inferred that early human habitation and associated land clearance altered hydrological and hydrogeological conditions, reducing floodplain connectivity and promoting single-threaded planform configurations. This was then followed by the most recent Victorian-era straightening. The palaeolandscape revealed by the study provides a guide for future Stage Zero river restoration in the New Forest and elsewhere, demonstrating an application of low cost, UAV-derived photogrammetry in river restoration research.</p>","author":"Edward Fleming","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"5cac2408a039cf46c7e9dc7b89a1b1b5b3c34bea21907740f7ca1d6c0b6b9c60","category":"Environment"}
