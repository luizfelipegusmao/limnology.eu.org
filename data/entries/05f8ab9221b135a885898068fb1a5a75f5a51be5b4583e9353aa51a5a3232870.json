{"title":"Trigonelline Chloride Ameliorated Triphenyltin-Induced Testicular Autophagy, Inflammation, and Apoptosis: Role of Recovery","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/1/133/7503555?rss=1","date":1703808000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Triphenyltin chloride (TPT-Cl) is an organometallic organotin. This study aimed to investigate the role of trigonelline (TG) along with the impact of TPT withdrawal on the testicular toxicity induced by TPT-Cl. Thirty-six adult male albino rats were divided into control, TG (40 mg/kg/day), TPT-Cl (0.5 mg/kg/day), TG + TPT-Cl, and recovery groups. Animals were daily gavaged for 12 weeks. Both TG and TPT-Cl withdrawal improved TPT-Cl-induced testicular toxicity features involving testis and relative testis weight reduction, luteinizing hormone, follicular stimulating hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin elevation, reduction of inhibin B, free testosterone levels, and sperm count reduction with increased abnormal sperm forms. Moreover, both TG and TPT-Cl withdrawal reduced inflammatory activin A, follistatin, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and proapoptotic Bax and elevated antiapoptotic Bcl2 in testicular tissues mediated by TPT-Cl. TG and TPT-Cl withdrawal restored the excessive autophagy triggered by TPT-Cl via elevation of mTOR, AKT, PI3K, and P62/SQSTM1 and reduction of AMPK, ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3 mRNA gene expressions and regained the deteriorated testicular structure. In conclusion, TG and TPT-Cl withdrawal had an ameliorative role in partially reversing TPT-Cl-induced testicular toxicity. However, the findings indicated that the use of TG as an adjunctive factor is more favorable than TPT-Cl withdrawal, suggesting the capability of the testis for partial self-improvement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"05f8ab9221b135a885898068fb1a5a75f5a51be5b4583e9353aa51a5a3232870","category":"Environment"}
