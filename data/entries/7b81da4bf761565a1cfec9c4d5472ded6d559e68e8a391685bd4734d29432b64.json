{"title":"In vitro to in vivo extrapolation from 3D hiPSC-derived cardiac microtissues and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to inform next-generation arrhythmia risk assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/1/145/7696325?rss=1","date":1718755200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Proarrhythmic cardiotoxicity remains a substantial barrier to drug development as well as a major global health challenge. In vitro human pluripotent stem cell-based new approach methodologies have been increasingly proposed and employed as alternatives to existing in vitro and in vivo models that do not accurately recapitulate human cardiac electrophysiology or cardiotoxicity risk. In this study, we expanded the capacity of our previously established 3D human cardiac microtissue model to perform quantitative risk assessment by combining it with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, allowing a direct comparison of potentially harmful concentrations predicted in vitro to in vivo therapeutic levels. This approach enabled the measurement of concentration responses and margins of exposure for 2 physiologically relevant metrics of proarrhythmic risk (i.e. action potential duration and triangulation assessed by optical mapping) across concentrations spanning 3 orders of magnitude. The combination of both metrics enabled accurate proarrhythmic risk assessment of 4 compounds with a range of known proarrhythmic risk profiles (i.e. quinidine, cisapride, ranolazine, and verapamil) and demonstrated close agreement with their known clinical effects. Action potential triangulation was found to be a more sensitive metric for predicting proarrhythmic risk associated with the primary mechanism of concern for pharmaceutical-induced fatal ventricular arrhythmias, delayed cardiac repolarization due to inhibition of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel, or hERG channel. This study advances human-induced pluripotent stem cell-based 3D cardiac tissue models as new approach methodologies that enable in vitro proarrhythmic risk assessment with high precision of quantitative metrics for understanding clinically relevant cardiotoxicity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"7b81da4bf761565a1cfec9c4d5472ded6d559e68e8a391685bd4734d29432b64","category":"Environment"}
