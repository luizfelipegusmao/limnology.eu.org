All types of costs, including direct medication costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect costs due to loss of work. Data were collected from online databases and literature reviews. Results: Cost of illness analysis estimated that the cost of Acne Vulgaris treatment varies for mild, Moderate and severe acne. Acne is causing an annual economic burden of PKR 1,92,366 PKR per person (direct cost is PKR 1,86,366 and indirect cost 6,000) for an expensive treatment and PKR 53,550 (direct cost is PKR 47550 and indirect cost 6,000) for a cheap treatment. Limitation: Being an LMIC, Pakistan needs extensive study on the pharmacoeconomic analysis of Acne for proper and rational allocation of resources. Conclusion: Acne has a significant economic burden in Pakistan. Even with significant impact of Acne, there is very minute work done about Acne in Pakistan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03abee51699e5f4487fa87004562c63b24a0f3e51e0bd340408804ee86ad50d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
