This review investigates the intricate balance between harnessing nanotechnology for enhanced crop productivity, negative impact, resource efficiency, and environmental sustainability. It cautiously addresses the potential ecological and health implications while navigating the double-edged sword of nanotechnology applications in agriculture for a resilient and responsible future.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Nanotechnology is a rapidly developing discipline that has the potential to transform the way we approach problems in a variety of fields, including agriculture. The use of nanotechnology in sustainable agriculture has gained popularity in recent years. It has various applications in agriculture, such as the development of nanoscale materials and devices to boost agricultural productivity, enhance food quality and safety, improve the efficiency of water and nutrient usage, and reduce environmental pollution. Nanotechnology has proven to be very beneficial in this field, particularly in the development of nanoscale delivery systems for agrochemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and growth regulators. These nanoscale delivery technologies offer various benefits over conventional delivery systems, including better penetration and distribution, enhanced efficacy, and lower environmental impact. Encapsulating agrochemicals in nanoscale particles enables direct delivery to the targeted site in the plant, thereby reducing waste and minimizing off-target effects. Plants are fundamental building blocks of all ecosystems and evaluating the interaction between nanoparticles (NPs) and plants is a crucial aspect of risk assessment. This critical review therefore aims to provide an overview of the latest advances regarding the positive and negative effects of nanotechnology in agriculture. It also explores potential future research directions focused on ensuring the safe utilization of NPs in this field, which could lead to sustainable development. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Kavita Shukla, \nVishnu Mishra, \nJawahar Singh, \nVishal Varshney, \nRajnandini Verma, \nSudhakar Srivastava","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"de8fb12d43468154b636b27626e4d9566aabecc725f0e607114a82f5a6383e87","category":"Environment"}
