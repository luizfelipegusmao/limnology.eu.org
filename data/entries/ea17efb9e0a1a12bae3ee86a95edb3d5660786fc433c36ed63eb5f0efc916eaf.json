{"title":"A Survey of Computer Vision Algorithm Applied in Driverless Robotic Vehicles with Sensing Capability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1051/v1","date":1715773453000,"content":"Within environmental perception, automatic navigation and object detection, computer vision is a crucial and demanding field with many applications in modern industries, such as multi-target long-term visual tracking in automated production, defect detection, and driverless robotic vehicles with sensing ability. The performance of computer vision has greatly improved recently thanks to developments in deep learning algorithms and hardware computing capabilities, which has spawned the creation of a large number of related applications. This paper presents the results of a detailed review of over 50 papers published over the course of two decades (1999â€“2024), with a primary focus on the technical advancement of computer vision. To elucidate the foundational principles, an examination of typical visual algorithms based on traditional correlation filtering was initially conducted. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of the most recent advancements in deep learning-based computer vision techniques was compiled. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between conventional and novel algorithms was undertaken to discuss the future trends and directions of computer vision. Lastly, the feasibility of employing visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms in the context of autonomous vehicles with sensing capability was explored. Furthermore, we explored a thorough and efficient architecture for utilizing these techniques in autonomous robotic vehicles into unmanned green and low-carbon smart factories, underlining novel advances as well as potential prospects for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea17efb9e0a1a12bae3ee86a95edb3d5660786fc433c36ed63eb5f0efc916eaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
