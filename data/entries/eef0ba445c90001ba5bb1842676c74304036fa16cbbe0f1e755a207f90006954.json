{"title":"Global synthesis of effects and feedbacks from artificial reefs on socioecological systems in recreational fisheries","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12809?af=R","date":1708005086000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Artificial reefs have been widely deployed with the intention of increasing fish habitat, enhancing recreational fishery opportunities and providing socio-economic benefits to surrounding communities. Substantial work has been done to understand the ecology of artificial reefs but the efficacy of artificial reefs as a management tool hinges on socioecological feedbacks that are not well understood. Socioecological feedbacks are difficult to discern because they depend on multiple and complex interactions between fish, fishers, managers and habitats. To better understand the net effects of artificial reefs on recreational fisheries, we conducted a literature review to catalogue effects and feedbacks of artificial reefs. Our global synthesis revealed that artificial reefs may result in a net negative effect on fish populations, at least in the short-term, as catch-driven effects bolstering socio-economic objectives occur more often or at greater intensities than positive biological effects. We have highlighted important effects of artificial reefs and feedbacks that need to be accounted for when considering their deployment in fishery management. There may be unintended consequences if biological benefits from habitat-to-fish and fish-to-fish feedbacks are outweighed by population losses due to greater socio-economic benefits from fish-to-fisher feedbacks. Taken in concert with their semi-permanent nature and apparent popularity with stakeholders, a view emerges of artificial reefs possibly functioning as a ‘social-ecological trap’. This work emphasizes the need for robust assessments of the effects of artificial reefs, as well as more formal decision science approaches for implementing of these structures.</p>","author":"Lisa Chong, \nZachary A.
