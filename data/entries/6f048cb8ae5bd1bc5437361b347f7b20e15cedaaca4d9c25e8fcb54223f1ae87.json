{"title":"An Overview of Tools and Technologies for Anxiety and Depression Management Using AI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0881/v1","date":1723561606000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the utilization and effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in managing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The primary objectives are to identify current AI tools, analyze their practicality and efficacy, and assess their potential benefits and risks. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases such as ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ResearchGate, focusing on publications from the last five years. The search utilized keywords including \"artificial intelligence,\" \"applications,\" \"mental health,\" \"anxiety,\" \"LLMs\" and \"depression\". Various AI tools, including chatbots, mobile applications, wearables, virtual reality settings, and large language models (LLMs), were examined and categorized based on their functions in mental health care. The findings indicate that AI applications, including LLMs, show significant promise in symptom management, offering accessible and personalized interventions that can complement traditional mental health treatments. Tools such as AI-driven chatbots, mobile apps, and LLMs have demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, improving user engagement and mental health outcomes. LLMs, in particular, have shown potential in enhancing therapeutic chatbots, diagnostic tools, and personalized treatment plans by providing immediate support and resources, thus reducing the workload on mental health professionals. However, limitations include concerns over data privacy, the potential for over-reliance on technology, and the need for human oversight to ensure comprehensive care. Ethical considerations, such as data security and the balance between AI and human interaction, were also addressed. The study concludes that while AI, including LLMs, has the potential to significantly aid mental health care, it should be used as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, human therapists. Future research should focus on enhancing data security measures, integrating AI tools with traditional therapeutic methods, and exploring the long-term effects of AI interventions on mental health. Further investigation is also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI applications across diverse populations and settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f048cb8ae5bd1bc5437361b347f7b20e15cedaaca4d9c25e8fcb54223f1ae87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
