{"title":"Male recognition of conspecific female chemical cues in a diverse clade of freshwater fishes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15600?af=R","date":1710504692000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Where orangethroat darters (<i>Etheostoma: Ceasia</i>) and rainbow darters (<i>Etheostoma caeruleum</i>) co-occur, males prefer conspecific over heterospecific females. The cues males use to identify conspecific females remain unclear. We conducted behavioral trials to ask whether chemical cues function in conspecific recognition. We found that males from three orangethroat darter species preferentially associate with female scent over a control. Our results support the use of olfaction in conspecific identification in the orangethroat clade and contribute to our understanding of signals that may facilitate species recognition and underlie the evolution of behavioral isolation.</p>","author":"Taylor N.
