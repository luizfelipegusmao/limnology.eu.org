{"title":"Severe acute malnutrition among children under the age of 5 years","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309122","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Gift C. Chama, Lukundo Siame, Chanda Kapoma, Benson M. Hamooya, Sepiso K. Masenga</p>\r\nBackground <p>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) poses a significant threat to child health globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Zambia, like many Sub-Saharan African nations, faces high rates of child malnutrition, with SAM contributing significantly to under-five mortality. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with SAM.</p> Methods <p>This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Livingstone University Teaching Hospital in Zambia (LUTH). SAM was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as either weight-for-height less than -3 standard deviations, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) less than 115 mm, or presence of bilateral pitting edema in children between 6 months and 5 years old who were attended to between 2020 and 2022. Data abstraction from pediatric patient records was conducted between August 2023 and January 2024. The records without the age and outcome variable were excluded. A total of 429 participants between 6 months and 5 years old were included, with demographic, clinical, and hematological parameters analyzed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were employed to investigate factors associated with SAM.</p> Results <p>Overall, 429 medical records were included in the study and the prevalence of SAM was 27.0% (n = 116). Age group 6–24 months (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 11.60; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.34–40.89, p&lt;0.001), living with HIV (AOR:3.90; 95% CI: 1.14–13.70, p = 0.034), Tuberculosis (TB) (AOR:22.30, 95% CI: 4.53, 110.3, p &lt; 0.001), comorbidities (AOR: 2.50; 95% CI 1.13, 5.88, p = 0.024) and platelet count (AOR: 1.00; 95% CI 1.00, 1.00, p = 0.027) were positively associated with SAM.</p> Conclusions <p>This study found a high prevalence of SAM, exceeding the WHO target of reducing SAM to 5% by 2025. SAM was associated with younger age (6–24 months), HIV infection, TB, comorbidities and platelet count. Therefore, there is need to enhance strategies aimed at reducing SAM among young children, children living with HIV, TB and comorbidities, particularly by intensive treatment, continuing and strengthening nutrition services.</p>","author":"Gift C.
