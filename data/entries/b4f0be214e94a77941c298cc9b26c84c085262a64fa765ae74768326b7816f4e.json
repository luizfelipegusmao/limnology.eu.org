For complex systems made from the assembly of several chemical compounds, investigations relying on conventional imaging are often not sufficient to reveal their organization and properties. Moreover, nanostructured systems require analytical techniques providing data at high spatial resolution. Analytical electron microscopies are well suited to furnishing such information about the chemical composition and organization. For instance, STEM-EELS provides an in-depth and local analysis with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level: elements composing the specimen can be identified, as can their chemical states by analyzing the fine structures of the corresponding atomic ionization edges [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B1\">1</a>]. Furthermore, the latest-generation microscopes equipped with monochromated electron guns cover excitations over a wide energy range, from tens of meV (infrared range) to hundreds of eV (soft X-rays) with an energy resolution better than 10 meV [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B2\">2</a>]. Based on this multimodality, EELS provides, in a single experiment, spectral signatures that are comparable to those from the corresponding photon-based spectroscopies. However, EELS signals are orders of magnitude lower than the standard imaging signals and the acquisitions usually require high electron doses which lead to the destruction of sensitive materials. The recent development of direct electron detectors (DED) for EELS analysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B1\">1</a>] makes it possible to circumvent this limitation. DEDs can record very weak EELS signals acquired in very low dose conditions, down to 10 e-/Ã…<sup>2</sup>; as low as those employed for cryo-TEM imaging of biological specimens. The combination of such low electron doses with cryogenic temperatures allows one to investigate sensitive specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B4\">4</a>]. Non-degraded signatures can be obtained and their distributions mapped at the nanoscale (&lt; 10nm) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B4\">4</a>] (Figure 1). Furthermore, degradation effects can be monitored by carefully adjusting the electron doses and identifying the chemical compounds formed under the electron irradiation [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B4\">4</a>]. These recent results demonstrate the scope of EELS for analyzing organic compounds such as polymers and biomolecules and deciphering the mechanisms involved in complex chemical reactions [<a href=\"#ozae044.1062-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b4f0be214e94a77941c298cc9b26c84c085262a64fa765ae74768326b7816f4e","category":"Environment"}
