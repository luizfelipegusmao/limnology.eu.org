{"title":"Salmonella Inactivation Model by UV-C Light Treatment in Chicken Breast","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0131/v1","date":1722571472000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of inactivating Salmonella enteritidis in fresh chicken breast by irradiation using a combination of short-wave UV (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 J / cm2) and a natural antimicrobial such as caffeine (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 nM/g) as alternative proposals to conventional techniques to reduce pathogens in food. The temperatures used were from 2 to 22Â°C. The most suitable models were double Weibull in 60% of cases with an adjustment of R2 0.9903-0.9553 and Weibull + cola, in 46.67%, with an adjustment of R2 of 0.9998-0.9981. Noting that the most effective combination in the reduction of Salmonella was 12 J/cm2 of UV light and 15 nM/g of caffeine, with a reduction of 6 CFU/g and an inactivation rate of 0.72. The synergistic effect was observed by increasing caffeine and UV light. Furthermore, the physic-chemical characteristics of the food matrix were not affected by the combination of both technologies. Therefore, these results suggest that this combination can be used in the food industry to effectively inactivate Salmonella enteritidis, without deteriorating product quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6feae3a8a2979d406be6cb909ad5fa78e34186313aa98d9af7807b4ddf2a63c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
