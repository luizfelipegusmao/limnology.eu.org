{"title":"Eye tracking evidence for the reinstatement of emotionally negative and neutral memories","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303755","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Paula P.

Norman, Maureen Ritchey</p>\r\n\r\nRecent eye tracking studies have linked gaze reinstatement—when eye movements from encoding are reinstated during retrieval—with memory performance. In this study, we investigated whether gaze reinstatement is influenced by the affective salience of information stored in memory, using an adaptation of the emotion-induced memory trade-off paradigm. Participants learned word-scene pairs, where scenes were composed of negative or neutral objects located on the left or right side of neutral backgrounds. This allowed us to measure gaze reinstatement during scene memory tests based on whether people looked at the side of the screen where the object had been located. Across two experiments, we behaviorally replicated the emotion-induced memory trade-off effect, in that negative object memory was better than neutral object memory at the expense of background memory. Furthermore, we found evidence that gaze reinstatement was related to recognition memory for the object and background scene components. This effect was generally comparable for negative and neutral memories, although the effects of valence varied somewhat between the two experiments. Together, these findings suggest that gaze reinstatement occurs independently of the processes contributing to the emotion-induced memory trade-off effect.","author":"Paula P.
