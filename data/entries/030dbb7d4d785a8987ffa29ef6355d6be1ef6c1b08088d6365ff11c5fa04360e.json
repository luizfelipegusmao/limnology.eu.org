{"title":"Application of elementary probability models for text homogeneity and segmentation: A case study of Bible","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303432","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Berhane Abebe</p>\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this study, A statistical test of Biblical books was conducted using the recently discovered probability models for text homogeneity and text change point detection. Accordingly, translations of Biblical books of Tigrigna and Amharic (major languages spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia) and English were studied. A Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution with a parameter range of 0.55 to 0.88 was obtained in these three Bibles. According to the statistical analysis of the texts’ homogeneity, the translation of Bible in each of these three languages was a heterogeneous concatenation of different books or genres. Furthermore, an in-depth examination of the text segmentation of prat of a single genre—the English Bible letters revealed that the Pauline letters are heterogeneous concatenations of two homogeneous segments.","author":"Berhane Abebe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"030dbb7d4d785a8987ffa29ef6355d6be1ef6c1b08088d6365ff11c5fa04360e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
