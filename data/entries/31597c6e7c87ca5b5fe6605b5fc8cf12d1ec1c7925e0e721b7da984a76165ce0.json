{"title":"Investigating the degradation potential of microbial consortia for perfluorooctane sulfonate through a functional \"top-down\" screening approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303904","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Yu Liang, Anzhou Ma</p>\r\n\r\nPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a prominent perfluorinated compound commonly found in the environment, known to pose various risks to human health. However, the removal of PFOS presents significant challenges, primarily due to the limited discovery of bacteria capable of effectively degrading PFOS. Moreover, single degradation bacteria often encounter obstacles in individual cultivation and the breakdown of complex pollutants. In contrast, microbial consortia have shown promise in pollutant degradation. This study employed a continuous enrichment method, combined with multiple co-metabolic substrates, to investigate a microbial consortium with the potential for PFOS degradation. By employing this methodology, we effectively identified a microbial consortium that demonstrated the capacity to reduce PFOS when exposed to an optimal concentration of methanol. The consortium predominantly comprised of Hyphomicrobium species (46.7%) along with unclassified microorganisms (53.0%). Over a duration of 20 days, the PFOS concentration exhibited a notable decrease of 56.7% in comparison to the initial level, while considering the exclusion of adsorption effects. Furthermore, by comparing the predicted metabolic pathways of the microbial consortium with the genome of a known chloromethane-degrading bacterium, Hyphomicrobium sp. MC1, using the KEGG database, we observed distinct variations in the metabolic pathways, suggesting the potential role of the unclassified microorganisms. These findings underscore the potential effectiveness of a \"top-down\" functional microbial screening approach in the degradation of stubborn pollutants.","author":"Yu Liang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"31597c6e7c87ca5b5fe6605b5fc8cf12d1ec1c7925e0e721b7da984a76165ce0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
