{"title":"Investigation of Increased Particle Size Distribution for PBF-LB/M Using Ti-6Al-4V","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0602/v1","date":1715567343000,"content":"This study investigates the potential benefits of integrating coarser particle size distributions (PSDs) of 45-106 µm into laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M), aiming to reduce costs while maintaining quality standards. Despite the considerable advantages of PBF-LB/M in producing intricate geometries with high precision, the high cost of metal powders remains a barrier to widespread adoption. By exploring the use of coarser PSDs, particularly from electron beam-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-EB/M), significant cost-saving opportunities are identified. Through comprehensive powder characterization, process analysis, and mechanical property evaluation, this study demonstrates that PBF-LB/M can effectively utilize coarser powders while achieving comparable mechanical properties to those produced with 20-53 µm PSD. Adaptations in process parameters enable the successful processing of coarser powders, maintaining high-relative density components with minimal porosity. Additionally, market surveys reveal substantial cost differentials between PBF-LB/M and PBF-EB/M powders, indicating 40 % cost reduction potential by integrating coarser PSDs into PBF-LB/M. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the economic and technical feasibility of printing with coarser powders in PBF-LB/M, offering promising avenues for cost reduction without compromising quality, thus enhancing competitiveness and adoption of the technology in manufacturing applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a888fa285a9a4067566a865b9c9e0944082fcee1093644d5d243d1b3100ee78c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
