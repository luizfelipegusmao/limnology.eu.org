{"title":"Comparison of Clinical and Morpho-anatomical Characteristics in Aneurysmal Degenerated and Non-aneurysmal Insufficient Great Saphenous Vein","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0962/v1","date":1728713812000,"content":"Background: Saphenous vein degeneration is associated with significant morphological changes. This study compares the clinical and morpho-anatomical characteristics between patients with aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal insufficient great saphenous vein (GSV). Methods: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on 75 patients with chronic venous disease. Patients were divided into Group A (n=17, GSV diameter ≥1.2 cm) and Group B (n=58, GSV diameter 0.6-1.2 cm). Clinical data and morpho-anatomical features were assessed using ultrasonography and histopathological examination. Results: Group A had significantly larger GSV diameter (1.4 ± 0.2 cm vs. 0.7 ± 0.1 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and wall thickness (0.4 ± 0.1 cm vs. 0.2 ± 0.1 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Elastic fiber fragmentation was more severe in Group A (55% vs. 29%, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Group A also had a higher mean BMI (31.4 ± 4.5 kg/m² vs. 27.4 ± 4.0 kg/m², p = 0.007) and longer hospitalization (2.1 ± 0.6 days vs. 1.5 ± 0.6 days, p = 0.0023). Conclusions: Aneurysmal degeneration is linked to more severe clinical and morphoanatomical changes, indicating a need for closer monitoring and more aggressive treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca395ebab3b7188d36d94a2f58cb8e99e923b389a00e61e490721daedb3c02b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
