{"title":"The Zilch-Zitter Electron","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1599/v1","date":1724320945000,"content":"This paper contains a comparative review of existing Zitterbewegung models. It attempts to synthesize them by offering a toy model containing an extra hypothesis of electromagnetic self-oscillation at the Fermi scale (10−15m). Inspired by Bell violation experiments, Zitterbewegung models and hydrodynamic walker studies, we revisit standing waves in quantum mechanics, echoing de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theories. Starting with the electromagnetic self-oscillation hypothesis at the Fermi scale we propose an emergent and deductive hierarchical electron structure across multiple scales. The model spans Fermi, Compton (10−13m), Bohr (10−11m) and finally de Broglie (&amp;gt;10−10m). At the Fermi scale, the hypothesis is one of \"source-free chiral light\", known as the \"zilch\", emerging as a self-oscillating electromagnetic field at the Schwinger limit. This self-interaction of retarded potentials due to real relativistic delays is a generic self-oscillation of Liénard-Wiechert potentials. This primary Fermi oscillation accounts for charge and mass at the Fermi scale. It generates secondary stable \"auto-orbits\" dynamics at the Compton scale, manifesting as observable spin and other quantum properties of the usual Dirac zitterbewegung models. These zitter models account for known electron characteristics, including mass, charge, spin and g/2 anomalous factors up to 9 digits precision. We explain the de Broglie wavelength through Doppler-shifted Compton-scale standing waves, in the tradition of de Broglie. The framework extends to electron-positron pair production at the Schwinger limit, described as a result of natural light focusing in non-homogeneous media, utilizing René Thom’s catastrophe theory. This offers a new perspective on baryogenesis and matter emergence from electromagnetic fields. We dub this toy model the \"sub-standard\" model of the electron.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"909c0b5052c70ab79c51f2c3cbcd47ac534c0f589f62f750a12a4a7b87e8ac1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
