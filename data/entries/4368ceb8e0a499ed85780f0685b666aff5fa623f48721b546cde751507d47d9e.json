{"title":"The economic displacement of thousands of fishers in the Pantanal, Brazil: A telling story of small‐scale fisheries marginalization worldwide.","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12856?af=R","date":1725515090000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A new policy in the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, aims to economically displace thousands of artisanal fishers from one-third of the region. The legislation disregards several FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainability in Small-Scale Fisheries' guiding principles (SSF guidelines). Considering that 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of these guidelines, this policy represents a significant setback for fish and fisheries worldwide. In this paper, we show that the legislation is part of long-term agenda against small-scale fishers in the Pantanal, aiming to use narratives around overfishing to justify physical and economic displacements—albeit no empirical evidence showing impact on fish stocks. We also show that, as in many other small-scale fisheries worldwide, overfishing narratives are, in fact, used to open space for industrial activities and large infrastructure projects. The Pantanal is a telling story of that, since the new legislation will likely open space for the construction of over 50 small hydroelectric dams in the Pantanal and surrounding area. We argue that, first, it is urgent to abolish the new legislation and promote a pro-fishers agenda in the Pantanal to protect the region. However, since this is not unique for the region, it is critical to implement international programmes that celebrate and support local fisheries worlwide and avoid physical and economic displacements. Stands out turning SSF guidelines into international agreements, implementing citizens science programmes and expanding the fisher's tenure rights through innovative mechanizes of ownership. By better protecting local small-scale fishers in the Pantanal and worldwide we are more likely to guarantee a sustainable future for ecosystems and its peoples.</p>","author":"Adriana Maria Espinoza Fernando, \nDouglas Alves Lopes, \nLúcia Mateus, \nJerry Penha, \nYzel Rondon Súarez, \nAgostinho Carlos Catella, \nAndré Valle Nunes, \nNeusa Arenhart, \nRafael Morais Chiaravalloti","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3de509ad0f312c77d6dd4d37070c89263edb7695bf1d0e15e1eb17cfd4455e34","entryHash":"4368ceb8e0a499ed85780f0685b666aff5fa623f48721b546cde751507d47d9e","category":"Environment"}
