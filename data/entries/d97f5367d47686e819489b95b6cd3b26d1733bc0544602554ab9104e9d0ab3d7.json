{"title":"Essential oil from Citrus depressa peel exhibits antimicrobial, antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive effects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13280?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Many diseases may be caused by pathogens and oxidative stress resulting from carcinogens. Earlier studies have highlighted the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of plant essential oils (EO). It is crucial to effectively utilize agricultural waste to achieve a sustainable agricultural economy and protect the environment. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of EO extracted from the discarded peels of <i>Citrus depressa</i> Hayata (CD) and <i>Citrus microcarpa</i> Bunge (CM), synonyms of <i>Citrus deliciosa</i> Ten and <i>Citrus japonica</i> Thunb, respectively.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the main compounds in CD-EO were (<i>R</i>)-(+)-limonene (38.97%), <i>γ</i>-terpinene (24.39%) and linalool (6.22%), whereas, in CM-EO, the main compounds were (<i>R</i>)-(+)-limonene (48.00%), <i>β</i>-pinene (13.60%) and <i>γ</i>-terpinene (12.07%). CD-EO exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of common microorganisms, including <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. However, CM-EO showed only inhibitory effects on <i>E. coli</i>. Furthermore, CD-EO exhibited superior antioxidant potential, as demonstrated by its ability to eliminate 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate free radicals. Furthermore, CD-EO at a concentration of 100 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> significantly inhibited 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced cancer transformation in mouse epidermal JB6 P+ cells (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), possibly by up-regulating protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its downstream antioxidant enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, heme oxygenase-1 and UGT1A.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings suggest that CD-EO exhibits inhibitory effects on pathogenic microorganisms, possesses antioxidant properties and has cancer chemopreventive potential. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yu‐Xiang Weng, \nHsiao‐Chi Wang, \nYung‐Lin Chu, \nYun‐Zhen Wu, \nJie‐An Liao, \nZheng‐Yuan Su","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d97f5367d47686e819489b95b6cd3b26d1733bc0544602554ab9104e9d0ab3d7","category":"Environment"}
