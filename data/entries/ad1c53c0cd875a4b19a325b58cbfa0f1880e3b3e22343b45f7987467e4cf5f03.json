{"title":"Technology empowerment: Digital transformation and enterprise ESG performance—Evidence from China’s manufacturing sector","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302029","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Xianyun Wu, Longji Li, Dekuan Liu, Qian Li</p>\r\n\r\nIn light of the long-term constraints posed by the \"dual carbon\" objective, can digital technology emerge as a transformative solution for enterprises to embark on a sustainable development trajectory? The existing body of research has yet to reach a consensus. In order to shed further light on the intricate relationship between digital transformation and ESG performance of enterprises, this study empirically examines the mechanisms and boundaries through which digital transformation influences ESG performance, based on observational data from A-share manufacturing listed companies in Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange spanning from 2011 to 2021. The findings demonstrate that digital transformation exerts a significant positive impact on the ESG performance of manufacturing enterprises. Mechanism analysis reveals that the enabling effect of digital transformation primarily enhances company transparency, thereby fostering continuous improvements in ESG performance among manufacturing enterprises. The performance expectation gap will give rise to the phenomenon of \"stop-loss in time\" and impede the promotional impact of digital transformation. Further investigation into industrial characteristics and industry competition intensity indicates that state-owned enterprises and those operating within highly competitive environments experience more pronounced effects of digital transformation on their ESG performance. This study expands the mechanism and boundary of digital transformation on ESG performance of manufacturing enterprises, and provides a new perspective for manufacturing enterprises to realize the collaborative transformation of digital and green.","author":"Xianyun Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ad1c53c0cd875a4b19a325b58cbfa0f1880e3b3e22343b45f7987467e4cf5f03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
