{"title":"Pregnancy outcomes before and during COVID-19 pandemic in Tamale Metropolis, Ghana: A retrospective cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302589","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Obed Duah Kwaku Asumadu, Michael Boah, Dennis Chirawurah, Joyce Aputere Ndago, Vida Nyagre Yakong, David Abatanie Kanligi, Martin Nyaaba Adokiya</p>\r\nBackground <p>The COVID-19 pandemic affected expectant mothers seeking maternal health services in most developing countries. Access and utilization of maternal health services including antenatal care (ANC) attendance and skilled delivery declined drastically resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study assessed pregnancy outcomes before and during COVID-19 pandemic in Tamale Metropolis, Ghana.</p> Methods/Design <p>A retrospective cohort study design was employed. A random sampling technique was used to select 450 women who delivered before or during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamale Metropolis, Ghana. The respondents were interviewed using structured questionnaire at their homes. In this study, the data collected were socio-demographics characteristics, ANC attendance, before or during pandemic delivery, place of delivery and birth outcomes. Chi-square test and bivariate logistic regression analyses were performed under significant level of 0.05 to determine factors associated with the outcome variables.</p> Result <p>Of the 450 respondents, 51.8% were between 26 and 30 years of age. More than half (52.2%) of the respondents had no formal education and 93.3% were married. The majority (60.4%) of the respondents described their residence as urban setting. About 31.6% of the women delivered before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced place of delivery. The proportion of women who attended at least one ANC visit (84.5% before vs 70.5% during), and delivered at a hospital (76.8% before vs 72.4% during) were higher before the pandemic. More women were likely to deliver at home during COVID-19 (OR: 2.38, 95%CI: 1.52–3.74, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, there was statistically significance difference between before and during COVID-19 delivery on at least one ANC attendance (OR: 2.72, 95%CI: 1.58–1.67, p&lt;0.001). Women who delivered during COVID-19 were about twice more likely to develop complications (OR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.03–2.87, p = 0.04).</p> Conclusion <p>ANC attendance and health facility delivery decreased while pregnancy complications increased during COVID-19. During disease outbreaks, outreach engagement strategies should be devised to increase access and utilization of maternal health services for marginalized and underserved populations. The capacity of health workers should be strengthened through skills training to manage adverse birth outcomes.</p>","author":"Obed Duah Kwaku Asumadu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dc4a32004082d167c957455f1dd08c907bb39ba327b34a6eecdd5e1c1185876b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
