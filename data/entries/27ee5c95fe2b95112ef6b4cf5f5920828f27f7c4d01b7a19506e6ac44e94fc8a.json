{"title":"Preparation, characterization, and bioavailability evaluation of antioxidant phosvitin peptide‐ferrous complex","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13200?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is one of the commonest global nutritional deficiency diseases, and the low bioavailability of iron is a key contributing factor. The peptide-iron complex could be used as a novel iron supplement to improve iron bioavailability.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, antioxidant low molecular weight (&lt;3 kDa) phosvitin peptide (named PP-4) was separated to prepare a phosvitin peptide-ferrous complex (named PP-4-Fe); then the structural conformation of PP-4-Fe was characterized and its bioavailability by <i>in vitro</i> digestion was evaluated. The results showed that PP-4 had good ferrous-binding activity with 96.14 ± 2.86 μg Fe<sup>2+</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup>, and had a strong antioxidant effect with 995.61 ± 79.75 μmol TE mg<sup>−1</sup> in 2,2'-azinobis'3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 62.3 ± 3.95 μmol FeSO<sub>4</sub> mg<sup>−1</sup> in ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). After ferrous binding, the FRAP activity of PP-4-Fe, enhanced by 1.8 times, formed a more ordered structure with an increase in <i>α</i>-helix and decrease in <i>γ</i>-random coil. The ferrous binding sites of PP-4 involved were the amino, carboxyl, imidazole, and phosphate groups. The PP-4-Fe complex displayed excellent gastrointestinal stability and antioxidant effects during digestion. The iron dialysis percentage of PP-4-Fe was 74.59% ± 0.68%, and increased to 81.10% ± 0.89% with the addition of 0.25 times vitamin C (VC). This indicated that PP-4-Fe displayed excellent bioavailability and VC in sufficient quantities had a synergistic effect on improving bioavailability.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrated that antioxidant phosvitin peptide was an efficient delivery system to protect ferrous ions and suggested that the phosvitin peptide-ferrous complex has strong potential as a ferrous supplement. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lushan Song, \nLinxian Zhu, \nSaifeng Qiao, \nLi Song, \nMingran Zhang, \nTianrui Xue, \nBinfei Lv, \nHuiping Liu, \nXiaowei Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"27ee5c95fe2b95112ef6b4cf5f5920828f27f7c4d01b7a19506e6ac44e94fc8a","category":"Environment"}
