{"title":"“Something we can all share”: Exploring the social significance of food insecurity for young people in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003137","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Laura J. Brown, Jenevieve Mannell, Laura Washington, Sivuyile Khaula, Andrew Gibbs</p>\r\n\r\nFood insecurity remains a pressing global issue and South Africa continues to face socioeconomic inequalities that make securing food a challenge for many young people. To address this challenge, we need better understanding of the social context of food and its importance in driving perceptions and behaviours about food and its scarcity. In this study, we examine the meaning of food for young people living in urban informal settlements and rural villages in KwaZulu-Natal, and investigate how they exert agency in the face of food insecurity. We use qualitative data from 17 photo/video elicitation interviews conducted from December 2020-January 2021 with young people experiencing food insecurity. The sample consisted of 9 women and 8 men who were part of the <i>Siyaphambili Youth (\"Youth Moving Forward\")</i> project. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Themes included the challenges young people face in securing food and money for food. However, in exploring young people’s agency, food also plays a critical role in shaping their identities and social networks. Relevant themes included the use of food as a means of bonding with others; solidifying relationships; and as a signifier of social status and gender roles. Despite the challenges of food insecurity, young people demonstrated resilience and agency, utilising social and gendered coping strategies to secure food and to maintain their social networks. Our study contributes to the understanding of food insecurity amongst young people in South Africa and highlights the need for a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to addressing this issue. We argue that interventions aimed at addressing food insecurity should prioritise the empowerment of local communities and consider the sociocultural and gendered context of food in their design and implementation.","author":"Laura J.
