{"title":"Revolutionizing Quantum Computing: Essence-Units and Energy States as Fundamental Programming Units","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0633/v1","date":1715325533000,"content":"Harnessing Quantum Energy States for Unprecedented Computing Capabilities In this proposal, we advocate for the use of energy states as fundamental units of quantum computer programming. Each unit of programming is conceptualized as an energy state, manifested as an essence-unit. An essence-unit, defined as the minimal form encapsulating complete uniqueness or specificity, serves as the cornerstone of this paradigm. This approach enables the recording of various forms of matter on quantum computers in essence-units, portraying their energy states. The recording of energy states is achieved through the creation of four distinct coherent potentials, facilitated by quantum dots or crystals. Crucially, these energy states embodied in essence-units resist subdivision. The study explores the intricate relationship among similarity, fractals, and uniqueness in quantum dot operations, revealing their profound implications for information transfer efficiency. Normalized entropy characterizes charge localized in quantum dot impurities in systems that have distortions. Through the utilization of N-level recording and entropy-fractal dimension equivalence, the paper elucidates the potential of quantum dots in reducing transmission time and modeling complex systems. The proposed methodology signifies a paradigm shift in quantum computing, presenting unparalleled possibilities for tackling hitherto insurmountable challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"235ac04d46968100f0a058ea15388b27272d5d4073b94bf3a7bd0073fc1b423f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
