{"title":"Marine Bacteriocins: An Evolutionary Gold Mine to Payoff Antibiotic Resistance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0442/v1","date":1722953630000,"content":"The rapid evolution of drug resistance is one of the greatest health issues of the 21st century. There is an alarming situation to find new therapeutic strategies or candidate drugs to tackle ongoing multi-drug resistance development. The marine environment is one of the prime natural ecosystems on Earth, the majority of which is still unexplored, especially when it comes to the microbes. A wide variety of bioactive compounds have been obtained from a varied range of marine organisms, however, marine bacteria-produced bacteriocins are still undermined. Owing to the distinct environmental stresses that marine bacterial communities encounter, their bioactive compounds frequently undergo distinct adaptations that confer on them a variety of shapes and functions, setting them apart from their terrestrial counterparts. The ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), bacteriocins are of special interest because of their variety in structure and diverse potential biological activities. Additionally, the gut microbiome of marine creatures are largely unexplored source of new bacteriocins with promising activities. There is a huge possibility of novel bacteriocins from marine bacterial communities that might come out as efficient candidates to fight against antibiotic resistance, especially in light of the growing pressure from antibiotic-resistant diseases and industrial desire for innovative treatments. The present review summarizes known bacteriocins from marine bacteria, evolutionary aspects, challenges, and huge possibilities of unexplored bacteriocins from marine bacterial communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c208f7fc32fc714354b5883558865a97d9d370bb6ff63cc9559a70dc57127fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
