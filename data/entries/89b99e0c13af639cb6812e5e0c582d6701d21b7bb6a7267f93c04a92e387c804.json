The available methodological approaches fell short of accurate visualization of VDAC1 in living cells. To permit precise VDAC1 imaging, we utilized the tetracysteine (TC)-tag and visualized VDAC1 dynamics in living cells. TC-tagged VDAC1 had a cluster-like distribution on mitochondria. The labeling of TC-tagged VDAC1 was validated with immunofluorescence. The majority of VDAC1-TC-clusters were localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. Notably, VDAC1 colocalized with BCL-2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)-clusters upon apoptotic stimulation. Using this new tool, we were able to observe VDAC1-TC at mitochondrial fission sites. These findings highlight the suitability of the TC-tag for live-cell imaging of VDAC1, shedding light on the roles of VDAC1 in cellular processes.","author":"Johannes Pilic","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"89b99e0c13af639cb6812e5e0c582d6701d21b7bb6a7267f93c04a92e387c804","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
