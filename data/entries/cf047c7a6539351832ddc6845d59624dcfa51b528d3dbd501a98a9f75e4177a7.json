{"title":"Successful Administration of Very High Doses of Adenosine Distal Coronary Administration using Export Catheter for Resistant No-reflow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2262/v1","date":1727694553000,"content":"Resistant no-reflow can be difficult to treat. Unfortunately, persistent no-reflow can increase cardiac adverse events. It can be very difficult to treat. Intracoronary injections of any  vasoactive substances into the proximal coronaries cannot efficiently infuse the distal coronary bed. In this case, we report distal administration of very high doses of Adenosine in a native coronary artery for a severe life-threatening resistant no-reflow. Using an export catheter, we could reverse this complication within seconds. This case elaborates on the importance of giving high doses of vasoactive drugs as distal as possible in the coronary arteries for resistant no-reflow using an export catheter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf047c7a6539351832ddc6845d59624dcfa51b528d3dbd501a98a9f75e4177a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
