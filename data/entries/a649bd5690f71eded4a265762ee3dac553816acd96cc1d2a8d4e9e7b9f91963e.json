{"title":"Comparative analysis of the effects of cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone on intestinal immunity and microbiota in delayed hypersensitivity mice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312147","date":1729173600000,"content":"<p>by Xiangling Li, Ruyan Wen, Ben Chen, Xia Luo, Lu Li, Jun Ai, Junlong Yu</p>\r\nBackground <p>The T cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is critical for elucidating cellular immune mechanisms, especially the role of memory T cells upon antigen re-exposure. This study aimed to investigate the specific effects of the immunosuppressive drugs Cyclophosphamide (CY) and Dexamethasone (DEX) on intestinal immunity and microbiota in a DTH mouse model, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of their immunomodulatory mechanisms.</p> Methods <p>Female BALB/c mice were sensitized to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and randomly allocated into control, CY, and DEX groups. The impact of CY and DEX on immune function was assessed through measurement of thymus and spleen indices, lymphocyte proliferation in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) using MTT assay, and flow cytometric analysis of T cell subsets and TCR expression. Intestinal secretory IgA (sIgA) was quantified by ELISA, and gut microbiota diversity was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.</p> Results <p>CY and DEX significantly reduced the immune function in DNFB-induced sensitized mice, as indicated by decreased thymus and spleen indices, MLN enlargement, intestinal sIgA content, and ear swelling degree. Flow cytometry revealed that CY increased the proportion of total CD3+ T cells but reduced CD3+CD69+ activated T cells and CD3+TCRγ/δ+ T cells, while DEX increased CD3+CD4+ helper T cells. Both drugs induced distinct changes in gut microbiota diversity and structure, with CY enhancing α diversity and DEX reducing it.</p> Conclusions <p>The study demonstrates that CY and DEX have distinct regulatory effects on the immune organ index, distribution of T cell subsets, and diversity and structure of gut microbiota on DTH-induced immune responses mice, suggesting their differential influence on intestinal mucosal immunity. These findings have implications for the development of targeted immunotherapies and understanding the interplay between immunosuppressive drugs and gut microbiota.</p>","author":"Xiangling Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a649bd5690f71eded4a265762ee3dac553816acd96cc1d2a8d4e9e7b9f91963e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
