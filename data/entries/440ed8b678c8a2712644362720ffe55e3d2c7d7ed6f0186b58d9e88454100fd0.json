{"title":"Gone with the stream: Functional connectivity of a cold‐water coral at basin scale","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12444?af=R","date":1708528481000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Lophelia pertusa</i> reefs are vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems and their ecological integrity partly depends on the connectivity and availability of suitable habitat. Moreover, connectivity is a guiding principle in marine conservation planning, particularly for spatial prioritization and for the design of networks of marine protected areas. We estimated the functional seascape connectivity of <i>L. pertusa</i> in the Mediterranean Sea and provide a framework for prioritizing habitat areas for the species conservation. These goals were achieved by simulating transport and potential dispersal of virtual larvae using biophysical modeling and assessing habitat availability based on the suitability and spatial arrangement of the seascape and inter-annual climatological variability. Habitat availability was estimated using a network analysis and accounting for the attributes of habitat areas (i.e., size and quality). The connectivity among Mediterranean ecoregions was weak and an increase in the frequency of climate-driven events (e.g., dense shelf water cascading) may worsen this scenario. However, the potential exchange of larvae between patches within the same ecoregion was high, favoring populations resilience to local disturbances. The analysis of habitat availability allowed identifying important habitat areas for the connectivity of the <i>L. pertusa</i> including the Gulf of Lion, the Apulian and Sicily Island continental margin. Some of the habitat areas identified as important for the connectivity of the <i>L. pertusa</i> are exposed to intense anthropogenic pressures, that may act synergistically with climate change imposing greater challenges to species conservation. These habitat areas may be prioritized in future management and conservation actions targeting <i>L. pertusa</i>.</p>","author":"Fábio L. Matos, \nJacopo Aguzzi, \nJoan B. Company, \nMarina R.
