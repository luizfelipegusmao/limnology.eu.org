{"title":"A Topology on Sums of Square-Free Ideals in Monoids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0792/v1","date":1715596239000,"content":"In this paper we define families of open sets as sums of idempotent ideals and sums of square-free ideals in a ring. We investigate some topological properties of such topologies. We define the square-free spectrum of a ring as the set of all square-free ideals and examine what topological properties it has for a given monoid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f39506811fa0478b5ac58ca2fb7ffd36d7877f78a9f24c8ab88d48472754845","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
