{"title":"Nephrotic Range Proteinuria and Restrictive Heart Failure in a Patient with Secondary Amyloidosis: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1689/v1","date":1714054291000,"content":"Systemic amyloidosis is a multisystem illness characterized by fibrillary protein deposition, which causes dysfunction in the afflicted organ systems. Its diagnosis is frequently delayed since the disease's symptoms are unpredictable and non-specific. Its two main variants are light chain (AL) amyloidosis and transthyretin-related ATTR amyloidosis, which has both a sporadic (wildtype, ATTRwt) and hereditary (mutated, ATTRv) subtype. We discuss a case of Amyloidosis emerging in the kidneys and heart as a result of chronic inflammation caused by failure to treat TB, as well as its typical radiological characteristics, clinical presentation, imaging and instrumental evaluations, and therapeutic plan. This case report serves as a good reminder to medical personnel to ensure thorough patient follow-up in order to avoid extremely unusual and late complications resulting from treatment default.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"452a370d6fc571ec0dabdabc47d5f12b9962e260f6bc8dbd69109f8673424072","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
