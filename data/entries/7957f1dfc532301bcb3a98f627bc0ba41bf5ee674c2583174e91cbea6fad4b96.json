{"title":"A Comparative Study of Composition and Soluble Polysaccharide Content between Brewer’s Spent Yeast and Cultured Yeast Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1218/v1","date":1713430870000,"content":"Yeast, crucial in beer production, holds promise as a valuable by-product resource, known as brewer's spent yeast (BSY), with potentially beneficial physiological effects. This study aimed to compare the composition and soluble polysaccharide content of Brewer's spent yeast with those of pure cultured yeast strains, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and S. boulardii (SB), to facilitate the utilization of BSY as an alternative source of functional polysaccharides. BSY exhibited significantly higher carbohydrate content and lower crude protein content than SC and SB cells. The residues recovered through autolysis were 53.11%, 43.83%, and 44.99% for BSY, SC, and SB, respectively. Notably, the polysaccharide content of BSY residue (641.90 μg/mg) was higher than that of SC (553.52 μg/mg) and SB (591.56 μg/mg). The yields of alkali-extracted water-soluble polysaccharides were 40%, 30%, and 35% for BSY, SC, and SB, respectively, with BSY comprising a higher proportion of water-soluble saccharides than SC and SB, including 49.3% mannan and 20.1% β-glucan. Furthermore, BSY demonstrated antioxidant activities, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), ABTS, and DPPH scavenging potential, suggesting its ability to mitigate oxidative stress. BSY also exhibited a significantly higher total phenolic compound content, indicating its potential as an effective functional food material.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7957f1dfc532301bcb3a98f627bc0ba41bf5ee674c2583174e91cbea6fad4b96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
