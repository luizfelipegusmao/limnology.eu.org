{"title":"Genomic signatures of strawberry domestication and diversification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1622/7479895?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cultivated strawberry (<span>Fragaria Ã— ananassa</span>) has a brief history of less than 300 yr, beginning with the hybridization of octoploids <span>Fragaria chiloensis</span> and <span>Fragaria virginiana</span>. Here we explored the genomic signatures of early domestication and subsequent diversification for different climates using whole-genome sequences of 289 wild, heirloom, and modern varieties from two major breeding programs in the United States. Four nonadmixed wild octoploid populations were identified, with recurrent introgression among the sympatric populations. The proportion of <span>F. virginiana</span> ancestry increased by 20% in modern varieties over initial hybrids, and the proportion of <span>F. chiloensis</span> subsp. <span>pacifica</span> rose from 0% to 3.4%. Effective population size rapidly declined during early breeding. Meanwhile, divergent selection for distinct environments reshaped wild allelic origins in 21 out of 28 chromosomes. Overlapping divergent selective sweeps in natural and domesticated populations revealed 16 convergent genomic signatures that may be important for climatic adaptation. Despite 20 breeding cycles since initial hybridization, more than half of loci underlying yield and fruit size are still not under artificial selection. These insights add clarity to the domestication and breeding history of what is now the most widely cultivated fruit in the world.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"eff557165c7dd8a58218f3841ee257bdf59ab60cc0e71c2e9e2defea82bf4c30","category":"Environment"}
