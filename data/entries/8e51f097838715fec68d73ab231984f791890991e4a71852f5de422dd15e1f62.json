This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards ERAS among patients underwent thoracoscopy surgery.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2022 and August 2023, among patients underwent thoracoscopy surgery in 6 Secondary or Tertiary hospitals in the author’s area. Demographic characteristics and KAP scores were collected by questionnaires, and clinical data were extracted from medical records.</p> Results <p>A total of 309 valid questionnaires were collected, with 165 (53.40%) males and 202 (65.37%) aged ≤65 years old. The mean scores for KAP were 28.92±7.21 (possible range: 9–45), 53.60±6.73 (possible range: 13–65), and 43.45±5.50 (possible range: 10–50), respectively. SEM confirmed the positive associations between knowledge and attitude (β = 0.108, P = 0.019), knowledge and practice (β = 0.096, P = 0.004), and attitude and practice (β = 0.438, P&lt;0.001). However, the KAP were found not associated with prognosis.</p> Conclusion <p>Patients underwent thoracoscopy surgery showed moderate knowledge, positive attitude, and appropriate practice towards ERAS. Preoperative education, personalized counseling, peer support groups, peer support groups, and follow-up care were recommended in further clinical practice.</p>","author":"Yinping Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8e51f097838715fec68d73ab231984f791890991e4a71852f5de422dd15e1f62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
