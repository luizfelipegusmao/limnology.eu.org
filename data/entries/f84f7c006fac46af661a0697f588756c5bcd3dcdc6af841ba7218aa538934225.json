{"title":"Enhancing the Photoelectric Properties of Flexible Carbon Nanotube Paper by Plasma Gradient Modification and Gradient Illumination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0889/v1","date":1718249906000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of plasma gradient modification and gradient illumination on the optoelectronic properties of buckypaper (BP), a flexible and large-scale material composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The BP samples were subjected to argon ion plasma treatment at varying power levels and durations, thereby creating different carrier concentration gradients on the surface. The photovoltage and photocurrent responses of the samples were then measured under uniform full illumination and gradient illumination conditions. The findings revealed that both plasma gradient modification and gradient illumination significantly enhanced the optoelectronic performance of BP. Notably, the combined application of these two methods yielded superior results compared to the application of either method alone. Specifically, the optimal plasma power for improving BP was found to be 20W. Under conditions of plasma gradient modification and gradient illumination, a photovoltage of 267.76 μV was generated, which represents a 21.44 times increase, and a photocurrent of 15.69 μA, reflecting a 32.69 times enhancement. The mechanism underlying this optoelectronic effect can be attributed to the presence of π-bonds in the carbon atoms. These π-bonds are excited by photons, resulting in the generation of small voltages and currents. This study underscores the potential of BP as an optoelectronic material and introduces a novel approach to enhance its optoelectronic properties through plasma gradient modification and gradient illumination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f84f7c006fac46af661a0697f588756c5bcd3dcdc6af841ba7218aa538934225","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
