{"title":"Compositional Optimization of Sputtered SnO2/ZnO Films for High Coloration Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0058/v1","date":1725333862000,"content":"Electrochromic measurements have been performed to optimize the composition of reactive magnetron-sputtered mixed layers of Zinc oxide and Tin oxide (ZnO-SnO2). A combinatorial material synthesis approach was applied throughout the deposition experiments, and the samples represented the full composition range of the binary SnO2-ZnO system. The Coloration Efficiency (CE) of the mixed oxide films were determined with simultaneous measurement of layer transmittance and applied electric current through the using organic propylene carbonate electrolyte cells in a conventional three-electrode configuration. Optical parameters and composition have been determined and mapped by using Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) has been used to check the SE results as it was used in our earlier paper [N. T. Ismaeel et al, Materials 2023, 16(12), 4204] for (TiO2-SnO2). Zn and Sn targets were put separately from each other, and the Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) covered glass and Si-probes on a glass substrate (30 cm Ã— 30 cm) were moved under the two separated targets (Zn and Sn) in a reactive Argon-Oxygen (Ar-O2) gas mixture. By using this combinatorial process, all the compositions (from 0 to 100%) were achieved in the same sputtering chamber after one sputtering process. CE data evaluated from the primary data plotted against the composition displayed a characteristic maximum at around 29 % ZnO. Our combinatorial approach allows the localization of the maximum at 5% accuracy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5548069b4c4cf93d776cd3017d269b8fb4898cf459e600bd94b9fe7acea023f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
