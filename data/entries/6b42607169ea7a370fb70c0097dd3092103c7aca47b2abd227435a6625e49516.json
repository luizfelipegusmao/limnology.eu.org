Such mistilts blur the atoms in electron ptychographic reconstructions and impede their convergence. Although known mistilts can be added to the propagator function in multislice simulations [<a href=\"#ozae044.121-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.121-B2\">2</a>], finding tilt has been time- and computation-intensive. Conventionally, position averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns simulated with a range of roughly guessed thickness and tilt values have been compared to the experimental PACBED through least squares fitting. Recent studies sped up such a laborious process with convolutional neural networks (CNN) once the models were trained [<a href=\"#ozae044.121-B3\">3-5</a>]. However, the training requires tens of thousands of simulated datasets per material system at a specific zone axis, if not more. This study proposes a Bayesian optimization approach that is universal to various material systems and requires a minimal number of simulations to determine thickness and tilt of 4D-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) datasets, especially for the application of ptychography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6b42607169ea7a370fb70c0097dd3092103c7aca47b2abd227435a6625e49516","category":"Environment"}
