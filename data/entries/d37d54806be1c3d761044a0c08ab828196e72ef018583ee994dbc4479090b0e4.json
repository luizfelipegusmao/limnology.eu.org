{"title":"Molecular Docking Study Reveals Amentoflavone as a Potential Inhibitor of Dengue Virus Envelope Protein","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0083/v1","date":1725263385000,"content":"Dengue virus infection poses a significant global health threat, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. In this study, we employed molecular docking techniques to investigate potential inhibitors of Dengue virus type 1 envelope protein. Through a series of docking simulations, we identified Amentoflavone as a promising candidate with favorable binding affinity. Our results indicate that Amentoflavone exhibited a binding energy of -10 kcal/mol, suggesting strong interaction with the target protein. These findings highlight the potential of Amentoflavone as a therapeutic agent for combating Dengue virus infection. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety profile. This study underscores the utility of in silico approaches in drug discovery and development against emerging infectious diseases like Dengue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d37d54806be1c3d761044a0c08ab828196e72ef018583ee994dbc4479090b0e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
