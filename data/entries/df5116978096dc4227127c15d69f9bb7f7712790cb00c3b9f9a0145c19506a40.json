{"title":"Chemical Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Comparative Study of Antibacterial Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1289/v1","date":1721099859000,"content":"Recent studies have suggested significant antimicrobial properties of some metallic nanoparticles during the height of antibiotic resistance. The silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) is one of the most prominent candidates due to its noble nature and better tolerance profile in humans. The synthesis of AgNPs was carried out using silver nitrate using five different chemical reduction methods and comparing their activity with silver nitrate, also known to possess antimicrobial properties. AgNPs have been synthesized with varying combination of reducing agents, and subsequently characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Chemical reduction with both trisodium citrate and sodium borohydride provided better particle size and controlled uniformity, whereas hydrogen peroxide was used as a stabilizer to increase the stability of AgNPs. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for all AgNP formulations was determined against gram-negative E. coli, and AgNPs synthesized with only trisodium citrate were found to be the most effective. The synthesized AgNPs were tested against the resistant strains of E. coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus by the well diffusion method to evaluate and compare their inhibition zones and AgNPs synthesized with polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl pyrrolidine were found to be the most efficient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df5116978096dc4227127c15d69f9bb7f7712790cb00c3b9f9a0145c19506a40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
