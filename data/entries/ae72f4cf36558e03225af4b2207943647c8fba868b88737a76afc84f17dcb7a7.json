{"title":"Unmasking Antifungal Might: Anacardium occidentale Leaf Extract Unleashes Mitochondrial Disruption, Thwarting Candida albicans with Heightened Reactive Oxygen Species","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0579/v1","date":1715244089000,"content":"Invasive fungal disease causes high morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Anti-fungal drug resistance and cytotoxicity highlight the need for effective antifungal therapeutics. In this study, the antifungal potential of the ethanolic extract of Anacardium occidentale (Cashew Leaf) leaves were evaluated against Candida albicans and C. auris. The antifungal activity was tested by the broth microdilution method and growth kinetic test. To further explore its antifungal action mode, spectrofluorophotometry, confocal microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy were performed, Additionally, heterozygous knockout strains associated with resistance to oxidative stress were included in the study. We found that A. occidentale could inhibit the proliferation and growth of C. albicans at concentrations of 62.5 and 125 Î¼g/mL. the doubling time was also drastically affected, going from 2.8 hours to 22.5 hours. Which was also observed in C. auris. The extract induced the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, while it did not show cy-totoxicity or hemolytic activity at the concentrations evaluated. Our work preliminarily elucidated the po-tential mechanisms of A. occidentale against C. albicans on a cellular level and might provide a promising op-tion for the design of a new treatment for invasive candidiasis","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae72f4cf36558e03225af4b2207943647c8fba868b88737a76afc84f17dcb7a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
