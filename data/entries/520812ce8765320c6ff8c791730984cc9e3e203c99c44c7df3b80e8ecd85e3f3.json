{"title":"Transcriptome Analysis and Identification of Genes Associated with Cotton Seed Size","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1452/v1","date":1724154453000,"content":"Cotton seeds as the main by-product of cotton are not only an important raw material for edible oil and feed but also a source of biofuel. The quality of cotton seeds directly affects cotton planting and is closely related to the yield and fiber quality. However, the molecular mechanism governing cotton seed size remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms of cotton seed size by focusing on two cotton genotypes, N10 and N12, which exhibit notable phenotypic variations across multiple environments. Developing seeds were sampled at various stages (5, 20, 30, and 35 DAP) and subjected to RNA-seq. The temporal pattern clustering and WGCNA on differentially expressed genes identified 413 candidate genes, including these related to sugar metabolism that were significantly enriched in transcriptional regulation. A genetic transformation experiment indicated that the overexpression of the GhUXS5 gene encoding UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase 5 significantly increased seed size, suggesting an important role of GhUXS5 in regulating cotton seed size. This discovery provides crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling cotton seed size, helping to unravel the complex regulatory network and offering new strategies and targets for cotton breeding to enhance the economic value of cotton seeds and overall cotton yield.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"520812ce8765320c6ff8c791730984cc9e3e203c99c44c7df3b80e8ecd85e3f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
