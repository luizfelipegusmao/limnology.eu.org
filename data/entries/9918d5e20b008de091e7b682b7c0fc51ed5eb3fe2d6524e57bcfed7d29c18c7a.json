{"title":"Healthcare Resilience in Saudi Arabia: The Interplay of Occupational Safety, Staff Engagement, and Resilience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0882/v1","date":1723531219000,"content":"This research investigates the relationships between occupational health and safety (OHS), staff resilience (SR), staff engagement (SE), and organizational resilience (HOR) within Saudi Arabian hospitals. Employing a quantitative, cross-sectional design, data were collected from 127 administrative staff members working in both public and private hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Using SmartPLS to test the hypothesized relationships and mediation effects, the findings reveal that OHS significantly impacts both SR and SE, and SR significantly influences HOR. Additionally, SE significantly affects HOR. The study also confirms a partial mediation effect of SE and SR in the relationship between OHS and HOR. The model demonstrates substantial explanatory power for HOR, SE, and SR. These results underscore the critical role of OHS in fostering a resilient healthcare environment by enhancing staff engagement and resilience. The study’s implications highlight the importance of targeted interventions to improve OHS practices, promoting overall hospital resilience in alignment with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9918d5e20b008de091e7b682b7c0fc51ed5eb3fe2d6524e57bcfed7d29c18c7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
