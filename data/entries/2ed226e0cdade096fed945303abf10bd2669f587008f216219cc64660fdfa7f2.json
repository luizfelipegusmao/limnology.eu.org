{"title":"Environmental Surveillance through Machine Learning-Empowered Utilization of Optical Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0942/v2","date":1715095926000,"content":"We present the use of interconnected optical mesh networks for early earthquake detection and localization, exploiting existing terrestrial fiber infrastructure. Employing a Waveplate model, we integrate real ground displacement data from seven earthquakes, magnitudes ranging from four to six, to simulate the strains within fiber cables and collect large set of light’s polarization evolution data. These simulations help to enhance a Machine-Learning model that is trained and validated to detect Primary waves arrivals that precede earthquakes’ destructive Surface waves. The validation results show that the model achieves over 95% accuracy. The Machine-Learning model is then tested against an M4.3 earthquake, exploiting three interconnected mesh networks as a smart sensing grid. Each network is equipped with a sensing fiber placed to correspond with three distinct seismic stations. The objective is to confirm earthquake detection across the interconnected networks, localize the epicenter coordinates by a triangulation method and calculate fibers to epicenter distance. This setup allows early warning generation to municipalities close to epicenter location, and progressing to those further away. The model testing shows 98% of accuracy in detecting primary wave and one-second of detection time, affording nearby areas 21-seconds to take countermeasures, and an extended 57-seconds in more distant areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ed226e0cdade096fed945303abf10bd2669f587008f216219cc64660fdfa7f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
