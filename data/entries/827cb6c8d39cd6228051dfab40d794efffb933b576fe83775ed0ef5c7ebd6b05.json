{"title":"Timing of Resection of Spinal Meningiomas and Its Influence on Quality of Life and Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0108/v1","date":1717466581000,"content":"Background Main treatment modality for spinal meningiomas (SM) is gross total resection (GTR). However, optimal timing of surgery, especially in cases with absent or mild neurological symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of early-stage resection on neurological outcome, quality of life (QoL) and quality of care. The primary objective was a favorable neurological outcome (McCormick scale 1); Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients operated on SM between 2011 and 2021. Patients with mild neurological symptoms preoperatively (McCormick scale 1 and 2) were compared to those with more severe neurological symptoms (McCormick scale 3-5). Disabilities and QoL were assessed according to validated questionnaires (SF36, ODI, NDI). Results: Age, spinal cord edema, thoracic localization, and spinal canal occupancy ratio were associated with more severe neurological symptoms (all p&lt;.05). Patients presented with mild symptoms were associated with favorable neurological outcome (OR: 14.778 (95%CI 3.918-55.746, p&lt;.001), which is associated with shorter hospitalization, better QoL and less disabilities (p&lt;.05). Quality of care was comparable in both cohorts; Conclusions: Early surgical intervention of SM, before the development of severe neurological deficits, should be considered as it is associated with a favorable neurological outcome and quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"827cb6c8d39cd6228051dfab40d794efffb933b576fe83775ed0ef5c7ebd6b05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
