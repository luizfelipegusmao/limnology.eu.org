Recent studies have shown that extracting DNA from environmental samples can be a non-invasive, alternative method of detecting elusive species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has not yet been used to survey American mink (<i>Neogale vison</i>), a cryptic and understudied North American mustelid. To help determine best survey practices for the species, we compared the effectiveness and efficiency of eDNA and camera traps in surveys for American mink. We used both methods to monitor the shoreline of seven bodies of water in northeastern Indiana from March to May 2021. We extracted DNA from filtered environmental water samples and used quantitative real-time PCR to determine the presence of mink at each site. We used Akaike’s Information Criterion to rank probability of detection models with and without survey method as a covariate. We detected mink at four of the seven sites and seven of the 21 total survey weeks using camera traps (probability of detection (<i>ρ</i>) = 0.36). We detected mink at five sites and during five survey weeks using eDNA (<i>ρ</i> = 0.25). However, the highest probability of detection was obtained when both methods were combined, and data were pooled (<i>ρ</i> = 0.47). Survey method did not influence model fit, suggesting no difference in detectability between camera traps and eDNA. Environmental DNA was twice as expensive, but only required a little over half (58%) of the time when compared to camera trapping. We recommend ways in which an improved eDNA methodology may be more cost effective for future studies. For this study, a combination of both methods yielded the highest probability for detecting mink presence.","author":"Eleanor L.
