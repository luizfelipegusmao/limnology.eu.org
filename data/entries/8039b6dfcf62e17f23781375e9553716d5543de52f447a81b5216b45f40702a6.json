{"title":"DIKWP-TRIZ: A Revolution on Traditional TRIZ towards Invention for Artificial Consciousness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0751/v1","date":1728544077000,"content":"We propose the DIKWP-TRIZ framework, an innovative extension of the traditional Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) designed to address the complexities of cognitive processes and artificial consciousness. By integrating the elements of Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Purpose (DIKWP) into the TRIZ methodology, the proposed framework emphasizes a value-oriented approach to innovation, enhancing the ability to tackle problems characterized by incompleteness, inconsistency, and imprecision. Through a systematic mapping of TRIZ principles to DIKWP transformations, we identify potential overlaps and redundancies, providing a refined set of guidelines that optimize the application of TRIZ principles in complex scenarios. The study further demonstrates the frameworkâ€™s capacity to support advanced decision-making and cognitive processes, paving the way for the development of AI systems capable of sophisticated, human-like reasoning. Future research will focus on comparing the implementation paths of DIKWP-TRIZ and traditional TRIZ, analyzing the complexities inherent in DIKWP-TRIZ-based innovation, and exploring its potential in constructing artificial consciousness systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8039b6dfcf62e17f23781375e9553716d5543de52f447a81b5216b45f40702a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
