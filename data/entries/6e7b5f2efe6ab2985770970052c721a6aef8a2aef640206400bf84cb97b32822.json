{"title":"Role of S1P Signaling Pathway in Pancreatic Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0672/v2","date":1728614009000,"content":"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolic product produced via the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases (SPHKs), serving as a powerful modulator of various cellular processes through its interaction with S1P receptors (S1PRs). Currently, the incompletely understood of mechanism in pancreatic diseases including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, largely limits therapeutic therapy options for these disorders. Recent evidence indicates that S1P significantly contributes to pancreatic diseases by modulating inflammation, promoting pyroptosis in pancreatic acinar cells, regulating the activation of pancreatic stellate cells, and affecting organelle functions in pancreatic cancer cells. Nevertheless, no review has encapsulated these advancements. Thus, this review compiles information about the involvement of S1P signaling in exocrine pancreatic disorders, including acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer, as well as prospective treatment strategies to target S1P signaling for these conditions. The insights presented here possess the potential to offer valuable guidance for the implementation of therapies targeting S1P signaling in various pancreatic diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e7b5f2efe6ab2985770970052c721a6aef8a2aef640206400bf84cb97b32822","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
