{"title":"RSBagging: An ensemble classifier detecting the after-effects of ischemic stroke through EEG connectivity and microstates","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311558","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Fang Wang, Xueying Zhang, Peng Zhang, Fengyun Hu</p>\r\nBackground and purpose <p>Stroke can lead to significant after-effects, including motor function impairments, language impairments (aphasia), disorders of consciousness (DoC), and cognitive deficits. Computer-aided analysis of EEG connectivity matrices and microstates from bedside EEG monitoring can replace traditional clinical observation methods, offering an automatic approach to monitoring the progression of these after-effects. This EEG-based method also enables quicker and more efficient assessments for medical practitioners.</p> Methods <p>In this study, we employed Functional Connectivity features that extract spatial representation and Microstate features that focus on the time domain representation to monitor the after-effects of ischemic stroke patients. As the dataset from stroke patients is heavily imbalanced across various clinical after-effects conditions, we designed an ensemble classifier, RSBagging, to address the issue of classifiers often favoring the majority classes in the classification of imbalanced datasets.</p> Results <p>The experimental results demonstrate that different connectivity matrices are effective for three classification tasks: consciousness level, motor disturbance, and stroke location. Using our RSBagging model, all three tasks achieve over 98% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, significantly outperforming the existing classifiers SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest.</p> Conclusion <p>Therefore, the RSBagging classifier based on connectivity matrices offers an effective method for monitoring the after-effects in stroke patients.</p>","author":"Fang Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"746c814c61e4c595016c349d4bf10b62c996b14951a13623155203a0d6bee048","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
