Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the responses of the stability of grassland plant communities and underlying mechanisms, defined as the ratio of the temporal mean biomass to the standard deviation. However, a crucial knowledge gap remains regarding whether the impacts of precipitation on the stability of grassland biomass are contingent upon specific contextual factors.\n\nHere, we examined the stability of above- and below-ground biomass in adjacent grass- and shrub-dominated communities through a 7-year manipulation experiment involving seven precipitation levels: 20%, 40% and 60% decrease, as well as 20%, 40% and 60% increase in natural rainfall, in addition to ambient precipitation.\n\nWe found that the stability of community biomass was influenced by three contextual factors including the magnitude and directionality of precipitation, above- and below-ground biomass and the type of vegetation. In particular, higher and more intense precipitation resulted in higher stability of above-ground biomass in both grass- and shrub-dominated communities. Conversely, higher precipitation intensity led to decreased below-ground biomass stability in grass-dominated communities but increased below-ground biomass stability in shrub-dominated communities. Species stability and species asynchrony consistently played a positive role in explaining the stability of above-ground biomass in both grass- and shrub-dominated communities. However, species asynchrony negatively influenced below-ground biomass stability in grass-dominated communities without a comparable effect in shrub-dominated communities. The preeminent contribution to the total community biomass was identified in the stability of below-ground biomass, evident in both grass-dominated and shrub-dominated communities.\n\n<i>Synthesis</i>. This study highlights that while the specific effects of changes in precipitation may vary depending on the context, the fundamental processes governing biomass stability are consistent. These findings elucidate the desert steppe ecosystems' adaptive response to precipitation variations and emphasize their pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem functions under climatic perturbations.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/context-dependent-impact-of-changes-in-precipitation-on-the-stability-of-grassland-biomass/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>\n\n尽管环境变化，包括降水模式发生变化，但群落稳定在确保持续提供生态系统服务方面发挥着至关重要的作用。在过去的几十年里，草地植物群落稳定性的响应及其机制的研究取得了重大进展，其定义为时间平均生物量与标准差的比值。然而，关于降水对草地生物量稳定性的影响是否取决于特定的环境因素，仍然存在认知空白。\n\n在此，我们通过7年的操纵实验，包括7个降水水平:减少20%、40%和60%的自然降水量、增加20%、40%和60%的自然降雨量以及环境降水，研究了相邻草-灌丛为主群落地上和地下生物量的稳定性。\n\n研究发现，群落生物量的稳定性受降水大小和方向、地上和地下生物量、植被类型等3个环境因子的影响。特别是，更强的降水导致草-灌丛为主群落地上生物量的稳定性更高。相反，较高的降水强度导致草为主群落的地下生物量稳定性降低，而灌丛为主群落的地下生物量稳定性增加。物种稳定性和物种异步性在解释草-灌丛为主群落地上生物量的稳定性方面均发挥了积极作用。然而，在草为主群落中，物种异步性对地下生物量稳定性有负面影响，而在灌丛为主群落中没有类似的影响。地下生物量的稳定性对群落总生物量稳定性的贡献最大，无论是草为主群落还是灌丛为主群落中。\n\n总结。这项研究强调，虽然降水变化的具体影响可能因环境而异，但控制生物量稳定性的基本过程是一致的。这些发现阐明了荒漠草原生态系统对降水变化的适应性响应，并强调了其在气候扰动下维持生态系统功能的关键作用。\n</p>","author":"Xiangyun Li, \nXiaoan Zuo, \nJingjuan Qiao, \nYa Hu, \nShaokun Wang, \nPing Yue, \nHuan Cheng, \nZhaobin Song, \nMin Chen, \nYann Hautier","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"2828d15d6ec1cc1caa9106152545a8331be178805db7b0b4a67ce66f6ebfa119","category":"Environment"}
