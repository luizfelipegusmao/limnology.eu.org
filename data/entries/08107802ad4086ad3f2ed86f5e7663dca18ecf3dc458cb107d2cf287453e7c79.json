However, factors influencing frequently observed deviations from this exponent, such as ecosystem succession and organism traits, remain poorly understood.\n\nWe explore the dependence of size–density scaling on ecosystem succession and organism traits by analysing size–density relationships in trees and soil invertebrates across 183 temperate forest plots comprising urban secondary forests, urban old-growth forests and non-urban natural forests.\n\nExponents of scaling relationships in urban tree and invertebrate communities progressively steepened with increasing restored (planted) forest stand age as small organisms increased in abundance. In contrast, non-urban tree scaling relationships flattened during succession with exponents veering away from −0.75, whereas urban tree and invertebrate communities converged towards this prediction in later successional stages.\n\nOur results shed light on how the body size structure of tree and soil invertebrate communities spanning multiple trophic levels shift over successional time as the relative abundances of large versus small-bodied organisms increase. This study emphasises the fundamental influence of organismal traits and ecosystem succession on scaling relationships of organism body size and abundance.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/02/forest-development-alters-the-representation-of-small-versus-large-trees-and-soil-animals-differently/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Poppy Joaquina Romera, \nKiri Joy Wallace, \nJames K.
