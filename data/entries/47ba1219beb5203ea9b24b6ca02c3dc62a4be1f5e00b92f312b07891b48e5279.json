{"title":"Unstable Metal Hydrides for Possible on-Board Hydrogen Storage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0894/v1","date":1713163246000,"content":"Hydrogen storage in general is an indispensable prerequisite for the introduction of a hydrogen energy based infrastructure. In this respect, high-pressure metal hydride (MH) tank systems appear to be one of the most promising hydrogen storage techniques for automotive applications using proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. These systems bear the potential of achieving a beneficial compromise of comparably large volumetric storage density, a wide working temperature range, comparably low liberation of heat, and increased safety. The debatable term unstable metal hydride stands in the literature short for metal hydrides with high dissociation pressure at comparably low temperature. Such compounds may help to improve the merit of high-pressure MH tank systems. Consequently, in the last few years, some materials for possible on-board applications in such tank systems have been developed. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art developments of these metal hydrides, mainly including intermetallic compounds and complex hydrides and gives some guidelines for future developments. Since typical laboratory hydrogen uptake measurements are limited to 200 bar, a possible threshold for defining unstable hydrides could be a value of their equilibrium pressure of peq &gt; 200 bar for T &lt; 100Â°C. However, these values would mark a technological future target and most current materials, and those reported in this review, do not fulfill these requirements and need to be seen as current stages of development towards the intended target. For each of the aforementioned categories in the review, special care was taken not only to covers the pioneering and classical research, but also to portrait the current status and latest advances. For intermetallic compounds, key aspects focus on the influence of partial substitution on absorption/desorption plateau pressure, hydrogen storage capacity and hysteresis properties. For complex hydrides, the preparation procedures, thermodynamics and theoretical calculation are presented. Besides, challenges, perspectives, and development tendency of this field are also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47ba1219beb5203ea9b24b6ca02c3dc62a4be1f5e00b92f312b07891b48e5279","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
