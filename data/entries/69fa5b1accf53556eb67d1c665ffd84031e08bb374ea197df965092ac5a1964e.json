{"title":"Photoacoustic Resonator for Noninvasive Blood Glucose Detection through Photoacoustic Spectroscopy: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2418/v1","date":1727699986000,"content":"Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease with a rapidly increasing incidence projected worldwide, affecting both industrialized and developing regions. Effective diabetes management requires precise therapeutic strategies, primarily through self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to achieve tight glycemic control, thereby mitigating the risk of severe complications. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring blood glucose using photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) as it shows great promise for the detection of glucose using the Infrared region (e.g. MIR &amp; NIR) of light. A critical aspect of this method is the detection of the photoacoustic signal generated from blood glucose, which needs to be amplified through a photoacoustic resonator (PAR). In this work, an overview of various types of PARs used for noninvasive glucose sensing is reviewed, highlighting their operating principle, design requirements, limitations, and potential improvements needed to enhance the analysis of photoacoustic signals. This analysis will be helpful for the basic understanding and achieving the highly sensitive PAR required for noninvasive glucose monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69fa5b1accf53556eb67d1c665ffd84031e08bb374ea197df965092ac5a1964e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
