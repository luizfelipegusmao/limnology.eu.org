This imaging technique is closely related to electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging that has been employed in scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) for many years. With this technique sample currents are monitored as a function of the position of a scanning e-beam to reveal spatially resolved information about charge carriers in the sample. In a STEM the image contrast formation is based on the emission of secondary electrons (SEs) from the sample, leading to the terminology ‘SEEBIC imaging’ [<a href=\"#ozae044.065-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6cf6d8aab5e8bd2a7fedb820efa608f5b304f0002cc1d7038fb0f2100bdd6c81","category":"Environment"}
