{"title":"A meta-regression analysis to evaluate the effects of narasin on grow-finish pig performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae099/7693780?rss=1","date":1718409600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ionophores are feed additives that decrease gram-positive microbial populations by disrupting the ion transfer across cell membranes resulting in improved growth performance. Narasin (Skycis; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) is an FDA-approved ionophore utilized for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in growing-finishing pigs. A meta-regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of added narasin in growing-finishing pig diets to predict its influence on average daily gain (<strong>ADG</strong>), feed efficiency (<strong>G:F</strong>), and carcass yield. A database was developed containing 21 technical reports, abstracts, and refereed papers from 2012 to 2021 representing 35 observations for growth performance data in studies ranging from 35 to 116 d in length (overall data). In addition, within these 35 observations, individual period data were evaluated (143 observations) using weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly performance intervals (period data). Regression model equations were developed, and predictor variables were assessed with a stepwise manual forward selection procedure. The ADG model using the overall data included ADG, ADFI, and G:F of the control group, added narasin dose, and narasin feeding duration categorized as longer or shorter than 65 d. Predictor variables included in the G:F model using overall data were ADG, ADFI, and G:F of the control group and added narasin dose. For carcass yield, the final model included ADFI and G:F of the control group, added narasin dose, and narasin feeding duration of longer than 65 d. In the period model for ADG, the predictors included ADG, ADFI, and G:F of the control group, added narasin dose, and average BW of the control group categorized into greater than or less than 105Â kg. For period data for G:F, the model selected ADG, ADFI, and G:F of the control group and added narasin dose. Based on the results, the overall response to added narasin for ADG and G:F was quadratic and tended to decrease as ADG and G:F increased. A similar quadratic response was observed for the individual period data. In summary, using median values from the database for predictor variables, this meta-analysis demonstrated narasin would be expected to improve ADG between 1.06% and 1.65%, G:F between 0.71% and 1.71%, and carcass yield by 0.31% when fed continuously for longer than 65 d.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"3e5ef66c9ead12ef4d6a833d157e46a375d98d8167dbb2dcb13bec963e9fe56d","category":"Environment"}
