{"title":"Silicon Carbide-Silicon Nitride Materials: Part 2. Corrosion Resistance and Oxidation in Al Reduction Cells and at Lab Testing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0479/v1","date":1723006975000,"content":"The key question for the understanding of corrosion phenomena of Si3N4-SiC material in Al reduction cell – whether corrosion by gases (and oxidation in particular) opens way for the corrosion by molten cryolite, or corrosion of Si3N4-SiC by cryolite plays its own role in degradation of the material in service. More probably the reactions of silicon carbide and silicon nitride with molten cryolite go after the stage of pre oxidation to silicon dioxide.\nThe corrosion of Si3N4-SiC material in the reduction cell may take place by “gas-solid” reaction and by “liquid-solid” reaction.\nThere are several variants of lab corrosion test for the evaluation of corrosion resistance of Si3N4-SiC material to cryolite. The results of investigation of Si3N4-SiC lab corrosion test give no direct evidence of selective dissolution of specific phase (Si3N4 or SiC, α-Si3N4 or β-Si3N4) in cryolite. The existing variants of lab corrosion testing require clarification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4d47bac2bd0d891de2ad3f09c0ef19973e1552482a3b82a3fc2814c77821b64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
