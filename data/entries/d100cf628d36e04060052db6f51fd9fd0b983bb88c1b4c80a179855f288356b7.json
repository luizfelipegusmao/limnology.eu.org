{"title":"Evaluation of Electrical Characteristics of Weft-Knitted Strain Sensors for Joint Motion Monitoring: Focus on Plating Stitch Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1844/v1","date":1729693758000,"content":"We developed a sensor optimized for joint motion monitoring by exploring the effects of stitch pattern, yarn thickness, and NP number on the performance of knitted strain sensors. We conducted stretching experiments with basic weft-knit patterns to select the optimal stitch pattern and analyze its sensitivity and reproducibility. The plain stitch with a conductive yarn located on the reverse side exhibited the highest gauge factor value (143.68) and achieved excellent performance, with a stable change in resistance even after repeated sensing. For in-depth analysis, we developed six sensors using the aforementioned pattern with different combinations of yarn thickness (1-ply, 2-ply) and NP number (12, 13, 14). Based on bending experiments, the GF across all sensors was 60.2â€“1092, indicating noticeable differences in sensitivity. However, no significant differences were observed in reproducibility, reliability, and responsiveness, confirming that all the sensors are capable of joint motion monitoring. Therefore, the plain-patterned plating stitch structure with conductive yarn on the reverse side is optimal for joint motion monitoring, and the yarn thickness and NP numbers can be adjusted to suit different purposes. This study provides basic data for developing knitted strain sensors and offers insights into how knitting methods impact sensor performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d100cf628d36e04060052db6f51fd9fd0b983bb88c1b4c80a179855f288356b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
