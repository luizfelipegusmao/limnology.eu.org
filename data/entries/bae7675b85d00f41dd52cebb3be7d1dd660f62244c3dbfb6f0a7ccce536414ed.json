The efficient chelation of <sup>201</sup>Tl remains a challenge, leading to a lack of suitable chelators for targeted delivery of this radioisotope. Prussian blue can efficiently bind thallium and is an FDA-approved antidote for thallium poisoning. In this study, we aimed to compare the kinetics and subcellular localisation of two different types of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) coated with citric acid (caPBNPs) or chitosan (chPBNPs) and incubated with thallium (I) chloride or radiolabelled with <sup>201</sup>Tl to develop a potential radiopharmaceutic for cancer therapy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bae7675b85d00f41dd52cebb3be7d1dd660f62244c3dbfb6f0a7ccce536414ed","category":"Environment"}
