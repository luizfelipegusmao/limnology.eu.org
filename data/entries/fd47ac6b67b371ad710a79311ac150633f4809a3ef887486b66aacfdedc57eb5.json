{"title":"Closing the Loop between Waste‐to‐Energy Technologies: A Holistic Assessment Based on Multiple Criteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1023/v1","date":1715839442000,"content":"In response to the escalating global waste production rate, sustainable waste management be-comes indispensable. In parallel, the transformation of energy system is vital in order to ensure affordable, decentralized, and sustainable energy for the global community, based on economic, environmental, and social criteria. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) is an effective option in order to put a stepping stone to address both issues provided that multiple views and criteria are considered. This paper puts forward a generic methodological framework to holistically assess WtE technologies based on the PROMETHEE approach. In addition to environmental, economic, and social aspects, demonstration of applicability of the proposed methodology is realized at national level the case of Greece. Anaerobic Digestion seems to be the most preferable choice, recognized for its cost-effectiveness and lower environmental burden to other WtE technologies (i.e. gasification, pyrolysis, incineration). Insightful expert opinions and public preference are of paramount importance to the adopted approach, revealing technology-specific concerns and preferences. In addition, the material presented underscores a crucial gap in Life Cycle Assessment studies for large-scale WtE, emphasizing the need for future scientific attention and exploration. Public consensus indicates a positive overall attitude towards waste valorization in the context of energy production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd47ac6b67b371ad710a79311ac150633f4809a3ef887486b66aacfdedc57eb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
