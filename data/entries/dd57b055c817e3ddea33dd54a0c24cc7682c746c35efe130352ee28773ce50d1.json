Methods: 17 cases with progressive keratoconus were treated with a corneal surface excimer laser ablation normalization using the topography-guided (Contura) myopic ablation for customized corneal re-shaping using a 6mm optical zone. The epi-thelial removal was accounted for by adding a -2.75 diopters correction in the topography-guided normalizing surface ablation followed by, a second, wavefront-optimized hyperopic excimer treatment of + 2.75 diopters at 6mm optical zone.  The 2 sequential excimer ablations were fol-lowed by the corneal crosslinking (CXL). Visual acuity, refraction, and keratoconus documentation via keratometry, topography, and pachymetry, as well as endothelial cell density were evaluated over 36 months. Results: Keratoconus stabilized in all cases. The severity of keratoconus stage by Amsler-Krumeich criteria improved for the OD from an average 2.2 to 1. Mean UDVA showed marked improvement at one-year follow-up all values in decimal: from 0.21±0.18 pre-operative to 0.51±0.25 at 12 months, with small additional improvement through the 3 years to 0.51±0.16. CDVA respectively increased from 0.55±0.11 to 0.77±0.14 at 1 year, and to 0.79±0.16 at 3 years. Mean minimal corneal thickness decreased significantly from 466.74±34.25 μm to 396.17±45.17 μm (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd57b055c817e3ddea33dd54a0c24cc7682c746c35efe130352ee28773ce50d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
