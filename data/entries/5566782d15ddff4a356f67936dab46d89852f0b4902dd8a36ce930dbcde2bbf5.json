{"title":"Impact of Initial Soil Conditions on Soil Hydrothermal and Surface Energy Fluxes in the Permafrost Region of the Tibetan Plateau","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-023-3100-z","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Accurate initial soil conditions play a crucial role in simulating soil hydrothermal and surface energy fluxes in land surface process modeling. This study emphasized the influence of the initial soil temperature (ST) and soil moisture (SM) conditions on a land surface energy and water simulation in the permafrost region in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5.0). The results indicate that the default initial schemes for ST and SM in CLM5.0 were simplistic, and inaccurately represented the soil characteristics of permafrost in the TP which led to underestimating ST during the freezing period while overestimating ST and underestimating SLW during the thawing period at the XDT site. Applying the long-term spin-up method to obtain initial soil conditions has only led to limited improvement in simulating soil hydrothermal and surface energy fluxes. The modified initial soil schemes proposed in this study comprehensively incorporate the characteristics of permafrost, which coexists with soil liquid water (SLW), and soil ice (SI) when the ST is below freezing temperature, effectively enhancing the accuracy of the simulated soil hydrothermal and surface energy fluxes. Consequently, the modified initial soil schemes greatly improved upon the results achieved through the long-term spin-up method. Three modified initial soil schemes experiments resulted in a 64%, 88%, and 77% reduction in the average mean bias error (MBE) of ST, and a 13%, 21%, and 19% reduction in the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of SLW compared to the default simulation results. Also, the average MBE of net radiation was reduced by 7%, 22%, and 21%.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"5566782d15ddff4a356f67936dab46d89852f0b4902dd8a36ce930dbcde2bbf5","category":"Environment"}
