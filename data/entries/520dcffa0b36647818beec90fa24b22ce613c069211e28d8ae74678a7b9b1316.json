{"title":"Dual PPAR-&alpha;/&gamma; Activation by Algal Fiber-Rich NBF2 Formula Reverses Dyslipidemia and Hyperglycemia In Vivo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0632/v1","date":1712655648000,"content":"Fiber-rich green river Aonori alga is mass-cultivated in Japan; it has been reported to reduce inflammation and improve metabolic health in humans. Peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPARs) are associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We evaluated the effects of supplementation with NBF2, a formula made of algal and junos citrus biomaterials, on metabolic markers in obese and diabetic rats. An experimental study was performed using 18 obese and hyperglycemic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats randomly assigned to high dose NBF2 (20mg/kg; n=6), low dose (10mg/kg; n=6) NBF2 drink for 6 weeks, whereas OLETF control rats received similar amount of tap water (vehicle; n=6). LETO rats were used as normal controls (n=8). Biospecimens were taken for ELISA and real-time PCR. Both high dose and low dose NBF2 increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and adiponectin (APN), improved insulin sensitivity, and significantly improved glycemic and lipid (TG, LDL-c) profiles in NBF2-supplemented OLETF rats after a 6-week supplementation with NBF2 (vs. OLETF controls), as well as LDL-c (p&lt;0.05). During the glucose tolerance test (OGTT), both NBF2 groups and LETO rats had normal glycemia by 90-minute time-point (vs. OLETF controls; p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, intake of NBF2 up-regulated PPARa/g-mRNA and Sirt2-mRNA gene expressions in BAT, and improved blood pressure profile in OLETF rats. Findings from this research suggest that intake of NBF2 formula induces dual PPAR-a/g and Sirt2 activation, providing insights on beneficial prophylactic and therapeutic effects of this NB2 formula on dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in T2DM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"520dcffa0b36647818beec90fa24b22ce613c069211e28d8ae74678a7b9b1316","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
