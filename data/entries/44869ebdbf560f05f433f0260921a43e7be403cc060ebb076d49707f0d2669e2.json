{"title":"Research on B4C/PEEK Composite Material Radiation Shielding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1077/v1","date":1726217293000,"content":"There are various types of charged particles in the space environment, which can cause different types of radiation damage to materials and devices, leading to on-orbit failures and even accidents of spacecraft. Developing lightweight and efficient radiation shielding materials is an effective approach to improve the inherent protection of spacecraft. The protective performance of different materials against proton and electron spectra in the Earthâ€™s radiation belts is evaluated by Geant4 simulation. Based on the simulation results, suitable hardening components are selected to design composite materials, and B4C/PEEK composites with different B4C content were successfully prepared. Experimental results demonstrate that the simulated and experimental results for the electron, proton and neutron shielding performance of B4C/PEEK composites are consistent. These composites exhibit excellent radiation shielding capabilities against electrons, protons and neutrons, and the radiation protection performance improves with increasing B4C content in the B4C/PEEK composite materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44869ebdbf560f05f433f0260921a43e7be403cc060ebb076d49707f0d2669e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
