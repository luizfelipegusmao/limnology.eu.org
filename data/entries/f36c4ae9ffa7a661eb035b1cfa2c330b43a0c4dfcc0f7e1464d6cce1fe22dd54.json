{"title":"Excessive iron deposition in root apoplast is involved in growth arrest of roots in response to low pH","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/3188/7613792?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The rhizotoxicity of protons (H<sup>+</sup>) in acidic soils is a fundamental constraint that results in serious yield losses. However, the mechanisms underlying H<sup>+</sup>-mediated inhibition of root growth are poorly understood. In this study, we revealed that H<sup>+</sup>-induced root growth inhibition in Arabidopsis depends considerably on excessive iron deposition in the root apoplast. Reducing such aberrant iron deposition by decreasing the iron supply or disrupting the ferroxidases LOW PHOSPHATE ROOT 1 (LPR) and LPR2 attenuates the inhibitory effect of H<sup>+</sup> on primary root growth efficiently. Further analysis showed that excessive iron deposition triggers a burst of highly reactive oxygen species, consequently impairing normal root development. Our study uncovered a valuable strategy for improving the ability of plants to tolerate H<sup>+</sup> toxicity by manipulating iron availability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"f36c4ae9ffa7a661eb035b1cfa2c330b43a0c4dfcc0f7e1464d6cce1fe22dd54","category":"Environment"}
