{"title":"IRF4 induces M1 macrophage polarization and aggravates ulcerative colitis progression by the Bcl6‐dependent STAT3 pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24106?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic intestinal inflammation. An increasing body of evidence shows that macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is crucial for the development of autoimmune diseases via regulating immune cells. This research was designed to explore the function of IRF4 in UC and its association with macrophage polarization. The in vitro model of UC was established by stimulating colonic epithelial cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). A mouse model of UC was constructed by injecting C57BL/6 mice with dextran sulfate sodium salt. Flow cytometry was used to assess percentage of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> cells in bone marrow macrophages. Occult blood tests were used to detect hematochezia. Hematoxylin and eosin staining assay was used to assess colon pathological changes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. The interaction of IRF4 and B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) was confirmed using GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Our findings revealed that IRF4 promoted cell apoptosis and stimulated M1 macrophage polarization in vitro. Furthermore, IRF4 aggravated symptoms of the mouse model of UC and aggravated M1 macrophage polarization in vivo. IRF4 negatively regulated Bcl6 expression. Downregulation of Bcl6 promoted apoptosis and M1 macrophage polarization in the presence of IRF4 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Bcl6 positively mediated the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. In conclusion, IRF4 aggravated UC progression through promoting M1 macrophage polarization via Bcl6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. These findings suggested that IRF4 might be a good target to competitively inhibit or to treat with UC.</p>","author":"Jiwei Wang, \nZhao Wu, \nYulin Huang, \nLin Jin, \nJinyi Xu, \nZhiyi Yao, \nXi Ouyang, \nZhiyong Zhou, \nShengxun Mao, \nJiaqing Cao, \nBin Lai, \nWei Shen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"5e225b33b092ea7a7c3aa5798004ae776c1811cc403ef73bf1dc8e33a2b6fa95","category":"Environment"}
