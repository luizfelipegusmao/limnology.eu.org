{"title":"Historical Analysis of Resilience in Spanish Desalination Companies: Period 1980-2024","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1349/v1","date":1726654086000,"content":"The article examines the evolution and resilience of the Spanish desalination industry in response to changing market conditions and technological challenges. Initially focused on domestic projects, Spanish companies leveraged the A.G.U.A. Program to gain expertise, which later facilitated their successful international expansion as local demand diminished. The industry has adapted to varying international regulations and local conditions, demonstrating flexibility and competitiveness. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on integrating renewable energy into desalination processes to address rising energy costs and environmental concerns. This shift not only reduces CO2 emissions but also stabilizes operational costs, highlighting the sectorâ€™s ongoing innovation and adaptability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5aa08e113b5dd2a0f334cf603c7f665bdc28bea0da7324f1aec8fb06d20fa60b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
