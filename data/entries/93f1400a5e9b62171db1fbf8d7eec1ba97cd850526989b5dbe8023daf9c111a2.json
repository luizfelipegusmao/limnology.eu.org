{"title":"Tensile Yield Strength Prediction for Polypropylene Using Cowper-Symonds Model in the Low Range of Strain Rates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0688/v1","date":1723426769000,"content":"This study investigates by hybrid approach of classical calculations and numerical explicit FEM simulation the strain rate sensitive hardening of Polypropylene Sabic 83MF10 under dynamic tension loads. The Cowper-Symonds model is employed to characterize the non-linear increase in yield strength with strain rate, within the range of 0,01 to 1 [1‚ÅÑs]. For lower strain rates, a drastic decrease in yield strength is observed, suggesting the significant influence of creep and relaxation phenomena. The study proposes further research incorporating viscoelastic properties for a more comprehensive material model. Additionally, the study observes a disproportionate increase in yield strength for samples with smaller radius, indicating a dependency on triaxiality which suggests further research on the Drucker-Prager model for this material. The study concludes by recommending a broader range of input parameters for future studies, including the Johnson-Cook model and comparison of tensile test results with compression test results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93f1400a5e9b62171db1fbf8d7eec1ba97cd850526989b5dbe8023daf9c111a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
