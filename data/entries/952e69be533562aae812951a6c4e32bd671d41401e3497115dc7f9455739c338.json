The Cntnap2−/− mice, an ASD mouse model deficient for a major ASD susceptibility gene, display core ASD symptoms including motor stereotypies, which are directly linked to striatal dysfunction. This study reveals that striatal PV interneurons display hyperexcitability and hyperactivity in Cntnap2−/− mice, along with a reduced response in medium spiny neurons. We also provide evidence for a crucial role of striatal PV interneurons in motor stereotypies by demonstrating that their selective inhibition rescued a wild type-like phenotype. Our study identifies how PV interneuron dysfunctions disrupt striatal circuitry and drive the motor stereotypies in ASD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"952e69be533562aae812951a6c4e32bd671d41401e3497115dc7f9455739c338","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
