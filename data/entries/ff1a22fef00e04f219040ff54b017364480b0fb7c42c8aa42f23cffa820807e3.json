{"title":"Therapeutic potential of salidroside in type I diabetic erectile dysfunction: Attenuation of oxidative stress and apoptosis via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306926","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p>by Zhenghao Li, Bin Jia, Zhongkai Guo, Keqin Zhang, Danfeng Zhao, Ziheng Li, Qiang Fu</p>\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this work was to delve into the potential therapeutic advantages and dissect the molecular mechanisms of salidroside in enhancing erectile function in rats afflicted with diabetic microvascular erectile dysfunction (DMED), addressing both the whole-animal and cellular dimensions.We established a DMED model in Spragueâ€’Dawley (SD) rats and conducted in vivo experiments. The DMED rats were administered varying doses of salidroside, the effects of which on DMED were compared. Erectile function was evaluated by applying electrical stimulation to the cavernous nerves and measuring intracavernous pressure in real time. The penile tissue underwent histological examination and Western blotting. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was employed in the in vitro trial to induce an oxidative stress for the purpose of identifying alterations in cell viability. The CCK-8 assay was used to measure the viability of corpus cavernous smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) treated with vs. without salidroside. Flow cytometry was utilized to detect alterations in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Apoptosis was assessed through Western blotting and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL). Animal and cellular experiments indicate that the Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway may be upregulated by salidroside, leading to the improvement of erectile function in diabetic male rats by alleviating oxidative stress and reducing apoptosis in corpus cavernosum tissue.","author":"Zhenghao Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ff1a22fef00e04f219040ff54b017364480b0fb7c42c8aa42f23cffa820807e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
