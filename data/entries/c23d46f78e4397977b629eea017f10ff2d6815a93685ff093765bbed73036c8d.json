{"title":"High Definition Dynamic Voltage Restorer System Using Equivalent Time Sampling Techniques and Circular Structural Memory Filters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0087/v1","date":1717461698000,"content":"Due to advances in power electronics technology and the evolution of automation devices, the number of electrical devices that are sensitive to power quality is rapidly increasing, and for this reason, users are increasing their demand for high quality. To meet power quality demands, many power conversion devices are used, including dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs). DVRs are rec-ognized as devices that can effectively manage problems such as voltage segment, swells, and harmonics. DVR control requires many samples for harmonic compensation, which has the dis-advantage of being complicated to implement due to fast digital signal processing computation and the application of the cyclic discrete Fourier transform. In this paper, a high-precision DVR system configuration is proposed that compensates for harmonics using a periodically equivalent time-interval sampling technique and a novel circular structured memory filter. The proposed circular structured multi-pointer memory filter is an effective filter algorithm for high-precision input voltage measurement because it can remove noise and compensate for the delay of the phase angle of the filter in voltage measurement. A simulation and DVR prototype system was built, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the phase angle multi-filter voltage detection method and the compensation method were verified by experiments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c23d46f78e4397977b629eea017f10ff2d6815a93685ff093765bbed73036c8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
