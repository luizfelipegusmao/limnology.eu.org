{"title":"Anthropocene North Western Pacific Oceanography Recorded as Seasonal‐Resolution Radiocarbon in Coral From Kikai Island, Japan","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GB007927?af=R","date":1713855600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) in corals can be used as a relatively high-sensitivity indicator of vertical and horizontal advection of water masses, which contributes to the understanding of ocean circulation. In this study, we reconstruct Kuroshio and Ryukyu current transport with a seasonal resolution Δ<sup>14</sup>C record spanning 1947–2009. This record covers the beginning of the atomic era and was obtained from a coral on Kikai Island in the south of Japan. The Kikai Δ<sup>14</sup>C curve features a newly discovered Δ<sup>14</sup>C spike in July 1955, a rapid increase after 1962, and a steady decrease after 1980. The spike in 1955 may directly reflect ocean current transport. The lack of periodicity in the Δ<sup>14</sup>C record suggests the existence of mesoscale eddies and the complexity of Kuroshio and Ryukyu current transport. In addition, comparing the high-resolution Δ<sup>14</sup>C of Kikai and Ishigaki islands, both situated along the path of the Kuroshio, reveals the influence of Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Niño-Southern Oscillation on the Kuroshio and Ryukyu currents. This suggests that seasonally resolved Δ<sup>14</sup>C in corals along an ocean current can produce a long-term record of ocean mixing that responds to climate variability.</p>","author":"Yuning Zeng, \nYusuke Yokoyama, \nShoko Hirabayashi, \nYosuke Miyairi, \nAtsushi Suzuki, \nTakahiro Aze, \nYuta Kawakubo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Biogeochemical Cycles: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2d4e750daa5e386ca7dda0c54cc50454a723cbd123b964bfed1d56a4712b632","entryHash":"2350c0f46f80be594c06a35627ad55064da22a257d79e964224ad7c7bbed3ba2","category":"Environment"}
