{"title":"Association Between Temperature and Sunlight Hours with Daily Steps in School-Aged Children over 35 Weeks: Findings from the E-MOVI Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1843/v1","date":1727169692000,"content":"Objective: To examine the dose-response relationship between average daily temperature and sunlight hours with daily steps across a 35-week period in school-aged children, and to evaluate whether there were differences by sex.\nMethods: We conducted a follow-up study involving 655 children (50.8% girls, mean age 10.45 ± 0.95) from six public primary schools in Cuenca, Spain. We measured daily steps using Xiaomi Mi Band 3 Smart Bracelets from October 2022 to June 2023 (over 35 weeks). We collected daily average temperature from the local weather station in Cuenca and sunlight hours during the same period. We used ANCOVA models and LOESS regression to examine the dose-response relationship between average daily temperature and  daily hours of sunlight  with daily steps. Additionally, we performed a multiple linear regression model. \nResults: Our findings revealed significant variations in daily steps across the 35 weeks. The relationship between environmental factors and daily steps was non-linear, in both girls and boys. The optimal values for higher activity levels were an average temperature of 14°C and 13 hours of sunlight. Furthermore, a 1 ºC increase in temperature was associated with an increase of 74 ± 130 steps/day, while an increase of one hour of sunlight was associated with an increase of 315 ± 237 steps/day. However, sunlight hours may act as a moderating factor. \nConclusion: Our study showed a non-linear association between t average daily temperature and sunlight hours with daily steps over a 35-week period. Additional strategies may be necessary to encourage increased physical activity during periods of extreme temperatures or sunlight exposure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f44760f3d53b2c5adfa722d4340365af286cbb1482e908d915fac0cf2683a69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
