{"title":"Sustainable Development Goals in Pakistan: A Comprehensive Analysis of Progress, Challenges, and Recommendations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1670/v1","date":1727070294000,"content":"The United Nations Global Sustainability Agenda 2030 introduces a transformative framework through its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are designed to achieve equitable, prosperous, and sustainable development globally. Unlike the incremental Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs aim for systemic changes across economic, social, and environmental dimensions, ensuring that no one is left behind. This research paper provides a comprehensive examination of Pakistan's progress towards achieving the SDGs under the UN Global Sustainability Agenda 2030. Specifically, it includes an analysis of the prioritization of SDGs in Pakistan, highlights federal and institutional initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development, and explores the role of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in advancing these goals. Additionally, the paper critically analyzes the SDGs in Pakistanâ€™s annual status report, identifies the key challenges faced by the nation in implementing these goals, and offers recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of SDG implementation. Overall, the focus is primarily on the detailed analysis of the annual status report, the challenges encountered, and strategic recommendations for achieving excellence in SDGs in Pakistan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d95f1288bae1305a62282458586b29aaca375cc8fa0c05b87866876ce36a3783","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
