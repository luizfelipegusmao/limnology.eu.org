{"title":"Association of visceral adiposity index and lipid accumulation products with prediabetes in US adults from NHANES 2007–2020: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311312","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Li-Ting Qiu, Ji-Dong Zhang, Bo-Yan Fan, Ling Li, Gui-Xiang Sun</p>\r\nBackground <p>The lipid accumulation product (LAP) and the visceral adiposity index (VAI) are suggested as dependable measures for assessing visceral fat levels. Prediabetes is recognized as a condition that precedes the potential onset of diabetes. The objective of this research is to investigate how VAI and LAP are related to prediabetes among the adult population in the United States.</p> Methods <p>Information from the 2007–2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was scrutinized in a cross-sectional study. To evaluate the connection between VAI or LAP and the presence of prediabetes, both univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Threshold effect analysis and fitted smoothing curves were used to delve into the non-linear association between VAI or LAP and prediabetes. Additional analyses were performed on specific subgroups, along with tests to explore potential interactions.</p> Results <p>In general, 12,564 American adults were included. After full adjustment, prediabetes with VAI (OR: 1.128, 95% CI: 1.073–1.185) or LAP (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.004–1.008) showed a positive correlation. Individuals in the 4th VAI quartile group faced a significant 61.9% elevated risk for prediabetes (OR: 1.619, 95% CI: 1.354–1.937) when contrasted to those in the 1st VAI quartile. Participants in the 4th LAP quartile group had a significant 116.4% elevated risk for prediabetes (OR: 2.164, 95% CI: 1.747–2.681) when contrasted to individuals of the 1st LAP quartile. Smooth curve fitting analysis revealed a nonlinear correlation of VAI or LAP and prediabetes, and threshold effect analysis was used to determine an inflection point of 4.090 for VAI and 68.168 for LAP.</p> Conclusions <p>The values of VAI and LAP are positively associated with the prevalence of prediabetes. The VAI and LAP indices may be used as predictors of prediabetes.</p>","author":"Li-Ting Qiu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"41195e1bdd6ee5a279775035224fee8da14b3920b5a4a90d021d70bfc3c8a1d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
