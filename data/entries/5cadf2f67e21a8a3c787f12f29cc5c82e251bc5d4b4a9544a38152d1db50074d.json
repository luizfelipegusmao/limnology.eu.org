{"title":"Celebrating the American Society of Plant Biologists centennial anniversary: A compendium of review articles in plant biology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1183/7625520?rss=1","date":1710115200000,"content":"<span>This year, we celebrate 100 years of the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB; formerly the American Society of Plant Physiologists). A major motivation for the society was the intent to publish a journal devoted to plant physiology (<a href=\"#koae076-B13\">Hanson 1989</a>), and the first issue of <span>Plant Physiology</span> was published in January 1926. <span>The Plant Cell</span> began publication in January 1989, to fill a gap in the rapidly progressing areas of modern plant molecular cell and developmental biology (<a href=\"#koae076-B12\">Goldberg et al. 2019</a>). To celebrate the 100-year milestone of ASPB and the society's role in the publication of the highest-quality plant science over the ensuing years, we are pleased to present, in this issue of both journals, a compendium of review articles covering a range of topics in plant biology. The list of topics was divided more or less randomly between the 2 journals, and in each case, a more senior author was invited and asked to consider, where feasible, bringing on board 1 or more early- or mid-career coauthors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"5cadf2f67e21a8a3c787f12f29cc5c82e251bc5d4b4a9544a38152d1db50074d","category":"Environment"}
