{"title":"Preclinical Studies of Bioinert, Osteoinducing Alloys TNT (Ti21Nb6Ta) and ВТ-6 (Ti-6Al-4V) (In Vivo)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0925/v1","date":1715655738000,"content":"The integration of modern technologies like intramedullary fixators and advanced biometallic alloys has revolutionized traumatology and orthopedics. While these innovations have improved treatment, the exploration of new materials for implants persists. Tantalum and niobium, both non-toxic with similar properties, are preferred for titanium-based biomedical alloys due to their exceptional biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. Acting as stabilizers in titanium alloys, they form passive oxide layers resisting corrosion and remain compatible with biological systems. The novel Ti21Nb6Ta (TNT) alloy promises enhanced osteosynthesis outcomes. Our in vivo research on experimental animals evaluated the biocompatibility and osteoinduction of TNT compared to Ti-6Al-4V (BT-6) alloy (control group). The study comprised three experiments across different animal species, assessing acute toxicity, irritant effects, and long-term biocompatibility and osteoinduction through simulated osteosynthesis. Results indicated that aqueous extracts from both alloys were non-toxic and non-irritating. Furthermore, both demonstrated high biocompatibility and active osteoinduction potential after three months of implantation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73ad5c8e84714eff1f9f0d833ad6e2ed0c7654ef5dc492d5d07ed52163f53d3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
