Herein, we assessed the effects of OX2R-selective agonists TAK-925 (danavorexton) and OX-201 on respiratory function. In <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiologic analyses using rat medullary slices, danavorexton and OX-201 showed tendency and significant effect, respectively, in increasing the frequency of inspiratory synaptic currents of inspiratory neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex. In rat medullary slices, both danavorexton and OX-201 significantly increased the frequency of inspiratory synaptic currents of hypoglossal motoneurons. Danavorexton and OX-201 also showed significant effect and tendency, respectively, in increasing the frequency of burst activity recorded from the cervical (C3–C5) ventral root, which contains axons of phrenic motoneurons, in <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiologic analyses from rat isolated brainstem–spinal cord preparations. Electromyogram recordings revealed that intravenous administration of OX-201 increased burst frequency of the diaphragm and burst amplitude of the genioglossus muscle in isoflurane- and urethane-anesthetized rats, respectively. In whole-body plethysmography analyses, oral administration of OX-201 increased respiratory activity in free-moving mice. Overall, these results suggest that OX2R-selective agonists enhance respiratory function via activation of the diaphragm and genioglossus muscle through stimulation of inspiratory neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex, and phrenic and hypoglossal motoneurons. OX2R-selective agonists could be promising drugs for various conditions with respiratory dysfunction.","author":"Ryuji Yamada","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2633decdba70e92dba93711dd7d23833f286b04aba3635724e27cf29a6254b36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
