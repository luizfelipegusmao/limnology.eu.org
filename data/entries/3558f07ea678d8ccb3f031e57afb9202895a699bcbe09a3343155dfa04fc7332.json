{"title":"Burlap and buddies: the effects of social enrichment (preweaning mixing) and object enrichment (burlap) on piglet performance, behavior, and welfare in the preweaning environment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae053/7642717?rss=1","date":1712620800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>When weaned in commercial operations, piglets are not only separated from their sow but also mixed with unfamiliar pigs in an unfamiliar environment with a new diet. These abrupt changes can be stressful for piglets, often having negative welfare consequences. Our objective was to study the effects of early-life preweaning socialization and object enrichment in the preweaning environment. We compared piglet performance, behavior, and welfare across six treatments that combined multi-litter group size (1 vs. 2 vs. 4 litters) and burlap (yes vs. no). We recorded piglet behavior and lesion-scored sows and piglets. Normal conforming data, expressed per experimental unit (and behavior data were averaged over time), were analyzed by ANOVA. When given the opportunity in the sow barn, piglets in multi-litter groups socialized with other litters. Burlap use (<span>P</span> = 0.08) was observed in &lt; 5% of the observations but tended to increase in mixed litter groups. Cross-sucking was observed in ~12% of the observations within mixed litter groups and tended to increase with mixed group size (<span>P</span> = 0.08). While there was no difference in the proportion of piglets nursing (<span>P </span>&gt; 0.10), piglets were less active in the single crate groups and most active in the groups of two litters mixed (<span>P </span>= 0.03). Additionally, observed piglet/sow biting behaviors did not differ between treatments; however, piglet-piglet biting (<span>P</span> = 0.07), and pen object manipulation (<span>P</span> = 0.07) tended to be observed more frequently in non-enriched groups. Piglet displacements were observed more often in non-enriched groups around the pen (<span>P</span> = 0.03) but tended to be observed more often in enriched groups at the teat (<span>P</span> = 0.07). Preweaning socialization and object enrichment had no impact on the average number of piglets weaned per sow or total piglet mortality (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). However, the proportion of laid-on piglets decreased as the number of mixed litters increased (<span>P</span> = 0.02). The average number of lesions per piglet did not differ between treatments. Although the final lesion scores of sow teat and udder condition did not differ between treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10), sow udder scores tended to worsen more in the single litters than in the mixed litters (<span>P</span> = 0.08). Overall, social and object enrichment allows piglets to socialize at a younger age and to redirect their attention toward an object (burlap) which does not negatively impact piglet or sow performance, or behavior, and may improve piglet welfare around weaning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"3558f07ea678d8ccb3f031e57afb9202895a699bcbe09a3343155dfa04fc7332","category":"Environment"}
