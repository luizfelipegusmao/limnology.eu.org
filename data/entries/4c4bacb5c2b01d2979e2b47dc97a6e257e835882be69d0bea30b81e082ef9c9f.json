The S-acylated protein SALT TOLERANCE RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASE 1 (STRK1) phosphorylates and activates CATALASE C (CatC) to improve rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span> L.) salt tolerance, but the molecular mechanism underlying its S-acylation involved in salt signal transduction awaits elucidation. Here, we show that the DHHC-type zinc finger protein DHHC09 S-acylates STRK1 at Cys5, Cys10, and Cys14 and promotes salt and oxidative stress tolerance by enhancing rice H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging capacity. This modification determines STRK1 targeting to the plasma membrane or lipid nanodomains and is required for its function. DHHC09 promotes salt signaling from STRK1 to CatC via transphosphorylation, and its deficiency impairs salt signal transduction. Our findings demonstrate that DHHC09 S-acylates and anchors STRK1 to the plasma membrane to promote salt signaling from STRK1 to CatC, thereby regulating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis and improving salt stress tolerance in rice. Moreover, overexpression of <span>DHHC09</span> in rice mitigates grain yield loss under salt stress. Together, these results shed light on the mechanism underlying the role of S-acylation in RLK/RLCK-mediated salt signal transduction and provide a strategy for breeding highly salt-tolerant rice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"4c4bacb5c2b01d2979e2b47dc97a6e257e835882be69d0bea30b81e082ef9c9f","category":"Environment"}
