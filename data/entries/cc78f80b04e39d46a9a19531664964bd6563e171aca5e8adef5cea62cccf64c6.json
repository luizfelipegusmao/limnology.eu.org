{"title":"Redefinition and revision of Ser Rathbun, 1931 (Decapoda: Brachyura: Pilumnidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae027/7690444?rss=1","date":1717977600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The taxonomy of the setose brachyuran crabs <span>Ser fukiensis</span><a href=\"#CIT0070\">Rathbun, 1931</a> and <span>Litocheira amoyensis</span><a href=\"#CIT0025\">Gordon, 1930</a>, both described based on material from Fujian, China, have been poorly understood for decades.. The monotypic genus <span>Ser</span><a href=\"#CIT0070\">Rathbun, 1931</a> had been placed under Carcinoplacinae <a href=\"#CIT0046\">H. Milne Edwards, 1852</a> and Rhizopinae <a href=\"#CIT0081\">Stimpson, 1858</a> by subsequent authors. Examining type lots of both species and recently acquired material, we find the holotype of <span>L. amoyensis</span> is an immature male but this name represents a senior synonym of <span>Ser fukiensis</span>. The genus <span>Ser</span> is re-diagnosed and hereby placed under Pilumninae <a href=\"#CIT0071\">Samouelle, 1819</a>. It is here considered to contain three species: the type species, <span>Ser fukiensis</span> (= <span>S. amoyensis</span><strong>comb. nov.</strong>); <span>S. sasekumari</span> (<a href=\"#CIT0076\">Serène, 1971</a>) <strong>comb. nov.</strong>; and <span>S. mikawaensis</span> (<a href=\"#CIT0073\">Sakai, 1969</a>) <strong>comb. nov.</strong>. Comparisons are made between <span>Ser</span> and morphologically similar genera: <span>Rhizopoides</span><a href=\"#CIT0049\">Ng, 1987</a>, <span>Cryptocoeloma</span><a href=\"#CIT0043\">Miers, 1884</a>, <span>Pseudolitochira</span><a href=\"#CIT0089\">Ward, 1942</a>, <span>Bossacarcinus</span><a href=\"#CIT0080\">Števčić, 2011</a>, and <span>Heteropilumnus</span><a href=\"#CIT0020\">De Man, 1895</a>. It is also apparent that <span>Heteropilumnus</span> is a morphologically heterogeneous group, and that its type species, <span>H. stormi</span><a href=\"#CIT0020\">De Man, 1895</a>, is quite distinct from other species currently included in the genus. We discuss the implications of this finding, especially as it pertains to <span>Ser</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"cc78f80b04e39d46a9a19531664964bd6563e171aca5e8adef5cea62cccf64c6","category":"Environment"}
