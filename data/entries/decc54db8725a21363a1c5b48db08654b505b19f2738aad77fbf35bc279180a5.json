{"title":"Adapting childhood obesity and comorbidities lifestyle interventions from perspective and experience of parents from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicities in England","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0547/v1","date":1712580256000,"content":"Preventing childhood obesity and associated comorbidities is often hampered by disproportionate disparity in healthcare provision in minority ethnic populations. This study contextualised lifestyle factors influencing childhood obesity and related comorbidity from the perspectives and experiences of parents of ethnic minority children with obesity comorbidity. \nFamilies of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicities (BAME) in the Northeast of England (n=180) were contacted, and families with a child diagnosed with obesity and comorbidity (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, musculoskeletal problems, respiratory disorder, or polycystic ovarian disease) were interviewed (n=11). Semi-structured interviews and qualitative thematic analysis included parents’ perspective and experience on how their children were impacted by obesity and comorbidities, healthcare preventative interventions including lifestyle physical activity and nutrition, and views on tackling obesity. \nParents’ perspectives and experience revealed eleven themes centred around living with a child with obesity, risks and impact of obesity diseases; access to lifestyle nutritional and physical activity, and ethnicity specific barriers. Parents revealed social disadvantage, fear of victimisation by social services, perceptions on their cultural and religious traditions when dealing with nutrition and exercise, and child’s weight racial stigmatisation. Parents reported closer bonding with their children than health authorities to protect from obesity consequences. Work pressure, time, and lack of professionals’ guidance were seen as barriers to healthy lifestyle, while support from friends and family bond in adopting healthy lifestyle behaviours were facilitators. Parents reported no awareness of health service provision of nutritional and physical activity obesity prevention programmes.\nMinority ethnic communities’ perspective on childhood obesity prevention does not match the healthcare system preventative offerings. Community and family-oriented obesity preventative approaches, especially lifestyle nutrition and physical activity interventions are needed beyond those administered by the primary healthcare system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"decc54db8725a21363a1c5b48db08654b505b19f2738aad77fbf35bc279180a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
