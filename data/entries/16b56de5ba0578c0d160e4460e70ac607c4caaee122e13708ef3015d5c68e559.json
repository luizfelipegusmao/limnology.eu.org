{"title":"Polarization and Incident Angle Independent Multifunctional and Multiband Tunable THz Metasurface Based on VO2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1147/v1","date":1713353592000,"content":"Aiming at the limitations of single-functionality, limited applicability, and complex designs prevalent in current metasurfaces, we propose a terahertz multifunctional and multiband tunable metasurface utilizing a VO2-metal hybrid structure. This metasurface structure comprises a top VO2-metal resonance layer, a middle polyimide dielectric layer, and a gold film reflective layer at the bottom. This metasurface exhibits multifunctionality, operating independently of polarization and incident angle. The varying conductivity states of the VO2 layers, enable the metasurface to achieve various terahertz functionalities, including single-band absorption, broadband THz absorption, and multiband perfect polarization conversion for linear (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) incident waves. Finally, we believe that the functional adaptability of the proposed metasurface expands the repertoire of options available for future terahertz device designs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16b56de5ba0578c0d160e4460e70ac607c4caaee122e13708ef3015d5c68e559","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
