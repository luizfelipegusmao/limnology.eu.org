More than 55 million people in the world, including 6.7 million Americans, are living with AD. As AD is characterized by production and deposition of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain, Aβ is considered as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of AD. Nanomaterials-based electrochemical immunosensor is one of the most promising methods for early diagnosis and therapeutic of AD, due to its highly selective, sensitive, and label-free advantages. The graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets have shown large surface area, good conductivity, biocompatibility, high ion transport, and low diffusion barrier, attracting attention in recent years to use it as the nanomaterial substrate for biosensor fabrication [<a href=\"#ozae044.459-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.459-B2\">2</a>]. In this work, we presented a Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene nanosheets-based electrochemical immunosensor to detect trace Aβ for early diagnosis of AD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"75ae862c4acbf2257f8107f4375d92cc4243c333f33b28ef8f193b57e2435f64","category":"Environment"}
