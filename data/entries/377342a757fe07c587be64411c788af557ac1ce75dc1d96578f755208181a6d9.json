{"title":"Effect of De-Husking on Nutritional and Antioxidant Quality of Nigerian Millet Varieties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1006/v1","date":1726148637000,"content":"Millet is a staple food in Northern Nigeria, widely used for the preparation of various millet-based dishes. However, traditional processing methods, such as de-husking, can significantly affect the grain's nutritional and antioxidant properties. This study evaluates the antioxidant composition and nutritional value of four millet varieties cultivated in Northern Nigeria, with a particular focus on the impact of de-husking on these parameters. Our analysis encompasses the proximate composition, phytochemical content, antioxidant vitamins, mineral elements, amino acid profile, and antioxidant activities of the millet samples. The findings reveal that all millet varieties contain significant levels of antioxidant compounds, including phenolics, flavonoids, and vitamins, although their concentrations varied due to genetic differences and environmental factors. Notably, in the mineral composition, higher (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377342a757fe07c587be64411c788af557ac1ce75dc1d96578f755208181a6d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
