{"title":"Optimizing DMF Utilization for Improved MXene Dispersions in Epoxy Nanocomposites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1233/v1","date":1721181352000,"content":"Dimethylformamide (DMF), a polar solvent, is commonly used for preparing graphene/epoxy nanocomposites. While commonly previous research has predominantly highlighted the improvement in physio-mechanical properties of these nanocomposites, the effect of DMF on processing and its direct influence on the final characteristics of MXene/epoxy nanocomposites have not been investigated.This unexplored link between DMF dosage, MXene concentrations, and the final composite properties presents an exciting direction for future research. In this study, a fixed dosage of DMF was used with varying MXene concentrations to fabricate the nanocomposites. To assess the reliability of DMF dosage on the characteristics of the fabricated nanocomposites, various evaluation techniques were employed, including dispersion evaluation, mechanical tests, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and surface roughness measurements. The research outcomes revealed that as MXene concentration increased, the characteristics of the MXene/epoxy nanocomposites, improved across the board, indicating their potential for use in energy storage applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c79be777258d7cdbf92e3c5404cc290a7b40427cf90b21a14e5e7c95fa3132e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
