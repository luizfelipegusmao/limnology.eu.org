{"title":"Probiotic yeasts: a developing reality?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1641/v1","date":1716542319000,"content":"Yeasts are gaining increasing attention for their potential health benefits as probiotics in recent years. Researchers are actively searching for new yeast strains with probiotic properties (i.e, Debaryomyces hansenii; Kluyveromyces marxianus; Yarrowia lipolytica; Pichia hudriavzevii; Torulaspora delbrueckii) from various sources, including traditional fermented foods, the human gut, and the environment. This exploration is expanding the pool of potential probiotic yeasts beyond the well-studied Saccharomyces boulardii. Research suggests that specific yeast strains possess properties that could be beneficial for managing conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, skin disorders and allergy. Additionally, probiotic yeasts may compete with pathogenic bacteria for adhesion sites and nutrients, thereby inhibiting their growth and colonization. They might also produce antimicrobial compounds that di-rectly eliminate harmful bacteria. To achieve these goals, the approach that uses probiotics for human health is changing. Next-generation yeast probiotics are emerging as a powerful new approach in the field of live biotherapeutics. By using genetic engineering, scientists are able to give these tools specialized capabilities. However, most research on these probiotic yeasts is still in its early stages, and more clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for various health condi-tions. This review could provide a brief overview of the situation in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1ab27beceb207f501589f50e80a3e270de8fbd6ad13a5f9ef1cedb4a47ba3a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
