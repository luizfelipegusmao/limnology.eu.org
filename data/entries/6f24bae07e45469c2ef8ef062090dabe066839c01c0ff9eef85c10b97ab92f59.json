{"title":"Solvothermal Synthesis of Bimetallic Fe/Ni Metal Organic Framework/Polyaniline Composite for Supercapacitor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0358/v1","date":1722940232000,"content":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are being investigated for their potential to develop high-performance supercapacitors due to their porosity and well-defined topologies. This work presents a new hybrid nanocomposite, developed through a solvothermal method, using bimetallic (Fe/Ni) MOF and polyaniline. The morphology and structure of the electrode material were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Electrochemical performances were evaluated in 6 M KOH using an electrochemical workstation. The specific capacitance of Bimetallic Fe/Ni MOF and Bimetallic Fe/Ni MOF with PANI at 10 mVs-1 are 104 Fg-1 and 90 Fg-1, respectively. The EIS spectra show that the composite has lower series resistance and higher charge transfer resistance compared to pristine Fe/Ni MOF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f24bae07e45469c2ef8ef062090dabe066839c01c0ff9eef85c10b97ab92f59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
