{"title":"3D Printed K-band Radar Stealth Lightweight Material with Lotus Leaf Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1671/v1","date":1724379017000,"content":"K-band radar waves have high penetration and low attenuation coefficients. However, the wavelength of this radar wave is relatively short; thus, designing and preparing both broadband and wide-angle radar wave absorbers in this band presents considerable challenges. In this study, a resin-based K-band radar wave absorber with a biomimetic lotus leaf structure was designed and formed by UV curing. Here, microscale lotus leaf papillae and antireflection structures were prepared using a DLP 3D printer, and the contact angle between the material and water droplets was increased from 56° to 130°. In addition, the influence of the geometric parameters of the lotus leaf antireflection structure on the electromagnetic absorption performance and mechanical strength was investigated. After simulation optimization, the maximum electromagnetic loss of the lotus leaf structure 3D printed sample was −32.3 dB, and the electromagnetic loss was below −10 dB in the 20.8–26.5 GHz frequency range. When the radar incidence angle was 60°, the maximum electromagnetic loss was still less than −10 dB. The designed lotus leaf structure has a higher mechanical energy absorption per unit volume (337.22 KJ/m3) and per unit mass (0.55 KJ/Kg) than commonly used honeycomb lightweight structures during the elastic deformation stage, and we expect that the designed structure can be used as an effective lightweight material for K-band radar stealth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d850b67b18928c15562503880e993b17329dd4809c6692996c129a9718f6664","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
