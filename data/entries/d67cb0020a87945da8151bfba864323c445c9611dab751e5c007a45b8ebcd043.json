Its structure is diverse among different species, reflecting evolutionary adaptations to fulfill unique muscular functionalities and physiological requisites. The major protein myosin is unique among proteins in possessing a 1600 Å a-helical coiled coil sufficiently long to extend over 11 successive 145 Å axial repeats. Our comparative analyses of the thick filaments from <span>Lethocerus</span>, <span>Drosophila</span>, and <span>Bombus</span>, reveal a conserved architectural scaffold built upon overlapping segments of 44 myosin molecules in each axial 145 Å repeats. The helical arrangement of myosins is finely tuned by non-myosin proteins, like flightin, myofilin, and paramyosin, which bind the myosin tails at various regions through different mechanisms to stabilize the assembly. However, as one of the largest subcellular macromolecular structures, obtaining a high-resolution structure has been historically challenging, with the atomic level interactions between myosin and the non-myosin proteins remaining elusive until recently [<a href=\"#ozae044.367-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d67cb0020a87945da8151bfba864323c445c9611dab751e5c007a45b8ebcd043","category":"Environment"}
