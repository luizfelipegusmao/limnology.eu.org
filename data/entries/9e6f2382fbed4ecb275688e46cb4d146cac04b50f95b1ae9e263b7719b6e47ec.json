{"title":"Sensitivity of cholinesterases and carboxylesterases to pharmaceutical products in Tinca tinca","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24234?af=R","date":1711978113000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Discharges to the aquatic environment of pharmaceuticals represent a hazard to the aquatic organisms. Subchronic assay with 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE<sub>2</sub>) and <i>in vitro</i> essays with pharmaceuticals of environmental concern were conducted to examine the sensitivity of tissue acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carboxylesterase (CbE) activities of <i>Tinca tinca</i> to them. Subchronic exposure to 17-alpha-EE<sub>2</sub> caused significant effects on brain, liver, and muscle CbE, but no on AChE activities. Most of the pharmaceuticals tested <i>in vitro</i> were considered as weak inhibitors of tissular AChE activity. Depending on the tissues, some compounds were classified as moderate inhibitors of CbE activity while other were categorized as weak enzymatic inhibitors. An opposite trend was observed depending on the tissue, while brain and liver CbE activities were inhibited, the muscle CbE activity was induced. Changes experienced on enzymatic activities after exposure to pharmaceuticals might affect the physiological functions in which these enzymes are involved. <i>In vitro</i> exposure to 17-alpha-EE<sub>2</sub> in tench could be an informative, but not a surrogate model to know the effect of this synthetic estrogen on AChE and CbE activities.</p>","author":"Ana‐Lourdes Oropesa, \nBlanca González‐Sánchez, \nFernando J.
