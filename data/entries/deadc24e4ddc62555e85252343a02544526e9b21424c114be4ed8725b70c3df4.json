To mitigate the negative consequences, the negative symptoms should be identified at an early stage. Therefore, the implementation of very brief valid screening tools in mental health prevention programs and in therapeutic settings is advantageous. In two studies on representative German population samples, we developed and validated three ultra-short scales–the “bubbles”–that consist of only one item based on the Depression Anxiety Stress 21 subscales (DASS-21) for the assessment of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. The results of Study 1 (<i>N</i> = 1,001) and Study 2 (<i>N</i> = 894) revealed that the bubbles are valid instruments that fit the DASS-21 subscales on the factor level. Moreover, the bubbles replicated the association pattern of the DASS-21 subscales with demographic variables, and with variables that belong to the negative and the positive dimension of mental health. Thus, due to their time- and cost-efficiency, the bubbles can be used as brief screening tools in research (e.g., large-scale studies, longitudinal studies, experience sampling paradigms) and in praxis. Their shortness can prevent fatigue, motivation decrease, and participants’ drop-out.","author":"Julia Brailovskaia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"deadc24e4ddc62555e85252343a02544526e9b21424c114be4ed8725b70c3df4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
