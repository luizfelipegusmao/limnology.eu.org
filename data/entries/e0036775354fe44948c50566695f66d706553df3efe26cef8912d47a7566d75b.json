{"title":"Acute Kidney Injury in Children: Classification, Recognition and Treatment Principles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0851/v1","date":1728612772000,"content":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in children is a critical medical condition characterized by a sudden decline in kidney function. This article provides a comprehensive overview of AKI in pediatric populations, exploring its pathophysiology, the role of various drugs, and the long-term implications for kidney health. Key topics include oliguria, anuria, urine output, hypervolemia and interactions among them as well as role of diuretic nephrotoxicity and glomerular filtration rate. Concepts of electrolytes, acid-base balance and renal perfusion assessment are presented. Basic principles of intensive care unit (ICU) management, renal replacement therapy, and the association with multiorgan failure are described. Additionally, the article discusses the potential long-term outcomes of AKI, including the risk of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and proteinuria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0036775354fe44948c50566695f66d706553df3efe26cef8912d47a7566d75b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
