{"title":"Novel Biomarkers of Grade I Diastolic Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1312/v1","date":1726563077000,"content":"Background/aims: Prior research identified a significant association between heart disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated liver steatohepatitis (MASLD), but the mechanisms are unclear. This study aims to search predictive biomarkers for grade I left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), an early stage of heart failure (HF), in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods: This single-center, prospective observational study screened 73 T2DM patients for grade 1 LVDD and MASLD using 2D echocardiography, tissue analysis, spectral color Doppler, and Fibromax. Results: The study analyzed 50 patients (mean age 58±11.3 years) with a median diabetes duration of 7 years, abdominal obesity (mean BMI 34.4±5.9 kg/m2), and a mean HbA1c of 7.9±1.5%. The prevalence of grade I LVDD, fibrosis, mild steatosis, moderate to severe liver steatosis, mild MASLD, and moderate MASLD was 54%, 44%, 14%, 80%, 43%, and 34%, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that grade 1 LVDD was positively associated with age, Fibrotest, ɑ2-macroglobulin, epicardiac adipose tissue (EAT), and negatively associated with lateral s`, E wave, E/e`, E/A, medium E`, and septal e` (p&amp;lt; 0.05 for all). ɑ2-macroglobulin &amp;gt; 1.92 g/L (AUROC= 0.782, sensitivity 70.4%, specificity 81.2%) and fibrotest score &amp;gt; 0.11 (AUROC 0.766, sensitivity 92.6%, specificity 56.2%) were significant predictors of grade I LVDD. Conclusion: HF is a multifaceted disorder associated with multisystem organ damage, including nonalcoholic MASLD. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, innovative non-invasive biomarkers, such as ɑ2-macroglobulin or fibrotest, could concurrently indicate liver stiffness and the likelihood of grade I LVDD, an early, asymptomatic HF stage in T2DM patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e59a937ef98d8a6713ea18d9026db1fcad9a85a8a20536dc95295fb384fd42e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
