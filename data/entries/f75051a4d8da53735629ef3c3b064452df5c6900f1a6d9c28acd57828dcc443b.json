{"title":"Factors influencing risk perception of inshore and offshore artisanal fishers in a marine protected area in Brazil","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12666?af=R","date":1709729842000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Artisanal small-scale fisheries are crucial for subsistence and food security, especially in developing countries. However, artisanal fishers face stressors, such as economic and social marginalization, conflicts, and overfishing. Socio-economic attributes potentially influence their risk perception. We investigated risk perception among artisanal fishers in a Marine Protected Area through interviews and semi-structured questionnaires. Risk perception was positively influenced by fishing environment and negatively influenced by a lack of religious beliefs. Offshore fishers faced more operating conditions and time at sea, with higher risk of losses, and perceived more health and conflict risks. Inshore fishers have higher perception of environmental degradation. Prioritizing different risk perceptions is essential for effective fisheries management. Separate management plans for offshore and inshore fisheries are recommended due to varying catch, environmental perception, socio-environmental risks, and exploited resource characteristics among artisanal fisher groups.</p>","author":"Aline Olimpo dos Santos, \nCicero Diogo L.
