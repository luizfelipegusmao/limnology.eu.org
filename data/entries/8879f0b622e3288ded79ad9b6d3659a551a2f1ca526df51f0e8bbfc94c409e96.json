A modern STEM can now deliver atomic-level spatial resolution (1.1 Ã…) and phonon-detecting energy resolution (2.6 meV) at 20 keV primary energy [<a href=\"#ozae044.1083-B1\">1</a>]. These capabilities come from advanced electron-optical instrumentation, such as monochromators, correctors, and spectrometers. In parallel developments, many researchers are turning attention to combining advanced electron-optical capabilities with new developments, such as sample stimuli, detectors, software, and operating modes. We illustrate this progress in three directions: a new light injector/collector, fast 4D-STEM, and high energy resolution EELS beyond the traditional monochromated current limit.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8879f0b622e3288ded79ad9b6d3659a551a2f1ca526df51f0e8bbfc94c409e96","category":"Environment"}
