{"title":"Balancing Security and Efficiency: A Power Consumption Analysis of a Lightweight Block Cipher","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0769/v1","date":1728545680000,"content":"This research paper presents a detailed analysis of a Lightweight Block Cipherâ€™s power consumption and security features (LWBC), specifically designed for IoT applications. To accurately measure energy consumption during the execution of the LWBC algorithm, we utilised the Qoitech Otii Arc, a specialised tool for optimising energy usage. Our experimental setup involved using the Otii Arc as a power source for an Arduino NodeMCU V3, running the LWBC security algorithm. Our methodology focused on energy consumption analysis using the shunt resistor technique. Our findings reveal that the LWBC is highly efficient and provides an effective solution for energy-limited IoT devices. We also conducted a comparative analysis of the proposed cipher against established LWBCs, which demonstrated its superior performance in terms of energy consumption per bit. The proposed LWBC was evaluated based on various key dimensions such as power efficiency, key and block size, rounds, cipher architecture, gate area, ROM, latency, and throughput. The results of our analysis indicate that the proposed LWBC is a promising cryptographic solution for energy-conscious and resource-limited IoT applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dc4e00e535c385a4cbab5d969db3044fe4b8d27d1dd8bb8fc53ecd6b76c126d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
