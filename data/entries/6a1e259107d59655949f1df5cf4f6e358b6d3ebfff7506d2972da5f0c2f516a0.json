This study investigates the potential preventive effects of <span>M. oleifera</span> extract on aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced cortical neurodegeneration in rats.<div>Materials and methods</div>Therefore, 24 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four distinct groups: negative control, <span>M. oleifera</span> extract (MOE), AlCl3, and AlCl3 + MOE. Treatments were administered orally for 28 consecutive days. Cognitive performance, brain oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptotic-cell death, and associated histopathological alterations were assessed.<div>Results</div>Our results showed that MOE improved spatial learning and memory, enhanced antioxidant superoxide dismutase enzyme activity, antagonized nitrosative stress, reduced inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6), decreased caspase-3, increased Bcl-2, and facilitated repair of cortical and hippocampal structures.<div>Conclusions</div>We concluded that MOE exhibits protective effects against cortical neurodegeneration, making it a promising supplement to counteract aluminum-induced neurotoxic effects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"6a1e259107d59655949f1df5cf4f6e358b6d3ebfff7506d2972da5f0c2f516a0","category":"Environment"}
