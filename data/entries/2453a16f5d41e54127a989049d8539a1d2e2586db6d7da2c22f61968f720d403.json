Electronic tagging was used to provide the first information on the movements of an ocean sunfish from the northwestern Mediterranean. The sunfish moved towards the Gibraltar strait over the year and displayed substantial movements in the water column. The potential of the tagging technique employed for studying its behavior and long-term migratory dynamics, and assessing the post-release survival of ocean sunfish is highlighted.</p>","author":"Tristan Rouyer, \nA.
