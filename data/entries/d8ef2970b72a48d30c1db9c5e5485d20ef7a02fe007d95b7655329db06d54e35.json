{"title":"Sleeve Gastrectomy Reduces Body Weight and Food Intake in Diet-Induced Obese Mice with No Alterations in Anorexigenic and Orexigenic Hypothalamic Genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2148/v1","date":1724923918000,"content":"The epidemic of obesity has increased worldwide and is associated with comorbidities as diabetes as cardiovascular disease. Strategies that modulate body weight and improves glycemic metabolism has increased, and the bariatric surgeries as Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) has been highlighted in obesity treatment. However, the mechanism by which SG reduces body weight and improves glycemic control are unknow. C57BL mice were submitted to a 10 weeks high fat-diet protocol and submitted to SG. Food intake, fed/fasted glycemia and hypothalamic anorexigenic and orexigenic gene expression were evaluated. SG reduces body weight, fasting glycemia, insulinemia and leptinemia in obese mice. Moreover, SG reduces food and total calorie intake with no alterations in the expression of anorexigenic and orexigenic gene expression. These data indicates that SG improves obesity associated alterations, at least in part, by reduction on food intake. This effect is not associated with the classic food intake pathway in hypothalamus, indicating the involvement of supplementary pathways in this process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8ef2970b72a48d30c1db9c5e5485d20ef7a02fe007d95b7655329db06d54e35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
