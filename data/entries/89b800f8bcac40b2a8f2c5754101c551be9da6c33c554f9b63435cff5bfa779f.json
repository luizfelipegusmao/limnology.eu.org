{"title":"Cryptic species diversity and contrasting climate profiles in Aotearoa New Zealand, egg‐laying and live‐bearing velvet worms (Onychophora, Peripatopsidae: Ooperipatellus and Peripatoides)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ivb.12436?af=R","date":1723444482000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Aotearoa (New Zealand) is a biodiversity hotspot for temperate invertebrate taxa and home to high levels of endemicity. However, our knowledge of species-level diversity and phylogeny of endemic New Zealand Onychophora (velvet worms) is at present limited. Here, we use mitochondrial <i>cytochrome c oxidase subunit I</i> (<i>COI</i>) barcoding to assess the extent of species diversity for the two velvet worm genera found in New Zealand, the ovoviviparous and endemic <i>Peripatoides</i> and the oviparous <i>Ooperipatellus</i>, found in Australia and New Zealand. Our results reveal that the estimated number of species of both genera in New Zealand is greater than currently described. We estimate there are between 13 and 67 species of <i>Peripatoides</i> and between 16 and 21 species of <i>Ooperipatellus</i> endemic to New Zealand. This is a stark increase from the two currently described New Zealand species of <i>Ooperipatellus</i> and previous work that has identified 10 species within <i>Peripatoides</i>. Our exploration of climatic variables shows that individuals of <i>Ooperipatellus</i> are predominantly found in wet, cool environments and <i>Peripatoides</i> are found across relatively drier, warmer habitats. We also generate ecological niche models to provide initial predictions of the distribution of climatically suitable habitats for each genus across New Zealand.</p>","author":"Arianna Lord, \nThomas R.
