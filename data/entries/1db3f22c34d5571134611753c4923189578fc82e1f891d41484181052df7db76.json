{"title":"Current-Mode Control of a Distributed Buck Converter with a Lossy Transmission Line","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0342/v1","date":1720008849000,"content":"This article presents a buck converter in which the inductor has been replaced by a transmission line. This approach would be practically conceivable if the power supply and load have a greater spatial distance. In the time domain, this new converter can be described by a system of coupled partial and ordinary differential equations. In the frequency domain, a transcendental transfer function is obtained. For comparison with an equivalently parameterized conventional converter, Pad√© approximants are derived. A linear controller is designed for the converter topology under consideration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1db3f22c34d5571134611753c4923189578fc82e1f891d41484181052df7db76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
