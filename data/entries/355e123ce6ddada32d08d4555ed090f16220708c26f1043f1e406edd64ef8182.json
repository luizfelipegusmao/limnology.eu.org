{"title":"Optimizing Tempering Parameters to Enhance Precipitation Behavior and Impact Toughness in High-Nickel Steel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1112/v1","date":1721098727000,"content":"This study explores the effects of tempering on the precipitation behavior and impact toughness of high-nickel steel. The specimens underwent double quenching at 870°C and 770°C, followed by tempering at various temperatures. Advanced characterization techniques including optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to elucidate precipitation phenomena. Additionally, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was employed to assess the misorientation distribution after tempering. Charpy impact tests were performed on specimens tempered at different temperatures to evaluate their toughness. The findings reveal that with increasing tempering temperature, the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries decreases, which correlates positively with enhanced impact toughness. The impact toughness peaks at 580°C and then diminishes with further temperature increases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"355e123ce6ddada32d08d4555ed090f16220708c26f1043f1e406edd64ef8182","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
