{"title":"Phosphorus Removal and Recovery During Microalgae-Based Wastewater Treatment: A Mini-review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s41742-024-00590-w","date":1712102400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The depletion of phosphorus resources and the problem of environmental pollution are driving the advancement of traditional methods for wastewater treatment. Researchers have taken an interest in microalgae-based processes, which offer a sustainable approach by effectively converting phosphorus into biomass. To improve the environment and make better use of waste phosphorus resources, the efficiency of phosphorus removal by microalgae must be increased. Therefore, studying the mechanisms of phosphorus uptake by microalgae cells is valuable. This review outlines the typical microalgae systems used for phosphorus removal from wastewater. It summarizes the procedures of phosphorus surface adsorption, membrane transport, and intercellular utilization by microalgae. Additionally, this work analyzed the phenomena of excess phosphorus uptake and emerging organic phosphorus uptake by microalgae. Furthermore, the article examines the primary external factors that affect phosphorous removal. Lastly, this review proposes utilizing microalgal biomass phosphorus in fertilizer and transition metal phosphide catalysts. This review provides innovative approaches for removing phosphorus from wastewater and applying microalgal biomass phosphorus.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"29c2b07d382aac507c5acc3aec79c4fdd1bc1d90ecf7f5852ee2d3fdd51a26a5","category":"Environment"}
