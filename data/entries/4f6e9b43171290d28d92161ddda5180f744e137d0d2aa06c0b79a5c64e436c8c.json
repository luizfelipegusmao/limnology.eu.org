Their astonishing chemical diversity plays an essential role in plant adaptation, defense, and interaction with the world around them. Terpenoids, the largest class of plant small molecules, play important roles in physiological and biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and phytohormone production. Some terpenoids have more specialized roles as pollinator attractants or defense compounds, and their biosynthesis is restricted to specific plant families (<a href=\"#kiad617-B2\">Pichersky and Raguso 2018</a>; <a href=\"#kiad617-B7\">Zhou and Pichersky 2020</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4f6e9b43171290d28d92161ddda5180f744e137d0d2aa06c0b79a5c64e436c8c","category":"Environment"}
