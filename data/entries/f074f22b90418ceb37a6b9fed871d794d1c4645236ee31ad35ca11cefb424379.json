{"title":"The pathway for achieving sustainable aviation fuel production in the Middle East and North Africa region","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14395?af=R","date":1713871416000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces significant challenges in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) due to high costs, limited feedstock availability, and underdeveloped infrastructure. However, the region has diverse feedstock options and can leverage existing refining capabilities and advanced conversion technologies for SAF production. Addressing these challenges requires research and development (R&amp;D) collaboration, supportive policies, and international knowledge exchange. To promote the production of SAF in the MENA region, a comprehensive strategy is required that includes collaboration, policy alignment, research and development, infrastructure development, and training. Market incentives such as regulations and financial support can help drive demand for SAF. Collaborating with international organizations can improve knowledge sharing and promote sustainable practices. Research and development collaboration is crucial for innovation and establishing a strong SAF industry. Policy harmonization can create a supportive framework for investment and innovation. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms can ensure transparency and verify sustainability. By addressing these aspects, the region can become a leading hub for SAF production and contribute to a sustainable aviation industry.</p>","author":"Ismail Abbas, \nAli Shaar, \nRola El Osta","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"f074f22b90418ceb37a6b9fed871d794d1c4645236ee31ad35ca11cefb424379","category":"Environment"}
