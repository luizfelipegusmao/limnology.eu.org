{"title":"Silicone Shoes for Treatment of Pododermatitis (Bumblefoot) in Pet Chickens &ndash; A Retrospective Case Series","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0281/v1","date":1722860498000,"content":"Backyard chickens often suffer from foot pad dermatitis (FPD), a condition exacerbated by poor husbandry, nutritional deficiencies, and obesity. Pressure-relieving bandages, commonly used in treatment of FPD, are impractical for outdoor chickens as they quickly become wet and dirty, necessitating daily changes which are often unfeasible. This retrospective study explores the use of custom-fit silicone shoes, created via 3D-printed molds, as an alternative to traditional bandages. CT scans were used to design shoes, adapted from a design used for birds of prey. Over three years, 16 chickens with varying degrees of FPD were treated. The results demonstrated that sili-cone shoes were an effective treatment for FPD, allowing outdoor activity, and facilitated daily lesion care without frequent bandage changes. The median shoe-wearing period was 14 days, and most owners provided positive feedback. Despite some attachment issues, the occurrence of sec-ondary pressure marks and feather regrowth challenges, the silicone shoes offered better ventila-tion, reusability, and consistent pressure relief compared to traditional bandages. This study con-cludes that silicone shoes are a viable solution for managing FPD in backyard chickens, promoting faster healing and improved owner compliance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61a378a4aa7418f074b079b1ad4000767e2cd8c7745eea2e3007afb929cb153d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
