Therefore, we aimed to describe postoperative CRP values between two groups of patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for right-side colon cancer with IA or EA. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients affected by right-side colon cancers who underwent laparoscopic right-hemicolectomy with ileo-colic IA or EA between January 2016 and December 2022. Results: A total of 340 patients underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. EA was performed in 238 (70%) and IA in 102 (30%) cases. Patients with IA showed significantly higher values of CRP in the second, third and fourth postoperative days (15.2 mg/dL vs 9.5 mg/dL p=","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0faad22ee794cad35908ac0ab222da516566ea70382bc474f9b3e84eb643149","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
