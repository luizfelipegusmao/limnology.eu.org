However, our knowledge about the potential interaction between (A) the individual experience or conditioning of the arthropod predator based on its rearing environment and (B) the environmental conditions at the ultimate release site to control a particular pest is quite limited.\n\nWe hypothesized that simplified rearing conditions present in commercial insectaries may produce predators that are less adept to navigate complex and challenging crop systems compared to those reared on target crops. We chose <i>Phytoseiulus persimilis</i> (Phytoseiidae) as a case study because it is an important commercialized predator of the twospotted spider mite on diverse crops worldwide. We established colonies of <i>P. persimilis</i> on bean (commercial rearing host plant) and strawberry (target crop plant) for over five generations and compared patterns of ambulatory dispersal when released on bean or strawberry and feeding efficiency on strawberry.\n\nDispersal of <i>P. persimilis</i> was largely predicted by the presence of prey (higher dispersal when prey was absent), followed by the host on which predators were released (higher dispersal on bean compared to strawberry), and lastly by source colony (few examples of a significant difference). We found little evidence of an interaction between the two latter main effects. Rather, they were likely independent and additive. Prey consumption by <i>P. persimilis</i> on strawberry was higher for <i>P. persimilis</i> reared on strawberry compared to bean, but this did not translate into higher rates of oviposition.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. This study provides insight into sources of variation in dispersal and host finding behaviour of biocontrol agents that may help to predict biocontrol success. To compensate for prey availability and host plant effects on predator dispersal and biocontrol efficacy, we suggest that release rates and strategies should be tailored to host plants given their physical characteristics and prey quality.\n</p>","author":"Samantha A.
