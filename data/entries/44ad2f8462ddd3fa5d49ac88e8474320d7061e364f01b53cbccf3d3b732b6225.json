{"title":"Specific Monoclonal Antibodies against African Swine Fever Virus Protease pS273R Revealed a Novel and Conserved Antigenic Epitope","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0468/v1","date":1717985091000,"content":"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large enveloped DNA virus that causes a highly pathogenic hemorrhagic disease in both domestic pigs and wild boars. The ASFV genome contains a double-stranded DNA encoding more than 150 proteins. The ASFV possesses only one protease pS273R, which is important for virion assembly and host immune evasion. Therefore, the specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against pS273R is useful for ASFV research. Here, we generated two specific anti-pS273R mAbs named as 2F3 and 3C2, both of which were successfully applied for ELISA, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence assays. Further, we showed that both 2F3 and 3C2 mAbs recognize a new epitope of N terminal 1-25 amino acids of pS273R protein, which is highly conserved across different ASFV strains including all genotypes I and II strains. Based on the recognized epitope, an indirect ELISA was established and was effective in detecting antibody during ASFV infection. To conclude, the specific pS273R mAbs and corresponding epitope identified will strongly promote ASFV serological diagnosis and vaccine research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44ad2f8462ddd3fa5d49ac88e8474320d7061e364f01b53cbccf3d3b732b6225","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
