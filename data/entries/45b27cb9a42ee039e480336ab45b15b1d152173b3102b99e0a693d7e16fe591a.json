{"title":"New Piezoceramic SrBi2Nb2-2xWxSnxO9: Crystal Structure, Microstructure and Dielectric Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2319/v1","date":1722253841000,"content":"By using the method of high-temperature solid-phase reaction, the new piezoceramic SrBi2Nb2-2xWxSnxO9 was obtained, in which partial substitution of niobium (Nb) atoms with Sn4+ and W6+ atoms in the compound SrBi2Nb2O9 took place in the octahedra of the perovskite layer (B-position). X-ray diffraction studies have shown that these compounds are single-phase SrBi2Nb2-2xWxSnxO9 (x = 0.1, 0.2) and two-phase SrBi2Nb2-2xWxSnxO9 (x = 0.3, 0.4), but they all had the structure of Aurivillius – Smolensky phases (ASPs) with similar parameters of orthorhombic elementary cells, corresponding to the spatial group A21am. The dependences on temperature of the relative permittivity ε/ε0 and the tangent of the loss angle tan d at different frequencies were measured.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45b27cb9a42ee039e480336ab45b15b1d152173b3102b99e0a693d7e16fe591a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
