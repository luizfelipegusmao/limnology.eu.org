{"title":"Dancing in the sun: maize azimuthal canopy re-orientation for efficient light capture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1568/7589259?rss=1","date":1706140800000,"content":"<span>Over the last seven decades, high-density planting has helped increase US maize grain yields, reaching more than 93,000 plants/ha in the mid-2010s (<a href=\"#koae026-B1\">Assefa et al. 2018</a>). However, high-density planting also brings challenges, such as increased shading, which can affect individual plant yield. These challenges prompt a closer look at canopy architecture, particularly leaf inclination angle and azimuthal canopy orientation. The leaf inclination angle to the horizontal plane is crucial for light penetration through the canopy and overall productivity. Historically, more erect leaves allow greater light penetration and have been linked to greater yield. Previous studies indicated that more hybrids with erect leaves were released after 1970 (<a href=\"#koae026-B3\">Duvick et al. 2004</a>). The changes in leaf inclination angle have been hypothesized to be related to higher plant density in use.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"5246d303421f8e073a34fd9dd4467d66d42e5b72771fc2bfa626bc76b9b2ceff","category":"Environment"}
