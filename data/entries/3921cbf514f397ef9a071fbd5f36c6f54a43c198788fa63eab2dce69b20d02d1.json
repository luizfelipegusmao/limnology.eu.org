{"title":"Efficacy of Lasmiditan as a Secondary Treatment for Migraine Attacks After Unsuccessful Treatment with a Triptan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0392/v1","date":1715089227000,"content":"The combined use of lasmiditan and triptan is unexplored in medical literature. This study aimed to investigate whether the intake of lasmiditan following triptan improves migraine pain. Following triptan intake, if headache relief was less than 50% at 1 hour, patients took 50 mg lasmiditan within 2 hours of migraine onset. Patients recorded headache intensity and adverse events(AEs) caused by lasmiditan at 1, 2, and 4 hours after intake of additional 50 mg of lasmiditan. A significant reduction in pain scale was observed post 50 mg lasmiditan intake (p &amp;lt; 0.001, t-test). Pain relief was reported for 32 migraine attacks (80%) at 1 hour after additional lasmiditan intake. Although AEs were observed in 63% of the patients who took an additional lasmiditan, most were mild and resolved 1 hour after lasmiditan intake. Our study revealed the significant headache reliefs provided by an additional lasmiditan for patients who did not achieve satisfactory results following initial triptan intake for treating migraine. The AEs associated with this treatment strategy were mild and lasted for a short term. This study suggested that the combination of triptan and lasmiditan is promising for the treatment of migraine and should be studied in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3921cbf514f397ef9a071fbd5f36c6f54a43c198788fa63eab2dce69b20d02d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
