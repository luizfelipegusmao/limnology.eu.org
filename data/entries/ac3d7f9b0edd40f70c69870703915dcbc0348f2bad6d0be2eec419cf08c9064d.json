This study aims to investigate the effects of RLS replacement of chlortetracycline (CTC) on growth performance, slaughtering traits, meat quality, antioxidant function and nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in broilers. A total of 600 one-day-old Arbor Acres chicks were randomly assigned to five groups with eight replicates in each group, raised for 42 days. Broilers were respectively fed a basal diet with no CTC or RLS, 75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> CTC, and 250, 500, 1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RLS.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Dietary supplementation with RLS linearly increased the average daily gain, average daily feed intake, carcass yield, eviscerated yield, ether extract, enhanced total superoxide and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, overexpressed the relative expressions of <i>Nrf2</i>, <i>heme oxygenase 1</i>, <i>Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase</i>, <i>Manganese superoxide dismutase</i>, <i>GPx</i> and <i>catalase</i> and decreased the lightness value at 24 h, drip loss and malondialdehyde contents of broilers (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, broilers fed 1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RLS reduced the drip loss and broilers fed 500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RLS increased muscle crude fat content (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Compared with the CTC group, dietary supplementation with 1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RLS increased eviscerated yield (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>RLS could improve growth performance, crude fat content, meat quality and antioxidant capacity and activate relative expression of genes in the Nrf2 signaling pathway in broilers. It could be used as an antibiotic substitute in diets and the recommended supplemental dose of RLS in feed of broilers is 1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yonghao Shi, \nQilu Zhou, \nChao Wu, \nJinsong Liu, \nCaimei Yang, \nTing Yang, \nRuiqiang Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ac3d7f9b0edd40f70c69870703915dcbc0348f2bad6d0be2eec419cf08c9064d","category":"Environment"}
