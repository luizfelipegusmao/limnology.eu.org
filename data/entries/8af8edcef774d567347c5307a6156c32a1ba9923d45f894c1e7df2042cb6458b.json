{"title":"The scent of roses, a bouquet of fragrance diversity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1252/7453485?rss=1","date":1701129600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Roses have been domesticated since antiquity for their therapeutic, cosmetic, and ornamental properties. Their floral fragrance has great economic value, which has influenced the production of rose varieties. The production of rose water and essential oil is one of the most lucrative activities, supplying bioactive molecules to the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and therapeutic industries. In recent years, major advances in molecular genetics, genomic, and biochemical tools have paved the way for the identification of molecules that make up the specific fragrance of various rose cultivars. The aim of this review is to highlight current knowledge on metabolite profiles, and more specifically on fragrance compounds, as well as the specificities and differences between rose species and cultivars belonging to different rose sections and how they contribute to modern roses fragrance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8af8edcef774d567347c5307a6156c32a1ba9923d45f894c1e7df2042cb6458b","category":"Environment"}
