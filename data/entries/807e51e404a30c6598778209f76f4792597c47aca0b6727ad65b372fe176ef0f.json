In this study, simplified rapid electrochemical sensing methods were sought via a remote cyclic voltammetry and stripping amplifier circuit using our workstation systems. A sensing probe was prepared using human DNA and a Covid 19 antigen immobilized antibody sensing amplifier with rapid accumulation time of 30 sec. Optimal experimentation was performed using a telematics WiFi wearable circuit equipped with a bioelectrochemical analyzer-2 amplifier three electrode system. Diagnostic accumulation voltammetry and cyclic redox scanning were attempted at -2.0V~2.0V potential windows and 0.2V/Sec scan rate. Anodic and cathodic real time assay was performed using saliva swab from female patients that tested negative and positive. Diagnostic results are expected to be useful for non-contact analysis and for rapid personal testing anytime, anywhere","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"807e51e404a30c6598778209f76f4792597c47aca0b6727ad65b372fe176ef0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
