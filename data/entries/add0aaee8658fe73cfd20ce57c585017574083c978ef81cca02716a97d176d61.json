{"title":"Development of rice lines by pyramiding of major blast resistance genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1091/v2","date":1729763474000,"content":"Rice blast is the most harmful disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, leading to yield loss. The aim of the work is to improve resistance of rice to blast by introducing and pyramiding genes using conventional breeding technique and modern MAS analysis. Pyramiding is the combination of several resistance genes in one genotype, in this case it improves the resistance of rice to pathogens. MAS analysis revealed that 3 out of 4 studied domestic high-yielding rice cultivars (Bakanasski, Aisaule and Aru) contain 1 blast resistance gene (Pi-2). It was discovered 7 pyramidal lines with the introduction of a combination of 2 blast resistance genes (Pi-1 and Pi-ta) into 6 hybrids and 3 genes (Pi-1, Pi-33 and Pi-ta) into 1 line. Phytopathological test of local cultivars and pyramidal lines of rice showed that 3 out of 7 pyramidal lines have moderate resistance: 2 lines (F2 Bakanasski/7667 (var. vulgaris Koern.) and F2 Aisaule/7664 (var. italica Alef.)), containing 2 resistance genes (Pi-1 and Pi-ta) and 1 line – F2 Aisaule/7689 (var. zeravschanica Brsch.), carrying 3 genes (Pi-1, Pi-33 and Pi-ta), while the local cultivars Bakanasski, Aisaule and Aru are susceptible. As a result, the blast resistance of rice was improved by creating pyramidal lines. Pyramided lines can be used for germplasm exchange and in rice breeding programs to improve blast resistance in rice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"add0aaee8658fe73cfd20ce57c585017574083c978ef81cca02716a97d176d61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
