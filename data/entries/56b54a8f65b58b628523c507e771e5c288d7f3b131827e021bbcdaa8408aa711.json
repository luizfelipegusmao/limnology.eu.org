{"title":"Dual Inhibition of PI3 Kinase and MAP Kinase Signaling Pathways in Intrahepatic Cholangiocellular Carcinoma Cell Lines Leads to Proliferation Arrest but Not Apoptosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0651/v1","date":1712653019000,"content":"Cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary liver cancer, with increasing incidence worldwide and inadequate therapeutic options. Intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts have distinctly different embryonic origins and developmental behavior, and accordingly intra- and extrahepatic CCAs (ICC vs. ECC) are molecularly different. A promising strategy in oncotherapy is targeted therapy, targeting proteins that regulate cell survival and proliferation; such as the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Inhibitors of these pathways have been tested previously in CCA cell lines. However, these cell lines could not be clearly assigned to ICC or ECC, and results indicated apoptosis induction by targeted therapeutics. We tested targeted therapeutics (selumetinib, MK2206) in three defined ICC cell lines (HuH28, RBE, SSP25). We observed cooperative effects of dual inhibition of the two pathways, in accordance with inhibition of phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK1/2 expression. Proliferation was blocked more effectively with dual inhibition than with each single inhibition, but cell numbers did not drop below baseline. Accordingly, we observed G1-phase arrest, but not apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, AIFM1 regulation, subG1-phase) or necroptosis (phospho-MLKL). We conclude that dual inhibition of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways is highly effective to block proliferation of ICC cell lines, but therapy must certainly be supplemented with standard therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56b54a8f65b58b628523c507e771e5c288d7f3b131827e021bbcdaa8408aa711","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
