{"title":"Dendritic bifunctional nanotraps inside SBA‐15 for highly efficient removal of selected nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs from wastewater","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14347?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Large-pore mesoporous SBA-15 materials were functionalized with dendritic bifunctional ligands to achieve efficient adsorption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in aqueous solution mainly through a combination of anion-exchange ability of quaternary ammonium cations and π-π interaction capability of oxygen activated phenyls. The synthesis of such a dendritic ligand starts from propylamine on SBA-15 followed by consecutive amine-epoxy reactions with resorcinol diglycidyl ether (RDGE) and methylamine, and then amination of terminal epoxy with trimethylamine. The results from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements and elemental analysis reveal that the bifunctional dendritic nanotraps have been created successfully inside the mesochannels of SBA-15 (DNT@SBA-15). Adsorption kinetics for NSAIDs was very rapid following a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and adsorption isotherms were fitted well by the Langmuir isotherm model. Notably, DNT@SBA-15 demonstrated remarkably high adsorption capacities for NSAIDs, with maximum values of 1037.3 mg g<sup>−1</sup> for ibuprofen, 821.3 mg g<sup>−1</sup> for naproxen and 781.3 mg g<sup>−1</sup> for diclofenac at pH 7.0. The adsorption was presumed to be governed by a dual-interaction mechanism including electrostatic and van der Waal's interactions. This study demonstrates that the developed dendritic anion-exchanger can be a promising material for removing NSAIDs adsorption from environmental water.</p>","author":"Lixuan Zhu, \nXiaoyi Gou, \nYajun Zheng, \nZhiming Zhang, \nYajie Huang, \nYan Zhang, \nYun Li, \nZhiping Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"b5f6ffded53f7993ba11d64d3f716fa88467920c0aa9e0a9101d8c880a4c06d2","category":"Environment"}
