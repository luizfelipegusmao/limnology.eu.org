{"title":"Various Prospects of Biodiesel Production: Techniques and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1068/v1","date":1726301803000,"content":"Globally, the fuel demand is increasing rapidly and the conventional method to produce fuel is toxic which causes environmental degradation and climate crisis. Therefore, biodiesel emerges as the substitute to overcome the conventional fuel problems because biodiesel is renewable and non-toxic. Biodiesel synthesis is the process of using fats and oils to produce biodiesel ester and glycerol.  Biodiesel can be produced using edible and non-edible feedstock but using the edible feedstocks problems like fuel vs food, nutritional value and economic considerations were raised. Therefore, non-edible feedstocks are being used to overcome problems arising from edible feedstock. As non-edible feedstocks can easily be grown anywhere on land, doesnâ€™t cause imbalance to food economy and has low cost. Many non-consumable seeds like Mahua, Jatropha, Castor, Neem etc. are used to produce biodiesel. Now a days, researchers are using nanoparticles to enhance the stability, quality, and properties of biodiesel. In future, researchers can use algae and microbial oils for production of biodiesel. Research can also use biojet fuel in such a way that it reduces the carbon emission. In future, production of biodiesel can be integrated into circular economy models to reduce environmental waste and impact. In this review we will discuss the production methods for biodiesel, catalysts for biodiesel production, and non-edible feedstock properties of biodiesel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc0585769215397d6f9cdffb4306306f6a5d02941cc0d60f14756071d5efea28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
