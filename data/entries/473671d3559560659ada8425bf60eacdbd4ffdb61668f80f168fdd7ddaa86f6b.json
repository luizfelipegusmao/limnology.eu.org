{"title":"Weibull Random Vibration Reliability Based on Cumulated Damage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0634/v1","date":1723190373000,"content":"In this paper, based on the cumulated damage generated by the cyclical application of the testing vibration profile, a methodology to determine the reliability index of the analyzed component is given. In the analysis, the testing time, component geometry, applied weight, and material resonant frequency are all of them considered by using a dynamic, and amplitude factor. Then, from the generated vibration response data of the analysis, the corresponding bending stress is determined for each one of the rows of the testing profile. And by the cyclical application of the whole testing profile, the corresponding damage is cumulated to each profile cycle until the cumulated damage is D=1. Finally, the reliability that each one of the cumulated blocks (cyclical profile application) is determined by considering, the random vibration is a stress variable. Thus, we use the cumulative damage model with the inverse power law stress/life relationship to determine the two parameter Weibull distribution used to estimate the reliability index of each cumulated block. As a numerical application, we analyze a cantilever aluminum beam Al 6061-T6.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"473671d3559560659ada8425bf60eacdbd4ffdb61668f80f168fdd7ddaa86f6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
