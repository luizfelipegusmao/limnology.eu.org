{"title":"Study on Bioactivie Components of Aromatic Cynanchum thesioides (Freyn) K. Schum by Solvent Fractionation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0233/v1","date":1728265646000,"content":"This study evaluated the antioxidant activity of the methanol extract from aromatic Cynanchum thesioides (Freyn) K. Schum. by fractionating it with different solvents, aiming to provide theoretical evidence for the development of products related to aromatic Cynanchum thesioides (Freyn) K. Schum. The yield of the methanol extract was 13.33%, with the water fraction showing the highest yield, followed by n-hexane, n-butanol, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate. Among these fractions, the ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest antioxidant activity, as indicated by total polyphenol content and ABTS radical scavenging activity. The DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and SOD-like activity measurements showed no significant difference between the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions, as both showed the highest radical scavenging activity. In the FRAP activity measurement, the n-butanol fraction ranked behind the ethyl acetate and dichloromethane fractions in terms of antioxidant activity. Although the ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest antioxidant activity, its yield was only 1.29%, making it unsuitable for product production considering productivity and economy. However, the n-butanol fraction showed overall high antioxidant activity and was approximately 4 times more abundant with a yield of 5.80% compared to the ethyl acetate fraction. Consequently, considering both productivity and economy, the n-butanol fraction is considered suitable for product development and production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b488a5c5532da2b0bc8d91145ca15fce2fdc5d4d5dcdc23f20778c6be34bbbe0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
