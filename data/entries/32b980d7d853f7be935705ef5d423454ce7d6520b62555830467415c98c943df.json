{"title":"PSIII-26 Blood biochemistry, metabolomics profiling, and histology of contaminated with mycotoxin: Acute dose exposure 30 days-repeated toxicity study in piglets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/460/7757595?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Toxicity caused by deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisin (FB) produced by <span>Fusarium</span> species, naturally occur in food and feed, can lead to repress appetite and growth inhibition in pigs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the mycotoxin exposure with different concentrations in liver, ileum, and rectum tissues of piglets. Animals fed binary mixtures of mycotoxins followed by 0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg feed for 30 d. The castrated pigs (Landrace × Yorkshire) were housed one per separated pen. The tissue samples were collected for nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Additionally, biochemistry and histology were determined. Final body weight (BW) showed significant differences between the control and nine differently treated groups. In the blood biochemical analysis, the absorption of mycotoxins was significantly increased blood urea nitrogen levels. However, decreasing lipase concentrations showed in binary mixture groups. Metabolomic profiles of liver tissue were more clearly separated based on orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis than ileum and rectum tissues. The liver (Met, Pro, Lys, and Cys), ileum (Thr, Gly, Pro and Asp), and rectum (Met, Thr, and Pro) metabolic profile revealed the potential metabolites for mycotoxin exposure, respectively. Particularly, decreasing proline concentrations at high dose (3 mg/kg) showed in liver. Whereas, two organs observed an inverse trend. In the histological analysis, Group 9 (DON 3 plus FB1 3 mg/kg) might aggravate the fibrosis in liver tissue using Masson’s trichrome stains. Contaminated with acute doses showed no dramatical changes ileum and rectum tissue. Taken together, our results indicated that low dose (0.5 mg/kg) of mycotoxin did not result in significant differences. However, high dose (3 mg/kg) of mycotoxin induced significantly toxicity causing physiological changes. In conclusion, these results suggest that the toxicity of acute exposure to binary mixture cannot be ignored in piglets, because of their effects on the liver, ileum, and rectum.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"32b980d7d853f7be935705ef5d423454ce7d6520b62555830467415c98c943df","category":"Environment"}
