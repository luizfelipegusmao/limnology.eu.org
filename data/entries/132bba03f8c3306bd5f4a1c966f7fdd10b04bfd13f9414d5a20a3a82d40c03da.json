Similar to the development of high entropy alloys (HEAs) [<a href=\"#ozae044.665-B2\">2</a>], entropy-stabilized oxide was accomplished by incorporating five different cations into a single-phase oxide system to demonstrate the entropy-driven structural stabilization effect [<a href=\"#ozae044.665-B3\">3</a>]. Both HEAs and HEOs (high-entropy oxides) have been explored for applications in heterogeneous catalysis and distinct catalytic properties have been reported [<a href=\"#ozae044.665-B4\">4</a>]. For practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis, however, HEAs/HEOs need to possess high specific surface area, which poses a significant challenge since high-temperature processing is usually required and sintering of HEO particles can drastically reduce their specific surface area.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"132bba03f8c3306bd5f4a1c966f7fdd10b04bfd13f9414d5a20a3a82d40c03da","category":"Environment"}
