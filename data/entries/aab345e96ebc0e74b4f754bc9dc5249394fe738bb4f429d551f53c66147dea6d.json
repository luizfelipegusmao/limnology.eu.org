{"title":"Sustainability in Music Education: Research on Sustainable Learning Strategy Based on Stochastic Nonlinear System of Psychological Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1434/v1","date":1713865926000,"content":"This research aims to explore factors that influence sustainable music education from a psychological perspective, and innovatively constructs a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. For first time, combines stochastic nonlinear system of control theory and identifies relevant factors affecting sustainable music learning by establishing a data system for questionnaire answering and a quantitative model for actual academic performance. Existing research mainly looks at several factors that affect fragmented music education from perspective of teachers' teaching rules, emphasizing phased teaching state and learning goals of teachers as main body, thus ignoring sustainable music education and students, who are a large group of music learning objects. The research fills gap in this type of research object, focusing on sustainable music education from an emotional perspective and students who occupy a dominant position in music learning, so as to more accurately explore impact of their emotional influencing factors on sustainable music learning. The most prominent innovation of this study lies in construction of stochastic nonlinear system for psychological influencing factors of sustainable student music learning and a quantitative model for actual learning effect. Through analysis of nonlinear system, weight values of several negative emotions on sustainable music learning are obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aab345e96ebc0e74b4f754bc9dc5249394fe738bb4f429d551f53c66147dea6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
