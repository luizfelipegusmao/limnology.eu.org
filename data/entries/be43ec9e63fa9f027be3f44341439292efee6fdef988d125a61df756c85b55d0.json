{"title":"Research progress on the regulatory mechanism of cell senescence in arsenic toxicity: a systematic review","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae136/7738295?rss=1","date":1724284800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As an element with metalloid properties, arsenic is pervasively present in the environment and is recognized as a potent carcinogen. Consequently, the issue of human arsenic exposure has become a significant concern within the global public health sector. Numerous studies have indicated that arsenic induces cellular senescence through various mechanisms, including triggering epigenetic alterations, inducing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), promoting telomere shortening, and causing mitochondrial dysfunction. This article collates and summarizes the latest research advancements on the involvement of cellular senescence in arsenic toxicity and explores the mechanisms of arsenic-induced toxicity. This study aims to provide new perspectives and directions for future research on arsenic toxicity and the development of prevention and treatment strategies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"be43ec9e63fa9f027be3f44341439292efee6fdef988d125a61df756c85b55d0","category":"Environment"}
