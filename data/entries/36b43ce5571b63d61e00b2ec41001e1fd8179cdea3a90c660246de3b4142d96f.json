{"title":"Prognostic value of NT-proBNP in the new era of heart failure treatment","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309948","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Dat Vu Nguyen, Si Van Nguyen, An Le Pham, Bay Thi Nguyen, Sy Van Hoang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality and hospitalization in cardiovascular patients. Guideline-directed medical treatment (GDMT) in the current era includes novel medications such as ARNI and SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as an approach to treatment based on clinical phenotypes. To assess prognostic factors for mortality and hospital readmissions plays a crucial role in patient care.</p> Objectives <p>This study aimed to determine the rate of 90-day post-discharge events in patients having heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and investigate the associated clinical factors.</p> Method <p>A prospective study was conducted on 110 HFrEF patients at the cardiology department of Cho Ray Hospital. The 90-day events included all-cause mortality and rehospitalization due to heart failure.</p> Results <p>The rate of 90-day events was 45.6%. After multivariable Cox regression analysis, NT-proBNP level ≥ 1858 pg/mL was identified as an independent factor associated with the 90-day events.</p> Conclusion <p>NT-proBNP cut-off ≥ 1858 pg/mL can be used for the prognosis of 90-day events in HFrEF.</p>","author":"Dat Vu Nguyen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"36b43ce5571b63d61e00b2ec41001e1fd8179cdea3a90c660246de3b4142d96f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
