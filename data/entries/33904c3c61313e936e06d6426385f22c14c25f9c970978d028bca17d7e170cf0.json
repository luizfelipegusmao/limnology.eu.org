The causal inference from observational data provides a statistical approach for this issue, where the experimental research is infeasible. Various causal inference methods exist, each assuming distinct underlying systems for the targeted variables: pure stochastic or deterministic dynamic system (DDS), which means that these methods detect different types of causality: separable or non-separable. Acknowledging the inherent deterministic dynamic nature of SM-P coupling, this study employs a DDS-based method: Convergent Cross-mapping (CCM), to detect their non-separable causality. Centering around SM-P coupling, we also detect the causality between SMs in shallow and deeper layers, and the causality between evapotranspiration (ET) and SMs in all layers. Notably, before applying CCM, a preconditional procedure is required: verifying the DDS nature of targeted variables P, SM, and ET. Key findings of this research include: (a) In SM-P coupling, only SMs in shallow layers but not deeper layers could render causalities toward P, while P renders causalities toward SMs in all layers. (b) The time-delay of causality from SM1 to P in spring/summer is around 4–6 days, and that from P to SM1 is around 2–4 days. (c) Inside SMs, shallow SMs have obvious causalities downwards to deeper SMs, but deeper SMs seem harder to render causalities upwards to shallow SMs, explaining why they hardly render causalities to P. In summary, this study furnishes an indispensable DDS-based complement to stochastic-based methodologies for SM-P coupling.</p>","author":"Yiyang Zhao, \nEnze Ma, \nZhaoqiang Zhou, \nYiguang Zou, \nZhaodan Cao, \nHejiang Cai, \nCi Li, \nYuhan Yan, \nYan Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"33904c3c61313e936e06d6426385f22c14c25f9c970978d028bca17d7e170cf0","category":"Environment"}
