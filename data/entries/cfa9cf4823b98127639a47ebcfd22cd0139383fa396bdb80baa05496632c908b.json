The continued evolution of applications and maturation of basic TEM instruments have not only created additional sectors in the electron microscopy industry (life sciences, nanotechnology, and semiconductor), but have fostered significant growth in these areas that the new market sectors are comparable in size to the once dominant materials science market [<a href=\"#ozae044.721-B1\">1</a>]. Due to the growing applications of temporally resolved electron microscopy for probing fundamental chemical and electronic phenomena as well as reducing beam-induced damage, temporally resolved electron microscopy has experienced a much broader adoption across many technical fields (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong>). Complex laser techniques with limited image acquisition times have been complemented by ultrafast rf and microwave-driven techniques that can be synchronized with any sample excitation (laser, rf, thermal) providing much faster image acquisition times (from days to mere minutes). These complementary ultrafast techniques can also be used as ‘fast’ beam blankers with larger pulse widths for observing phenomena on timescales larger than 100 picoseconds, providing more flexibility and therefore wider adoption of these laser-free electron beam modulation techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cfa9cf4823b98127639a47ebcfd22cd0139383fa396bdb80baa05496632c908b","category":"Environment"}
