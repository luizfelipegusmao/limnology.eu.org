{"title":"Gluten‐free lentil cakes with optimal technological and nutritional characteristics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13459?af=R","date":1710851638000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Celiac population usually struggle finding nutritive gluten-free (GF) baked goods. GF foods can be improved using legume flours. Eleven GF cake formulations were elaborated according to different percentages of lentil flour (LF), corn flour (CF) and rice flour (RF) using a simplex lattice design. Water holding capacity (WHC) and particle size of flours were evaluated. Moisture, aw, pH, specific volume, texture profile analysis, relaxation, color and alveolar characteristics were determined for crumbs of all formulations. An optimization process was used to enhance the technological and nutritional attributes, selecting the three best formulations containing LF: 46 % LF + 54 % RF (C<sub>LF+RF</sub>); 49 % LF + 51 % CF (C<sub>LF+CF</sub>); and 100 % LF (C<sub>LF</sub>), evaluated in their proximal composition and sensory characteristics. Linear and quadratic models for predicting behavior of GF lentil cakes were obtained.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>LF and CF could favor water incorporation and more resistance to enzymatic digestion than RF. Formulations with LF showed an improve in specific volume and alveolar parameters, while use of RF led to better cohesiveness, elasticity and resilience but it deteriorated chewiness and firmness. C<sub>LF</sub> can be labeled as high in protein and fiber and presented the lowest amounts of lipids, carbohydrates and energy content. Consumer preference leaned towards C<sub>LF+RF.</sub></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It was possible to elaborate GF cakes using LF, obtaining nutritive products that can be offered to people intolerant to gluten ingestion.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
