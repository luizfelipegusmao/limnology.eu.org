{"title":"Impact of body mass index on mortality outcomes in intensive care patients with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sepsis: A retrospective analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308471","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Heping Xu, Yiqiao Liu, Huan Niu, Hong Wang, Feng Zhan</p>\r\nBackground <p>Evidence associating body mass index (BMI) with the prognosis of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sepsis remains scarce.</p> Objective <p>To explore the association between BMI and clinical outcomes in intensive care units patients with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sepsis.</p> Methods <p>A retrospective analysis of patients with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sepsis was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database from the Critical Care Medicine Information. Data were collected within the first 24 hours of intensive care units admission. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. The association between BMI and 28-day all-cause mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.</p> Results <p>The study included 2,295 patients with an average age of 63.5 (16.1) years, 60.2% of whom were male. Multivariate analysis revealed that each 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in BMI was linked to a 2.8% decrease in the risk of 28-day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.972, 95% CI: 0.955–0.990, P = 0.002). Patients in the medium and high BMI categories had significantly lower risks of 28-day mortality compared to those in the low BMI group (OR [95% CI] 0.650 [0.474–0.891]; OR [95% CI] 0.516 [0.378–0.705]; P trend &lt; 0.0001). The RCS model showed a non-linear association between BMI and 28-day mortality (P = 0.014). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with elevated BMI had lower 28-day mortality (P &lt; 0.0001). Notably, significant interactions between AKI and SOFA with BMI were observed (P&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>Increased BMI is associated with a reduced risk of 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sepsis.</p>","author":"Heping Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"76c25829854e4fe05350ace0abd9d0e2daaaa048e8eb91197e7d079fbd20257e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
