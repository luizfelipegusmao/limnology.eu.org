{"title":"Occurrence and Abundance of Some Non-Indigenous Sparid Species (Actinopterygii: Sparidae) in the Coastal Bulgarian Black Sea Waters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2022/v1","date":1714489398000,"content":"Fish species diversity in the Black Sea is affected by the introduction of non-indigenous species, particularly through the process of \"mediterranization\" and the expansion of the ranges of invasive species. In August 2023, we documented an increasing quantity of four non- indigenous sparid species, namely Spicara smaris (Linnaeus, 1758), Diplodus puntazzo (Walbaum, 1792), Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758), and Lithognathus mormyrus (Linnaeus, 1758), in the coastal Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea, based on citizen science data obtained from small-scale fisheries and pelagic trawlers. However, in the autumn of 2022, only small quantities of S. smaris were collected periodically, indicating significant fluctuations in abundance and occasional presence. The other three species were recorded in August 2023 in the central coastal region near the Fandakliyska River, at depths of less than 10 m. This brief communication presents information on the identified species, including sampling locations and biological data, and examines the sparid species records in the Black Sea. In addition, we reviewed recent studies on the distribution and biological traits of the identified species in their natural Mediterranean habitats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09c8f888f7d0be9c1bf0944da2a4a9465aef07e3d60bfbea685709ea589dc668","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
