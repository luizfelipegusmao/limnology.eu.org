In this minireview, we outline recent progress in hybridization strategies in constructing high- performance cocatalyst/photocatalyst systems. We discussed the fundamental principles of photocatalytic water splitting and the pivotal role of cocatalysts. We placed special emphasis on understanding the structure-activity relationship of cocatalysts for effective photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production from pure H<sub>2</sub>O. We expect this review to offer insights and stimulate further research interest in the development of high-performance cocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.
