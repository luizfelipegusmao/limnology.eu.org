In this minireview, we outline recent progress in hybridization strategies in constructing high- performance cocatalyst/photocatalyst systems. We discussed the fundamental principles of photocatalytic water splitting and the pivotal role of cocatalysts. We placed special emphasis on understanding the structure-activity relationship of cocatalysts for effective photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production from pure H<sub>2</sub>O. We expect this review to offer insights and stimulate further research interest in the development of high-performance cocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.\n\n</p>\n<br />","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"ae55fd28c40c78bbbebb1a17a06561d6efcb7d80ce9e84860abfd68d8a11b038","category":"Environment"}
