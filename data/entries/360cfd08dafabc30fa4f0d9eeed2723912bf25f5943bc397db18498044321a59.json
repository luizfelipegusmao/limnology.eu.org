{"title":"Impeding Digital Transformation by Establishing a Continuous Process of Competence Reconfiguration: Developing the New Construct and Measurements for Sustained Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0632/v1","date":1725866247000,"content":"Organisations need dynamic capabilities in the ongoing digital transformation to reconfigure knowledge and learning. There is a need to define new concepts and explain mechanisms of relevant factors to build dynamic capabilities. Especially organisations acting in healthcare are caught in a dilemmatic situation. New, digital processes and business models are promising benefits for cost-containment measures and improved patient-centric care, offering digital services. However, investments are needed to benefit. The important question is: how can individual actors in healthcare be motivated to engage in this transformational process to build and reconfigure relevant competences and establish new learning routines? Founded on the essence of existing literature, we assume sustained learning as a relevant dynamic capability to seize and sense competences and reconfigure human capital. This paper answers the call for deeper investigations into the mechanisms in new digitally transformed environments and sectors with less focus on performance and competitive advantages, like public administration or the healthcare sector. Based on previous research, validated in qualitative interviews and quantitative testing, we define the new construct of sustained learning with its subdimensions. By providing measures, we build the ground for further quantitative research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"360cfd08dafabc30fa4f0d9eeed2723912bf25f5943bc397db18498044321a59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
