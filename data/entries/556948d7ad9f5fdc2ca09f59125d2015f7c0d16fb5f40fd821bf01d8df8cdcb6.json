We aimed to use human cord blood-derived mast cells (hCBMCs) as a model to evaluate different conditions under which chemokines and growth factors are expressed and secreted as mediators upon stimulation with the alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33).</p> Methods <p>hCBMCs were stimulated with 10 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-33 (rhIL-33) for 6 h (acute) or 24 h (chronic). The mRNA expression of chemokines and growth factors was analyzed using microarrays, and the mediators released in the supernatant were evaluated using a multiplex assay.</p> Results <p>The mRNA expression levels of C-C chemokine ligands (CCL) CCL1, CCL5, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-4/CCL18 were upregulated under all conditions. In contrast, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) CXCL8 and CCL24 levels increased only under acute (6 h) and prolonged (24 h) conditions, respectively. Moreover, high levels of CXCL8, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β were secreted during acute inflammation, whereas the release of GM-CSF and CXCL9 proteins increased under all four conditions.</p> Conclusions <p>This study highlights the sentinel role of MCs in mounting a specific immune response against a pathogenic-like stimulus in a timely and dose-dependent manner and is relevant for improving inflammatory treatment options.</p>","author":"Sherin Bakhashab","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"556948d7ad9f5fdc2ca09f59125d2015f7c0d16fb5f40fd821bf01d8df8cdcb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
