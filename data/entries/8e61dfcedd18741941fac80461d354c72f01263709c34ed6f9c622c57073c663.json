{"title":"Preparing for patient-customized N-of-1 Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapy to Treat Rare Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1955/v1","date":1716977290000,"content":"The process of developing therapies to treat rare diseases is fraught with financial, regulatory, and logistical challenges that have limited our ability to build effective treatments. Recently, a novel type of therapy called antisense therapy has shown immense potential for the treatment of rare diseases, particularly through single-patient N-of-1 trials. Several N-of-1 antisense therapies have been developed recently for rare diseases, including the landmark study of milasen. In response to the success of N-of-1 antisense therapy, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed unique guidelines specifically for the development of antisense therapy to treat N-of-1 rare diseases. This policy change establishes a strong foundation for future therapy development, and addresses some of the major limitations that previously hindered the development of therapies for rare diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e61dfcedd18741941fac80461d354c72f01263709c34ed6f9c622c57073c663","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
