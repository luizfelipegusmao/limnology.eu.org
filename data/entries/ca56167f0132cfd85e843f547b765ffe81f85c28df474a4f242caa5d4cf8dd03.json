{"title":"Tackling the Challenge of Visceral Leishmaniasis: A Severe Threat to Public Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0513/v1","date":1728364606000,"content":"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), or kala-azar, is a severe and potentially fatal form of leishmaniasis, a disease classified under Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). VL primarily affects the internal organs, with symptoms ranging from chronic fever and weight loss to hepatosplenomegaly and anemia. The disease is transmitted by sandflies, with Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum being the primary pathogens. Despite various treatment options like liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, challenges remain due to drug toxicity, high costs, and limited availability. Alternative therapeutic approaches, particularly those involving phytocompounds, offer promising potential for overcoming these limitations and improving outcomes for affected populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca56167f0132cfd85e843f547b765ffe81f85c28df474a4f242caa5d4cf8dd03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
