The main objective of this work is to evaluate the attitude of healthcare professionals towards the first universal vaccination campaign in our region, as well as the acceptability of the vaccines used and the attitude towards the piloting of school vaccination. Cross-sectional, survey-based, descriptive study. All healthcare professionals involved in the campaign were invited to participate. The 91.9% of surveyed professionals thought that flu vaccination from 6 to 59 months was important or very important. 89.8% had previous experience regarding the intramuscular vaccine. The professionals valued the intranasal vaccine significantly more positively; however, there were no differences when asking for each of the vaccines without comparison. The inhaled vaccine was preferred by 97.5% for the following campaign. Piloted school vaccination showed 75% acceptance. The inhaled vaccine was preferred by most professionals and the piloted school vaccination was highly accepted, and independently associated to the importance of vaccination as considered by physicians, being a medical doctor, and participation in the pilot program.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b73d509c0f2167717dfe368f743cc0c73936eba5fd97386d7884e8a590a0364","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
