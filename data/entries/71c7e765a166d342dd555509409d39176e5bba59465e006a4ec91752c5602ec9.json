{"title":"Ecological investigations of giant Phaeocystis colonies in Viet Nam: II. Photosynthesis—irradiance characteristics and nitrogen uptake","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13501?af=R","date":1726470000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Phaeocystis globosa</i> is a marine phytoplankton species that forms deleterious blooms in temperate and tropical waters. In some locations, “giant” colonies form, although the controls on its size are unknown. During a “giant” colony bloom, measurements were completed to characterize photosynthesis–irradiance relationships, nitrogen uptake kinetics, and nitrogen–irradiance relationships of <i>P. globosa</i> colonies to understand its growth characteristics and their relationship to colony size. The photosynthetic capacity (<i>F</i>\n<sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i>\n<sub>m</sub>) varied from 0.65 to 0.68 among colony sizes ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 mm, indicating that all colonial cells were physiologically robust. The maximum chl <i>a</i>-specific photosynthetic rates (PmaxB$$ {P}_{\\mathrm{max}}^B $$) ranged from 0.89 to 1.92 μg C · μg<sup>−1</sup> chl · h<sup>−1</sup>, were maximal in the mid-sized colonies (5.5–6.5 mm) and decreased with size. The relatively low PmaxB$$ {P}_{\\mathrm{max}}^B $$ values may be related to the high cellular chl <i>a</i> of colonial cells and their acclimation to in situ irradiance. Nitrate Vmax$$ {V}_{\\mathrm{max}} $$ and KS$$ {K}_S $$ values were greater than those of ammonium, although N affinity was greater for ammonium. No differences in light-limited rates in either nitrate or ammonium uptake among colony sizes were observed, and no dark uptake occurred. Both ammonium and nitrate uptake showed a saturation response as a function of irradiance. While the driving forces for the formation of giant colonies remain unknown, their impacts on coastal systems are substantial and a further assessment of their growth is warranted.</p>","author":"Rui Meng, \nWalker O.
