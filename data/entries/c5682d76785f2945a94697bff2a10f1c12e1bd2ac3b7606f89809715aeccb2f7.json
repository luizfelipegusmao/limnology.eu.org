{"title":"Variety ofÂ Plant Oils: Species-Specific Lipid Biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/845/7424541?rss=1","date":1700092800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant oils represent a large group of neutral lipids with important applications in food, feed and oleochemical industries. Most plants accumulate oils in the form of triacylglycerol within seeds and their surrounding tissues, which comprises three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone. Different plant species accumulate unique fatty acids in their oils, serving a range of applications in pharmaceuticals and oleochemicals. To enable the production of these distinctive oils, select plant species have adapted specialized oil metabolism pathways, involving differential gene co-expression networks and structurally divergent enzymes/proteins. Here, we summarize some of the recent advances in our understanding of oil biosynthesis in plants. We compare expression patterns of oil metabolism genes from representative species, including <span>Arabidopsis thaliana, Ricinus communis</span> (castor bean), <span>Linum usitatissimum</span> L. (flax) and <span>Elaeis guineensis</span> (oil palm) to showcase the co-expression networks of relevant genes for acyl metabolism. We also review several divergent enzymes/proteins associated with key catalytic steps of unique oil accumulation, including fatty acid desaturases, diacylglycerol acyltransferases and oleosins, highlighting their structural features and preference toward unique lipid substrates. Lastly, we briefly discuss protein interactomes and substrate channeling for oil biosynthesis and the complex regulation of these processes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"c5682d76785f2945a94697bff2a10f1c12e1bd2ac3b7606f89809715aeccb2f7","category":"Environment"}
