{"title":"Hybrid Approaches for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Neural Networks and Traditional Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0625/v1","date":1723155625000,"content":"This paper explores innovative approaches to determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors through the combination of neural networks and traditional numerical methods. Traditional methods like the Newton-Raphson and Durand-Kerner algorithms are proven effective but often require good initial approximations and can be sensitive to the choice of starting points. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that uses neural networks to generate better initial approximations, which are then iteratively refined using traditional methods. By combining the pattern recognition power of neural networks with the adaptability of traditional numerical methods, we demonstrate faster convergence and higher accuracy in determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Experimental results on various polynomials of different degrees and characteristics show that our hybrid approach outperforms individual methods, providing a more robust and efficient solution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df5fd7c60b8d17409391a903f72e939b75bf77ed3a84102aa6c68af9ec59a4ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
