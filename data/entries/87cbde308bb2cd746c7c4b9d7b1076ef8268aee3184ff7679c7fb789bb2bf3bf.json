{"title":"Rapid IDH1-R132 genotyping panel utilizing locked nucleic acid loop-mediated isothermal amplification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae012/7612232?rss=1","date":1708473600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>While the detection of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is important for evaluating human health and disease, most genotyping methods require a nucleic acid extraction step and lengthy analytical times. Here, we present a protocol which utilizes the integration of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) into self-annealing loop primers for the allelic discrimination of five isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132 (<span>IDH1</span>-R132) variants using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). This genotyping panel was initially evaluated using purified synthetic DNA to show proof of specific SNV discrimination. Additional evaluation using glioma tumor lysates with known <span>IDH1</span>-R132 mutational status demonstrated specificity in approximately 35â€‰min without the need for a nucleic acid extraction purification step. This LNA-LAMP-based genotyping assay can detect single base differences in purified nucleic acids or tissue homogenates, including instances where the variant of interest is present in an excess of background wild-type DNA. The pH-based colorimetric indicator of LNA-LAMP facilitates convenient visual interpretation of reactions, and we demonstrate successful translation to an end-point format using absorbance ratio, allowing for an alternative and objective approach for differentiating between positive and negative reactions. Importantly, the LNA-LAMP genotyping panel is highly reproducible, with no false-positive or false-negative results observed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"87cbde308bb2cd746c7c4b9d7b1076ef8268aee3184ff7679c7fb789bb2bf3bf","category":"Environment"}
