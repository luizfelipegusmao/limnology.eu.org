{"title":"In-gallery social behaviors of the ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/85/7584717?rss=1","date":1705708800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The east Asian ambrosia beetle <span>Xylosandrus germanus</span> (Blanford) was first detected in the United States in 1932. It now occurs across much of eastern North America and parts of the Pacific Northwest. It attacks a broad range of stressed, woody hosts including ornamental and orchard species. The foundress tunnels into the sapwood of hosts where it cultures a symbiotic fungus as food for its offspring. A few other ambrosia beetles have been shown to possess a facultatively eusocial structure among gallery members, but this has not been described for <span>Xylosandrus</span> spp. Using a novel artificial diet arena, we quantified the behaviors of <span>X. germanus</span> larvae and adults (foundress and mature offspring) over 10 wk inside their galleries. Foundresses were responsible for constructing the gallery. They also initially tended the fungal garden and brood but eventually spent most of their time blocking the gallery entrance. Larvae were mainly observed to feed, crawl, or be inactive within the gallery, regardless of the absence or presence of adult siblings. Adult female offspring were primarily inactive, likely due to dormancy. Adult male offspring actively crawled and attempted to mate with their sisters before eventually dispersing out of the gallery. Cooperative hygienic behaviors (removal of frass, cannibalism of dead nest mates, grooming siblings) were observed but a division of labor among offspring was not clear. Rather, foundress behaviors were mostly distinct from offspring behaviors, particularly as the gallery aged. Because no overlap in generations occurred, <span>X. germanus</span> displays a quasisocial structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"36d51e647332fbba567efec5a3e77386cfa262caf96890721678c230b1cd5631","category":"Environment"}
