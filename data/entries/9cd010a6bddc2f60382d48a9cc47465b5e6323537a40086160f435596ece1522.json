Unfortunately, incidence of jacking has increased linked to intensive rearing conditions. This study subjected 1000 salmon (52.1 ± 5.2 g) to one of two temperatures (15, 12.5°C) and one of two photoperiods (constant light-LL, a 5-week LD12:12 winter signal regime-WS) to assess their effects on spermatogenesis regulation. Indicators included testis histology images, mRNA transcription of gonadotropin receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone (<i>fshr</i>) and luteinizing hormone (<i>lhr</i>), and of factors regulating spermatogenesis like anti-Müllerian hormone (<i>amh</i>), gonadal-soma-derived factors 1 and 2 (<i>gsdf1</i> and <i>gsdf2</i>), and insulin-like growth factor-3 (<i>igf3</i>). High temperature (15°C) induced early testis development processes irrespective of photoperiod, evidenced by presence of type B spermatogonia before clear increases in testis size or any transcriptional changes. The winter signal at 15°C caused a synchronized onset of spermatogenesis not present under constant light. This was evidenced by a pronounced downregulation of the spermatogenesis-inhibiting factor <i>amh</i> and a clear upregulation in the stimulating factor <i>igf3</i>. Consequently, combining high temperatures with winter signal regimes pose risk; high temperature can stimulate early cellular/endocrine processes of spermatogenesis, which can later be synchronized in the population by an increase in daylength.</p>","author":"Enrique Pino‐Martinez, \nKari Anne Kamlund, \nPablo Balseiro, \nMarianne Kraugerud, \nAlbert Kjartan Dagbjartarson Imsland, \nSigurd O.
