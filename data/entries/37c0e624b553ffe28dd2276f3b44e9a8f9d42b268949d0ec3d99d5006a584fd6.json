{"title":"Genetic engineering of drought- and salt-tolerant tomato via Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase S-nitrosylation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1038/7628149?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought and soil salinization substantially impact agriculture. While proline’s role in enhancing stress tolerance is known, the exact molecular mechanism by which plants process stress signals and control proline synthesis under stress is still not fully understood. In tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span> L.), drought and salt stress stimulate nitric oxide (NO) production, which boosts proline synthesis by activating <span>Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase</span> (<span>SlP5CS</span>) and <span>Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase</span> (<span>SlP5CR</span>) genes and the P5CR enzyme. The crucial factor is stress-triggered NO production, which regulates the <span>S</span>-nitrosylation of SlP5CR at Cys-5, thereby increasing its NAD(P)H affinity and enzymatic activity. <span>S</span>-nitrosylation of SlP5CR enables tomato plants to better adapt to changing NAD(P)H levels, boosting both SlP5CR activity and proline synthesis during stress. By comparing tomato lines genetically modified to express different forms of <span>SlP5CR</span>, including a variant mimicking <span>S</span>-nitrosylation (<span>SlP5CRC5W</span>), we found that <span>SlP5CRC5W</span> plants show superior growth and stress tolerance. This is attributed to better P5CR activity, proline production, water use efficiency, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and sodium excretion. Overall, this study demonstrates that tomato engineered to mimic <span>S</span>-nitrosylated SlP5CR exhibits enhanced growth and yield under drought and salt stress conditions, highlighting a promising approach for stress-tolerant tomato cultivation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"37c0e624b553ffe28dd2276f3b44e9a8f9d42b268949d0ec3d99d5006a584fd6","category":"Environment"}
