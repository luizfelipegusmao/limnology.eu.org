{"title":"RHO OF PLANTS signalling and the activating ROP GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS: specificity in cellular signal transduction in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/12/3685/7659659?rss=1","date":1714348800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Every cell constantly receives signals from its neighbours or the environment. In plants, most signals are perceived by RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASEs (RLKs) and then transmitted into the cell. The molecular switches RHO OF PLANTS (ROP) are critical proteins for polar signal transduction and regulate multiple cell polarity processes downstream of RLKs. Many ROP-regulating proteins and scaffold proteins of the ROP complex are known. However, the spatiotemporal ROP signalling complex composition is not yet understood. Moreover, how specificity is achieved in different ROP signalling pathways within one cell still needs to be determined. This review gives an overview of recent advances in ROP signalling and how specificity by downstream scaffold proteins can be achieved. The composition of the ROP signalling complexes is discussed, focusing on the possibility of the simultaneous presence of ROP activators and inactivators within the same complex to balance ROP activity. Furthermore, this review highlights the function of plant-specific ROP GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS polarizing ROP signalling and defining the specificity of the initiated ROP signalling pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"1adf9adfd19554c9fa23c847b5cbacba281083bd17e10ef6e6bddb111b1524a5","category":"Environment"}
