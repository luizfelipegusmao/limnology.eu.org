{"title":"The paradox of Picroside II: As a natural antioxidant, but may instead futher aggravate liver injury by exacerbating mitochondrial oxidative stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae073/7675698?rss=1","date":1715904000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Picroside II (PII), an iridoid glycoside extracted from the rhizomes and stems of the genus Picroside, exhibits pronounced hepatoprotective properties. Pre-administration of PII protects against acute liver injury caused by D-galactosamine (D-Gal), carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>), and acetaminophen (APAP). This study aimed to elucidate the ramifications of PII administration subsequent to the initiation of acute hepatic injury.<div>Methods</div>Exploring the role of PII treatment in APAP-treated cell and rat models and in D-Gal and CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated rat models.<div>Results</div>In rats, APAP treatment increased serum aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels and decreased glutathione activity and the fluidity of the liver mitochondrial membrane. In L-02 cells, APAP exposure resulted in a decrement in membrane potential, an augmentation in the liberation of reactive oxygen species, and an acceleration of apoptotic processes. Moreover, PII pre-administration protected against D-Gal-induced acute hepatic injury and CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced chronic hepatic injury in rodent models, whereas PII administration post-injury aggravated CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced chronic hepatic injury.<div>Conclusions</div>Our results suggest that the effects of PII depend on the hepatic physiological or pathological state at the time of intervention. While PII possesses the potential to avert drug-induced acute hepatic injury through the mitigation of oxidative stress, its administration post-injury may exacerbate the hepatic damage, underscoring the critical importance of timing in therapeutic interventions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"17db5c678a96f3997777c235873ae28e7ea25ccc4fa0bfd43b5b10b863fe3ce1","category":"Environment"}
