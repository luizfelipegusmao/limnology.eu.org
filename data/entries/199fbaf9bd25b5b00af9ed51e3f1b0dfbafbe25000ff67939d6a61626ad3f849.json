{"title":"Antifungal Activity of Rhizosphere Bacillus Isolated from Ziziphus jujuba Against Alternaria alternata","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0957/v1","date":1728704237000,"content":"The serious impact of Alternaria alternata on jujube black spot disease has seriously affected the quality and yield of jujube, constraining the sustainable development of the jujube industry. The purpose of this study was to isolate and screen highly effective biocontrol strains of jujube black spot disease from jujube rhizosphere soil. Thirty-three soil samples were collected from 4 regions in southern Xinjiang. The strains with antagonistic effects were isolated and screened by the dilution spread method and plate confrontation method and identified by morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, as well as 16S rDNA, gyrB, and rpoB gene sequences. Indoor and field efficacy experiments were conducted to determine their biocontrol effect. A total of 110 strains with antibacterial activity were selected, and one strain, Bacillus velezensis 26-8, with a stable antagonistic effect was further tested. Biological characteristic experiments showed that strain 26-8 could grow at NaCl concentrations of 0.5%-10% and pH 4.0-9.0. The biocontrol experiment results showed that Bacillus velezensis 26-8 could achieve an 89.83% control effect against black spot disease. In conclusion, strain 26-8 has good salt and alkali tolerance, exerts a good control effect on jujube black spot disease, and is worthy of further study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"199fbaf9bd25b5b00af9ed51e3f1b0dfbafbe25000ff67939d6a61626ad3f849","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
