We conducted repeated cross-sectional serosurveys (July 2020 –November 2021) using residual samples from patients from Cape Town, South Africa, sent for routine laboratory studies for non-COVID-19 conditions. SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies and linked clinical information were used to investigate: (1) seroprevalence over time and risk factors associated with seropositivity, (2) ecological comparison of seroprevalence between subdistricts, (3) case ascertainment rates, and (4) the relative protection against COVID-19 associated with seropositivity and vaccination statuses. Among the subset sampled, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town increased from 39.19% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37.23–41.19) in July 2020 to 67.8% (95%CI 66.31–69.25) in November 2021. Poorer communities had both higher seroprevalence and COVID-19 mortality. Only 10% of seropositive individuals had a recorded positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Using COVID-19 hospital admission and death data at the Provincial Health Data Centre, antibody positivity before the start of the Omicron BA.1 wave (28 November 2021) was strongly protective for severe disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.15; 95%CI 0.05–0.46), with additional benefit in those who were also vaccinated (aOR 0.07, 95%CI 0.01–0.35). The high population seroprevalence in Cape Town was attained at the cost of substantial COVID-19 mortality. At the individual level, seropositivity was highly protective against subsequent infections and severe COVID-19 disease. In low-income communities, where diagnostic testing capacity is often limited, surveillance systems dependent on them will underestimate the true extent of an outbreak. Rapidly conducted seroprevalence studies can play an important role in addressing this.","author":"Hannah Hussey","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"a0cd66b39e49357183b8e1741bc5ff84ca88bf4028c4540060de2a31b32247ac","category":"Environment"}
