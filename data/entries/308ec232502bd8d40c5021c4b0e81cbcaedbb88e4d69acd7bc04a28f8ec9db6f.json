{"title":"Neighbour‚Äêdetection causes shifts in allocation across multiple organs to prepare plants for light competition","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.14603?af=R","date":1722927600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nTo maximize their fitness, plants have to adjust their allocation strategy according to their abiotic and biotic environments. Plants can use the ratio of red to far-red light (R:FR) to sense neighbours, allowing them to modify their growth in response to aboveground competition.\n\nIn this study, we used supplemental FR light to artificially lower the R:FR of the lower leaves of common sunflowers (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) to examine how plants change their growth in response to the threat of neighbours. We combined this treatment with a nitrogen fertilization treatment to investigate how responses to neighbour-detection interact with nitrogen limitation.\n\nPlants grown in low R:FR increased in height at the expense of root growth, resulting in nitrogen limitation that restricted leaf growth. However, we found that plants reduced their nitrogen investment into leaves in low R:FR. By weakening the nitrogen sink strength of these lower leaves before they experienced low photosynthetically active radiation, plants were able to preemptively allocate nitrogen to leaves higher in the canopy.\n\nPlants responded to the perception of neighbours by simultaneously diverting resources from root growth to stem elongation and from leaves threatened by neighbours to leaves that would pose a threat to neighbours. This whole-plant response to neighbour-detection enables plants to change their allocation in a way that simultaneously manages their limited nitrogen and prepares them for future light competition.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/06/06/plants-make-strategic-adjustments-to-their-growth-when-threatened-by-neighbors/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Isaac K.
