A total of 1,086 eddies were identified in the Mozambique Channel, comprising 509 cyclonic eddies and 577 anticyclonic eddies. The results revealed that the bay area on the northwest coast of Madagascar was the main hotspot of eddy generation, and the mean amplitude and radius of the anticyclonic eddies in the Mozambique Channel were 24.23 cm and 82.7 km, respectively, which are larger than those of the cyclonic eddies. Local wind forcing had a significant impact on the formation of mesoscale eddies in the Mozambique Channel. In winter, the wind stress in the northern and southern areas of the Mozambique Channel exhibited a strong correlation with the distribution of eddy kinetic energy (EKE), where both monsoonal winds in the north and trade winds in the south could facilitate mesoscale anticyclonic eddy formation. In addition, the variability in the number of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in the Mozambique Channel may have exerted a significant influence on the seasonal anomalous fluctuations in local sea surface temperatures (SSTs). This study presented a novel analysis of the mesoscale eddy characteristics in the Mozambique Channel.","author":"Linfei Bai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bc2a15394e24478692d6617c5070e5d39fd820ceb55785f0e1d07419e2845a70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
