{"title":"Prospect for Fine and Coarse Coal Waste Deployment for a Constructed Technosol and Eragrostis tef Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1608/v1","date":1719222473000,"content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate soil properties and Eragrostis tef (teff) growth on Technosols produced from coarse and fine coal wastes from Moatize Mine, Mozambique. The experiment was performed in triplicate in 30 L containers filled with different substrate conditions, composed of fine coal waste, coarse coal waste, agricultural soil, and sewage sludge as an organic matter source. The soil analyses included bulk density, available water capacity, permeability, and fertility. Plant growth was monitored for biomass production and plant tissue composition. All the substrates presented a good available water capacity and a proper drainage condition. Regarding the soil fertility, there were shortages of potassium and boron in the substrates composed exclusively of coal wastes, which was reflected in the composition of the plant tissue. Even so, plant growth was statistically equivalent to the control in all conditions, except for the substrate produced exclusively with fine coal waste and sewage sludge, which presented a better performance. Technosols are an alternative for reducing the final mine waste volume, and Eragrostis tef used as a means for land use after the mining process, with social gains, and as a tool in an ecological process for restoring coal mining sites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddb2a1afc2e92eadda1dcf21191657a18b188842dbd90f2a531c871301a3c948","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
