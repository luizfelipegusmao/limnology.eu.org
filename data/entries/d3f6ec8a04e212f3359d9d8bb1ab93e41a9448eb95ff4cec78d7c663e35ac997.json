{"title":"Revealing the Impact of Understory Fires on Stem Survival in Five Palm Species (Arecaceae): An Experimental Approach Using Predictive Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0087/v1","date":1719832229000,"content":"Amid increasing deforestation, surface fires reaching the forest understory are one of the primary threats to Amazonian ecosystems. Despite extensive research on post-fire mortality in woody species, literature on palm resilience to fire is scant. This study investigates post-fire mortality in four understory palms—Bactris maraja Mart., Chamaedorea pauciflora Mart., Geonoma deversa (Poit.) Kunth, Hyospathe elegans Mart., and juvenile individuals of Euterpe precatoria Mart. Objectives included: a) comparing post-fire responses; b) developing mortality models based on severity variables; and c) evaluating if diameter protects bud stems from heat flux. Conducted at the edge of an Ombrophylous Forest in Alto Juruá Acre, Brazil (7°45'S, 72°22'W), the experiment subjected 85 individuals to controlled burning in a 1 m² area near the stipe, with temperature sampling using K thermocouples. Results showed varying mortality rates among species, with larger stipe diameter correlating to reduced mortality. Canopy burning patterns significantly influenced mortality, especially for Euterpe precatoria. Species exhibited diverse regrowth capacities, with B. maraja showing the highest number and tallest basal resprouts. This study underscores post-fire plant mortality as a critical indicator of fire severity, essential for understanding its ecological impacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3f6ec8a04e212f3359d9d8bb1ab93e41a9448eb95ff4cec78d7c663e35ac997","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
