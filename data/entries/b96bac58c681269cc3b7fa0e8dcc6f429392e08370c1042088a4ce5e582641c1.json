{"title":"Prevalence of Anxiety in COPD Patients. Usefulness of the HADS Test for Establishing the Diagnostic Suspicion of Anxiety Through the Collaboration Between Primary Care, Pulmonology, and Psychiatry Services","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0732/v1","date":1718166409000,"content":"Anxiety disorders, characterized by excessive fear and anxiety, are increasingly recognized as significant comorbidities in chronic diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\nThis study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety in COPD patients referred from primary care centers to pulmonology services and identify predictive factors for anxiety. Conducted as a multicentric, observational, and prospective study, 293 COPD patients were recruited, undergoing comprehensive respiratory and smoking histories, spirometry, and anxiety assessments using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\nThese results show: a diagnosis of suspected anxiety in in 85 patients (29.0%): 17 possible and 68 with a strong suspicion. The study found significant associations between anxiety and factors such as gender (women showed a risk 3.5 times higher than men), weight, and body mass index (BMI). Disease severity, smoking status, and clinical manifestations did not significantly influence anxiety prevalence. The findings underscore the need for systematic psychological evaluations in COPD management, advocating for the use of simple diagnostic tools like the HADS to facilitate referrals to mental health services. Addressing anxiety in COPD patients could potentially improve their quality of life and disease outcomes.\nThe study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving family medicine, pulmonology, and psychiatry to optimize COPD patient care and suggests future research should focus on the impact of anxiety treatment on COPD progression. These insights call for integrating psychological assessments into routine clinical practice for comprehensive COPD management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b96bac58c681269cc3b7fa0e8dcc6f429392e08370c1042088a4ce5e582641c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
