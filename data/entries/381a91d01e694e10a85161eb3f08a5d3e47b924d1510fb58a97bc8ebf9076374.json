We determined the effects of consuming tart cherry juice versus a high-glycemic index sports drink on cycling performance, substrate oxidation, and recovery of low-frequency fatigue. Using a randomized, counter-balanced cross-over design, with one-month washout, 12 recreational cyclists (8 males and 4 females; 35±16y; VO<sub>2peak</sub> 38.2±7.4 ml/kg/min) consumed cherry juice or sports drink twice a day (300mL/d) for 4d before and 2d after exercise. On the exercise day, beverages (providing 1g/kg carbohydrate) were consumed 45min before 90min of cycling at 65%VO<sub>2peak</sub>, followed by a 10km time trial. Blood glucose, lactate, carbohydrate and fat oxidation, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), O<sub>2</sub> cost of cycling, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during the initial 90min of cycling. Muscle soreness, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and low-frequency fatigue were determined at baseline and after the time trial on the exercise day, and 30min after beverage consumption 24 and 48h later. There were no differences for time trial performance (17±3min cherry juice vs. 17±2min sports drink, <i>p</i> = 0.27) or any other measures between drink conditions. There were time main effects (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) for isometric MVC (decreasing) and low-frequency fatigue (increasing; i.e. decreased force at low relative to high stimulation frequencies), changing significantly from baseline to post-exercise and then returning to baseline at 24h post-exercise. Tart cherry juice was not effective for improving performance, substrate oxidation during exercise, and recovery from exercise, compared to a high-glycemic index sports drink.","author":"Ruirui Gao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"381a91d01e694e10a85161eb3f08a5d3e47b924d1510fb58a97bc8ebf9076374","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
