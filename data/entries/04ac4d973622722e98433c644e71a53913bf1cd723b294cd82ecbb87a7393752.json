Only 20% of PDAC patients are suitable for surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy which remains the only curative treatment.  Chemotherapeutic and genetherapy treatments are associated with adverse effects and lack specificity/efficacy.  In this study we assess the oncolytic potential of immuno-oncolytic tanapoxvirus (TPV) recombinants expressing mouse monocyte chemoattractant protein (mMCP-1 or mCCL2), and mouse interleukin (mIL)-2, in human pancreatic BxPc-3 cells, using immunocompromised and CD-3+ T-cell reconstituted mice.  Intratumoral treatment with TPV/∆66R/mCCL2 and TPV/∆66R/mIL-2 resulted in regression of BxPc-3 xenograft volume as compared to control in immunocompromised mice; mCCL-2 expressing TPV OV resulted in significant difference from control at p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04ac4d973622722e98433c644e71a53913bf1cd723b294cd82ecbb87a7393752","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
