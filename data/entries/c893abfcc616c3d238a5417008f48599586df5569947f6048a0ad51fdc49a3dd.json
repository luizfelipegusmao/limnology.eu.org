{"title":"Time-Optimal Motions of Mechanical System with Viscous Friction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1144/v1","date":1713416954000,"content":"Optimal control has emerged as an indispensable tool in the domain of mechanical robotic systems. The dynamic processes under consideration in this paper are characterized by differential equations with an unknown coefficient. The problem addressed is time-optimal and exhibits bilinear characteristics. To investigate this inverse optimal problem, the classical method has been employed alongside Pontryaginâ€™s Maximum Principle (PMP). This article aims to provide an exact piecewise function for controlling trajectories, specifically accounting for viscous friction. The goal is to determine the reachability set and to find the minimal process time. Notably, no simplifying assumptions were made during the analytical transformations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c893abfcc616c3d238a5417008f48599586df5569947f6048a0ad51fdc49a3dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
