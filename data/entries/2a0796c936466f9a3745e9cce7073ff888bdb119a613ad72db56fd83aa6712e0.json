{"title":"Outbreak of Esophagitis and Ingluvitis Caused by Salmonella Typhimurium in Passeriform Birds of the Genus Sporophila Seized from Wildlife Trafficking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1788/v1","date":1727097098000,"content":"An outbreak of esophagitis and ingluvitis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium in passerines seized from illegal wildlife trafficking is described. This illegal activity causes stress and leads to lowered immunity in the birds. Additionally, inadequate hygiene conditions predispose the birds to diseases such as salmonellosis. Few studies report the occurrence of Salmonella-induced lesions in the esophagus and crop of wild birds; thus, this study aimed to describe the disease in these species, investigate its presence in the environment, and determine the antimicrobial resistance profile. Three birds of the genus Sporophila were necropsied. In the esophagus and crop, yellowish plaques corresponding to necrosis with bacterial aggregates were observed. Salmonella spp. was isolated from these lesions, with genus confirmation via MALDI-TOF. Environmental samples were collected from the enclosures and cages where the animals were quarantined, and the same bacterium was isolated. In two birds, the serotype S. Typhimurium was identified. Antibiograms performed on the strains from the birds and the environment revealed resistance to antibiotics in the classes of Penicillins, Sulfonamides, Aminoglycosides, Monobactams, Tetracyclines, and first and third-generation Cephalosporins. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of this agent causing death in Sporophila due to esophagitis and ingluvitis. It is also the first report of salmonellosis in three species of passerines in Brazil. The study underscores the importance of understanding the pathogens circulating in wild animals, especially within the context of One Health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a0796c936466f9a3745e9cce7073ff888bdb119a613ad72db56fd83aa6712e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
