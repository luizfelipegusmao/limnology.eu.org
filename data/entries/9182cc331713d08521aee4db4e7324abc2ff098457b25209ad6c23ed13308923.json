{"title":"A Comparative Analysis for Optimizing Machine Learning Model Deployment in IoT Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2141/v1","date":1717148651000,"content":"In the intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML), the choice between high-level and low-level programming libraries presents a significant dilemma for developers, impacting not only the efficiency and effectiveness of ML models but also their environmental footprint. We have proposed a comprehensive framework to aid in this decision-making process, underpinned by a detailed comparative analysis of both types of libraries on one of the key IoT ML task; image classification. We have introduced a novel algorithm designed to calculate the green footprint of ML model training, factoring in execution time, memory utilization, power consumption, and CPU temperature, addressing the urgent need for sustainable ML practices. Through an empirical evaluation of popular libraries such as PyTorch for high-level and Libtorch for low-level development, we have assessed their performance, development efficiency, and hardware compatibility. The culmination of our research is a decision support system that synthesizes the experimental findings to guide developers toward choices that harmonize model performance with environmental sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9182cc331713d08521aee4db4e7324abc2ff098457b25209ad6c23ed13308923","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
