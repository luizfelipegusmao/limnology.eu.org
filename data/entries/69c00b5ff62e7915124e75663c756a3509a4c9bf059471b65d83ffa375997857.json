{"title":"Molecular analyses of the Kalotermes dispar-complex (Blattodea: Kalotermitidae) from the Canary Islands reveal cryptic intraspecific divergence and a connection to a lone Nearctic congener","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae072/7710977?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Canary Islands is a Macaronesian volcanic archipelago with a depauperate community of three species of Kalotermitidae, including <span>Kalotermes dispar</span>. A total of 54 <span>Kalotermes</span> colonies were collected from Gran Canaria, Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro islands. Soldiers and imagos were morphologically examined and sequenced for four mitochondrial markers. Although morphological differences could not be detected, phylogenetic analysis of both <span>cox1</span>/<span>tRNA</span>/<span>cox2</span> and <span>rrnL</span> markers revealed two distinct clades of <span>K. dispar</span>, suggesting cryptic diversity. The diversification within the Canary <span>Kalotermes</span> lineage most likely occurred around 7.5 Mya, while the divergence within the two clades was reconstructed at about 3.6 Mya and 1.9 Mya. <span>Kalotermes approximatus</span> from the southeastern Nearctic constitutes a sister to the Canary <span>Kalotermes</span>, while the Palearctic <span>K. flavicollis</span>, <span>K. italicus</span>, and <span>K. phoenicae</span> form a separate clade. It is hypothesized that a faunal exchange of <span>Kalotermes</span> from the Nearctic to the Canary Islands occurred via transoceanic rafting during the mid-Miocene.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"69c00b5ff62e7915124e75663c756a3509a4c9bf059471b65d83ffa375997857","category":"Environment"}
