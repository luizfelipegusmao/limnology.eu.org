{"title":"Exploring pharmacists’ attitude, willingness and barriers to provide extended community pharmacy services: Implications for improved pharmacy services","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310141","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Anan S. Jarab, Walid Al-Qerem, Karem H. Alzoubi, Nadeen Almomani, Shrouq Abu Heshmeh, Tareq Mukattash, Yazid N. Alhamarneh</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aimed to evaluate pharmacists’ attitude and willingness to provide extended community pharmacy services (ECPS), the barriers to ECPS, and the factors associated with attitude and willingness to implement ECPS.</p> Methods <p>In this cross-sectional study, a validated, self-administered questionnaire was distributed online to community pharmacists across the United Arab Emirates between September and November 2023. In addition to sociodemographic data, the questionnaire evaluated attitudes toward ECPS, willingness to provide ECPS, and barriers to its implementation. Binary logistic regression was conducted to explore the factors associated with attitude and willingness to implement ECPS.</p> Results <p>The study included 409 pharmacists. Over half of the participants reported below the median attitude (58.7%) and willingness (59.4%) scores. Female pharmacists had a lower attitude towards ECPS (OR = 0.425, 95%CI: 0.242–0.747). Higher number of daily prescriptions (OR = 1.066, 95%CI: 1.029–1.105) and being a Pharm D graduate (OR = 2.664, 95%CI: 1.439–4.932) were associated with higher willingness to provide ECPS, while an increased number of employed pharmacists (OR = 0.518, 95%CI: 0.397–0.676) was associated with a lower willingness (OR = 0.049, 95%CI: 0.004–0.660). Patients’ preoccupation (76.5%), lack of specific training (76.3%), lack of clinical problem-solving skills (74.6%) and lack of a private consultation room (74.6%) were the most commonly reported barriers to ECPS.</p> Conclusions <p>Community pharmacists demonstrated unsatisfactory levels of attitude and willingness towards ECPS provision. Therefore, providing training and education programs that enhance pharmacists’ perception and willingness to implement ECPS and emphasize improving clinical problem-solving skills, as well as setting up specific private consultation rooms, is deemed necessary. Female pharmacy graduates, pharmacists dispensing fewer daily prescriptions, and those working with a higher number of employed pharmacists should be specifically targeted when implementing these strategies.</p>","author":"Anan S.
