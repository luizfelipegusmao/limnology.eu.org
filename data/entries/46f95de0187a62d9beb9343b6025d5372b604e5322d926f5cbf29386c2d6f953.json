{"title":"Statistical Optimization Strategies for the Extraction Process Parameters of Bioactive Molecules from Seafood Byproducts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1573/v1","date":1711448610000,"content":"Extraction techniques of important bioactive molecules from the major concern of Seafood byproducts are getting emphasis for better valorization. Employing green extraction technologies for efficient and quality production of these bioactive molecules is also strictly required. Hence, understanding the extraction process parameters to effectively design an applicable optimization strategy could make this real. In this review, statistical optimization strategies applied for the extraction process parameters of bioactive molecules from Seafood byproducts are focused. The type of experimental designs, and techniques applied to criticize and validate the effects of independent variables on the extraction output was addressed. Dominant parameters studied were enzyme/substrate ratio, pH, time, temperature and power of extraction instruments. The yield of bioactive compounds, chitin and chitosan, proteins and peptides, enzymes and carotenoids (Astaxanthins) were the most studied responses. Efficiency and/or economic and quality considerations and their selected optimization strategies that favour the production of potential bioactive molecules were also reviewed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46f95de0187a62d9beb9343b6025d5372b604e5322d926f5cbf29386c2d6f953","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
