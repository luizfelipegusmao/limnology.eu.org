{"title":"The Level and Limitations of Physical Activity in Elderly Patients with Diabetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0943/v1","date":1726132499000,"content":"Background: Old age and illnesses can limit physical activity (PA). Objectives: To assess the level of PA and its limitations. Design: Cross-sectional study, January and June 2024. Setting: Diabetes Center. Subjects: Patients (N=207) &gt;64 years with diabetes (DM). Methods: Surveying using: IPAQ, Accompanying Survey (AS). The significance was assessed by: Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson’s test. The relationships between the IPAQ and the AS results were analyzed based on a meta-analysis model for variable effects, OR with a 95% CI. ROC curve was used to determine the threshold values for age, BMI. Correlations between selected key variables were evaluated using the PCA. Results: The median age: 72 years (65–87), BMI: 28.70 kg/m2 (18.61–49.69). The median PA level: 1,837 MET-min/week (0–9,891). The individuals who obtained insufficient (n=28), sufficient (n=75), and high levels of PA (n=53) were 17.95%, 48.08%, and 33.97%, respectively. Diseases were the main factor limiting PA (53,54%) in patient’s opinion, followed by the lack of a companion or motivation. The meta-analysis found no diseases linked to insufficient PA, but those with BMI &gt; 33.3 kg/m² and over 75 years old more often had insufficient PA. PCA revealed several characteristics that predispose individuals to insufficient PA. Conclusions: People over 75 years of age tend to avoid PA more than younger seniors, leading to its insufficient level, similarly like higher BMI. The individual with DM who has an insufficient level of PA is typically a single, woman, over 75, BMI&gt;33.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba8b466f969003862604a50dbc68b9b1be04494c6f496b65de53ba66ad9fec80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
