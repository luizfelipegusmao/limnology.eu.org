{"title":"Genetic and environmental effects on processing productivity and food product yield: drudgery of women's work","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13079?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Cassava processing is a crucial source of livelihood for rural farmers and processors in Nigeria and Cameroon. This study investigated the varietal effect on the processing productivity of women farmer processors within their working environment and compared this with the food product quality as evaluated by the processors and the field yield. Field trials were established in Nigeria (Benue and Osun state) and Cameroon (Littoral region). Eight cassava genotypes were evaluated. These eight varieties included newly bred genotypes, commercial checks and varieties provided and preferred by the processors. The roots of these genotypes were harvested and processed into <i>gari</i> and <i>eba</i> by processors. The time of each processing step was recorded. Processors assessed the quality of the roots and food products using pairwise ranking.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the field trials in Cameroon and Nigeria (Benue state), the newly bred genotypes showed superior performance in terms of dry matter content and fresh and dry yield. During processing, genotypes showed significant variation for most assessed parameters in both countries. Some newly bred varieties exhibited lower productivity that can make them more prone to drudgery than the local commercial checks and the varieties provided and preferred by the processors. Newly bred varieties were mostly ranked higher or equal to processors' preferred varieties concerning fresh root and food product quality. In the Cameroon location there were significant varietal differences in processing productivity and drudgery index which suggest that the particular processing methods there - such as pressing methods and fermentation time - cause these varietal differences to matter more.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The varieties that were tested were observed to differ in yield, product quality, processing productivity, and potential drudgery levels. Some breeders' germplasms displayed a combination of increased yields and good product quality and good processor productivity. Those varieties that showed low processor productivity should be avoided during selection to avoid increased labour burden and associated drudgery of women processors. Further research is recommended to enhance food product color, latent culinary qualities, and processing productivity of newly bred varieties to improve acceptability and reduce processing drudgery for women. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Abolore Bello, \nAfolabi Agbona, \nOlamide Olaosebikan, \nGospel Edughaen, \nDominique Dufour, \nAlexandre Bouniol, \nPeter Iluebbey, \nRobert Ndjouenkeu, \nIsmail Rabbi, \nBéla Teeken","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a4886acda7b5930cf452e2ccf3efc50cbc290608b16ab409240b05513e5e7d57","category":"Environment"}
