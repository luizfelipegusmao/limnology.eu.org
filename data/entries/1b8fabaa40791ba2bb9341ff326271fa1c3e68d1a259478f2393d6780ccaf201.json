{"title":"Evaluation of the Fischer‐Tropsch synthesis product selectivity over iron‐based silica‐supported catalyst under mild temperatures","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14335?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The circular economy is considered a keystone of sustainable development, and its implementation requires analyzing both product and by-products, as well as process waste. In this study Fischer-Tropsch synthesis product selectivity over Fe/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst was investigated in the reaction temperature range of 240 to 300°C. The composition of the gas, liquid hydrocarbon, and wax products is discussed alongside the aqueous phase, which is rarely addressed. It was found that 280°C is the optimal temperature for condensable hydrocarbon production over Fe/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. The increase in reaction temperature led to a decrease in the selectivity of 1-olefins and alcohols in the liquid hydrocarbon phase and waxes, but at the same time contributed to an increase in the content of alcohols in the aqueous phase products.</p>","author":"Agija Stanke, \nKristine Lazdovica, \nLauma Laipniece","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"1b8fabaa40791ba2bb9341ff326271fa1c3e68d1a259478f2393d6780ccaf201","category":"Environment"}
