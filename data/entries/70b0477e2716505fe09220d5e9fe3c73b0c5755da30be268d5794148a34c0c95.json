Through thematic analysis of interviews with e-commerce platform managers, supplier representatives, and industry experts, the study identifies three primary types of relationships: transactional, relational, and strategic. Critical factors influencing these relationships include trust, effective communication, technological integration, and regulatory compliance. Challenges such as information asymmetry, cultural differences, logistical complexities, and competitive pressures are examined, alongside strategies for enhancing collaboration, including clear communication protocols, performance evaluations, and technological advancements. The findings highlight the significant impact of collaborative supplier relationships on business performance, including cost efficiencies, supply chain resilience, innovation capacity, customer satisfaction, and market competitiveness. Looking forward, trends in digital transformation, sustainability initiatives, global supply chain networks, resilience-building strategies, and industry collaboration are discussed as shaping the future landscape of e-commerce partnerships. Embracing these trends presents opportunities for organizations to innovate, adapt, and sustain growth in the competitive digital marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70b0477e2716505fe09220d5e9fe3c73b0c5755da30be268d5794148a34c0c95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
