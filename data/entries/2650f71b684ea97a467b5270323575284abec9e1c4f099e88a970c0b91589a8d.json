{"title":"Congenital Sepsis with Candida albicans - a Rare Event in the Neonatal Period. Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1482/v1","date":1721306128000,"content":"Candida spp. is rarely found in the etiology of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS). However, candidemia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, as in late-onset sepsis. Congenital candidiasis may present as mucocutaneous infection or, more rarely, as a systemic infection in term and preterm infants. Material and methods: Case reports of two cases of congenital systemic candidiasis (CSC) produced by Candida albicans and a review of the data in the literature. Results: Both neonates were male, born vaginally, with risk factors for congenital candidiasis. One of the infants was born at term and presented with an almost generalized maculopapular rash at birth; C. albicans grew in the blood culture sampled at 36 hours; parenteral fluconazole was started immediately, and no complications were noted. The other infant was born preterm, at 28 weeks of gestation, and presented signs of respiratory distress on the 4th day of life after initial successful treatment of the respiratory distress syndrome with surfactant and non-invasive respiratory support. C. albicans was present in the neonatal blood and gastric aspirate cultures, and in the maternal vaginal cultures (all sampled at birth); parenteral fluconazole therapy was administered for 30 days as investigations revealed both liver and renal involvement and the infant development bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Conclusion: As data in the literature suggests, despite occurring at any gestational age, CSC may present various clinical pictures, the rash may mimic many other neonatal conditions, and the systemic dissemination cannot be distinguished from bacterial EOS. Careful anamnesis and a high index of suspicion are important for the prompt recognition and treatment of CSC, optimizing the short- and long-term outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2650f71b684ea97a467b5270323575284abec9e1c4f099e88a970c0b91589a8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
