{"title":"304 Amino acid digestibility and protein quality of fermented soybean-based ingredients using the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/120/7757402?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fermented soybean-based ingredients may serve as an alternative protein source for pet foods because of their high-quality protein content. The amino acid (AA) content and protein quality of fermented soybean-based ingredients may vary depending on their composition and processing, however, so testing is required. Our objective was to measure the AA composition, AA digestibility, and protein quality of fermented soybean-based ingredients using the precision fed cecectomized rooster assay. The University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal procedures prior to experimentation. Cecectomized roosters (n = 36; six roosters per substrate) were randomly allotted to one of five test substrates: 1) autoclaved soybean (ASB); 2) fermented soybeans (FSB); 3) fermented soybeans with probiotics (FSBP); 4) fermented soybean meal (FSBM); 5) fermented soybean meal with probiotics (FSBMP). After 26 h of feed withdrawal, roosters were tube-fed test substrates. Following crop intubation excreta samples were collected 48 h. Endogenous loss corrections for AA were made by using five additional cecectomized roosters. All data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4. All substrates had increased AA digestibilities, with all indispensable AA digestibilities being &gt;80% except for lysine (78.1% to 86.9%). Tryptophan digestibility was less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in FSB than other substrates, but other AA digestibilities were not different. Digestible indispensable AA score (DIAAS)-like values were calculated to determine protein quality according to nutritional guidelines for adult dogs, adult cats, growing puppies, and growing kittens. The most limiting AA was the same for all ingredients. In adult dogs, methionine was the most limiting AA based on National Research Council (NRC; DIAAS: 33.4-35.1), European Pet Food Industry Nutritional Guidelines (FEDIAF; DIAAS: 49.6-52.1), and Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO; DIAAS: 60.2-63.2) guidelines. In adult cats, phenylalanine was the most limiting AA (DIAAS: 59.5-63.2) when using NRC guidelines, but DIAAS were above 100 for FEDIAF and AAFCO guidelines. In growing puppies, methionine was most limiting according to NRC (DIAAS: 56.7-59.6) and FEDIAF (DIAAS: 78.8-82.7) guidelines, but threonine was most limiting according to AAFCO (DIAAS: 68.8-72.3) guidelines. In growing kittens, methionine was most limiting according to NRC (DIAAS: 70.9-74.4) and AAFCO (53.4-56.0) guidelines, but phenylalanine was most limiting according to FEDIAF (DIAAS: 66.7-70.8) guidelines. Our results demonstrate that fermented soybean-based ingredients are high-quality protein sources. Even though they have one or more limiting AA, they would serve as strong complementary proteins for pet foods. Further research in dogs and cats is necessary to confirm sufficient palatability and digestibility, but these data suggest that they are valuable sources of protein for pet food.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d7a67f730642c64209d4c56eb25bd8d69a776075c82a7e592ac6a3bfd60259b8","category":"Environment"}
