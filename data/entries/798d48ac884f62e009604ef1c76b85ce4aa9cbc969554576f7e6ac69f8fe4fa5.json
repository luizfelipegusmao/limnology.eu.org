{"title":"Navigating the Future of PHA Composites: A Review of Challenges and Opportunities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1308/v1","date":1716216596000,"content":"The article offers a comprehensive overview of recent breakthroughs in eco-friendly polymers and polymer composites, underscoring their pivotal role in addressing sustainability challenges across diverse industrial sectors. Despite encountering obstacles related to performance and processability, biopolymers sourced from renewable materials emerge as promising alternatives for the plastics that are currently used by human beings. Natural fillers are highlighted as a strategic avenue for crafting sustainable composites, with residual natural fillers being particularly explored. Heightened environmental concerns propel discussions on the criticality of integrating biodegradable materials with natural fillers, underlining the urgency for clear frameworks and financial incentives to support adoption of these materials. Additionally, the article examines the potential of biodegradable polymers and polymer composites, with a specific emphasis on the utilization of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) in composite materials and its market prospects. Moreover, it emphasizes the indispensable need for ongoing research and development endeavors to address environmental challenges within the polymer sector, reflecting a mounting interest in sustainable materials across industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"798d48ac884f62e009604ef1c76b85ce4aa9cbc969554576f7e6ac69f8fe4fa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
