{"title":"Effect of Al or Cu Content on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Zn alloys Fabricated Using Continuous Casting and Extrusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0105/v1","date":1719838948000,"content":"The effect of Al or Cu content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of continuous casting and extrusion Zn alloys has been studied by room temperature tensile test, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. With the increase of Al content, the microstructure of continuous casting and extrusion Zn alloys slightly coarsens and the lamellar eutectic structure increases. The changes in the above structural factors result in a slight decrease in strength and a significant increase in elongation of Zn-Al alloys. The strength of Zn alloys increases as the Cu content increases, due to the increased content and size of the second phase in the Zn alloys. This means that the mechanical properties of Zn alloys can be adjusted by continuous casting and extrusion process, and the improvement of equipment capacity can improve the structure and morphology of the alloys.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f56feeb5f181a204e174aae23bf042166c00ce62e663e0054a8f262ebd6dd8b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
