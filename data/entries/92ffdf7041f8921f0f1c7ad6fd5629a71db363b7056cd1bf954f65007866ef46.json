{"title":"Targeting the Hippo-YAP/TAZ Signaling Pathway in Primary Liver Cancer Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1713/v1","date":1721711412000,"content":"Liver cancer imposes a pervasive global health challenge, ranking among the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Its prevalence and mortality rates are on a concerning upward trajectory and exacerbated by the dearth efficacious treatment options. The Hippo signaling pathway, originally discovered in Drosophila, comprises four core components: MST1/2, WW45, MOB1A/B, and LATS1/2. This pathway regulates the cellular localization of the transcriptional coactivator YAP/TAZ (Yes-associated protein/PDZ-binding motif) through a series of enzymatic reactions. The Hippo/YAP/TAZZ pathway maintains a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, regu-lates tissue and organ sizes, and stabilizes the internal environment. Abnormalities of any genes within the Hippo signaling pathway, such as deletion or mutation, disturb the delicate balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, creating a favorable condition for tumor initiation and progression. Mutations or epigenetic alterations in the Hippo signaling pathway components can lead to its inactivation. Consequently, YAP/TAZ becomes overexpressed and activated, promoting excessive cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This dysregulation is closely associated with the development of liver cancer. This review discusses the pivotal role of the Hippo signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and progression of liver cancer. By elucidating its mechanisms, we aim to offer new insights into potential therapeutic targets for effectively combating liver cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92ffdf7041f8921f0f1c7ad6fd5629a71db363b7056cd1bf954f65007866ef46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
