{"title":"Post Graduate Urology Training in LMIC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1334/v1","date":1721142296000,"content":"Introduction: Urological conditions significantly impact global health, with increasing demand for urologists in both developed and developing countries. Disparities in access to surgical care between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are evident. Despite advancements in urology, LMIC training programs often follow outdated curricula and traditional methods.\nMethodology: A comprehensive search strategy identified urology training programs in LMICs using the EduRank website, Google searches, and PubMed. Data were collected from literature, official documents, and online resources, focusing on variables such as program duration, research requirements, and resident salaries.\nResults: The analysis revealed significant variability in program structures and requirements across LMICs. Residency training durations ranged from 4 to 6 years, with inconsistent research obligations and resident salaries averaging $12,857 annually, with a range from 5,412 to 18,174$. Fellowship opportunities were limited, with only a small number of programs achieving international accreditation.\nConclusion: The study highlights substantial disparities in urology training between HICs and LMICs. There is an urgent need for standardized and locally tailored training frameworks to enhance the quality of urology education in LMICs. Future research should focus on developing strategies to improve training opportunities, ensuring equitable access to advanced urological care and education globally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f853c7d7cdbd7c6654fd1563efccba799640842a4ba4f3d672706befbb0fc580","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
