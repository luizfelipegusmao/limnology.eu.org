{"title":"Sustainable Decarbonization of Road Transport: Policies, Current Status, and Challenges of Electric Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1098/v1","date":1723705065000,"content":"Land transportation is contributing to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly. Switching from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is the most practical way to decarbonize land transportation. Some regions of the world have seen significant advancements in the adoption of electric vehicles, largely due to government policies through subsidies and other rules and laws that globally made the cost of acquisition and ownership more advantageous for EV owners compared to their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts. The success of EV adoption in Norway, China, the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), and India has been linked to the favorable government policies. At present, China is the largest EV market in the world, enjoying a better advantage than any other market. It also has the highest manufacturing capacity and the largest number of EVs in operation. Norway has the highest EV penetration rate, with over 90% of newly registered cars, and one of the lowest costs of ownership globally. In this review, we present the current state of EV technology and performance, together with consumer perspectives and barriers, EV regulations in the regions with the highest penetration rates, and the decarbonization of land transportation. China is competing with the USA for leadership in manufacturing and technology, especially in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and batteries. \nIn order to achieve the goal of decarbonizing road transportation, we proposed that a number of factors, including government energy policies and regulatory standard development, necessary infrastructure investments and developments, AI incorporation in EVs, innovation in EV and battery technologies, and consumer perspectives, play a crucial role.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e9245fe7e5281c379fc273c04d5ec7bae1825427ba6376ecc2c5a362543d777","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
