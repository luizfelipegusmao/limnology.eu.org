{"title":"Policy and Crisis Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0438/v1","date":1717752500000,"content":"The aim of this article is to present the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland in 2020-2022, the formation of ad hoc health and anti-crisis policies, an assessment of crisis management and the perceived impact of the pandemic and anti-crisis measures.The paper draws on literature, official reports on the pandemic, data from Eurostat and other information from state institutions and public organisations.Particular attention was paid to the analysis and evaluation of the objectives, instruments and effects of the policies pursued by the state in a coordinated manner, i.e. the anti-pandemic policy and the anti-crisis policy. The anti-pandemic policy in Poland has failed to protect the country from significant personal losses and negative impacts on the health of the population and demographic processes.The anti-crisis policy of the state carried out with the mobilisation of businesses and disciplined society, in the form of anti-crisis shields supplemented and adjusted on an ongoing basis, allowed Poland to avoid a deep crisis and economic recession. Attention was drawn to the need to coordinate the management of health and economic crises nationally and internationally, and to the need to have a medium-term anti-crisis state strategy and a system for the early detection of crisis symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5f295b5c70f5c381889adb30ce9dbbc680521d1eb46b7df8e780a4c211019c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
