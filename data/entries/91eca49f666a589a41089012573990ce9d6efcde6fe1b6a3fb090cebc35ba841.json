In 2021, diseased cobias (<i>Rachycentron canadum</i>, <i>n</i> = 10) and dusky groupers (<i>Epinephelus marginatus</i>, <i>n</i> = 10) were sampled and subjected to bacteriological and pathological examinations. The isolates obtained were morphologically and biochemically characterized and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) and <i>16S rRNA</i> gene sequencing. The genetic diversity of these isolates was analysed using repetitive extragenic palindromic-polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using the disk diffusion technique. Macroscopically, the fish presented skin ulcerations, ocular lesions, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. A pleomorphic, gram-negative, catalase- and oxidase-positive bacterium was isolated from seven cobias and two groupers. The <i>16S rRNA</i> gene sequences showed &gt;99% coverage and identity with other deposited sequences of <i>F. salimarina</i>. The results of the biochemical analysis corresponded to these bacterial species. Histologically, granulomas were observed in the spleen, liver and heart of the cobias (<i>n</i> = 6), and necrotizing and fibrinous dermatitis and myositis were identified in some groupers (<i>n</i> = 2). The isolates exhibited the same banding pattern when REP-PCR was performed, indicating that they were clonally related. Finally, the antibiogram test, no inhibition halo was observed for amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>F. salimarina</i> infection in cobias and dusky groupers.</p>","author":"Victória Pontes Rocha, \nDanise Gauer, \nHenrique Lopes Costa, \nFrancisco Yan Tavares Reis, \nSóstenes Apolo Correia Marcelino, \nLuiz Fagner Ferreira Nogueira, \nFelipe Pierezan, \nHenrique César Pereira Figueiredo, \nGuilherme Campos Tavares","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"91eca49f666a589a41089012573990ce9d6efcde6fe1b6a3fb090cebc35ba841","category":"Environment"}
