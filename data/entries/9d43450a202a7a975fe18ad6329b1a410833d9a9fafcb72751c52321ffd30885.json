{"title":"The inhibition of MARCO by PolyG alleviates pulmonary fibrosis via regulating mitochondrial function in a silicotic rat model","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24241?af=R","date":1718077862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>)-induced pulmonary fibrosis is potentially associated with the impairment of mitochondrial function. Previous research found that inhibition of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) could alleviate particle-induced lung injury by regulating phagocytosis and mitigating mitochondrial damage. The present study aims to explore the underlying anti-fibrosis mechanism of polyguanylic acid (PolyG, MARCO inhibitor) in a silicotic rat model. Hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining were performed to visualize lung tissue pathological changes. Confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscope, western blot analysis, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content assay were performed to evaluate collagen content, mitochondrial function, and morphology changes in SiO<sub>2</sub>-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. The results suggested that SiO<sub>2</sub> exposure contributed to reactive oxygen species aggregation and the reduction of respiratory complexes and ATP synthesis. PolyG treatment could effectively reduce MARCO expression and ameliorate lung injury and fibrosis by rectifying the imbalance of mitochondrial respiration and energy synthesis. Furthermore, PolyG could maintain mitochondrial homeostasis by promoting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator 1 α (PGC1α)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and regulating fusion and fission. Together, PolyG could ameliorate SiO<sub>2</sub>-induced pulmonary fibrosis via inhibiting MARCO to protect mitochondrial function.</p>","author":"Meiyu Chang, \nNing Li, \nQiang Zhou, \nYaomin Yan, \nWeiwei Xu, \nYingzheng Zhao, \nSanqiao Yao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"9d43450a202a7a975fe18ad6329b1a410833d9a9fafcb72751c52321ffd30885","category":"Environment"}
