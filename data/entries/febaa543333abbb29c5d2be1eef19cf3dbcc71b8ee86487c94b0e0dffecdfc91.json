However, it has received little attention. This study used a combination of preselection and statistic methods consisting of the oxidation capacity and the boxplot iteration methods to evaluate the NBL of shallow groundwater Al in four groundwater units of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) via eliminating anthropogenic-impacted groundwaters and to discuss driving factors controlling high NBLs of Al in groundwater in this area. A total of 280 water samples were collected, and 18 physico-chemical parameters including Redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolved solids, HCO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>, F<sup>−</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Fe, Mn, and Al were analyzed. Results showed that groundwater Al NBLs in groundwater units A-D were 0.11, 0.16, 0.15, and 0.08 mg/L, respectively. The used method in this study is acceptable for the assessment of groundwater Al NBLs in the PRD, because groundwater Al concentrations in various groundwater units in residual datasets were independent of land-use types, but they were opposite in the original datasets. The dissolution of Al-rich minerals in sediments/rocks was the major source for groundwater Al NBLs in the PRD, and the interaction with Al-rich river water was secondary one. The high groundwater Al NBL in groundwater unit B was mainly attributed to the acid precipitation and the organic matter mineralization inducing the release of Al in Quaternary sediments. By contrast, the high groundwater Al NBL in groundwater unit C mainly was ascribed to the release of Al complexes such as fluoroaluminate from rocks/soils into groundwater induced by acid precipitation, but it was limited by the dissolution of Mg minerals (e.g., dolomite) in aquifers. This study provides not only useful groundwater Al NBLs for the evaluation of groundwater Al contamination but also a reference for understanding the natural geochemical factors controlling groundwater Al in urbanized deltas such as the PRD.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe natural background level (NBL) of groundwater aluminum in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) was evaluated.\nThe dissolution of aluminum-rich minerals in sediments/rocks was the major source for groundwater aluminum NBLs in the PRD.\nThe acid precipitation and organic matter mineralization contribute to high groundwater Al NBL in the groundwater unit B.\nThe acid precipitation contributes to high groundwater Al NBL in the groundwater unit C, while dissolution of magnesium minerals limits it.\n</p>","author":"Gangli Yan, \nLiguo Yang, \nQinxuan Hou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"febaa543333abbb29c5d2be1eef19cf3dbcc71b8ee86487c94b0e0dffecdfc91","category":"Environment"}
