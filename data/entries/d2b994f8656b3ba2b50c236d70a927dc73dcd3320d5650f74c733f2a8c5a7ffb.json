{"title":"Random Walk on T-Fractal with Stochastic Resetting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1771/v1","date":1729732444000,"content":"In this study, we explore the impact of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of random walks on a T-fractal network. By employing the generating function technique, we establish a recursive relation between the generating function of the first passage time (FPT) and derive a relationship between the mean first passage time (MFPT) with resetting and the generating function of the FPT without resetting. Our analysis covers various scenarios for a random walker reaching a target site from the starting position, and for each case, we determine the optimal resetting probability Î³* that minimizes the MFPT. We compare the results with the MFPT without resetting and find that the inclusion of resetting significantly enhances search efficiency, particularly as the size of the network increases. Our findings highlight the potential of stochastic resetting as an effective strategy for optimizing search processes in complex networks, offering valuable insights for applications in various fields where efficient search strategies are crucial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2b994f8656b3ba2b50c236d70a927dc73dcd3320d5650f74c733f2a8c5a7ffb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
