{"title":"Alena Tensor and Its Possible Applications in Unification Theories","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1872/v5","date":1712841911000,"content":"Alena Tensor is a recently discovered class of energy-momentum tensors that provides a mathematical framework in which the description of a physical system in curved spacetime and its description in a flat spacetime with fields are equivalent. As demonstrated in previous publications, in curved spacetime this tensor reproduces Einstein Field Equations and in flat Minkowski spacetime, it describes physical system with fields that can be widely configured. Thanks to the obtained compliance with QM and QED, the use of the discussed tensor may significantly simplify Quantum Field Theory equations and a new interpretation of the Schrödinger equation is possible. In the article it has also been shown that the use of Alena Tensor for the electromagnetic field takes into account effects related to the particle's spin, Abraham–Lorentz effect and, in the curvilinear description, this excludes non-physical phenomena such as the black hole singularity. The article contains a method for verifying Alena Tensor within QM, proposing an explanation for the discrepancy between the Dirac and Klein-Gordon solutions. It also discusses prospects for the application of Alena Tensor in unification theories against the background of existing research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93e1e8a53a7879f0de20dffaf9e5374cd1b2267c317133721b4f7d8d9ab2c18f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
