{"title":"Under-Five Mortality and Associated Risk Factors in Children Hospitalized at David Bernardino Pediatric Hospital (DBPH), Angola: A Hierarchical Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1919/v1","date":1716961652000,"content":"Reducing under-five mortality is a key indicator of a country's overall development, yet in Angola, understanding the factors contributing to hospital deaths in this vulnerable demographic remains incomplete despite improvements in healthcare infrastructure and public health policies. With one of the highest under-five mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, Angola grapples with significant challenges, including malaria, malnutrition, pneumonia, neonatal conditions, and intestinal infectious diseases, as leading causes of death among children. This study aimed to identify factors associated with these hospital deaths in children aged 28 days to five years admitted to DBPH in Luanda between May 2022 and June 2023. Utilizing a hospital-based case-control design, a total of 1020 children were studied, with 340 cases of hospital deaths. Notably, distal and intermediate determinants emerged as primary predictors of hospital mortality, revealing significant associations with maternal education status, maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, short hospital stays (≤24h), poor nutritional status, short interbirth intervals, maternal age ≤19 years, and maternal age ≥35 years. These findings underscore the preventable nature of most under-five hospital deaths and emphasize the urgent need to address social inequities and enhance the quality of primary healthcare services to effectively mitigate child mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52e3b1a669c35e22091b2ab485ac02823372f1f1b2b30a2393e5ad07dcab651b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
