{"title":"Diatomite evidence for a small palaeo mountain lake at 3400 m asl, Lesotho, southern Africa","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3643?af=R","date":1720436708000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The Eastern Lesotho Highlands experience an excess of rainfall sufficient to form the country's primary export, supplying the economic hub of southern Africa, Gauteng South Africa. However, there is currently only one natural lake in the country, Letšeng-la Letsie, and evidence of palaeolakes in the region is therefore of particular interest. This study presents the analysis of a diatomite outcrop from a depression northwest of Mafadi Summit, at 3400 m asl. The presence of diatomite, dominated by the facultative planktonic species <i>Staurosirella pinnata</i> and <i>Staurosira construens</i> and abundant planktonic <i>Aulacoseira ambigua</i>, is indicative of the continuous presence of a shallow lake between ~4600 and 100 cal a \n<span>bp.</span> Comparative analysis of rainfall for the Mafadi and Letšeng-la Letsie regions from CHIRPS gridded rainfall data demonstrates sufficient rainfall for a lake of comparable size, if not larger, as Mafadi receives considerably more rainfall than Letšeng-la Letsie. Analysis of the SRTM 30-m Digital Elevation Model and Topographic Position Index calculations demonstrate the feasibility of a shallow surface water feature at Mafadi. The conversion of this palaeolake into the contemporary wetland is hypothesized to be the result of post-industrial warming, possibly augmented by migration of livestock into the Eastern Lesotho Highlands.</p>","author":"Jennifer M.
