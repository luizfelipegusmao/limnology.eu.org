{"title":"Exploring empathic engagement in immersive media: An EEG study on mu rhythm suppression in VR","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303553","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Jong-Hyun Lee, Sung Eun Lee, Young-Sung Kwon</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the influence of immersive media, particularly Virtual Reality (VR), on empathic responses, in comparison to traditional television (TV), using electroencephalography (EEG). We employed mu rhythm suppression as a measurable neural marker to gauge empathic engagement, as its increase generally signifies heightened empathic responses. Our findings exhibit a greater mu rhythm suppression in VR conditions compared to TV conditions, suggesting a potential enhancement in empathic responses with VR. Furthermore, our results revealed that the strength of empathic responses was not confined to specific actions depicted in the video clips, underscoring the possibility of broader implications. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the effects of different media environments on empathic engagement, particularly emphasizing the unique role of immersive technologies such as VR. It invites further investigation into how such technologies can shape and potentially enhance the empathic experience.","author":"Jong-Hyun Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b397a8c8110e118aac25ef5c7780a9fd9fedbb223e24d13bdb3f68d4dcdb2e1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
