{"title":"New Multifunctional Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-Based Porous Carbons for the Removal of Industrial Wood Dyes from Aqueous Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0164/v1","date":1722588571000,"content":"Wastewaters containing synthetic dyes, namely molecules with large aromatic structure which can produce harmful effects on the aquatic environment, are difficult to treat. Accordingly, and based on the adsorption technology, this work proposes the use of porous carbons as adsorbents of a red dye used in the wood industry. Three porous carbonaceous materials with relatively high porosity and tunable pore size were prepared by transformation of a nitrogen-rich precursor, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), at high temperature: N doped carbon (PAN-C), N-doped activated carbon with potassium hydroxide (PAN-C-Act) and N, S-co doped carbon with sulphur (PAN-S-C). Different experiments were planned to study the influence of pH (1.9-2.3, 6-6.8 and 11.8-12.6), solid/liquid ratio (S/L, 0.43-0.53 and 1.73-1.91 g L−1) and initial concentration (24 – 28 mg L−1 and 231 – 285 mg L−1) on the dye removal from aqueous solutions. The best results were found for the activated carbon (PAN-C-Act) at all concentrations and pH essayed. Specifically, the maximum adsorption capacity of 602.3 mg g−1 (99.9%, adsorption yield) was obtained at S/L of about 0.5 g L−1, acid pH, 285 mg L−1 and 48 h. Adsorption kinetics was better explained by the pseudo-second order model. Also, the existence of external mass transfer and intra-particle diffusion was confirmed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d2795961fad90cdba1100bbddadfcfbf02726e105a9853de04c710620ee6bf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
