{"title":"Intelligent Fire Suppression Devices based on Microcapsules Linked to Sensor IoT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0543/v1","date":1715263139000,"content":"This study develops an intelligent fire suppression device that links microcapsule-based IoT to extinguish early fires, such as blind spots that cannot be seen by humans or places that are difficult to recognize fires. The microcapsule is a micro-unit collection that collects Novak 1230 gas generated in the semiconductor production process. The microcapsule is molded into a form with a fire suppression function, and when a fire occurs, the molded body explodes and absorbs ambient oxygen to suppress the fire. The complex sensor IoT executes smoke and heat detection generated when a fire is suppressed within 10 seconds, which derives the reliability of the detector by notifying the fire and detecting the ignition point through communication linkages such as Ieee 485 and WiFi or LoRa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"362765f90fa73973cc20ff747573853060caf7d04b78bf89db4ce9b37314a5f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
