{"title":"Mitigation of acrylamide formation in wood oven baked pizza base using wholemeal and refined wheat flour with low free asparagine content: considerations on fibre intake and starch digestibility","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13289?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In wheat-derived bakery products, the quantity of free asparagine (fAsn) has been identified as a key factor in acrylamide (AA) formation. Based on this assumption, four varieties of common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.), <i>Stromboli</i>, <i>Montecarlo</i>, <i>Sothys</i> and <i>Cosmic</i>, selected for their different fAsn content inside the grain, were studied to evaluate their potential in the production of pizza with reduced AA levels. To this purpose, wholemeal and refined flours were obtained from each variety.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The fAsn content ranged from 0.25 to 3.30 mmol kg<sup>−1</sup>, with higher values for wholemeal flours which also showed greater amount of ash, fibre and damaged starch than refined wheat flours. All types of flours were separately used to produce wood oven baked pizza base, according to the Traditional Speciality Guaranteed EU Regulation (97/2010). AA reduction in the range 47–68% was found for all the selected wheat cultivars, compared with a commercial flour, with significantly lower values registered when refined flour was used. Moreover, refined leavened dough samples showed decreased levels of fAsn and reducing sugars due to the fermentation activity of yeasts. Furthermore, it was confirmed that pizza made with wholemeal flours exhibited lower rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and rapidly available glucose (RAG) values compared to that prepared with the refined flour.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study clearly shows that a reduced asparagine content in wheat flour is a key factor in the mitigation of AA formation in pizza base. Unfortunately, at the same time, it is highlighted how it is necessary to sacrifice the beneficial effects of fibre intake, such as lowering the glycaemic index, in order to reduce AA. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Clelia Covino, \nAndrea Tafuri, \nAngela Sorrentino, \nStefania Masci, \nElena Baldoni, \nFrancesco Sestili, \nReynaldo Villalonga, \nPaolo Masi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a94f1601d7b07a76dad082364789ac67602b04328d2e549eab6d41ce02bc4d4e","category":"Environment"}
