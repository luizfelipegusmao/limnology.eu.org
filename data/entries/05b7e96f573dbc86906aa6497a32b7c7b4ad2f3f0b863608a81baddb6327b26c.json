{"title":"Global Resources and Resource Justice &ndash; Lost in Frameworks and the Way Forward","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0798/v1","date":1710409888000,"content":"The lexical analysis of seminal policy-to-diplomacy documents from the socio-environmental discourse of the last fifty year agendas allowed examining the evolution of five themes: resources/waste, pollution, social and economic development, justice, and health. Contextual affinities were strongest between resources, pollution, and health and are linked to societal trends and pressures. On those grounds, the central role of resource stewardship according to nature’s physical limits is highlighted, and dedicated concepts, analytical frameworks, and methodologies with different degrees of sustainability are analyzed. To reframe the identified social and economic problems, the work proposes criteria and choices that (1) allow to compare the dynamics of socioecological states across the planet, (2) help matching the pace of socioecological change by addressing path dependencies through participation and engagement of communities, and (3) enable stakeholders to make trade-offs and take decisions in specific social, economic, political, and cultural contexts. The prioritization of resource justice and  responsibility becomes a societal project : from Wellfare State to commonfare communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05b7e96f573dbc86906aa6497a32b7c7b4ad2f3f0b863608a81baddb6327b26c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
