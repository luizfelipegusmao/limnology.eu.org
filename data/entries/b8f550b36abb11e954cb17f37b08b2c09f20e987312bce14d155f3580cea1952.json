{"title":"Usefulness of Tissue Biomarkers versus Prostate-Spcific Membrane Antigen-Positron Emission Tomography for Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1635/v1","date":1721634779000,"content":"Despite curative-intent local therapy, approximately 27% to 53% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients experience prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence, known as biochemical recurrence (BCR). BCR significantly raises the risk of PCa-related morbidity and mortality, yet there is not consensus on optimal management. Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA PET) has emerged as highly sensitive imaging, distinguishing local recurrences from distant metastases, crucially influencing treatment decisions. Genomic biomarkers such as Decipher, Prolaris, and Oncotype DX contribute to refining recurrence risk profiles, guiding decisions on intensifying adjuvant therapies like radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This review assesses PSMA PET and biomarkers utility in post-radical prostatectomy BCR scenarios, highlighting their impact on clinical decision-making. Despite their promising roles, routine integration of biomarkers is limited by availability and cost, requiring further evidence. PSMA PET remains indispensable for restaging and treatment evaluation in these patients. Integrating biomarkers and PSMA PET promises to optimize personalized management strategies for BCR, though more comprehensive consensus-building studies are needed to define their standardized utility in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8f550b36abb11e954cb17f37b08b2c09f20e987312bce14d155f3580cea1952","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
