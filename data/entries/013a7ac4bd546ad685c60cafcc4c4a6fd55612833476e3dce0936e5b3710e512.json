{"title":"A Verifiable Multi-Secret Sharing Scheme for Hierarchical Access Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2061/v1","date":1717069581000,"content":"Sharing confidential information is a critical concern in today’s world. Secret sharing schemes facilitate the sharing of secrets in a way that ensures only authorized participants (shareholders) can access the secret using their allocated shares. Hierarchical secret sharing schemes (HSSSs) build upon Shamir’s scheme by organizing participants into different levels based on priority. Within HSSS, participants at each level can reconstruct the secret if a specified number, denoted as the threshold value (t), or more of them are present. Each level has a predetermined threshold value. If the number of participants falls below the threshold at any level, higher-level participants must be involved in reconstructing the secret at lower levels. Our paper proposes schemes that implement hierarchical access structures and enable the sharing of multiple secrets. Additionally, our proposed scheme includes share verification. We have analyzed potential attacks and demonstrated the scheme’s resistance against them. Through security analysis and comparison with existing schemes, we highlight the novelty and superiority of our proposed approach, contributing to advancements in secure information sharing practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"013a7ac4bd546ad685c60cafcc4c4a6fd55612833476e3dce0936e5b3710e512","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
