More recently, the development of high-speed pixelated electron detectors has enabled the collection of full 2D convergent beam electron diffraction patterns for every scan position in a normal 2D raster scan, producing 4D datasets. As well as being used to generate standard STEM images with variably defined collection angles, new 4D-STEM techniques such as center-of-mass [<a href=\"#ozae044.192-B2\">2</a>], ptychography [<a href=\"#ozae044.192-B3\">3</a>], nanoscale strain mapping [<a href=\"#ozae044.192-B4\">4</a>] and STEM holography [<a href=\"#ozae044.192-B5\">5</a>] are now also available.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1531c8f0ac55dcd47604ee97df9928fe9f1e76e09f218e5ad826c4c48956409d","category":"Environment"}
