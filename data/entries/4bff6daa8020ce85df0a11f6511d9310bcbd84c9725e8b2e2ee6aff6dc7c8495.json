{"title":"N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B) Regulates PD-L1 Expression\nin Melanoma by an HDAC3-Mediated Epigenetic Mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0990/v1","date":1713182762000,"content":"Effects of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B, ARSB), which removes the 4-sulfate group at the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate, on the expression of PD-L1 were determined and the underlying mechanism of PD-L1 expression elucidated. Initial experiments in human melanoma cells (A375) showed PD-L1 expression increased from 357 ± 31 to 796 ± 50 pg/mg protein (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bff6daa8020ce85df0a11f6511d9310bcbd84c9725e8b2e2ee6aff6dc7c8495","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
