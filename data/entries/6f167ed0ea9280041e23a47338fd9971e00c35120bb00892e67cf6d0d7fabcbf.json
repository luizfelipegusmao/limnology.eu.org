The objective is to design a prototype to mitigate risks and prevent threats to avoid the closure of this type of company. Through the analysis of related articles, applying sequences of methodological steps; It was determined that the proposed results are aimed at how to identify and mitigate the risks and threats that cause their bankruptcy and closure. Prototypes resulted that allow mitigating risks, preventing threats and minimizing vulnerabilities in the management of SMEs. It was concluded that the proposed prototype to detect threats and vulnerabilities provides an optimal security model for small and medium-sized companies; As a result of the simulations, a security percentage of 77.92% was established, which means that the greater the number of risks and threats, the greater the probability that a small and medium-sized company will close.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f167ed0ea9280041e23a47338fd9971e00c35120bb00892e67cf6d0d7fabcbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
