{"title":"Precision Medicine for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0191/v1","date":1728433503000,"content":"The clinical outcome for children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a testimony to the success of modern medicine. Over the past several decades, survival has climbed from âˆ¼ 10% to &amp;gt; 90% for certain subgroups. Yet, the outcome for those with relapsed disease is often poor and survivors struggle with a multitude of healthcare issues, some of which are lifelong. In recent years, the advent of widespread sequencing of tumors has made available previously unrecognized subtypes of leukemia patients who have the potential to benefit from the addition of targeted therapies. Indeed, the promise of precision medicine encompassing a person's environment, genetics and lifestyle is likely to have profound impact on further tailoring therapies that are likely to improve outcomes, diminish toxicity and ultimately pave the pathway for a healthier population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a8b20d822d59de432f7858b99edfb821361123bd5ca4b43e9a1fdae4aa7ae37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
