However, generating uniform, high-quality templates in a short amount of time remains a challenge in traditional vertical self-assembly techniques. Drop casting concentrated particle solutions, on the other hand, can generate templates over large (&gt; 100 cm<sup>2</sup>) areas in a fraction of the time. One hypothesis for why drop casting works so well is that the particles begin to order while in solution, supported by the iridescence of the solutions. Confirming this hypothesis presents a challenge: due to particle size and confinement effects, techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nano-computed tomography (nanoCT) and white light microscopy proved inconclusive. Similarly, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) can only image the top surface of the solution where evaporation drives particle packing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"105cd25e7a97e899ee089afa5e9aa40fe453524b16507b992b95b7ed75bcc513","category":"Environment"}
