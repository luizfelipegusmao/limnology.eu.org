{"title":"A BIM-Based Bar Bending Schedule Generation Algorithm With Enhanced Accuracy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1856/v1","date":1712116508000,"content":"Rebar quantity estimation is pivotal for determining the cost of construction projects and essential for bidding purposes. A bar bending schedule plays a crucial role by providing rebar information and bending instructions, facilitating efficient procurement. Traditional methods of bar bending schedules, which involve manual extraction from 2D (two-dimensional) drawings, are error-prone and hinder construction productivity. This study proposes a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based algorithm that automates the generation of a Bar Bending Schedule (BBS) directly from the 3D (three-dimensional) BIM models, ensuring accuracy and eliminating manual errors. The effectiveness of the algorithm was verified by comparing the rebar quantities generated by the model against those derived from optimization calculations. The results demonstrated a mean absolute error of 0.017 and a mean absolute percentage error of 1.13%, validating the algorithmâ€™s precision. Additionally, it achieved a remarkable 33.33% reduction in the manpower required for preparing BBSs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize construction workflow efficiency and accuracy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbd92f960bc6d031b2caad41c204494c2ea75d0a53fbff7678aa01cf3cf2bc1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
