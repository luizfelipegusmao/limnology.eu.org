{"title":"Single point motion kinematics convey emotional signals in children and adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301896","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Elisa Roberti, Chiara Turati, Rossana Actis-Grosso</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigates whether humans recognize different emotions conveyed only by the kinematics of a single moving geometrical shape and how this competence unfolds during development, from childhood to adulthood. To this aim, animations in which a shape moved according to happy, fearful, or neutral cartoons were shown, in a forced-choice paradigm, to 7- and 10-year-old children and adults. Accuracy and response times were recorded, and the movement of the mouse while the participants selected a response was tracked. Results showed that 10-year-old children and adults recognize happiness and fear when conveyed solely by different kinematics, with an advantage for fearful stimuli. Fearful stimuli were also accurately identified at 7-year-olds, together with neutral stimuli, while, at this age, the accuracy for happiness was not significantly different than chance. Overall, results demonstrates that emotions can be identified by a single point motion alone during both childhood and adulthood. Moreover, motion contributes in various measures to the comprehension of emotions, with fear recognized earlier in development and more readily even later on, when all emotions are accurately labeled.","author":"Elisa Roberti","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f428967625aad9c1965c1a488fae0f14061e5e6de26bed8f43d7d99ede50c8d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
