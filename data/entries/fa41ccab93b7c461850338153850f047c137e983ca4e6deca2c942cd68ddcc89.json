More research is needed to understand the impact of financial burden on patients with COPD, heart failure, and kidney failure. Patients with COPD, heart failure, or kidney failure completed a cross-sectional online survey using validated measures of financial burden (general financial strain as well as financial toxicity attributable to treatment), physical quality of life (symptom burden and perceived health), and emotional quality of life (anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation). ANCOVA was used to examine whether financial strain and financial toxicity were associated with physical and emotional quality of life, while accounting for key covariates. Among 225 participants with COPD (n = 137), heart failure (n = 48), or kidney failure (n = 40), 62.2% reported general financial strain, with 34.7% experiencing financial toxicity attributable to treatments. Additionally, 68.9% rated their health as fair or poor, experiencing significant symptom burden including fatigue, dyspnea, and chest pain. Participants also reported clinically relevant levels of anxiety (55.1%), depression (52.0%), and suicidal ideation (21.8%). In the total sample, financial strain was associated with worse physical and emotional quality of life on all measures (all Ps &lt; .001). Financial toxicity attributable to treatment was not associated with quality of life in the total sample or subsamples. Patients with COPD, heart failure, and kidney failure face significant financial, physical, and emotional burdens. Financial strain appears to undermine physical and emotional quality of life. Our study highlights the demand for interventions aimed at mitigating financial strain and toxicity experienced by individuals with chronic illnesses.","author":"Seowoo Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fa41ccab93b7c461850338153850f047c137e983ca4e6deca2c942cd68ddcc89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
