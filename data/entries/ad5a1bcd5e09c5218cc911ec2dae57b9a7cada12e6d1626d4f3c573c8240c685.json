{"title":"Metabolic Control of Sugarcane Internode Elongation and Sucrose Accumulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0130/v1","date":1717501233000,"content":"The relationship between metabolic changes occurring in the developing internodes of sugarcane and the final yield and sugar characteristics is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of integration between phenotypic and metabolic data. To address this issue, a study was conducted where sugarcane metabolism was modelled based on the measurement of cellular components in the top internodes at two stages of crop development. The study also looked at the effects of Trinexapac-ethyl (ModdusÂ®) on growth inhibition. The metabolome was measured using GC-analysis while LC-MS/MS was used to measure proteome changes in the developing internodes. The data was then integrated with the metabolic rates. The study revealed that the duration of internode growth is independent of the growth rate and is probably controlled by the accumulation of heat units (degree days). In contrast, sucrose and lignin accumulation is sensitive to the growth rate. Sucrose accumulation only occurs once the cell wall synthesis slow down. The data suggest that sucrose accumulation is controlled a reduction in sucrose breakdown for metabolic activity and a reduction in demand for carbon for cell wall polysaccharide synthesis. This study also found that nucleotide sugar metabolism appears to be a key regulator in regulating carbon flow during internode development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad5a1bcd5e09c5218cc911ec2dae57b9a7cada12e6d1626d4f3c573c8240c685","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
