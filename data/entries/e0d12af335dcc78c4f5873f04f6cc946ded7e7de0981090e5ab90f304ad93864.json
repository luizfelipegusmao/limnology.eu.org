{"title":"Corporate governance for sustainable development in Vietnam: Criteria for SOEs based on MCDM approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302306","date":1714572000000,"content":"<p>by Phi-Dinh Hoang, Ly-Thi Nguyen, Binh-Quoc Tran, Dao-Thi Ta</p>\r\n\r\nThis research explores the nexus between corporate governance and sustainable development, focusing on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Vietnam. Recognizing the pivotal role of SOEs in the national economy, this study employs a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach (MCDM) to assess and enhance the corporate governance frameworks of these entities. First, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model is employed to identify the most qualified prospective SOEs firms based on several quantitative criteria. Then, the spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (SF-AHP) model is used to identify priority weights for a given set of qualitative criteria, the Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) model is implemented to rank enterprises in the SOEs sector. To validate the proposed models, a case study conducted within the Vietnamese electric power industry is utilized. The MCDM methodology integrates diverse factors such as business management, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance shareholder to construct a comprehensive evaluation framework. By applying this approach, the study aims to identify the key drivers and barriers influencing corporate governance practices within Vietnamese SOEs. The studyâ€™s findings illustrate the efficacy of the suggested approach in evaluating corporate governance performance, providing valuable insights for policymakers, corporate leaders, and stakeholders involved in shaping the governance landscape of SOEs in Vietnam. By aligning corporate governance with sustainable development principles, the research aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on responsible business practices, offering practical recommendations to enhance the performance and resilience of SOEs in the pursuit of long-term socio-economic and environmental sustainability.","author":"Phi-Dinh Hoang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e0d12af335dcc78c4f5873f04f6cc946ded7e7de0981090e5ab90f304ad93864","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
