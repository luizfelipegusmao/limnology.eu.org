{"title":"Thermal Deformation Behavior and Consitutive Equation of Uranium-50wt.%Zirconium Nuclear Fuel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2394/v1","date":1727685161000,"content":"In order to study the thermal deformation behavior of uranium-50wt.%zirconium, used Gleeble 3800 thermal simulation testing machine to carry out compression deformation experiments at different temperatures for this material. The effects of deformation temperature and strain rate on the alloy were studied. The results show that the peak stress of U-50wt.%Zr metallic fuel decreases with the increase of deformation temperature after thermal deformation at 500°C~600°C, especially at 600°C compared with that at 500°C and 550°C. At the same temperature, the peak stress increases with the increase of strain rate, especially the peak stress at strain rate 0.1s-1 and 1s-1 is significantly higher than that at strain rate 0.01s-1, and then the microstructure and diffraction results of U-50wt.%Zr metal-type fuel after thermal deformation are compared and analyzed, and the Arrhenius-type constitutive equation and thermal proces550℃,έ=1s-1 diagram of U-50wt.%Zr metal-type fuel are established based on the peak stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e0113229d0b70884bec4f1d52eb9a7bc42b1e9afdfa157ff262fa603c7d2b69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
