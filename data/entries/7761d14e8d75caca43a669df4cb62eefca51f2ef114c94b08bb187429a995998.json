{"title":"Progress and Perspective on the Zirconia Ceramics and Applications: A Review on Processing Methods and Mechanical Characteristics Improvements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1457/v1","date":1713852776000,"content":"The development in the field of ceramics has been increasing over the past several decades. Among all of the dental ceramics, zirconia ceramics show very good mechanical properties and a significant improvement in mechanical function. However, it is properly established that each step of the fabrication process of zirconia ceramics must be controlled to achieve the expected mechanical properties. These steps include the block constructing, sintering process, machining and surface processing. Recent advances have focused on zirconia ceramics in forming and sintering processes, mechanical properties, combining with various materials, and on surface processing. All these items provide conceptions about the formability and machinability of the zirconia. Until now, very excellent studies have been done to specify the evolution of microstructures, phase and mechanical properties of zirconia ceramics during the sintering process. However, more studies are required in this field. This paper aims to demonstrate general views and various studies in the field of zirconia ceramics. The properties, applications and tests performed and the recent developments in the field of zirconia bioceramics are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7761d14e8d75caca43a669df4cb62eefca51f2ef114c94b08bb187429a995998","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
