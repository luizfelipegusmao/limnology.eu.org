{"title":"Foliar applications of a Malvaceae‐derived protein hydrolysate and its fractions differentially modulate yield and functional traits of tomato under optimal and suboptimal nitrogen application","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13596?af=R","date":1716902290000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Protein hydrolysates (PHs) can enhance plant nitrogen nutrition and improve the quality of vegetables, depending on their bioactive compounds. A tomato greenhouse experiment was conducted under both optimal (14 mM) and suboptimal (2 mM) nitrogen (N-NO<sub>3</sub>) conditions. Tomatoes were treated with a new Malvaceae-derived PH (MDPH) and its molecular fractions (MDPH1, &gt;10 kDa; MDPH2, 1–10 kDa and MDPH3, &lt;1 kDa).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Under optimal N conditions, the plants increased biomass and fruit yield, and showed a higher photosynthetic pigment content in leaves in comparison with suboptimal N, whereas under N-limiting conditions, an increase in dry matter, soluble solid content (SSC) and lycopene, a reduction in firmness, and changes in organic acid and phenolic compounds were observed. With 14 mM N-NO<sub>3</sub>, MDPH3 stimulated an increase in dry weight and increased yield components and lycopene in the fruit. The MDPH2 fraction also resulted in increased lycopene accumulation in fruit under 14 mM N-NO<sub>3</sub>. At a low N level, the PH fractions showed distinct effects compared with the whole MDPH and the control, with an increase in biomass for MDPH1 and MDPH2 and a higher pigment content for MDPH3. Regardless of N availability, all the fractions affected fruit quality by increasing SSC, whereas MDPH2 and MDPH3 modified organic acid content and showed a higher concentration of flavonols, lignans, and stilbenes.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The molecular weight of the peptides modifies the effect of PHs on plant performance, with different behavior depending on the level of N fertilization, confirming the effectiveness of fractioning processes. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mariateresa Cardarelli, \nAngela Valentina Ceccarelli, \nChristophe El Nakhel, \nYoussef Rouphael, \nHajar Salehi, \nPaola Ganugi, \nLeilei Zhang, \nLucini Luigi, \nYoury Pii, \nSeunghyun Choi, \nHye‐Ji Kim, \nGiuseppe Colla","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b0bbb1564239e8c264a77f7f1038039eccc3a7e25666e4016857f7da278e40c3","category":"Environment"}
