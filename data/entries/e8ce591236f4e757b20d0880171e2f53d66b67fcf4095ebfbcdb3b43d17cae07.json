{"title":"19 Strategies to optimize the trace mineral status of weaned beef calves","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/72/7757142?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Trace mineral nutrition of pre-weaned beef calves is derived from 1) tissue stores at birth, 2) milk, 3) forage, and 4) supplement. In most production systems, calves are born with adequate trace mineral status, namely Cu, Zn, Mn and Se. One exception, however, is severe Se deficiency in the dam which may result in White Muscle Disease in Se-deficient calves shortly after birth. Despite general adequacy at birth, tissue concentrations of these elements often decrease during the pre-weaning period due to inadequacies in milk and trace mineral deficiency of forages. Trace mineral losses are further exacerbated by a variety of stressors naturally occurring throughout the production system, including, but not limited to, environmental, social, and immunological. Weaning, which is unavoidable in modern production systems, is the most stressful experience a beef animal will experience in their lifetime. To avoid deficiency at weaning, trace mineral deficits must be addressed through supplementation during the pre-weaning period. One of the most common supplementation methods involves the blending of supplemental trace minerals with common salt, offered free choice. This system assumes that cattle have a “nutritional wisdom” to consume salt at a level that meets their requirement for Na. Although largely effective in most grazing situations, this management system is not without complications. Notably, salt-based, free-choice mineral supplements are offered simultaneously to cow/calf pairs with known variation in voluntary intake. The necessity to understand and manage free-choice intake is the basic principle behind all successful free-choice mineral supplementation systems. In tropical and subtropical climates, where a large percentage of the world’s beef is produced, cattle are typically enrolled in year-long grazing schedules that are characterized by dry and wet seasons. In these environments, the craving for salt increases as forage DM decreases resulting in large seasonally impacted reductions in voluntary intake of salt-based, free-choice mineral supplements. During the dry season, when forage moisture is low, free-choice, salt-based mineral consumption often does not meet anticipated target levels due to a reduced natural craving for salt. There are other examples where seasonal variation in salt craving impacts the effectiveness of targeting appropriate voluntary intake of free-choice mineral supplements. For example, in some coastal regions of the world, salt-water intrusion will impact the Na content of forages and drinking water. In these regions, cattle may avoid salt-fortified supplements because of excessive Na intake from other sources. Fortunately, if we understand these regional and climatic impacts, there are effective management interventions that may be adopted to protect against trace mineral deficiency resulting from inadequate free-choice intake. This symposium presentation will review multiple pre-weaning mineral supplementation systems that have been shown to be effective for optimizing the mineral status of weaned beef calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e8ce591236f4e757b20d0880171e2f53d66b67fcf4095ebfbcdb3b43d17cae07","category":"Environment"}
