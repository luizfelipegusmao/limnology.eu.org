This pilot prospective study aimed to: i) evaluate the suitability of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for determination of PAHs in the LRT and of urine for determination of hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PAHs) in patients with INHI, ii) describe the dynamic changes in the levels of these toxic compounds, and iii) correlate these findings with clinical variables of the patients with INHI.</p> Methods <p>The BAL and urine samples from 10 patients with INHI were obtained on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 of hospitalization, if possible, and PAHs (BAL) and OH-PAHs (urine) were analyzed using chromatographic methods (GC-MS and HPLC).</p> Results <p>Concentrations of analyzed PAHs were in most cases and time points below the limit of quantification in BAL samples. Nine OH-PAHs were detected in the urine samples; however, their concentrations sharply decreased within the first three days of the hospitalization. On Day 14, the total amount of OH-PAHs in urine was higher in surviving patients with High-grade INHI (≥3) than in those with Low-grade INHI (&lt;3, p = 0.032). Finally, a significant correlation between certain OH-PAHs and clinical variables (AST/ALT, TBSA, ABSI) from Day 1 of the hospitalization was observed (p&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusions <p>BAL samples are not suitable for the analysis of PAHs. However, the OH-PAHs levels in urine can be measured reliably and were correlated with several clinical variables. Moreover, High-grade INHI was associated with higher total concentrations of OH-PAHs in urine.</p>","author":"Katerina Vyklicka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bd15ce5228cebcf1d45b43b3fe02bd5bb349d5489ab609bcd4060e857b02c35d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
