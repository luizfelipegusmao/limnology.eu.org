{"title":"Recent Advances and Current Challenges in Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Ultra-Central Lung Tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1934/v1","date":1729772115000,"content":"Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy has been established as a viable treatment option for inoperable early-stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or secondary lesions mainly in oligoprogressive/oligometastatic scenarios. Treating lesions in the so-called “no flight zone” has always been challenging and conflicting data never cleared how to safely treat these lesions. This is truer considering ultra-central lesions, i.e. directly abutting or whose PTV is overlapping critical mediastinal organs. While historical retrospective data is abundant but mostly heterogenous in terms of definition of ultra-central lesions, dosing regimens and outcomes, prospective data remains scarce, even though recently published studies have given new encouraging results for such delicate treatment scenarios. For this reason, we aimed to review and summarize current knowledge on stereotactic radiation treatment for ultra-central thoracic lesions, highlighting the most recent advances and the messages that can be taken from them. Lastly, we propose a workflow of the necessary steps to identify and treat such patients, therefore helping in elucidating them with advantages and caveats of such treatment option.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"915db596ac78bceaa0dc8b44312748701c168ee32a0cf8bd1c7a29ca06bf4854","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
