{"title":"Introduction and temporospatial tracing of piscine orthoreovirus‐1 (PRV‐1) in Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) after local fallowing","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13978?af=R","date":1723123610000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Piscine orthoreovirus-1 (PRV-1) is a prevalent agent in Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) and the causative agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), an important disease in farmed Atlantic salmon. Investigations into the introduction and dissemination routes of PRV-1 in a field setting have been limited. This study aimed to better understand PRV-1 infections and HSMI-associated mortality under field conditions. We tracked introduction and spread of PRV-1 over one production cycle in a geographically isolated region in Norwegian aquaculture. From five sites, a total of 32 virus isolates were sequenced and genogrouped. The results indicated multiple introductions of PRV-1 to the area, but also revealed a high level of genetic homogeneity among the virus variants. The variants differed from that of the previous production cycle at two out of three sites investigated, suggesting that synchronized fallowing can be a useful tool for preventing dissemination of PRV-1 between generations of fish. Exposure to PRV-1 at the freshwater stage was identified as a potential source of introduction. A low level of HSMI-associated mortality was observed at all sites, with the onset of mortality showing some variation across PRV-1 genogroups. However, the study highlighted the complexity of associating viral genogroups with mortality in a field setting. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into PRV-1 dynamics in a real-world aquaculture setting, offering potential strategies for disease management and prevention.</p>","author":"Nina A.
