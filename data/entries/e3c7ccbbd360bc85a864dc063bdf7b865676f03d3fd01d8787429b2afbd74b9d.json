This article provides a thorough description of the possible uses of OpenAI's state-of-the-art language model, ChatGPT-4, in musculoskeletal imaging. Purpose for review: MSK Radiologists need to evolve about their knowledge and understanding of the roles of ChatGPT and its implications in daily practice. We aim to emphasize the advantages of ChatGPT-4 on the musculoskeletal imaging field and its potential to enhance radiologist working checklist review items, and the overall productivity of radiology reports. Recent findings: The fact of that specialists in radiology, rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, and other fields are conversant with ChatGPT. Furthermore, opinions are generally well, despite the fact that many people have reservations about the new technology, which is still developing [1]. Compared to GPT-4V based ChatGPT, GPT-4 based ChatGPT showed noticeably better diagnostic accuracy. Although ChatGPT, which is based on GPT-4, performed diagnostically on par with radiology residents, however, it demonstrated lower performance than a musculoskeletal radiologist [2].","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3c7ccbbd360bc85a864dc063bdf7b865676f03d3fd01d8787429b2afbd74b9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
