{"title":"Factors Influencing the Effects of Triticale on Laying Hens&rsquo; Performance: A Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0281/v1","date":1714981096000,"content":"Triticale is known for being an alternative energy source to usual cereals such as maize and wheat in poultry nutrition. Several studies suggested opposite results regarding its incorporation as a feed ingredient on laying hens’ production parameters. This article used a meta-analysis to assess the factors influencing the effects of triticale on layers’ performance. In July 2022, papers studying the effect of triticale on layers’ egg production (EP), egg weight (EW), egg yolk color (EYC), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were identified on Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct. According to the eligibility criteria of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, 6 articles were registered and segmented into 16 experiments for our meta-analysis. Overall, the trim and fill method revealed that triticale had similar impacts to conventional cereals on laying hens' performance. However, the meta-ANOVA and the meta-regression emphasized that triticale percentage, triticale strains and laying hens strains could significantly influence the effect of triticale on layers' performance. Indeed, the meta-Anova highlighted that the Hy-Line Brown strain and Joesong and Juanilo triticale strains in-duced the best laying hens’ performance. Moreover, the meta-regression emphasized a positive correlation between the triticale inclusion percentage and the EW in Juanilo triticale diets and a negative correlation between the triticale inclusion percentages and the EYC in the triticale and laying hens strains studied. Even though the funnel plot and the Egger linear test suggested sig-nificant publication bias, the present meta-analysis remains consistent research to understand how certain factors could influence the impact of triticale on layers' performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4686327fb81793df7e560ddd8a600be811b87ff1948743380123bafd36a31242","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
