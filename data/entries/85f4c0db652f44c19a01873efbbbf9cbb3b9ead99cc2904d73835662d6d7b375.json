{"title":"Rise and decline of Holocene tufas across Europe: exploring east/west and north/south similarities and differences in their development","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3637?af=R","date":1718874858000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>An extended inventory of 82 well-dated European calcareous tufas is used to discuss the timing and amplitude of their onset, maximum and decline; in particular differences from east to west and between the Mediterranean area and the rest of Europe. Eastern deposits start to develop and reach their maximum slightly earlier than western tufas. Strong east–west differences in the timing and intensity of the climatic improvement during the first half of the Holocene explain the earlier development of eastern tufas compared with the west. The strongest differences are observed between Mediterranean deposits and other European tufas both in their development and decline, whether all or only fluvial deposits are considered, reflecting the important decoupling between Mediterranean and mid-latitude climate records. During the Late Holocene, the earlier and more pronounced tufa decline observed in European mid-latitudes is likely to result from more intense and rapid deforestation compared with the Mediterranean region.</p>","author":"Julie Dabkowski, \nLéa Beaumont","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"85f4c0db652f44c19a01873efbbbf9cbb3b9ead99cc2904d73835662d6d7b375","category":"Environment"}
