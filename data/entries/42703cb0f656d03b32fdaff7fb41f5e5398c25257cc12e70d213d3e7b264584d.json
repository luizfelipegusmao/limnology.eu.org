{"title":"Banana Lectin: A Novel Immunomodulatory Strategy for Mitigating Inflammatory Bowel Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1993/v1","date":1714469928000,"content":"Compared to the general population, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are less likely to be vaccinated, putting them at an increased risk of vaccine-preventable illnesses. This risk is further compounded by the immunosuppressive therapies commonly used in IBD management. Therefore, developing new treatments for IBD that maintain immune function is crucial, as successful management can lead to better vaccination outcomes and overall health for these patients. Here, we investigate the potential of recombinant banana lectin (rBanLec) as a supporting therapeutic measure to improve IBD control and possibly increase vaccination rates among IBD patients. By examining the therapeutic efficacy of rBanLec in a murine model of experimental colitis, we aim to lay the foundation for its application in improving vaccination outcomes. After inducing experimental colitis in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, we treated animals orally with varying doses of rBanLec 0.1-10 µg/ml (0.01 – 1 µg/dose) during the course of the disease. We assessed the severity of colitis and rBanLec’s modulation of the immune response compared to control groups. rBanLec administration resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in colitis severity (less pronounced weight loss, less shortening of the colon) and an improved recovery profile, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Notably, rBanLec-treated mice exhibited significant modulation of the immune response, favoring anti-inflammatory pathways (primarily reduction in a local [TNFα]/[IL-10]) crucial for effective vaccination. Our findings suggest that rBanLec could mitigate the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy on vaccine responsiveness in IBD patients. By improving the underlying immune response, rBanLec may increase the efficacy of vaccinations, offering a dual benefit of disease management and prevention of vaccine-preventable illnesses. Further studies are required to translate these findings into clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42703cb0f656d03b32fdaff7fb41f5e5398c25257cc12e70d213d3e7b264584d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
