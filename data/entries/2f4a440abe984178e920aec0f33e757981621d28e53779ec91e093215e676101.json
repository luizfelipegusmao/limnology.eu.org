{"title":"Assessment of Health Centers Indoor Air Quality across Various Locations in Nigeria: A Comparative Analysis of Particle Count Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0692/v1","date":1723427236000,"content":"This study presents a comparative analysis of indoor air quality (IAQ) across health centers in Arakale, Iju, Owode, FECA, and Oba Ile, Ondo State, Nigeria. Particle count data were analyzed to identify common trends, similarities, and differences in IAQ parameters, with the aim of informing targeted interventions for improving indoor air quality in healthcare settings. The findings reveal consistent positive skewness in particle count distributions, indicating occasional spikes in pollution levels amidst generally lower concentrations. Fine particles in the size range of PC 2.5 were consistently dominant across all locations, emphasizing their significance in IAQ assessment. Similar variability in particle count data suggests comparable levels of fluctuations in IAQ among the health centers. However, variations in PCA patterns highlight unique factors influencing IAQ in specific locations, such as combustion sources and control strategies. Targeted interventions, including enhancing ventilation systems, controlling indoor pollution sources, and promoting smoking cessation programs, are proposed to mitigate health risks associated with indoor air pollution exposure. Ongoing monitoring and collaboration with environmental experts are crucial for assessing IAQ trends and implementing evidence-based interventions to safeguard the health of patients, staff, and visitors in healthcare facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f4a440abe984178e920aec0f33e757981621d28e53779ec91e093215e676101","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
