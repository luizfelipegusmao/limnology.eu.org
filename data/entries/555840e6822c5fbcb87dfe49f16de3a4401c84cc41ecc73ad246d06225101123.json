We use induction as a proof to show that the 5th Catalan-Mersenne number is a prime number, thus demonstrating the infinitude of Mersenne primes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"555840e6822c5fbcb87dfe49f16de3a4401c84cc41ecc73ad246d06225101123","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
