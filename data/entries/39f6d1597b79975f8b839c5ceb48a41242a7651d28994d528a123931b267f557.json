{"title":"Research on the Range of Appropriate Spatial Scale of Underground Commercial Street Based on Psychological Perception Evaluation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1969/v1","date":1716976685000,"content":"Developing and utilising of underground space is an vital direction for urban growth. Underground commercial streets, as a significant component of underground space accommodating extensive human social activities, and consequently necessitate the creation of human-scale spaces. In the evolution of urban design development towards greater refinement, applying architectural theories and excessively subjective designs has resulted in a deficiency of human-centered design and a disordered spatial environment. This study merges environmental psychology and architectural theory to determine the appropriate length of spatial scale. Two experiments focusing on spatial perception evaluation were conducted using a virtual experimental platform that featured varying dimensions of spatial scale combinations. These quantified combinations were correlated with perception evaluation, and regression analysis was employed to identify appropriate scale ranges, which were superimposed on the range of length selection. Finally, the optimal length and scale combination for underground commercial street spaces were established, providing a reference for the human-centered design of these environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39f6d1597b79975f8b839c5ceb48a41242a7651d28994d528a123931b267f557","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
