{"title":"Natural stable isotope ratios as a tool in understanding nutrient allocation of protein sources in the growth of farmed abalone, Haliotis midae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aff2.190?af=R","date":1719298800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Using stable isotope analysis, we assessed the relative contributions of the main protein contributors fishmeal, soya and sunflower meal to mature abalone muscle and gonad tissue over 1 year. Prerequisites for the use of stable isotope mixing models were established in this species. The δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N discrimination factors and turnover rates were influenced by diet composition, and there were tissue-specific and sex-specific differences. Abalone were fed the two combination diets (fishmeal–soya and fishmeal–sunflower meal) grew at similar rates. However, feed was most efficiently utilised in abalone fed a combination of fishmeal and soya. The relative contribution of fishmeal, soya and sunflower meal to female and male abalone tissue growth fluctuated throughout the 1-year study. Overall, fishmeal contributed over 50% of the gonad (54%–82%) and muscle (54%–84%) tissue growth in females. Similarly, fishmeal contributed over 50% of gonad tissue growth of male abalone, ranging from 59% to 87%, while the contribution to meat tissue growth in males ranged from 44% to 94%. These findings support the importance of laboratory studies when using stable isotope analysis and mixing models for nutrient allocation in aquaculture.</p>","author":"Yu Wu, \nHorst Kaiser, \nCliff L.
