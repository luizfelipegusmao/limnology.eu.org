{"title":"Effect of pH on Spontaneous Imbibition in Calcareous Rocks","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035307?af=R","date":1713384892000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Reactive transport in porous media exhibits multifaceted interactions that are dependent on the matrix and fluid properties, and which ultimately alter these properties. A set of calcareous rock samples with unique mineralogy and varying petrophysical properties are selected for this study. A capillary rise experiment is performed in each sample, first with deionized water and then with a dilute, pH 2, HCl solution. Pre- and post-acid petrophysical properties such as porosity, permeability, pore size distribution, and contact angle are measured for each sample along with the capillary rise profile. The latter is tracked by applying image analysis on video recording. The rock mineralogy significantly affects the acidic fluid intrusion into the rock samples. Calcite dissolution is the main reaction that results in the opening of the pore space. This is more prominent in all the carbonate samples where a higher proportion of calcite minerals is present. A higher capillary rise is consistently observed compared to the neutral fluid along with an increase in porosity and the mean pore size. The contact angle also undergoes changes making the carbonate matrix from oil-wet to neutral-wet. Coupling capillary interactions with fluid reactivity is often neglected in fluid transport phenomena. This study offers new insights into the relative importance of reactivity at the timescale of spontaneous imbibition. This is important in understanding dissolution and precipitation processes during capillary flow.</p>","author":"Muhammad Andiva Pratama, \nHasan Javed Khan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"cf64ca8d3f103c4cc2717e335572f82ab265ee6c0e2e0b030a685029f119bb3e","category":"Environment"}
