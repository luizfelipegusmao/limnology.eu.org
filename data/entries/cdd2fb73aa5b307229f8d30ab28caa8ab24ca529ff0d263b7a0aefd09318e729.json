{"title":"Medicines in Development for Venous Thromboembolism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0053/v1","date":1722563857000,"content":": Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious health condition and represents an important cause of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. According to the latest estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 3 out of 10 people with VTE will have recurrence of clotting event within 10 years. The American Heart Association reports that VTE is more common in people over 40 years of age, and that risk doubles with each decade. The World Health Organization advises that the worldâ€™s population of people aged 60 years is going to be doubled by 2050. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the two main conditions that make up VTE. People with VTE are initially treated with anticoagulants to prevent conditions such as stroke and to reduce the recurrence of VTE. However, thrombolytic therapy is used for people with PE experiencing with low blood pressure or in severe cases of DVT. Despite the approval of direct anticoagulants in 2010, there is clear evidence that the search for new drugs that are more effective or safer than the current antithrombotic treatments continues. Thrombin plays a crucial role in regulating hemostasis and maintaining blood coagulation, and therefore serves as a major target for the treatment of hemostatic disorders such as thromboembolic syndromes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, and acquired hemostatic disorders such as platelet dysfunction and excessive anticoagulation, among other pathologies. This review focuses on the progress in research on new anticoagulants and novel delivery systems for antithrombotic targeting to vascular embolisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdd2fb73aa5b307229f8d30ab28caa8ab24ca529ff0d263b7a0aefd09318e729","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
