{"title":"Stable Trend of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Profiles of Helicobacter pylori Isolated from Patients during a 12-Year Period in Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1395/v1","date":1721210297000,"content":"An efficacious treatment of H. pylori infection is cornerstone for the global control of the diseases caused by this bacterium. Continuous epidemiologic surveillance of susceptibility of H. pylori to the antibiotics recommended for its eradication is highly recommended. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of 651 isolates from five different collections isolated between 1996 to 2008 in MÃ©xico City. The susceptibility profile of H. pylori isolates was determined by the E-test strips for each antibiotic (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed a very high proportion of H pylori strains susceptible to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and tetracycline (94.5%, 95%, and 99.5 %, respectively). In contrast, a high proportion (95%) of isolates was resistant to metronidazole. Notably, the proportion of susceptible/resistant strains to the 4 antibiotics over 5 consecutive time periods remained stable over time. Despite a wide use of amoxicillin and clarithromycin in the general population, the H pylori high susceptibility to these 2 antibiotics has been preserved during more than a decade. The high prevalence of resistance to metronidazole in H. pylori strains in our population compromises its use in the empirical treatment of H. pylori infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d709a308603e71090593e57a88c2870501b040a5e47523e44a83e328c2b1acb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
