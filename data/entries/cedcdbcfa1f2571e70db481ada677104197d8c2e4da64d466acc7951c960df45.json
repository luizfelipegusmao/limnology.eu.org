Even slight disruptions in order can greatly affect the properties and behavior of strongly correlated systems such as complex oxides. Measuring order in a robust, statistical manner is notoriously challenging, particularly in the case of nanostructured systems that may contain local, dilute, and aperiodic defects that are difficult to probe using global scattering approaches. Modern scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), with its ability to directly examine lattice structure, chemistry, and composition, can greatly inform order. However, present approaches to data collection and analysis are highly manual, lacking the accuracy and throughput necessary to generate statistically relevant descriptors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cedcdbcfa1f2571e70db481ada677104197d8c2e4da64d466acc7951c960df45","category":"Environment"}
