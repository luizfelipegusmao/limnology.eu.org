{"title":"Evaluating the association between lifetime physical activity and oral squamous cell carcinoma: A case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303929","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Seyyed Abolfazl Tabatabaie-Zadeh, Nazanin Mahdavi, Behnaz Mahdaviani, Maryam Selk-Ghaffari</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Oral cancers are the 6th most common malignancy worldwide and oral squamous cell carcinoma, comprises over 90% of oral cancers. This study investigates the relationship between physical activity level during the lifetime and oral squamous cell carcinoma risk.</p> Methods <p>100 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and 200 healthy individuals participated in this case-control study. Physical activity level was evaluated via the Lifetime Physical Activity Questionnaire. The occupational, household, and sports domains of lifetime physical activity were determined. Case and control groupsâ€™ participants were matched in terms of sex, age, smoking, and alcohol consumption by the Frequency Matching Method. Mann-Whitney U Test was applied to compare physical activity levels between groups.</p> Results <p>The Body Mass Index was higher among cases compared with controls. The average amounts of lifetime physical activity among cases and controls were approximately identical. However, only a statistically significant difference between time spent on total lifetime physical activities and the oral squamous cell carcinoma risk was discovered. Moreover, there were no statistically significant odds ratios in examining the risk associated with each domain of activities.</p> Conclusions <p>The total time spent on lifetime physical activity may decrease the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma; However, the total level and intensity of lifetime physical activity are not significantly associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma risk. Further studies are required in this field.</p>","author":"Seyyed Abolfazl Tabatabaie-Zadeh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3dafce48543a38eef5a325adbc60f6fbf59032ccf6d28d5dddb133bed0dcc27b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
