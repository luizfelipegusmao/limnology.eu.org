{"title":"Correlation between hyperlipidemia-related diseases and thorax/thigh circumference ratio along with Body Condition Score in dogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1967/v1","date":1724840742000,"content":"There are some limitations in using the Body Condition Score (BCS) for client education to prevent obesity, hyperlipidemia-related diseases, and orthopedic diseases in dogs because it is hard to quantify in detail. In small dogs, patellar luxation is a common orthopedic disease that is related to obesity and hind leg muscle. In this study, we evaluated the thorax/thigh circumference ratio as a prognostic evaluation index, along with the BCS, for assessing patellar dislocation and other hyperlipidemia-related diseases. I analyzed eleven client-owned dogs that visited Bundang New York Animal Hospital, South Korea. According to the results, triglycerides (TGs) showed a negative correlation with thorax/thigh value (R = -0.585, p-value = 0.059) and a strong positive correlation with thigh circumference (R = 0.749, p-value = 0.008). Total cholesterol (TC) showed a strong positive correlation with thigh circumference (R = 0.776, p-value = 0.005), whereas the thorax/thigh value showed a negative correlation with the medial patella luxation (MPL) grade with low significance (R = -0.343, p-value = 0.302). These data indicate that thigh circumference can be an excellent negative indicator for hyperlipidemia and thorax/thigh value shows a low correlation with medial patella luxation, which encompasses other factors including varus and trochlear groove, despite the limitations of this study due to the small sample size.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4c5b6ccf2ea24a3bf72d2139bfa3b7781c40fdd26522ee5e2b52a8f0a7381c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
