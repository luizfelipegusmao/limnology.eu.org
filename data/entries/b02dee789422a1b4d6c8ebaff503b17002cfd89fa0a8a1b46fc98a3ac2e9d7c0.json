Key examples are detrital subsidies from the riparian vegetation that form the base of food webs in small streams. Despite the central role of detritivores in these food webs, the consequences of altered riparian vegetation type and resource availability on their trophic strategies are less known.\nTherefore, we experimentally tested direct and indirect effects of riparian vegetation type (i.e. riparian forests present vs. absent) on trophic interactions and dietary imbalances of aquatic detritivores. To characterise trophic strategies, we used stoichiometric and isotopic differences between consumers and resources as functional measures of trophic link strength in leaf litter bags naturally colonised by stream decomposers and detritivores.\nOur results show that an absence of riparian forests affected stoichiometric and isotopic properties in stream detrital food webs. Where local riparian forests were absent, leaf litter showed lower C:N ratios, which only trichopteran detritivores mirrored, whereas plecopteran and crustacean detritivores showed differences in their isotopic signatures. Diverging patterns between resources and consumers could lead to a rewiring of energy flow paths and weaken the coupling between aquatic detritivores and terrestrial detritus.\nConsequently, our findings demonstrate that riparian forests are essential for aquatic food webs by not only influencing organisms themselves but also their trophic interactions and energy flow paths. Aquatic detritivores depending on terrestrial subsidies can be highly sensitive to local changes in their resource environment. Therefore, functionally divergent patterns between resources and consumers in recipient systems highlight how habitat properties of the donor system can affect food webs connected across ecosystem boundaries.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/13/forests-are-essential-for-stream-food-webs/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Rebecca Oester, \nFlorian Altermatt, \nAndreas Bruder","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"b02dee789422a1b4d6c8ebaff503b17002cfd89fa0a8a1b46fc98a3ac2e9d7c0","category":"Environment"}
