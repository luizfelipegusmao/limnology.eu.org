{"title":"Determination of PAH Contamination in Breast Milk Samples from Hungarian Volunteering Mothers, Using HPLC/FLD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2146/v1","date":1727359235000,"content":"(1) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are hazardous organic compounds with known carcinogenic and toxic properties. Exposure to PAHs occurs through various sources, including diet, inhalation, and skin contact, and they can transfer into breast milk following maternal exposure, potentially endangering breastfeeding infants. (2) This study aimed to determine the PAH content in breast milk samples from 50 Hungarian mothers using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC/FLD). The carcinogenic risk to infants was estimated using the Incremental Life Risk Calculation (IRCL) model. (3) Total PAH concentrations ranged from 0 to 78 ng/mL, with fluorene (5.3 ng/mL), phenanthrene (3.2 ng/mL), and pyrene (2.5 ng/mL) being the most abundant. PAHs were detected in 48 of the 50 samples, with phenanthrene present in 92% of samples. Dibenzo (a,h)anthracene was not detected. (4) Based on IRCL calculations, 10% of the samples were classified as safe, while 88% presented an acceptable carcinogenic risk for infants. Statistical analysis of questionnaires completed by the mothers indicated that factors such as diet, residence, and education may influence PAH levels in breast milk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41bd50c7b44302be8f309b0af069d4fffb8c45cefe99dba3b18a267675a8d575","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
