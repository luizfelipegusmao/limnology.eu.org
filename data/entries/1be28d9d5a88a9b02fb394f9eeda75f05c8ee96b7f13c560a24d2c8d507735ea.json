{"title":"Treatment of the fractures of the humeral surgical neck: MIROS versus intramedullary nailing. A retrospective study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0498/v1","date":1725608579000,"content":"The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the clinical outcomes of treating isolated surgical neck fractures of the humerus using either the intramedullary nail or the MIROS (Minimally Invasive Reduction and Osteosynthesis SystemÂ®) system. The study included 42 patients who underwent surgical treatment at the Polyclinic from January 2014 to June 2020. The results indicated that both treatments were effective; however, the MIROS system exhibited a higher complication rate. Intramedullary nailing was more reliable, thus recommended as the primary treatment method. This study underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate fixation technique to minimize complications and enhance patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1be28d9d5a88a9b02fb394f9eeda75f05c8ee96b7f13c560a24d2c8d507735ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
