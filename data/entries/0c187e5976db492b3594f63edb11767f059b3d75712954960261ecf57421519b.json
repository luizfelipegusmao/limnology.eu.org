{"title":"72 Comparison of Myotonic, Kiko, and Spanish Sires for Meat Goat Doe-Kid Traits","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/95/7618006?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Myotonic goats are a small-framed heritage breed known for the condition myotonia congenita which causes a prolonged contraction of their muscles when startled. There is a potential for them to be utilized in commercial meat goat systems within the United States. This study evaluated the effect of Myotonic sires on kid preweaning and doe reproductive traits across a 2-yr period. Myotonic (n = 6) and Kiko (n = 5) sires were bred to a group of 72 Kiko-influenced does and produced 139 kids. Myotonic (n = 6) and Spanish (n = 4) sires were bred to a group of 53 Spanish-influenced does and produced 123 kids. Sire breed comparisons were made within doe group. Kids were weighed at birth and weaning (3 months of age). Within both doe groups, litter size affected (P &lt; 0.05) weaning weight but not birth weight, whereas kid sex influenced (P &lt; 0.05) both birth and weaning weights. Doe age affected (P &lt; 0.05) birth and weaning kid weights in the Kiko group but did not influence (P &gt; 0.05) kid weights within the Spanish group. Myotonic- and Kiko-sired kids did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) for birth (2.81 ± 0.11 vs 2.81 ± 0.11 kg, respectively) and weaning (16.43 ± 0.65 vs. 16.92 ± 0.61 kg, respectively) weights. Likewise, Myotonic- and Spanish-sired kids did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) for birth (2.66 ± 0.13 vs. 2.89 ± 0.13 kg, respectively) and weaning weights (14.96 ± 0.62 vs. 15.37 ± 0.61 kg, respectively). There was no effect (P &gt; 0.05) of sire breed on ADG and survivability among kids within either doe group. Doe age did not influence (P &gt; 0.05) litter weight at birth but did influence (P &lt; 0.05) litter weight at weaning within the Kiko group. Doe age had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on these litter traits within the Spanish group. Myotonic and Kiko sires did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) for birth (4.09 ± 0.25 vs. 4.43 ± 0.25 kg, respectively) and weaning (23.66 ± 1.51 vs. 23.69 ± 1.50 kg, respectively) litter weights. Litter weight at birth did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) for Myotonic and Spanish sires (4.09 ± 0.15 vs. 4.44 ± 0.15 kg, respectively). Myotonic sires produced lighter (P &lt; 0.05) litters at weaning than Spanish sires (21.10 ± 0.79 vs. 23.61 ± 0.92 kg). Service sire breed did not influence (P &gt; 0.05) litter size at birth and weaning nor kidding and weaning rates within either doe group. Sire breed did not consistently affect preweaning kid traits nor doe reproductive traits. Myotonic sires did not significantly reduce birth and weaning kid weights compared with Kiko and Spanish sires in this preliminary study.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0c187e5976db492b3594f63edb11767f059b3d75712954960261ecf57421519b","category":"Environment"}
