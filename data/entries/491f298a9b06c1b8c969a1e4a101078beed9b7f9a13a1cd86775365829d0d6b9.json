{"title":"Evaluation of the Use of Cell Lines in Studies of Selenium-Dependent Glutathione Peroxidase 2 (GPX2) Involvement in Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1727/v2","date":1719933659000,"content":"Hydroperoxides (ROOH) are known as damaging agents capable of mediating mutation, while a role as signaling agents through oxidation of protein sulfhydryls that can alter cancer-related pathways has gained traction. Glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) is an antioxidant enzyme that reduces ROOH at the expense of glutathione (GSH). GPX2 is noted for a tendency of large in-creases or decreases in expression levels during tumorigenesis that leads to investigators focusing on its role in cancer. However, GPX2 is only one component of multiple enzyme families that metabolize ROOH and GPX2 levels are often very low in the context of these other ROOH reducing activities. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was selected as a case study for examining GPX2 function as colorectal tissues and cancers are sites where GPX2 is highly expressed. A case can be made for a significant impact of changes in expression levels. There is also a link between GPX2 and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) from earlier studies that is seldom addressed and is discussed, presenting data on a unique association in colon and CRC. Tumor-derived cell lines are quite commonly used for pre-clinical studies involving the role of GPX2 in CRC. Generally, selection for this type of work is limited to identifying cell lines based on high and low GPX2 expression with the standard re-search scheme of overexpression in low expressing lines and suppression in high expressing lines to identify impacted pathways. This overlooks CRC subtypes among cell lines involving a wide range of gene expression profiles and a variety of driver mutation differences along with a large difference in GPX2 expression levels. A trend for low and high GPX2 expressing cell lines to segregate into different CRC subclasses, indicated in this report, suggests that choices based solely on GPX2 levels may provide misleading and conflicting results by disregarding other properties of cell lines and failing to factor in differences in potential protein targets of ROOH. CRC and cell line classification schemes are presented here that were intended to assist workers in performing pre-clinical studies but are largely unnoted in work on GPX2 and CRC. Studies are often initiated on the premise that the transition from normal to CRC is associated with up-regulation of GPX2. This is probably correct. However, the source normal cells for CRC could be almost any colon cell type, some with very high GPX2 levels. These factors are addressed in this study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"491f298a9b06c1b8c969a1e4a101078beed9b7f9a13a1cd86775365829d0d6b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
