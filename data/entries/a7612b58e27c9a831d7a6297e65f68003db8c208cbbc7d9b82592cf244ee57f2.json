Remarkably, some of the quantum phenomena displayed by these materials now persists at room temperature, opening the way for usable devices. We have done studies for example of TI's such as Ba<sub>6</sub>Nb<sub>11</sub>S<sub>28</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.756-B1\">1</a>]. This material naturally realizes vdW coupled heterointerfaces between transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers (hexagonal NbS<sub>2</sub>, H-NbS<sub>2</sub>) and insulating spacers Ba<sub>3</sub>NbS<sub>5</sub>. Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) taken along the c-axis shows that the hexagonal spacer and TMD layers, are commensurate. The electronic band structure can be understood as that resulting from superimposing a periodic potential defined by Ba<sub>3</sub>NbS<sub>5</sub> onto monolayer H-NbS<sub>2</sub>. This is the mechanism which yields flat energy bands and correlated physics in twisted-bilayer graphene and TMD heterostructures and is one of the key advances in the prediction of band structure and properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a7612b58e27c9a831d7a6297e65f68003db8c208cbbc7d9b82592cf244ee57f2","category":"Environment"}
