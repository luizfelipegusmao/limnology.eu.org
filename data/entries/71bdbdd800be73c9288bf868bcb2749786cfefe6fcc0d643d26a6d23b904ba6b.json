After determining the LC<sub>50</sub> (96 h) value of cypermethrin, cypermethrin was added to the water at a ratio of 1:20 of this concentration, and the fish were fed for 42 days. To reduce the effects of cypermethrin, 1% black cumin oil was added to the fish feed as a potential protectant. Growth parameters, hematology, blood biochemistry, and histopathological changes of Nile tilapia were examined after the feeding period. In this study, the best growth was observed in the group fed with feed containing 1% black cumin oil, while the worst growth performance was observed in the group fed with water containing cypermethrin and without black cumin oil in the feed. As a result of the study, it was observed that black cumin oil added to the fish diet reduced the negative effects of water-borne cypermethrin on growth, hematology, blood biochemistry, and histopathological parameters of Nile tilapia.</p>","author":"Mustafa Öz, \nEnes Üstüner, \nFerhan Bölükbaş","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"71bdbdd800be73c9288bf868bcb2749786cfefe6fcc0d643d26a6d23b904ba6b","category":"Environment"}
