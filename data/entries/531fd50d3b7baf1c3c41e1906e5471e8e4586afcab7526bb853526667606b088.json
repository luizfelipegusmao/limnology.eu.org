{"title":"Comparative in silico and in vitro evaluation of possible toxic effects of bisphenol derivatives in HepG2 cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae127/7731471?rss=1","date":1723334400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Introduction</div>Bisphenols are widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and resin coatings. Bisphenol A (BPA) is suggested to cause a wide range of unwanted effects and “low dose toxicity”. With the search for alternative substances to BPA, the use of other bisphenol derivatives namely bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) has increased.<div>Methods</div>In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the in silico predicted inhibitory concentration 50s (pIC50s) of bisphenol derivatives on immune and apoptotic markers and DNA damage on HepG2 cells. Moreover, apoptotic, genotoxic and immunotoxic effects of BPA, BPF and BPS were determined comparatively. Effects of bisphenols on apoptosis were evaluated by detecting different caspase activities. The genotoxic effects of bisphenols were evaluated by measuring the levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1). To determine the immunotoxic effect of bisphenol derivatives, the levels of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are known to be expressed by HepG2 cells, were measured. Results: In silico data indicate that all of the bisphenols may cause alterations in immune and apoptotic markers as well as DNA damage at low doses. İn vitro data revealed that all bisphenol derivatives could affect immune markers at inhibitory concentration 30s (IC<sub>30</sub>s). In addition, BPF and BPS may also have apoptotic immunotoxic effects.<div>Conclusion</div>Both in silico and in vivo research are needed further to examine the toxic effects of alternative bisphenol derivatives.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"531fd50d3b7baf1c3c41e1906e5471e8e4586afcab7526bb853526667606b088","category":"Environment"}
