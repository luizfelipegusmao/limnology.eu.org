{"title":"Segmenting Tumor Gleason Pattern using Generative AI and Digital Pathology: Use Case of Prostate Cancer on MICCAI Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2019/v1","date":1719555803000,"content":"Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second most fatal and sixth most prevalent cancer among males globally. This study focuses on leveraging deep learning networks to detect the Gleason grading of prostate cancer from histopathology images stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;amp;E). Six pathologists annotated the images, resulting in six distinct labels for each input image. A common ground truth label was established through majority voting approach. Subsequently, the dataset was trained using architectures: UNeT, UNeT++, DeepLabV3, DeepLabV3+, and GAN based segmentation network. Notably, GAN based network demonstrated superior performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.872 and a Jaccard Index of 0.777, outperforming the other architectures considered in this study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63e5a2b78fb947325fe91ec7abfbb40b7f17bd69b051b329577e9f5bace136c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
