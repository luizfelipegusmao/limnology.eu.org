{"title":"Synthesis and physical investigation of Al doped La2O3 thin films for wettability applications","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14354?af=R","date":1706249153000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this work, aluminum doped La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films deposited by the spray pyrolysis technique, are investigated by many characterization techniques. First, XRD spectra reveal the presence of two phases. A dominant cubic phase is obtained for pure La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with (220) preferential orientation. The second hexagonal phase with (004) orientation is present in all doped samples. It is found that Al doping induces a perovskite crystalline structure identified as lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO<sub>3</sub>). Second, FTIR spectra include the main peaks of La-O bonds related to La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> structure. Photoluminescence (PL) shows a good enhancement by Al doping related to LaAlO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. Finally, the surface wettability measurements corroborate the hydrophobic character of all doped samples.</p>","author":"Rabia Jbeli, \nYoussef Dabaki, \nNazar Elamin Ahmed, \nI.
