{"title":"Enhancing drug therapy in ostomy patients: Best practice recommendations for medication management","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305047","date":1717682400000,"content":"<p>by Vivien Berger, Matthias Reeh, Martin Scherer, Steffen Härterich, Sven Möller, Eva-Maria Anette Wansing, Annika van der Linde, Claudia Langebrake</p>\r\nBackground <p>Ostomy surgery is a common procedure that poses various challenges for patients and healthcare professionals. There are numerous guidelines addressing different ostomy-related problems (ORPs) and supporting an interdisciplinary approach for ostomy care, but evidence-based literature for optimizing drug therapy after ostomy surgery is lacking.</p> Aim <p>To investigate and characterize typical ORPs in relation to drug therapy and provide best practice recommendations from a pharmaceutical point of view.</p> Methods <p>Patients with an ileo- or colostomy were consecutively enrolled in a prospective, interventional monocentric cohort study during hospitalization, with particular attention to medication. A clinical pharmacist assessed DRPs by performing level 3 medication reviews and patient interviews. Pharmacists’ interventions (PIs) were evaluated by two senior clinical pharmacists and documented in DokuPIK (Documentation of Pharmacists’ Interventions in the Hospital). Following interdisciplinary discussions, physicians either accepted or rejected the proposed changes in drug therapy. Comparisons were made between ileostomy and colostomy patients regarding type and extent of PIs.</p> Results <p>Out of the 80 patients included in the cohort, 54 (67.5%) had an ileostomy and 26 (32.5%) a colostomy. In this study, 288 PIs were documented (234 ileostomy <i>vs</i>. 54 colostomy), of wich 94.0% were accepted and implemented by the physicians. The most common reason for PIs in both subgroups (29.6% ileostomy <i>vs</i>. 26.1% colostomy) was a missing drug although indicated (e.g. no loperamide, but high stoma output). The proportion of PIs associated with the ostomy was higher in ileostomy patients (48.3% ileostomy <i>vs</i>. 31.5% colostomy; p = 0.025). Typical ORPs were extracted and analyzed as case studies including recommendations for their respective management and prevention.</p> Conclusion <p>This study highlights the importance of clinical pharmacists being a part of interdisciplinary teams to collaboratively improve ostomy care and patient safety. Especially ileostomy patients are more vulnerable for ORPs in the context of drug therapy and need to be monitored carefully.</p>","author":"Vivien Berger","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f717974bb922c6f53898a713081105535fb82031569ac4c3d4591fdeefad5894","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
