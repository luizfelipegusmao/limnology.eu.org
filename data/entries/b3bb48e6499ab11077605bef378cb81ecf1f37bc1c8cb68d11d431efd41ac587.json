{"title":"Cardiovascular Aging in HIV Infection: Analysis\nof Involved Genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0370/v1","date":1717666496000,"content":"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has transitioned from a progressive, fatal disease to a chronic, manageable disease thanks to better defining of antiretroviral therapy, hence contributing to increased life expectancy. In parallel, a growing number of subjects without overt clinical signs of disease but living with chronic HIV infection (people living with HIV, PLWH) are experiencing early cardiovascular disease worldwide. However, a progressive increase in the prevalence of multiple comorbid diseases has been reported as these patients age, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular mortality can be either directly related to the viral infection, a progressive reduction of response to the antiretroviral therapy, chronic inflammation or lifestyle-related. Cardiovascular ageing represents a relevant issue in the management of HIV-infected patients. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanism that leads PLWH to develop cardiovascular disease is not entirely understood, there is substantial evidence that they accumulate age-related conditions earlier than the general population. Furthermore, since the proportion of PLWH growing older than 50 years has progressively increased, this results in a complex interaction between disease-related pathophysiology and the exposition of a growing burden of cardiovascular risk factors. For this reason, we performed a systematic review of the genes most frequently associated with ageing in HIV-infected subjects, followed by a bioinformatic analysis to explore the biological impact of the genes related to ageing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3bb48e6499ab11077605bef378cb81ecf1f37bc1c8cb68d11d431efd41ac587","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
