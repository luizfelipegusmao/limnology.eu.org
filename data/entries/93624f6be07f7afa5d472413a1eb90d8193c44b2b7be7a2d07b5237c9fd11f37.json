{"title":"Effects of rosmarinic acid on immune response and intestinal microbiota in ovalbumin‐induced intestinal allergy mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13192?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an active polyphenol that is widely found in various edible herbs. This study explored the potential anti-allergic activities and the underlying mechanisms of RA in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced intestinal allergic mice.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Forty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, model group (OVA sensitized/challenged), RA-Low group (OVA sensitized/challenged, 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RA intervention), RA-Middle group (OVA sensitized/challenged, 90 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RA intervention) and RA-High group (OVA sensitized/challenged, 270 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> RA intervention). RA effectively attenuated allergic reactions, including alleviating allergic symptoms and regulating the hypothermia of mice in the model group. Moreover, the anaphylactic mediator (OVA-specific IgE, histamine and mMCP-1) levels of OVA allergic mice were markedly decreased after RA intervention. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that RA significantly inhibited Th2 cytokine expression, while Th1 and Treg cytokines were markedly increased. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that RA effectively regulated the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiota in OVA allergic mice. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were altered by RA intervention. At the genus level, RA was found to regulate the disturbances in the relative abundance of <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Prevotella</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>RA exhibited potential anti-allergic activity in OVA allergic mice by regulating hypersensitive immune responses and the intestinal microbiota structure. These results provide important evidence that RA can be developed into a novel functional food-derived ingredient against food allergy. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Qing Yang, \nBinmei Jia, \nJieli Shang, \nXuanpei Wang, \nLin Xu, \nXin Liu, \nMin Fang, \nFengbo Zeng, \nHao‐Long Zeng, \nZhiyong Gong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"93624f6be07f7afa5d472413a1eb90d8193c44b2b7be7a2d07b5237c9fd11f37","category":"Environment"}
