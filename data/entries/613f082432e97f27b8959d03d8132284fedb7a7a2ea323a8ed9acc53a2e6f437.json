This study is based on the theories of banking business models, stakeholder theory, risk management theory, and ESG investment theory. It uses the financial data and ESG scores of Chinese listed banks to deeply analyze the ESG factors and explore their impact on the liquidity risk of commercial banks. The research found that (1) good ESG performance can reduce the liquidity risk commercial banks face by improving bank value and financial performance. (2) ESG factors can also enhance the liquidity management level of commercial banks through standardization and sustainable business principles, thereby reducing the occurrence and impact of liquidity risk. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the liquidity risk of banks and promote the sustainable development of commercial banks from four aspects: ESG performance and management, bank value, financial performance, and policy regulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"613f082432e97f27b8959d03d8132284fedb7a7a2ea323a8ed9acc53a2e6f437","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
