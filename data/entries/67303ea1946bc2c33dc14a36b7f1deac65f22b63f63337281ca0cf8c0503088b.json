{"title":"Breeding phase and outcome determine space use in European rollers Coracias garrulus prior to migration","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/70/2/137/7056770?rss=1","date":1677196800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The breeding period is a demanding and time-constrained phase for migratory bird species. Breeding outcome and duration can interact with the extent and duration of post-breeding movements, resulting in individual differences in space use ultimately influencing later stages of the annual cycle. We present space-use and home range estimates during the breeding season for 21 European rollers <span>Coracias garrulus</span> tracked between 2018 and 2022, in Italy and Croatia. Using high-resolution spatial GPS data coupled with regular nest-box monitoring, we analyzed differences in space use during the incubation/nestling period versus post-breeding period prior to migration, accounting for the breeding outcome (successful vs. failure). We found that adult movements were strongly reduced during the first phase, whereas increased in the post-breeding phase, especially for failed breeders. Successful breeders remained in the surroundings of the nest site, whereas unsuccessful ones tended to abandon the nest and visit distant areas (up to 500 km) for long periods (60.5 ± 6.2 days). Breeding outcome did not influence the departure date of autumn migration, suggesting that failed breeders used this period for exploratory movements but not for advancing the onset of migration. Such exploratory movements may be functional to prospect and inform settlement decisions in failed breeders in search of new breeding opportunities and may be particularly important in migratory species, which generally have a limited period to gather information prior to autumn migration. The study demonstrates the need to investigate seasonal movements in different populations and the potential importance of prospecting post-breeding movements for long-distance migratory species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"67303ea1946bc2c33dc14a36b7f1deac65f22b63f63337281ca0cf8c0503088b","category":"Environment"}
