{"title":"Are integrated care models associated with improved drug safety in Swiss primary care? an observational analysis using healthcare claims data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311099","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Renato Farcher, Sereina M. Graber, Stefan Boes, Carola A. Huber</p>\r\nBackground <p>Integrated care models (ICMs) might be an effective strategy to improve patients’ quality of care. The aim of this study was to compare different ICMs such as family-doctor models, and a standard care model (SCM) regarding patients’ drug safety in Swiss primary care.</p> Methods <p>We performed an observational study using health insurance claims data from patients who were continuously enrolled in an ICM or in a SCM between 2020 and 2021. ICMs included family-doctor model (FDM), family-doctor model light (FDM-light) and the telemedicine model (TM). Drug safety was assessed by the prescription of potentially inappropriate proton pump-inhibitors (PIPPI), opioids (PIO), medications (PIM), and polypharmacy. Propensity-score-weighted multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between different types of ICMs and drug safety.</p> Results <p>Patients in FDM had significantly lower odds of receiving PIPPI (OR, 0.86; CI 95%, 0.83–0.89), PIO (OR, 0.81; CI 95%, 0.76–0.85), PIM (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.91–0.97), and polypharmacy (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.91–0.97) compared to patients in SCM. Potentially inappropriate prescribing was also lower in patients in TM and partly in FDM-light than in SCM. Persons enrolled in FDM were less likely to receive PIM (OR, 0.93; CI 95%, 0.89–0.97) and polypharmacy (OR, 0.94; CI 95%, 0.90–0.99) than those in FDM-light, whereas the odds of receiving PIPPI and polypharmacy were higher in FDM than in TM.</p> Conclusion <p>ICMs were significantly associated with higher drug safety compared to SCM for most outcomes. Findings suggest that patients may benefit most from ICMs with a high degree of coordination or gatekeeping. ICM may represent an effective approach to improve patients’ drug safety and, thus, to reduce the risk of adverse events.</p>","author":"Renato Farcher","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6568ee7c5d48f6bac221020162e1f861d7680381305c2eb470f5669f8e0dbd26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
