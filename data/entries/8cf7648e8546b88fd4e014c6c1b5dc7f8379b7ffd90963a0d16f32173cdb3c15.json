{"title":"Background selection for camouflage shifts in accordance with color change in an intertidal prawn","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae060/7721689?rss=1","date":1722038400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To maximize camouflage across visually heterogeneous habitats, animals have evolved a variety of strategies, including polyphenism, color change, and behavioral background matching. Despite the expected importance of behavioral processes for mediating camouflage, such as selection for matching substrates, behavior has received less attention than color traits themselves, and interactions between color change and behavior are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated behavioral background matching in green and red chameleon prawns (<span>Hippolyte varians</span>) over the course of a color change experiment. Prawns were housed on mismatching green and red seaweeds for 30 days and periodically given a choice test between the same seaweeds in y-choice trials over the experiment. We found that, as prawns change color and improve camouflage (to the perspective of a fish predator), there is a reinforcing shift in behavior. That is, as prawns shift from red to green color, or vice versa, their seaweed color preference follows this. We provide key empirical evidence that plasticity of appearance (color) is accompanied by a plastic shift in behavior (color preference) that reinforces camouflage in a color changing species on its natural substrate. Overall, our research highlights how short-term plasticity of behavior and longer-term color change act in tandem to maintain crypsis over time.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"8cf7648e8546b88fd4e014c6c1b5dc7f8379b7ffd90963a0d16f32173cdb3c15","category":"Environment"}
