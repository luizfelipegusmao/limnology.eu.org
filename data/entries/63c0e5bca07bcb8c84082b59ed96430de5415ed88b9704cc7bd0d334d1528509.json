{"title":"Investigating the Performance of Glass Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) in the Marine Environment for Tidal Energy: Velocity, Particle Size, Impact Angle and Exposure Time Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1534/v1","date":1724298329000,"content":"Tidal energy, with its potential to provide a consistent energy output and reduce carbon emis-sions, has garnered significant interest. This study, which is the first to evaluate the performance of tidal turbines in seawater conditions involving sand particles, presents a novel approach. A slurry rig was developed to examine composite materials, and a glass fibre reinforcement poly-meric material was tested over a range of particle size, velocity, impact angle, and exposure time. The results, which show significant changes in the mass loss materials as a function of these variables, have profound implications for the design and performance of tidal turbines. The study also utilized a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and depth profiling analysis, and erosion maps were generated to demonstrate the changes in erosion mechanisms. These tools can be used to optimize such materials in tidal turbine conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63c0e5bca07bcb8c84082b59ed96430de5415ed88b9704cc7bd0d334d1528509","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
