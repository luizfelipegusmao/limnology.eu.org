{"title":"Simulation of Industrial Psychology Adopting an Entrepreneurial Mindset within the Green Entrepreneurship Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1509/v1","date":1724222403000,"content":"The adoption of an entrepreneurial mindset within the lenses of green entrepreneurship contributes to negotiating a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach by intertwining industrial psychology and industrial engineering through [system dynamics] which forms part of the paper's focus. The methodology used in this study is a system dynamics methodology using data readily available online with a focus on quantitative methodology. This study's dynamic variable and the causal loop are formulated using the Euler mathematical equation with support from the Vensim modelling software (academic purposes license). Results and variables simulated in the current study are entrepreneurial mindsets [through subfield of education, values, intentions and gender representation] contribution and the conclusion is explained towards the end of the paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db811cf695581af2aa0dba6a9a24ebc2d54c2950b8238b501423993119a299b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
