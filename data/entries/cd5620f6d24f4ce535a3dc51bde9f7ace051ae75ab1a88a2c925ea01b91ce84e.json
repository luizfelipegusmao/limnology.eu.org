However, the way in which cell wall establishment is regulated by ethylene remains largely elusive. Here, by analyzing cell wall patterns, cell wall composition and gene expression in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>, L.) roots, we found that ethylene induces cell wall thickening and the expression of cell wall synthesis-related genes, including <span>CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE C1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>10</span> (<span>OsCSLC1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>10</span>) and <span>CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>9</span> (<span>OsCESA3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>9</span>). Overexpression and mutant analyses revealed that OsCSLC2 and its homologs function in ethylene-mediated induction of xyloglucan biosynthesis mainly in the cell wall of root epidermal cells. Moreover, OsCESA-catalyzed cellulose deposition in the cell wall was enhanced by ethylene. OsCSLC-mediated xyloglucan biosynthesis likely plays an important role in restricting cell wall extension and cell elongation during the ethylene response in rice roots. Genetically, <span>OsCSLC2</span> acts downstream of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (OsEIL1)-mediated ethylene signaling, and <span>OsCSLC1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>9</span> are directly activated by OsEIL1. Furthermore, the auxin signaling pathway is synergistically involved in these regulatory processes. These findings link plant hormone signaling with cell wall establishment, broadening our understanding of root growth plasticity in rice and other crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cd5620f6d24f4ce535a3dc51bde9f7ace051ae75ab1a88a2c925ea01b91ce84e","category":"Environment"}
