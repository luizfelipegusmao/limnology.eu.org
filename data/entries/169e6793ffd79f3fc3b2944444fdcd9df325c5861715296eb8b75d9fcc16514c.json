{"title":"Critical infrastructures in an Informal Settlement of Maputo City, Mozambique: The Special Importance of Sectors Interdependencies for Interventions Prioritization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0105/v1","date":1725289283000,"content":"In Africa, the urban population and informal settlements are increasing, resulting in additional public health and environmental risks and challenges related to the need of basic and sustainable infrastructures and services. In Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, at least 80% of the city is composed of informal settlements, and although some areas are regularized and have approved urbanization plans, the municipality has major deficiencies in meeting current demands in terms of basic infrastructures, such as water supply, sewerage, solid wastes, energy, roads and communications. Most of the peri-urban areas is occupied with small but overcrowding houses, mostly self-built, served by unpaved roads, and with access limitations. The water network is almost non-existent, and the same occurs for stormwater drainage, sanitation, waste collection and public illumination. Despite the improvements made in the last few years, some households still do not have safe sanitation, and in some neighborhoods, open defecation still prevails. In this study, the authors try to understand and explore the interdependences among the infrastructures of the different sectors and how they may jointly contribute for adequate services and a better life of the urban poor, and how to identify the combination of infrastructures to be implemented at short term in face of the limited budgets for investments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"169e6793ffd79f3fc3b2944444fdcd9df325c5861715296eb8b75d9fcc16514c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
