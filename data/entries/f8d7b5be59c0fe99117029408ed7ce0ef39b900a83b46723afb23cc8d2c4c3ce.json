{"title":"Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems: A Review and Future Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1150/v1","date":1726449639000,"content":"Rapid urbanisation and city expansion worldwide have significantly increased impervious surfaces such as roads, buildings, and pavements. These impervious surfaces impede water infiltration into the ground, resulting in escalated surface runoff during rainfall. This has been exacerbated by climate change and heightened precipitation levels, resulting in recurrent annual flooding. Conventional drainage systems are now insufficient to cope with the amplified surface runoff, contributing to the escalating flood occurrences. Sustainable urban drainage systems such as green roofs, swales, and permeable pavements were developed as modern flood control techniques to replace the traditional drainage system approach by optimising resource utilisation and developing novel and more productive technologies. While most SUD techniques are sustainable in design, construction, and operation, permeable pavements are considered one of the least sustainable SUD techniques. This has garnered considerable attention from researchers who have been studying the design of a more sustainable permeable pavement system by utilising sustainable and recycled materials. This paper reviews the performance of permeable pavements systems using findings from extensive reviews and analyses of scientific publications on permeable pavements. It introduces a future solution and design of permeable pavements using recycled materials. The study will consist of two permeable pavement systems, one incorporating recycled materials in its layers and the other using traditional construction materials. The data collected from both systems will be compared to determine their performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8d7b5be59c0fe99117029408ed7ce0ef39b900a83b46723afb23cc8d2c4c3ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
