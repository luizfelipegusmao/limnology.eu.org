{"title":"Extrarenal Visceral Arteries Injuries During Left Radical Nephrectomy: A 50-Year Continuing Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1408/v1","date":1726708753000,"content":"Due to their close anatomical and spatial relationships with left renal hilum, both superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk injuries continue to be reported during left radical nephrectomy, either through an open, laparoscopic or robotic approach. The aim of this review, 50 years after the first reported cases, is to highlight anatomical and pathophysiological basis, risk factors, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for dealing with these injuries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"641415bfdbc7e27dd9723109ff6b5975f80527d4fcd3620496eaa3d6363c6ac3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
