Due to the increasing amount of construction waste, recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is being considered by more people. However, although RAC has more points, the performance is inferior to natural aggregate concrete (NAC). To narrow or address this gap, lightweight, high-strength and corrosion-resistant CFRP can be used, also protecting the steel flange of the PEC structure. Therefore, carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) confined partially encased recycled coarse aggregate concrete columns were studied in this paper. With respect to different slenderness ratios, recycled coarse aggregate(RCA) replacement ratios, and number of CFRP layers, the performance of the proposed CFRP restrained columns are reported. The RCA replacement ratio is analyzed to be limited negative impact on the bearing capacity, generally within 6%. As for the slenderness ratio, the bearing capacity increased with it. However, wrapping CFRP significantly increased the bearing capacity. Considering the arch factor, a simple formula for calculating the ultimate strength of CFRP-confined partially encased RAC columns is developed based on EC4 and GB50017-2017. By comparison with the experimental values, the error is within 10%.","author":"Yunchen Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"310bfe67c1f77e1fc1b70d915235860c046aa3d0c08c6d0e7de107ec18414844","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
