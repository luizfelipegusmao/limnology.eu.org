{"title":"435 Use of plant bioactives to improve the efficiency of rumen function","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/180/7757394?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant bioactives, also known as phytogenics or phytobiotics, are secondary metabolites of plant origin that are deployed as host-defense mechanisms against predators or to enable them to be more competitive in their environment. These metabolites also regulate growth and reproductive functions in the plant. They can be grouped into three major classes: terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and alkaloids. Various studies have shown their worth in improving livestock production and health via insectifugal, organoleptic and enhanced rumen functions. Ruminants are critical to food security because they are able to convert poor-quality feed materials into nutritious products like meat. The rumen provides temporary storage of feed but serves the main function of digesting those complex materials through symbiotic relationships among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms within the rumen vat. Antimicrobial resistance and other health or social license challenges have led researchers to find acceptable replacements that will not exacerbate the health and social issues in animals and humans. Plant bioactives appeal to producers because of the ‘natural’ brand and because they are usually certified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Anecdotal reports from input companies show an increased demand for mineral supplements infused with phytogenics. The complex chemical compositions of these products appear to make them less prone to developing resistance by microorganisms. Phytogenics research has been further catalyzed by government legislation that has banned the use of medically important antibiotics to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance. Potential improvements in livestock productivity are associated with mechanisms such as enhanced nutrient utilization, increased digestibility, modified digestive secretions or altered microbial communities. These benefits contribute to the increasing use of these phytogenics by livestock producers to keep their animals healthy and productive while enhancing the profitability of their operations. We will examine the different bioactives and their applications in improving the efficiency of the rumen function. Some commercial products in the Canadian market will be presented. Other research trials showcasing their potential benefits to rumen health and general animal productivity will also be discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d28232bcb2fd5ea56c3a8183d4c573d839a4d418df4bce2ee4a301dc46541042","category":"Environment"}
