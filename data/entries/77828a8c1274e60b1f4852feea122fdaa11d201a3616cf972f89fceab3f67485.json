{"title":"Sensitivity of Dynamic Stall Models to Dynamic Excitation on Large-Flexible Wind Turbine Blades in Edgewise Vibrations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1620/v1","date":1726829083000,"content":"The present studies are specifically aimed at investigating the sensitivity of different dynamic stall models when exposed to various excitation frequencies targeted at the blade edgewise vibrations. The work is done on a modified version of the IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine employing a wind turbine design tool Bladed. The state-of-the-art dynamic stall models for wind turbine applications such as the ye model, Beddoes-Leishman (BL) model and the newly developed IAG model are evaluated. The beginning of the research work starts by evaluating different dynamic stall model effects on rigid blade section forces against known airfoil datasets. Then, the blade flexibility is considered to enable systematic evaluations of the blade flexibility influences in comparison to the rigid blade cases. It is observed that the range of the angle of attack grows depending on the excitation frequency and the adopted dynamic stall model. The critical excitation frequency range and the effects of twist distribution are then identified from the studies, which can be useful as a rough guidance when designing wind turbine blades.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77828a8c1274e60b1f4852feea122fdaa11d201a3616cf972f89fceab3f67485","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
