For instance, it has been shown that Au-Pd nanoparticles can improve the selectivity for the hydrogenation of alkynes compared to pure Pd particles [<a href=\"#ozae044.834-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.834-B4\">4</a>]. However, it has been shown that the catalytic properties of Au-Pd nanoparticles can be substantially changed upon oxidation or reduction pretreatment. This is due to the dynamic restructuring effects of the Au-Pd particles in a gaseous environment, as changes in composition, morphology, and valence state can modify its catalytic properties. Thus, a detailed characterization of Au-Pd in a reactive environment is needed to better understand the origin of their functionality and improve the rational design of Au-Pd systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ec319841e70509459f48d089fc74e8a718c1218874b81753a39ef6dbbaf40c5d","category":"Environment"}
