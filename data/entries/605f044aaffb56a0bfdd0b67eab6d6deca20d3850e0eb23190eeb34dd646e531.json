Advances in deep learning have enabled automated analysis of these signals. However, the effectiveness of deep learning models depends heavily on the quality of signal preprocessing. This study evaluates the impact of different windowing techniques applied to Fourier Transform-preprocessed ECG signals on the classification accuracy of deep learning models. (2) Methods: We applied three windowing techniques—Hamming, Hann, and Blackman—to transform ECG signals into the frequency domain. A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to classify the ECG signals into five arrhythmia categories based on features extracted from each windowed signal.(3) Results: The Blackman window yielded the highest classification accuracy, with improved signal-to-noise ratio and reduced spectral leakage compared to the Hamming and Hann windows. (4) Conclusions: The choice of windowing technique significantly influences the effectiveness of deep learning models in ECG classification. Future studies should explore additional preprocessing methods and their clinical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"605f044aaffb56a0bfdd0b67eab6d6deca20d3850e0eb23190eeb34dd646e531","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
