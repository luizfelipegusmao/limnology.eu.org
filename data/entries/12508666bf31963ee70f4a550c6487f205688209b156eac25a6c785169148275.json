{"title":"Replacing alfalfa hay with a novel alfalfa leaf pellet product (ProLEAF MAX) and/or alfalfa stems (ProFiber Plus) in the diet of developing dairy heifers alters dry matter intake, but does not negatively impact growth or development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae038/7632050?rss=1","date":1710806400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Alfalfa is a commonly grown forage in the Intermountain West region of the United States and is often included in the diet of dairy cattle. Alfalfa provides a variety of different nutrients, but the nutrient content of alfalfa varies depending on factors such as the soil, region, cutting, and climate. However, alfalfa leaves tend to have less variation in their nutrient content than alfalfa stems. Fractionating alfalfa may be one way to improve control of nutrients provided when developing a ration for developing dairy heifers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether including fractionated alfalfa in the diet impacts the growth or conception rates of developing dairy heifers. Heifers were allocated to one of three treatments: a control group fed a typical diet (<strong>CON</strong>; <span>n</span> = 8), a diet that replaced alfalfa with fractionated alfalfa leaf pellets and alfalfa stems (ProLEAF MAX + ProFiber Plus; <strong>PLM</strong> + <strong>PFP</strong>; <span>n</span> = 8), or a diet that replaced alfalfa with alfalfa stems (<strong>PFP</strong>; <span>n</span> = 8) for 85 d. Heifers were fed individually twice daily and weight, hip height (<strong>HH</strong>), and wither height (<strong>WH</strong>) were recorded every 14 d. Additionally, blood was collected every 28 d, and conception rates were recorded at the end of the trial. Heifers receiving the PFP diet consumed less dry matter (<span>P</span> = 0.001) than the CON treatment. Analyses were then conducted to determine nutrient intake and heifers receiving the PFP diet also consumed less neutral detergent fiber (<span>P</span> = 0.02), acid detergent fiber (<span>P</span> = 0.02), crude protein (<span>P</span> = 0.001), and net energy for maintenance (<span>P</span> = 0.001) than heifers consuming the CON diet; however, no differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) were observed between heifers fed the CON and PLM + PFP diets. Analysis of body weight gain over the feeding period showed no difference (<span>P</span> = 0.52) among heifers consuming the different treatment diets. Additionally, treatment did not affect average daily gain (<span>P</span> = 0.49), gain:feed (<span>P</span> = 0.82), HH gain (<span>P</span> = 0.20), or WH gain (<span>P</span> = 0.44) among heifers receiving different diets. Treatment × time altered (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) blood urea nitrogen when analyzed as a repeated measure. Total feed cost was lowest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) for the PFP diet and cost of gain tended (<span>P</span> = 0.09) to be increased for the PLM + PFP diet compared to the CON diet. Overall, these data indicate that including alfalfa stems in a developing heifer diet may decrease dry matter intake, lower input costs, and increase profitability, without negatively impacting growth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"12508666bf31963ee70f4a550c6487f205688209b156eac25a6c785169148275","category":"Environment"}
