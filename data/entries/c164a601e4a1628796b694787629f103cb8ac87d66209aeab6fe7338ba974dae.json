{"title":"Immature development and adult longevity of the soybean tentiform leafminer (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/723/7699395?rss=1","date":1719360000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The leaf-mining microlepidopteran, <span>Macrosaccus morrisella</span> (Fitch) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), has emerged as a new pest of soybean, <span>Glycine max</span> (L.) Merrill (Fabales: Fabaceae), in Canada and the United States, but little is known about its life history traits. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the immature developmental rate of <span>M. morrisella</span>, from egg to adult emergence, on soybean at different temperatures, and the longevity of adults supplied with water and/or honey at different temperatures. The time to 50% emergence of adults was 71.90, 36.33, 24.62, and 17.83 days at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C, respectively. The lower developmental threshold of <span>M. morrisella</span> was estimated at 8.96 °C, with 425.04 degree-days required for egg-to-adult development. For adult longevity, time to 50% mortality at 25 °C was 15.00, 4.00, and 2.00 days when adults were provided with 25% (v/v) honey–water solution, water, or nothing, respectively. In a follow-up experiment, time to 50% mortality at 25 °C was 24.00, 6.00, 3.00, and 3.00 days when adults were provided with honey and water (offered separately), honey, water, or nothing, respectively, with a synergistic effect when honey and water were offered simultaneously as opposed to honey or water alone. Finally, when fed 25% (v/v) honey–water solution and maintained at 20, 25, and 30 °C, time to 50% mortality of adults was 26.50, 15.00, and 15.00 days. These results inform the understanding of the basic biology of <span>M. morrisella</span> and will help inform the future development of management programs for this insect in soybean.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"c164a601e4a1628796b694787629f103cb8ac87d66209aeab6fe7338ba974dae","category":"Environment"}
