{"title":"Differences in bacterial community composition between fish-stocked and fishless lakes from an arid Patagonian plateau","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05622-2","date":1719878400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Bacterial community composition (BCC) can be modulated by different indirect and direct factors. The Strobel Lake Plateau (Patagonia, Argentina) holds natural fishless lakes. Fish introduction in some of these lakes has affected the structure of their zooplankton, phytoplankton and autotrophic picoplankton communities, whereas its effects on bacterioplankton are unknown. Hence, we analyzed BCC to assess the potential effect of fish introduction on this community in lakes of this region. We sampled fishless and fish-stocked lakes during three summer campaigns and analyzed the BCC. Our results revealed a contrasting arrangement in the main limnological variables and significant differences in the BCC between fishless and stocked lakes. In fish-stocked lakes, Alphaproteobacteria class had a higher proportion and SAR11_cladeIII was the most abundant amplicon sequence variant (ASV); these lakes also showed a marginally higher mean richness but less exclusive ASVs. Environmental and biotic factors contributed to explain BCC variations. The lower percentage of exclusive ASVs and the closer BCC ordination in a non-metric multidimensional scaling suggest a homogenizing effect in fish-stocked lakes. This study contributes to understand the consequences of fish introduction on the plankton communities in lakes of this invaluable region for biodiversity conservation.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"8b307b05c4fe8dc283e44e93bcd164b3a6a698fbf462ab53a91459941dd54b76","category":"Environment"}
