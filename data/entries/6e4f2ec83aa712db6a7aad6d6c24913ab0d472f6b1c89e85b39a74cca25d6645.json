{"title":"The Correlations Between Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and Electrocardiographic Parameters in Predicting the Outcome after Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1171/v1","date":1718632290000,"content":"(1) Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is essential for patients with heart failure and ventricular conduction abnormalities. Cardiomyopathy often includes left bundle branch block (LBBB) marked by delayed activation of the LV lateral wall and a widened QRS complex. Following CRT, patients with heart failure and LBBB have better outcomes and quality of life improvements. Various electrocardiographic and clinical parameters are thought to predict this improvement. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a reliable tool for measuring the quality of life in these patients. (2) Methods: We performed an observational prospective study over 69 individuals diagnosed with cardiac failure and dilatative cardiomyopathy with low FE and major LBBB and analyzed the correlations between patient outcomes after the procedure and the demographic, clinical, and electrocardiographic parameters, which include systolic blood pressure, ECG morphology elements, QRS duration, QRS area and associated comorbidities. (3) Results: Following our analysis a correlation between QRS area, intraprocedural systolic blood pressure, QRS duration and CRT outcomes assessed by the KCCQ score was observed which reflected that CRT has a hemodynamic impact and also affects the severity of ventricular asynchrony.; (4) Conclusions: The significant correlations observed with the KCCQ score show how CRT therapy impacts patients' quality of life, symptom burden, and functional status.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e4f2ec83aa712db6a7aad6d6c24913ab0d472f6b1c89e85b39a74cca25d6645","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
