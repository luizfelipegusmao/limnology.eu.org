{"title":"Unravelling the Triad of Lung Cancer, Drug Resistance, and Metabolic Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1759/v1","date":1711618077000,"content":"Abstract: Lung cancer, characterized by its heterogeneity, presents a significant challenge in ther-apeutic management, primarily due to the development of resistance to conventional drugs. This resistance is often compounded by the tumourâ€™s ability to reprogram its metabolic pathways, a survival strategy that enables cancer cells to thrive in adverse conditions. This review article ex-plores the complex link between drug resistance and metabolic reprogramming in lung cancer, offering a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms and treatment strategies. It emphasizes the interplay between drug resistance and changes in metabolic pathways, crucial for developing effective lung cancer therapies. The review examines the impact of current treatments on metabolic pathways and the significance of considering metabolic factors to combat drug resistance. It highlights the different challenges and metabolic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer, underlining the need for subtype-specific treatments. Key signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK, and AMPK, have been discussed for their roles in promoting drug resistance and metabolic changes, alongside the complex regulatory networks involved. The article evaluates emerging treatments targeting metabolism, such as metabolic inhibitors, dietary management, and combination therapies, assessing their potential and challenges. It concludes with insights into the role of precision medicine and metabolic biomarkers in crafting personalized lung cancer treatments, advocating for metabolic targeting as a promising approach to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance. The review underscores ongoing advancements and hurdles in integrating metabolic considerations into lung cancer therapy strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"082184e902296c19451ec6bf332d3541d73e630cf8e3639bfba0b1098b2c1ca9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
