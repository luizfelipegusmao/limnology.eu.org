{"title":"Removal of organic pollutants by subcritical water under moderate conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0004/v1","date":1717408116000,"content":"In this research the efficiency of degradation of different organic contaminant classes, including pesticides (tembotrione, clomazone), pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin, 17α-ethinyl estradiol) and mycotoxins (zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B1), by subcritical water treatment, was studied in model systems. All experiments were conducted in a house-made batch type pilot reactor. The research was focused on the optimization of the treatment parameters by using moderate treatment conditions. Optimization of the remediation processes of water contaminated with 17α-ethinyl estradiol, tembotrione, clomazone, ciprofloxacin, was conducted by testing different homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, as well as different gas atmospheres (nitrogen and carbon-dioxide) for pressurization of the process system. Mycotoxins in water were degraded without catalysts and all experiments were conducted in nitrogen atmosphere. Optimization was conducted by defining the optimal combination of the treatment temperature and time, oriented towards energy saving and minimization of the technical requirements. The degradation efficiency in all tested samples was determined by HPLC analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85a699be072a1cc150138e36691354aaf0c7d770404571698dcea1d02422b291","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
