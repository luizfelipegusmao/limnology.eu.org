HF is the final state to which all heart diseases of different etiologies lead if not adequately treated, therefore it is highly prevalent worldwide, with a progressive increase with age, reaching a prevalence of 10% in subjects over the age of 65 years. It should also be underlined that lately, while the prevalence of HF with left ventricular reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is slowly decreasing, the incidence of HF with left ventricular preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is progressively increasing.\nIn deed, among patients consecutively hospitalized for HF between 1987 and 2001 in a study from the Mayo Clinic Hospitals in Olmsted County, Minnesota, prevalence of HFpEF increased from 38% to 54%. HFpEF is typically characterized by concentric remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) with impaired diastolic function and increased filling pressures. Over the years, also the prevalence of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia in the general adult population has progressively increased, primarily due to lifestyle changes, particularly in developed and developing countries, with a range that globally ranges between 15.5% and 46.5%. Notably, insulin resistance (IR)/hyperinsulinemia (Hyperins) is present in up to 60% of patients with HF and is significantly higher in subjects with HfpEF.\nIn the scientific literature it has been well highlighted that the increased circulating levels of insulin are associated with conditions of insulin resistance are responsible for progressive cardiovascular alterations over the years. In the setting of HFpEF, insulin stimulates the concentric remodeling of the left ventricle with associated diastolic dysfunction, which, coincidentally. Unfortunately, IR/Hyperins, despite being a well-known cardiovascular risk factor, is still not screened in the general population and is not treated as promptly as it should be, and this could at least in part concur in the progressive increase in prevalence of HFpEF in the general adult population. The aim of this manuscript was to review scientific literature that support a pathophysiologic connection between IR/Hyperins and HFpEF to stimulate the scientific community towards the identification of hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance as an independent cardiovascular risk factor in development and worsening of HF, believing that its adequate screening in the general population and appropriate treatment could reduce the prevalence of HFpEF and improve its progression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c8d4cde273080025e265bf2f879803292016431697b3f19c8c3dd29b9241aac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
