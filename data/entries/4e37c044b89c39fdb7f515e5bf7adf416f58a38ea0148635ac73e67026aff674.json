However, a comprehensive understanding of the species diversity of these mycoparasites in the West Azarbaijan province of Iran is lacking. In this study, a total of 114 mycoparasitic <i>Pythium</i> s.s. and <i>Globisporangium</i> isolates were obtained from agricultural soils collected from six regions in the province. Through DNA barcoding, all <i>Globisporangium</i> isolates were identified as <i>G. nunn</i>, while the barcode markers were insufficient to accurately resolve species boundaries in <i>Pythium</i> s.s. By combining morphological and multilocus sequence data, five species within the genus <i>Pythium</i> s.s. were identified: <i>P. salmasense</i> sp. nov., a potentially new species, and three known species, <i>P. acanthicum</i>, <i>P. ornamentatum</i>, and <i>P. periplocum</i>. <i>Pythium ornamentatum</i> was the most common species and found in all regions studied, followed by <i>G. nunn</i> and <i>P. acanthicum</i>, which were both isolated from four regions. While the isolates of <i>G. nunn</i> showed no mycoparasitic activity against <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, all <i>Pythium</i> s.s. species were capable of infecting the hyphae of this pathogen. The existence of mycoparasitic species is promising for biological control of soil-borne fungal pathogens in the province. The widespread occurrence of <i>P. ornamentatum</i>, <i>G. nunn</i>, and <i>P. acanthicum</i> may suggest their adaptation to local soil and environmental conditions, indicating their potentially superior effectiveness in controlling plant diseases across different regions if used as biocontrol agents.</p>","author":"Sevda Rezaei, \nMasoud Abrinbana, \nYoubert Ghosta","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"4e37c044b89c39fdb7f515e5bf7adf416f58a38ea0148635ac73e67026aff674","category":"Environment"}
