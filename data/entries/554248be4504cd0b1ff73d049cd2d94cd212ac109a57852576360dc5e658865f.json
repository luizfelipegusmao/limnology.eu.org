{"title":"An Analysis of General and Specific Deterrence Perception of Drivers Using Structural Equation Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1252/v1","date":1724079524000,"content":"In 2018, Iran witnessed approximately 21,000 fatalities resulting from road accidents, ranking it as the fifth leading cause of death across all age groups. These incidents carry substantial economic and social burden for the nation, claiming more than 5% of its GDP. Human behavior emerges as a significant contributing factor to high-risk driving offenses. It has been proposed that by influencing general deterrence, a rigorous defense can be established against such violations. Various theories posit that by reinforcing or diminishing influential factors, general deterrence perception can be molded, presenting a potential avenue for an effective deterrent against traffic infractions. This study examines deterrence perceptions prevailing among the public in Iran regarding the enforcement of traffic laws. Employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we delve into the intricate relationships between variables, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing general deterrence. The study draws on the data derived from a survey comprising 548 questionnaires for modeling purposes. An innovative concept, private sector enforcement, is introduced and incorporated into the questioning and modeling process. The findings reveal that socioeconomic status (p-value&amp;lt;0.01), police enforcement (p-value&amp;lt;0.05), private sector enforcement (p-value&amp;lt;0.05), specific deterrence (p-value&amp;lt;0.01), and the use of technology (p-value&amp;lt;0.01) have direct and indirect impacts on the general deterrence perception of drivers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"554248be4504cd0b1ff73d049cd2d94cd212ac109a57852576360dc5e658865f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
