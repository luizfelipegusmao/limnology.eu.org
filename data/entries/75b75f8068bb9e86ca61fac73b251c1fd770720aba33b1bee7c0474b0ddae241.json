{"title":"Origins of Attractive Gravitational and Boson Forces, and Wave Mechanics of the Elementary Particles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1888/v1","date":1727165919000,"content":"In the standard model (SM) and general relative theory (GR) based on the 4-D Minkowski space, the graviton and photon are massless. In that case, two particles with the positive masses are attracted to each other by the gravitational (graviton) waves. The origin of the attractive gravitational force is not understood in terms of SM and GR. In the present work, the 3-D quantized space model (TQSM) based on the 4-D Euclidean space is applied to explain the attractive gravitational force. The repulsive Coulomb force between two particles with the positive charges is explained by using the destructive interference of the electric waves emitted from two particles. Therefore, the destructive interference of the gravitational (graviton) waves emitted from two particles with the positive masses should make the repulsive gravitational force (Fr). The observance of the attractive gravitational force (Fg) indicates the non-zero graviton mass because the attractive gravitational force can be explained if the gravitational (graviton) waves are the oscillating mass waves. The masses lost during the destructive interference of the gravitational (graviton) waves are converted to the gamma rays. These induced gamma rays make the new attractive force (Fa). The observed attractive gravitational force (Fg) should be originated by the equation of Fg = Fa â€“ Fr &gt; 0. This can explain the reason why the gravitational force (Fg) between the elementary particles is so weak when compared with the Coulomb forces. The properties of elementary particles in terms of the TQSM model are analyzed by the wave mechanics of G, E and M waves of the 3-D quantized photon space. The G wave is the time fluctuations along the (absolute) time axis and E (electric) and M (magnetic) waves are the space fluctuations along the space axes. The elementary particles exist as the particle forms with the constant (rest) masses (m) at the low speed. The elementary particles at the high speed have the (particle) wave forms with the oscillating masses or the particle forms with the relativistic masses (gm). The graviton has the very small mass moving with the very high-speed close to the light speed of c. This means that most of the gravitons exist as the graviton wave forms. The particle waves are coupled with the photon waves (2EM, gamma rays) because of the energy conservation. It is concluded that the gravitational waves are the coupled oscillating forms (GEM waves) of the graviton waves and photon waves. The existence of the wave forms for the particles can explain the double slit experiment for the electron beams. And the attractiveness of the dark matter, weak and strong forces is explained by the virtual two boson processes with the TC symmetry and total energy conservation. All elementary bosons and neutrinos are considered as the wave forms with the high speed close to the light speed of c. Because of the charge and energy conservations, only the neutrino oscillations and dark matter (baston) oscillations are allowed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75b75f8068bb9e86ca61fac73b251c1fd770720aba33b1bee7c0474b0ddae241","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
