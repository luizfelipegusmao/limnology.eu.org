{"title":"Lumbar Facet Joint Disease: What, Why and When?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1198/v1","date":1729046822000,"content":"Abstract: Low back pain (LBP) affects over 60% of individuals in their lifetime and is a leading cause of disability and increased healthcare expenditure. Facet joint pain (FJP) occurs in 27% to 40% of LBP patients but is often overlooked or misdiagnosed. Additionally, there is no clear correlation between clinical examination, radiological findings, and clinical presentation, com-plicating the diagnosis and treatment of FJP.\nThis narrative review aims to provide an overview of the literature regarding facet joint pain and discusses the utility of medial branch blocks (MBBs) and intra-articular (IA) injections as diag-nostic and therapeutic tools prior to radiofrequency ablation (RFA).\nRFA is considered the gold standard for managing FJP, employing techniques that include precise needle placement and stimulation parameters to disrupt pain signals. Promising alternatives such as cooled RFA and cryodenervation require further research on their long-term efficacy and safety. Endoscopic denervation and multifidus stimulation are emerging therapies that may benefit chronic LBP patients, but additional research is needed to establish their effectiveness. \nWhen conservative management fails, RFA provides significant and lasting relief in well-selected patients and has a favourable safety profile. Current literature does not support surgical inter-ventions for LBP management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f084994fef0ec89dd6acf6a30282b2d719fb24d9fba0f74a3c9730cdfe3b5fd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
