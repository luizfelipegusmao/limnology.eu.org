{"title":"A Methodology for Robust Multislice Ptychography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/4/703/7693793?rss=1","date":1718409600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>While multislice electron ptychography can provide thermal vibration limited resolution and structural information in 3D, it relies on properly selecting many intertwined acquisition and computational parameters. Here, we outline a methodology for selecting acquisition parameters to enable robust ptychographic reconstructions. We develop two physically informed metrics, areal oversampling and Ronchigram magnification, to describe the selection of these parameters in multislice ptychography. Through simulations, we comprehensively evaluate the validity of these two metrics over a broad range of conditions and show that they accurately guide reconstruction success. Further, we validate these conclusions with experimental ptychographic data and demonstrate close agreement between trends in simulated and experimental data. Using these metrics, we achieve experimental multislice reconstructions at a scan step of 2.1Ã…/px, enabling large field-of-view, data-efficient reconstructions. These experimental design principles enable the routine and robust use of multislice ptychography for 3D characterization of materials at the atomic scale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d7340840aad1a2d1df9333c4373f85e2f2985043ec38a171b1ce9953217307ec","category":"Environment"}
