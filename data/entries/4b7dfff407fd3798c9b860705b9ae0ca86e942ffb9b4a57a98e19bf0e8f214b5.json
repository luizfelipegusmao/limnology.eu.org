Transcriptome analysis first revealed that due to the sharing pathway between sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>), the K<sup>+</sup> largely regulates the metabolisms of amino acid and glutathione under the accumulation of selenite salt. Furthermore, K<sup>+</sup> could improve the tolerance performance and selenium-biotransformation yields of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells under Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> salt stimulation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The important role of K<sup>+</sup> in regulating the intracellular selenium accumulation especially in terms of amino acid metabolism and glutathione, suggested a new direction for the development of selenium-enrichment supplements with <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cell factory. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wenhui Hao, \nYing Li, \nHanlin Guo, \nJian Chen, \nFuwei Pi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4b7dfff407fd3798c9b860705b9ae0ca86e942ffb9b4a57a98e19bf0e8f214b5","category":"Environment"}
