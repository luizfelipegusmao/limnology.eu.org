{"title":"3D Printing with Earthen Materials: A Settlement-Scale Design Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0259/v1","date":1722838744000,"content":"The research theme originates as a design experiment for a sustainable housing system built on-site. The context is Niamey, the capital of Niger. The study takes into account the environmental issues in the construction sector and aims to find a solution capable of meeting housing, environmental, and economic needs. In the field of earthen construction, the most important developments have been achieved in manufacturing methods. In particular, the use of an additive digital manufacturing system, such as large-scale 3D printing, allows the construction of complex shapes derived from structural and thermal studies, maintaining a high degree of automation in the construction process, reducing construction times and labor costs. The research investigates the possibility of responding to housing and environmental needs with a settlement system made entirely of printed earth, maintaining the highest possible degree of automation. Starting from a study on the state of the art of 3D printing in architecture and printable earthen compounds, the design choices of similar cases are analyzed to understand the construction techniques, potentials, and limitations of the medium. Finally, a design proposal is developed based on the definition of a fully printable functional module, which, upon aggregation, determines the characteristics of the final settlement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e596efcb14a77886a8a9fb144a94c0491a7f73136b381edbbd7435861f67ac5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
