{"title":"The Role of Peptides in Combatting HIV Infection: Applications and Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0137/v1","date":1725312758000,"content":"Peptide-based inhibitors represent a promising approach for the treatment of HIV-1, offering a range of potential advantages including specificity, low toxicity, and the ability to target various stages of the viral lifecycle. This review outlines the current state of research on peptide-based anti-HIV therapies, highlighting key advancements and identifying future research directions. Over the past few years, there has been significant progress in developing synthetic peptide-based drugs that target various stages of the viral life cycle, including entry and replication. These approaches aim to create effective anti-HIV therapies. Additionally, peptides have proven valuable in the development of anti-HIV vaccines. In the quest for effective HIV vaccines, discovering potent antigens and designing suitable vaccine strategies are crucial for overcoming challenges such as low immunogenicity, safety concerns, and increased viral load. Innovative strategies for vaccine development through peptide research are, therefore, a key focus area for achieving effective HIV prevention. This review aims to explore the strategies for designing peptides with anti-HIV activity and to highlight their role in advancing both therapeutic and preventive measures against HIV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"397e599d1c936eae2b24d0b9420eb4bb3e4a8bb0f53d7c26dc5e6beeeee84e42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
