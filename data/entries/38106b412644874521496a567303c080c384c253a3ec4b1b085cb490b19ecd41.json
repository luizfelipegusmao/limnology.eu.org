{"title":"Evolution Of Self-gravitating Fluid Spheres Involving Ghost Stars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1441/v1","date":1726666350000,"content":"We present some exact analytical solutions describing, either the evolution of fluid distributions corresponding to a ghost star (vanishing total mass), or describing the evolution of fluid distributions which attain the ghost star status at some point of their lives. The first two solutions correspond to the former case, they admit a conformal Killing vector (CKV) and describe the adiabatic evolution of a ghost star. Other two solutions corresponding to the latter case are found, which describe evolving fluid sphere absorbing energy from the outside, leading to a vanishing total mass at some point of their evolution. In this case the fluid is assumed to be expansionâ€“free. In all four solutions the condition of vanishing complexity factor was imposed. A discussion of the physical implications of the results, is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38106b412644874521496a567303c080c384c253a3ec4b1b085cb490b19ecd41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
