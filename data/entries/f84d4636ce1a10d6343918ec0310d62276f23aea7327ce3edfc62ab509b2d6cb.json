{"title":"Genetic factors acting prior to dormancy in sour cherry influence bloom time the following spring","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4428/7644105?rss=1","date":1712793600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding the process of <span>Prunus</span> species floral development is crucial for developing strategies to manipulate bloom time and prevent crop loss due to climate change. Here, we present a detailed examination of flower development from initiation until bloom for early- and late-blooming sour cherries (<span>Prunus cerasus</span>) from a population segregating for a major bloom time QTL on chromosome 4. Using a new staging system, we show floral buds from early-blooming trees were persistently more advanced than those from late-blooming siblings. A genomic DNA coverage analysis revealed the late-blooming haplotype of this QTL, <span>k</span>, is located on a subgenome originating from the late-blooming <span>P. fruticosa</span> progenitor. Transcriptome analyses identified many genes within this QTL as differentially expressed between early- and late-blooming trees during the vegetative-to-floral transition. From these, we identified candidate genes for the late bloom phenotype, including multiple transcription factors homologous to Reproductive Meristem B3 domain-containing proteins. Additionally, we determined that the basis of <span>k</span> in sour cherry is likely separate from candidate genes found in sweet cherryâ€”suggesting several major regulators of bloom time are located on <span>Prunus</span> chromosome 4.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"f84d4636ce1a10d6343918ec0310d62276f23aea7327ce3edfc62ab509b2d6cb","category":"Environment"}
