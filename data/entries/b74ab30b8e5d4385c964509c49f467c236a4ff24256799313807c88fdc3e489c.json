Significant improvement in thermal conductivity can be achieved by decreasing the cell size, which results in thermal conductivity decrease due to radiation drop [<a href=\"#ozae044.167-B1\">1</a>]. Several Dow businesses, including Polyurethanes, Industrial Solution, and Performance Silicones have projects targeting breakthrough insulation development with the primary focus on cell size reduction. As a result, large DOEs are routinely executed to screen impact of developmental grade polyols, catalyst, blowing agents, nucleating agents, and surfactants on cell size control. To support these critical business projects, the Core R&amp;D Analytical Science group at Dow is heavily leveraged for cell size analysis or rigid foams.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b74ab30b8e5d4385c964509c49f467c236a4ff24256799313807c88fdc3e489c","category":"Environment"}
