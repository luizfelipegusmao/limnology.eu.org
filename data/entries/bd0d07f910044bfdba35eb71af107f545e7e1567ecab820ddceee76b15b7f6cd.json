Expanding access to post-abortion care while eliminating barriers to utilization could significantly reduce abortions-related morbidity and mortality. We describe the barriers to providing and utilizing post-abortion care across health facilities in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Nigeria. This paper draws on three data sources: health facility assessment data, patient-exit interview data, and qualitative interviews conducted with healthcare providers and policymakers. All data were based on a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of health facilities conducted between November 2018 and February 2019. Data on post-abortion care service indicators were collected, including staffing levels and staff training, availability of post-abortion care supplies, equipment and commodities. Patient-exit interviews focused on patients treated for post-abortion complications. In-depth interviews were conducted with healthcare providers within a sample of the study health facilities and national or local decision-makers in sexual and reproductive health. Few primary-level facilities in Burkina Faso (15%), Kenya (46%), and Nigeria (20%) had staff trained on post-abortion care. Only 16.6% of facilities in Kenya had functional operating theaters or MVA rooms, Burkina Faso (20.3%) and Nigeria (50.7%). Primary facilities refer post-abortion care cases to higher-level facilities despite needing to be more adequately equipped to facilitate these referrals. Several challenges that impede the provision of quality and comprehensive post-abortion care across the three countries. The absence of post-abortion care training, equipment, and inadequate referral capacity was among the critical reasons for the lack of services. There is a need to strengthen post-abortion care services across all levels of the health system, but especially at lower-level facilities where most patients seek care first.","author":"Winstoun Muga","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"bd0d07f910044bfdba35eb71af107f545e7e1567ecab820ddceee76b15b7f6cd","category":"Environment"}
