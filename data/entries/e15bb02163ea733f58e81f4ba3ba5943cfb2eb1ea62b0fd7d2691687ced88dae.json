{"title":"Marine Pharmacology in 2019‐2021: Marine Compounds with Antibacterial, Antidiabetic, Antifungal, Anti‐Inflammatory, Antiprotozoal, Antituberculosis and Antiviral Activities; Affecting the Immune and Nervous Systems, and Other Miscellaneous Mechanisms of Action","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1549/v1","date":1716460849000,"content":"The current 2019-2021 marine pharmacology literature review provides a continuation of previous reviews covering the period 1998 to 2018. Preclinical marine pharmacology research during 2019-2021 was published by researchers in 42 countries and contributed novel mechanism of action pharmacology for 171 structurally characterized marine compounds. The peer-reviewed marine natural products pharmacology literature reported antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis,and antiviral mechanism of action studies for 49 compounds, 87 compounds with antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities as well as affecting the immune and nervous system, while another group of 51 compounds demonstrated novel miscellaneous mechanisms of action, which upon further investigation, may contribute to several pharmacological classes. Thus, in 2019-2021, a very active preclinical marine natural product pharmacology pipeline provided novel mechanism of actions as well as new lead chemistry for the clinical marine pharmaceutical pipeline targeting the therapy of several disease categories.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e15bb02163ea733f58e81f4ba3ba5943cfb2eb1ea62b0fd7d2691687ced88dae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
