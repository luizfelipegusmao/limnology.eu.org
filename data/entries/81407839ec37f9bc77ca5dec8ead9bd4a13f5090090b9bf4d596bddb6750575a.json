{"title":"Comparative analysis of growth cycles among three weedy <i>Avena</i> species: Insights from field observations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307875","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Süleyman Gürdal Türkseven</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Avena</i> species, especially <i>A</i>. <i>fatua</i>, <i>A</i>. <i>sterilis</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>ludoviciana</i>, are among the most problematic weed species in many crops worldwide. The growth cycles of these three species could be helpful in understanding their growth cycle and their implications for agriculture and weed management. The growth cycles of these species were studied altogether or in combination with any single or double combinations of the other species in cereal fields in Türkiye, using two populations of each in a common garden experiment in Bornova district, Izmir, Türkiye. Germination and growth experiments were conducted in the laboratory and screen house, respectively. Various phenological parameters were recorded during the experiment and data were analyzed using R software. There were no significant differences in germination, emergence, SPAD values, leaf width, plant height, or plant dry weight among the species or populations. The SPAD values and width of the flag leaf and the leaf before the flag leaf were strongly correlated. Plant weight increased with increasing tiller number. The length of the ligule in a population of <i>A</i>. <i>sterilis</i> was significantly greater than that in populations of two other species, and it was concluded that the species is not <i>A</i>. <i>fatua</i> or <i>A</i>. <i>ludoviciana</i> if the length of the ligule is greater than 10 mm. The length of the spikelets of <i>A</i>. <i>sterilis</i> was greater than 65 mm with awn and greater than 35 mm without awn; these values were significantly greater than those of two other species that were shorter than 55 with awn for <i>A</i>. <i>fatua</i> and 30 mm without awn for <i>A</i>. <i>ludoviciana</i>, respectively. <i>Avena ludoviciana</i> had fewer tillers than the other two species. The plants emerged at 37.58 GDD at the soil surface temperature, which corresponds to 7 days after sowing. The growing cycles of the species differed: 196 days for <i>A</i>. <i>sterilis</i>, 201 days for <i>A</i>. <i>fatua</i>, and 209 days for <i>A</i>. <i>ludoviciana</i> after emergence, although there were no clear differences in earlier growth stages. This study provides initial basic information about the <i>Avena</i> spp., and it is concluded that even if a field has mixed <i>Avena</i> populations, herbicides can be applied simultaneously because the early development stages of the three species are very similar. In future prospects, there is a need for proper studies about the management of all <i>Avena</i> spp. on the basis of growth stages and growing degree days in regional context.","author":"Süleyman Gürdal Türkseven","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"81407839ec37f9bc77ca5dec8ead9bd4a13f5090090b9bf4d596bddb6750575a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
