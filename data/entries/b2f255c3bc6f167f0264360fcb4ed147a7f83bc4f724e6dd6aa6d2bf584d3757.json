{"title":"Evaluation of TRPM2 Channel‐Mediated Autophagic Signaling Pathway in Hippocampus and Cortex Tissues of Rat Offspring Following Prenatal Exposure to Elevated Alcohol Levels","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24427?af=R","date":1728567084000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) can occur because of high amount of alcohol intake during pregnancy and is characterized by both physical and neurological problems. Children diagnosed with FAS have difficulties in learning, memory, and coordination. Hippocampus has a major role in memory and learning. We aimed to determine whether alcohol exposure during pregnancy had any effect on offspring by evaluating learning ability as well as oxidative stress and autophagy in the hippocampus and cortex tissues of litters. Attention was also paid to sex differences. To do so, TRPM2, Beclin1, p62, LC3B, IBA1, parvalbumin, GAD65, and mGluR5 expression levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as total oxidant (TOS) and total antioxidant (TAS) status were determined by ELISA. Learning experiments were evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Our findings demonstrated that IBA1, LC3B, GAD65, and mGluR5 expression levels were higher in female rats of the chronic alcohol exposure (CAE) model. Our IHC results revealed that TRPM2 expression levels were significantly increased in both males and females in the CAE group. Likewise, TAS was lower, and TOS was higher in CAE animals. Moreover, MWM outcomes supported a learning deficiency in CAE litters compared to controls and indicated that female offspring outperformed males in learning experiments. Therefore, our results revealed the detrimental effects of alcohol exposure during pregnancy on autophagy signaling in the hippocampus and cortex tissue of litters, which could affect the learning ability of animals.</p>","author":"Abdülhadi Cihangir Uğuz, \nAslı Okan, \nZüleyha Doğanyiğit, \nSeher Yilmaz, \nŞükrü Ateş, \nEvrim Suna Arikan Söylemez, \nSebahattin Karabulut, \nAlper Serhat Kumru, \nJavier Espino","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"b2f255c3bc6f167f0264360fcb4ed147a7f83bc4f724e6dd6aa6d2bf584d3757","category":"Environment"}
