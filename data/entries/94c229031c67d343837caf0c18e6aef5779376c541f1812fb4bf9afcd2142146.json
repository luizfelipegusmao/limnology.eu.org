{"title":"Estimation of optimal treatment regimes with electronic medical record data using the residual life value estimator","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/4/933/7604037?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Clinicians and patients must make treatment decisions at a series of key decision points throughout disease progression. A dynamic treatment regime is a set of sequential decision rules that return treatment decisions based on accumulating patient information, like that commonly found in electronic medical record (EMR) data. When applied to a patient population, an optimal treatment regime leads to the most favorable outcome on average. Identifying optimal treatment regimes that maximize residual life is especially desirable for patients with life-threatening diseases such as sepsis, a complex medical condition that involves severe infections with organ dysfunction. We introduce the residual life value estimator (ReLiVE), an estimator for the expected value of cumulative restricted residual life under a fixed treatment regime. Building on ReLiVE, we present a method for estimating an optimal treatment regime that maximizes expected cumulative restricted residual life. Our proposed method, ReLiVE-Q, conducts estimation via the backward induction algorithm Q-learning. We illustrate the utility of ReLiVE-Q in simulation studies, and we apply ReLiVE-Q to estimate an optimal treatment regime for septic patients in the intensive care unit using EMR data from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring Intensive Care database. Ultimately, we demonstrate that ReLiVE-Q leverages accumulating patient information to estimate personalized treatment regimes that optimize a clinically meaningful function of residual life.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"94c229031c67d343837caf0c18e6aef5779376c541f1812fb4bf9afcd2142146","category":"Environment"}
