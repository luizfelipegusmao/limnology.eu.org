{"title":"Attitudes of Dental Students towards the Prescription of Antibiotics during Endodontic Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1374/v1","date":1718811225000,"content":"Abstract:             \nAim: This study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic-prescribing attitudes of dental students during the management of pulpal and periapical pathologies.\nMaterial and methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study concerned all the students in clinical training registered the 5 faculties of dental medicine in Morocco. A self-administered questionnaire was used, and completed via email addresses. Data were analyzed with Jamovi software. Quantitative variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation and qualitative variables as numbers and percentages. X2 and ANOVA tests were performed. The significance level was set at p &lt; 0.05.\nResults: Three sixty-five students participated in this study. The average duration was 5.87 Â±1.45 No statistical difference was found between the different universities p &gt;0.05. Of most students 83.8% prescribe Amoxicillin first ; Amoxcilin in combination with clavulanic acid is prescribed by 9.2%. For patients with penicillin allergy, clindamycin was the most prescribed 53.9%, after followed by azitromycin at 20.9%. Antibiotics are prescribed for all pulp and periapical pathologies, whether acute or chronic. For acute pulpitis, a difference was statistically significant (P=0.01). Regarding acute apical periodontitis, a statistically significant difference between the different faculties was noted (P= 0.03). For the apical abscess, the antibiotic prescription was higher at the public faculty of Casablanca 92.8% than in the other faculties (P = 0.02)\nConclusion:  It appears from this study the need for faculties of dentistry to develop innovative teaching models to improve the level of knowledge of students on antibiotics and their indications in endodontics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fff07aea68969e5d43cc9456e7c6d5bb790bc196a22a4e138093c0c0b20b37e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
