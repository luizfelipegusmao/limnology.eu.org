Characteristics of productivity and collaborations of pre-Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine, including journal impact factor, publications, National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded grants, patents, coinventors, and coauthors at each academic age can be used as a reference guide for emerging researchers to compare one's research productivity and collaboration patterns with pre-Nobel laureates.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Significant advancements in public health come from scientific discoveries, but more are needed to meet the ever-growing societal needs. Examining the best practices of outstanding scientists may help develop future researchers and lead to more discoveries. This study compared the comprehensive work of 49 Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine from 2000 to 2019 to a matched control of National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded biomedical investigators. Our unique data set, comprising 11,737 publications, 571 US patents, and 1693 NIH research awards produced by pre-Nobel laureates, was compared to a similar data set of control researchers. Compared to control researchers, pre-Nobel laureates produce significantly more publications annually (median = 5.66; interquartile range [IQR] = 5.16); significantly fewer coauthors per publication (median = 3.32; IQR = 1.95); consistently higher Journal Impact Factor publications (median = 12.04; IQR = 6.83); and substantially more patents per researcher (median = 5; IQR = 14). Such differences arose from nearly identical cumulative NIH award budgets of pre-Nobel laureates (median $25.3 M) and control researchers. Nobel laureates are neither hyper-prolific (&gt;72 papers per year) nor hyper-funded (&gt;$100 M cumulative). An academic age–specific trajectory graph allows aspiring researchers to compare their productivity and collaboration patterns to those of pre-Nobel laureates.</p>","author":"Wendy J. Burnett, \nE.
