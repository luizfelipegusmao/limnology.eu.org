{"title":"Research of the Systems of Environmental and Soil Protection Technologies in Erosion-Hazardous Agrolandscapes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1835/v1","date":1729695379000,"content":"The problem of land degradation has become a global issue. It is primarily caused by direct destruction of the natural ecosystems, irrational use and depletion of the land resources, and the growing agro-technogenic load on soils. The current state of sloped agricultural landscapes is characterized by a significant increase in the area of soils with varying degrees of erosion that require the development of scientifically based measures to protect against the erosion processes for the purpose of their further environmentally safe use, taking into account the requirements of sustainable development of the land use and farming systems, and the agricultural sphere, as a whole. There has been obtained and summarized modern scientific information on the development of adaptive-ecological and organizational-economic measures for the conservation (establishment) of erosion-degraded and low-productivity soils of arable sloped lands through the environmentally sound use of agricultural lands, the development and implementation of a soil-protective adaptive-landscape farming system. Contemporary scientific research has been carried out by means of field route studies and land inventory to determine the geomorphological and soil characteristics of the studied polygons, taking into account the basic principles of application in the geospatial analysis and practical use in the landscape studies by means of the Auto CAD computer program, the boundaries of the polygons - watersheds on raster topographic maps being determined, digitized in the local coordinate system (SK-63). The research methodology included the collection and analysis of cartographic and field experimental materials to determine the geoecological situation of the formation and manifestation of spatio-temporal erosion-hydrological processes in the area studied, conducting scientific research to study the erosion and washout of soils in the key areas, agricultural landscape polygons, determining the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors upon the estimated intensity of the erosion processes, and office processing of the results, obtained in the field. The reliability and validity of the results are confirmed by the large volume of data obtained and their statistical processing, based on the software: Office 2016, \"Statistika 13\", \"Statgraphics 19\" and \"MapInfo Pro v12.5.5\". It has been established that the introduction of a set of measures for the conservation of the degraded lands of the sloped agro-landscape systems by stopping intensive economic activity with subsequent use of the land plots as hayfields and pastures, ensured a significant reduction in soil loss due to erosion, while the soil loss on heavily and moderately eroded soils of the studied sites amounted to 2.38-4.19 t ha-1, which differs slightly from the maximum permissible standard indicators of soil loss for the heavily and moderately eroded soils. The main characteristics of the agrochemical, agrophysical and other properties of the washed-out chernozems have stabilized during the conservation period. At the same time, the humus content in the cultivated soil layer has increased to 3.85%, the optimal values are characterized by the soil acidity pH 7.1 - 7.3 (close to neutral). Attention has been focused on the specifics of the land conservation by excluding it from economic circulation with its subsequent use as pasture and hay lands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b7e3bfc1b56c435dd99646068aa8d59bcaa04c7f50aee757471fccc72dc1037","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
