{"title":"Challenges and Strategies of Implementing Agricultural Electronic Licenses in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1980/v1","date":1716985421000,"content":"In the process of expanding the application of electronic licenses in the Chinese agricultural sector, challenges such as inconsistent information standards, poor interoperability, significant data barriers, and lack of regulatory basis are encountered. By examining online information and practical data of agricultural electronic licenses in the 31 provincial-level administrative units in mainland China, variations in the reasons for promoting the expanded application of electronic licenses in different regions were identified. It is believed that strategies should be proposed around key factors such as government capacity, economic development, social needs, and intergovernmental relations. Suggestions include enhancing the intensity of information aggregation, diversifying the management entities, advancing the intelligence of underlying technology, and improving the completeness of legal rules. New conceptual proposals, such as constructing a database for agricultural information collection, establishing a multi-entity management authorization mechanism, implementing intelligent applications of electronic licenses at the grassroots level, and developing specialized legal rules, require further validation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"108f0638c6bc7f5fcf1f032eba054dc1863fd51518680b3c47126b74bfef7b95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
