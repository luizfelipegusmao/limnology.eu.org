This paper assesses several analytical solutions available in the literature for the calculation of at-rest, active, and passive lateral earth pressures behind rigid retaining walls. The calculated lateral earth pressures from these analytical solutions are compared with the measured values from small-scale tests, full-scale tests, and/or numerical simulations available in the literature. Small-scale tests showed similar normalized at-rest, active and passive lateral earth pressures as compared with full-scale tests/numerical simulations. The comparisons show that the calculated lateral thrust using the method by Jaky (J Soc Hung Archit Eng 78:355–358, 1944) and Janssen (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure, 39: 1045-1049, 1895) with a low wall-soil interface friction angle well matched the measured at-rest lateral thrust in the field tests and those by Coulomb (Essai sur une application des règles de maximis et minimis a quelques problèmes de statique, relatifs a l’architecture, Academie Royale Des Sciences, Paris, 1776) and Zhou et al. (Rock Soil Mech 35:245–250, 2014) agreed better with the measured passive lateral thrusts in the small-scale tests and full-scale numerical simulations than those by other methods. The calculated lateral thrusts using the methods by Coulomb (Essai sur une application des règles de maximis et minimis a quelques problèmes de statique, relatifs a l’architecture, Academie Royale Des Sciences, Paris, 1776), and Handy (J Geotech Eng 111:302–318, 1985) and Paik and Salgado (Geotechnique 53:643–653, 2003) with appropriate wall-soil interface friction angles matched the active thrusts in both small-scale and full-scale tests reasonably well.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"9ba6878a6533ec09e884a8efd017f489db4f37ce189bd42b565fa918640e091f","category":"Environment"}
