In the context of the rapidly expanding e-commerce landscape, ensuring the security of personal data is a complex and crucial task. The study of several legal frameworks, including Malaysia's compliance with EU regulations and Indonesia's Personal Data Protection Law, provides valuable insights into consumer data protection. The challenges of balancing data safeguarding and unrestricted movement and tackling misuse by external entities are significant and require careful consideration. This research elucidates the pivotal role of trust in e-commerce environments and the deployment of innovative e-commerce models designed to minimize personal data sharing. By integrating advanced privacy-enhancing technologies and adhering to stringent regulatory standards such as the GDPR, this study demonstrates effective strategies for robust data protection. The paper contributes to the academic discourse by providing a comprehensive framework that synergizes legal, technological, and procedural elements to fortify data security and enhance consumer trust in digital marketplaces. This approach aligns with international data protection standards and offers a pragmatic blueprint for achieving sustainable data security in e-commerce.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ee92975e8eb95f25ec31b585ef9a83f3cfabda881be1979cbc5125863955809","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
