{"title":"Exploring the Role of Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Disease Diagnosis and Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0467/v2","date":1723732476000,"content":"Recent advancements in molecular diagnostics have highlighted the potential of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) as a biomarker in various diseases. This study aims to explore the role of ccfDNA in the early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of diseases, with a focus on oncology. We conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of current literature, combined with experimental approaches involving advanced genomic sequencing and bioinformatics techniques. Our research systematically characterizes the molecular composition of ccfDNA, including its origins, size distribution, and methylation patterns, across different disease states. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of ccfDNA release and clearance in the bloodstream, elucidating mechanisms that could influence its diagnostic accuracy. In the context of cancer, we analyze the correlation between tumor-derived ccfDNA and disease progression, response to therapy, and overall survival. Our findings indicate that ccfDNA holds promise as a non-invasive biomarker for early disease detection, real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy, and potentially, predicting relapse. This study contributes to the growing field of liquid biopsies and opens new avenues for personalized medicine, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols in ccfDNA analysis to maximize its clinical utility. The implications of our findings extend beyond oncology, suggesting potential applications of ccfDNA in other pathological conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70a9771a1d597ef36d7a7e910fc00af39185b3a9209e7dfdd821e90fb9a091b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
