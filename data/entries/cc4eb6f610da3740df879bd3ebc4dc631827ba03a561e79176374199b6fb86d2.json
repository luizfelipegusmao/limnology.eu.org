{"title":"Review on Microwave Surface Resistance of High Temperature Superconductor Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1723/v1","date":1714123925000,"content":"The performance of Yttrium-Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) high-temperature superconductors in high-frequency applications is significantly affected by the microwave surface resistance (Rs). The paper delves into the basics, measuring methods and factors affecting the resistance (Rs) in YBCO, highlighting its high critical temperature (Tc) and low resistance, positioning it as a promising material. YBCO's compatibility with epitaxial growth and microstructure engineering offers opportunities to reduce grain boundary effects and improve Rs, making it advantageous for high-frequency electronics, communication systems, and MRI coils. This is due to its high critical current density (Jc) and exceptional Rs at practical temperatures.\n\nChallenges remain in comprehending and managing Rs in YBCO, despite its favorable characteristics. Utilizing advanced fabrication methods and incorporating nanotechnology allow for customization of YBCO-based devices. Multi-scale modeling and simulation are essential for guiding experimental work and understanding YBCO's performance in high-frequency settings. This study highlights the promise of YBCO for future high-frequency technologies and stresses the importance of more research to overcome hurdles and fully exploit its capabilities, potentially transforming superconducting devices for practical use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc4eb6f610da3740df879bd3ebc4dc631827ba03a561e79176374199b6fb86d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
