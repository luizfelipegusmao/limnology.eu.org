{"title":"When Four Cyclic Antipodal Points Are Ordered Counterclockwise in Euclidean and Hyperbolic Geometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0910/v1","date":1710497372000,"content":"A cyclic antipodal points of a circle is a pair of\npoints that are the intersection of the circle with a diameter\nof the circle. A recent proof of Ptolemyâ€™s Theorem, simultaneously\nin both (i) Euclidean geometry; and (ii) the relativistic\nmodel of hyperbolic geometry (which is identified with the\nKlein model of hyperbolic geometry), motivates in this article\nthe study of four cyclic antipodal points of a circle, ordered\narbitrarily counterclockwise. The translation of results from\nEuclidean geometry into hyperbolic geometry is obtained by\nmeans of hyperbolic trigonometry, called gyrotrigonometry,\nto which Einstein addition gives rise. Formulas that extend\nthe Pythagorean formula in both Euclidean and hyperbolic\ngeometry are obtained as byproducts","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee6c405e0dab8fd54e739141ec5a9e8eca3193c282071a2d13c4a364dc9c98fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
