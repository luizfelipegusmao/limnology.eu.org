The country or region of your Apple ID must be \nset to one of the countries or regions of the European Union, and \nyou must be physically located in the European Union. </p>\n\n<p>Your device eligibility for alternative app marketplaces is \ndetermined by using on-device processing, with only an indicator \nof eligibility sent to Apple. To preserve your privacy, Apple does \nnot collect your device’s location. </p>\n\n<p>If you leave the European Union for short-term travel, you’ll \ncontinue to have access to alternative app marketplaces for a \ngrace period. If you’re gone for too long, you’ll lose access to \nsome features, including installing new alternative app \nmarketplaces. Apps you installed from alternative app marketplaces \nwill continue to function, but they can’t be updated by the \nmarketplace you downloaded them from. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How long is “too long”? What a confusing mess this is shaping up to be.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/06/ios-app-marketplace-eligibility\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7b0b61ec8afeb86ae6aad5c55d3041e635d7650e29f80828be03e7108a75295a","category":"Tech"}
