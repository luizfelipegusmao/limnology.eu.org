{"title":"Alternative localization of HEME OXYGENASE 1 in plant cells regulates cytosolic heme catabolism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2937/7683853?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Heme, an organometallic tetrapyrrole, is widely engaged in oxygen transport, electron delivery, enzymatic reactions, and signal transduction. In plants, it is also involved in photomorphogenesis and photosynthesis. HEME OXYGENASE 1 (HO1) initiates the first committed step in heme catabolism, and it has generally been thought that this reaction takes place in chloroplasts. Here, we show that <span>HO1</span> in both Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) and rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) has 2 transcription start sites (TSSs), producing long (<span>HO1L</span>) and short (<span>HO1S</span>) transcripts. Their products localize to the chloroplast and the cytosol, respectively. During early development or de-etiolation, the <span>HO1L</span>/<span>HO1S</span> ratio gradually increases. Light perception via phytochromes (Phys) and cryptochromes elevates the <span>HO1L</span>/<span>HO1S</span> ratio in the whole seedling through the functions of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG and through the suppression of DE-ETIOLATED 1, CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1, and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs. <span>HO1L</span> introduction complements the <span>HO1</span>-deficient mutant; surprisingly, <span>HO1S</span> expression also restores the short hypocotyl phenotype and high pigment content and helps the mutant recover from the <span>genomes uncoupled</span> (<span>gun</span>) phenotype. This indicates the assembly of functional Phys within these lines. Furthermore, our findings support the hypothesis that a mobile heme signal is involved in retrograde signaling from the chloroplast. Altogether, our work clarifies the molecular mechanism of <span>HO1</span> TSS regulation and highlights the presence of a cytosolic bypass for heme catabolism in plant cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d872919bd7a61fecf77a8ceaccd08b55c4f6b5c6b71864020151bbf1ac7d3c70","category":"Environment"}
