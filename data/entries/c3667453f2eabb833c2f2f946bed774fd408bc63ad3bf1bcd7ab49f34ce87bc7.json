{"title":"Numerical Analysis of Structural Vibrations in Masts. A Practical Study Applied to a 28-Meter Tugboat.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1915/v1","date":1714382002000,"content":"This article investigates the vibration analysis of the mast on the bridge top of a 28-meter tugboat, in the quasi-static regime. The study aims to determine the natural frequencies using an equivalent dynamic model of the mast and considers the accelerations of different degrees of freedom of the vessel. Practical design and reinforcement strategies for the local bridge top structure are proposed, utilizing numerical and analytical tools. The investigation explores various alternatives to optimize the structural arrangement. By analyzing the modal behavior, insights are provided for efficient design and reinforcement. The results contribute to understand the mast's vibration characteristics, offering guidance for similar structures. The study employs numerical and analytical methods, enhancing the optimization of the mast's behavior. It determines natural frequencies, proposes practical design strategies, and explores alternatives for structural optimization. The findings provide insights for shipbuilding and mast design applications in other vessels and industries such as radar mast, compass deck and guyed mast.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3667453f2eabb833c2f2f946bed774fd408bc63ad3bf1bcd7ab49f34ce87bc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
