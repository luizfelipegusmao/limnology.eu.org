{"title":"The Impact of Applied Behavior Analysis on Autism in Diverse Cultural Contexts: A Non-Western Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0363/v1","date":1725454280000,"content":"Applied behavior analysis (ABA) interventions first introduced by Lovas in the 1960s have been proven historically effective in reducing challenging behaviors such as self-harm aggressive behaviors and improving communicative language skills in children with autism. While the interventions have evolved, focusing on restricting punishments and enforcing more reinforcements to teach skills, some concerns are yet to be evaluated. With the boom of ABA in Asia, this review focuses on understanding the techniques used and the progression of ABA by reviewing the existing literature. It aims to critically analyze the ABA strategies used to target challenging behaviors and teach new skills to gauge their long-term impact on children undergoing these interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"677394e4de8d8a92d6848a9d9bd35ef1297b936124124a4786243080f7c595c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
