{"title":"Living on low-incomes with multiple long-term health conditions: A new method to explore the complex interaction between finance and health","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305827","date":1719410400000,"content":"<p>by Olga Biosca, Enrico Bellazzecca, Cam Donaldson, Ahalya Bala, Marta Mojarrieta, Gregory White, Neil McHugh, Rachel Baker, Jonathan Morduch</p>\r\n\r\nPeople on low-incomes in the UK develop multiple long-term health conditions over 10 years earlier than affluent individuals. Financial diaries -new to public health- are used to explore the lived experiences of financially-vulnerable individuals, diagnosed with at least one long-term condition, living in two inner-city London Boroughs. Findings show that the health status of these individuals is a key barrier to work opportunities, undermining their income. Their precarious and uncertain financial situation, sometimes combined with housing issues, increased stress and anxiety which, in turn, contributed to further deteriorate participantsâ€™ health. Long-term health conditions limited the strategies to overcome moments of financial crisis and diarists frequently used credit to cope. Restrictions to access reliable services and timely support were connected to the progression of multiple long-term conditions. Models that integrate healthcare, public health, welfare and financial support are needed to slow down the progression from one to many long-term health conditions.","author":"Olga Biosca","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"395fc6e7509d4eeceed8158c87cb79a7f3ca60c7ee3552d60f58c4b410769e18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
