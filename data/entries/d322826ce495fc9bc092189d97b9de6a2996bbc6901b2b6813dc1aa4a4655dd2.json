{"title":"University Students’ Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence: An Exploratory Study of the Cognitive, Emotional, And Behavioural Dimensions of AI Attitudes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1360/v1","date":1724118066000,"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI) apps, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Siri, have taken society and higher education institutions by storm. Yet, there is a paucity of empirical studies recording and analysing university social sciences students’ attitudes toward AI. Hence, the present study draws upon a sample of 190 university students (82.45% female) from a Greek social sciences department to query what are the students’ attitudes toward AI in education and future employment and what factors correlated with these attitudes. Descriptive statistics revealed that students’ attitudes toward AI were mostly positive. A principal components analysis confirmed a three-component solution of attitudes toward AI, comprising cognitive, behavioural, and emotional dimensions. Comparative analysis of the three components indicated that the emotional dimension was the highest ranked, followed by the cognitive and behavioural dimensions. Pairwise correlation analyses revealed that the strongest correlate of cognitive, behavioural, and emotional components of attitudes toward AI was the future frequency of AI use, followed by general feelings of safety with technology. In conclusion, students display more emotional and cognitive favourable dispositions toward AI. The social background of the students and the prospective future use of AI play a key role in the formulation of attitudes toward AI. University educators need to provide more teaching and learning about AI to improve students’ attitudes toward AI and future AI use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d322826ce495fc9bc092189d97b9de6a2996bbc6901b2b6813dc1aa4a4655dd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
