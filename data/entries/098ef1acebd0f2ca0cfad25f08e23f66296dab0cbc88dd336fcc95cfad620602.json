In this study, we explore the potential for identifying a global analytic first integral in a generalized 3-dimensional chaotic system (2). Our work involves detailing the model of a new 3-D chaotic system characterized by three Lyapunov exponentsâ€”positive, zero, and negative. We depict the phase trajectories, illustrate bifurcation patterns, and visualize Lyapunov exponent graphs. The investigation encompasses both local and global analytic first integrals for the system, providing results on the existence and non-existence of these integrals for different parameter values. Our findings reveal that the system lacks a global first integral, and the presence or absence of analytic first integrals is contingent upon specific parameter values. Additionally, we present a formal series for the system, demonstrating 3D and 2D projections of the system (2) for a given set of initial conditions achieved by selecting alternative values for parameters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>.","author":"Ahmad Muhamad Husien","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"098ef1acebd0f2ca0cfad25f08e23f66296dab0cbc88dd336fcc95cfad620602","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
