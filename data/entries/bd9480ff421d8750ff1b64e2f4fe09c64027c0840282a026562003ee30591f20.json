{"title":"First paired observations of sexual behavior and calls in wild leopard seals","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00300-024-03275-4","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Little is known about the reproductive biology of the leopard seal (<em>Hydrurga leptonyx</em>), a Southern Ocean predator. Here we observed sexual behavior in wild leopard seals in Laguna San Rafael, Chile during a 2 h courtship interaction between a female and male. The female was hauled out on ice, mostly lying still (69% of the time) or moving (19%). The male was mostly under water (87%) or at the water’s surface (11%). The female made seven in-air calls (i.e., thump pulse, noseblast, blast, growl). The male produced 65 underwater calls (i.e., low- and high-double trills, unidentified trills). The underwater calls appeared to be directed toward the female. After the primary male vocalized for an hour, one or two unidentified leopard seals briefly swam near the female. After leaving the area, we heard underwater calls for another 8 h. The next day, the primary male was hauled out on ice with a swollen genital opening. The male was bleeding from a laceration caudal to the preputial opening, suggesting the male attempted to mate and that the female, or another seal, was responsible for the injury. Together, we find that leopard seal courtship involves a suite of behavioral and acoustic behaviors by both sexes, both in air and under water. This is the first description of leopard seal sexual behavior in the wild. Our study also provides the first evidence that leopard seals mate in South America.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"bd9480ff421d8750ff1b64e2f4fe09c64027c0840282a026562003ee30591f20","category":"Environment"}
