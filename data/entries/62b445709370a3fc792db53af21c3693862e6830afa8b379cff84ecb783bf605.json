We evaluated the incidence and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis among PLWH. We also assessed factors related to vaccination coverage in the Balearic Islands.</p> Methods <p>A retrospective analytical study was performed, including patients from the Balearic cohort (EVHIA) who were visited at least twice between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2020 and 31<sup>st</sup> March 2022. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were estimated to identify risk factors.</p> Results <p>A total of 3567 patients with HIV were included. The median age was 51 years (IQR 44–59). Most of them were male (77,3%), from Europe (82,1%) or South America (13,8%). During the study period 1036 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (29%). The incidence rate was 153,24 cases per 1000 person-year. After multivariable analysis, men who have sex with men (MSM) were associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio 1,324, 95% CI 1,138–1,540), whereas African origin, tobacco use and complete or booster vaccination coverage were negatively related. Overall, complete vaccination or booster coverage was recorded in 2845 (79,75%) patients. When analysing vaccination uptake, older patients (adjusted hazard ratio 5,122, 95% CI 3,170–8,288) and those with a modified comorbidity index of 2–3 points (adjusted hazard ratio 1,492, 95% CI 1,056–2,107) had received more vaccine doses.</p> Conclusions <p>In our study no HIV related factor was associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for differences in the transmission route. Possible confounding variables such as mask wearing or social interactions could not be measured. Vaccines were of utmost importance to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts should be made to encourage vaccination in those groups of PLWH with less coverage.</p>","author":"Francisca Artigues Serra","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"62b445709370a3fc792db53af21c3693862e6830afa8b379cff84ecb783bf605","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
