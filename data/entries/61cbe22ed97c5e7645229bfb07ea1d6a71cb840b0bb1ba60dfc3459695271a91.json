{"title":"Improving Methods for Imaging Viral Pathogens Using Liquid Transmission Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.992/7720333?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Interest in the study of viruses has dramatically increased since the emergence of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus and its devasting impact in the United States and beyond [<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B1\">1</a>]. Globally, research has pivoted towards understanding pandemic pathogens to identify new vaccines and drug therapies to curb viral transmission and save lives. To this end, traditional and cryo-electron microscopy (EM) methods have been primarily used to study virions and elicit key details of their structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B3\">3</a>]. However, these techniques only provide a snapshot of static structures, frozen and unmoving, in contrast to the dynamic liquid state in which they natively reside and assemble. Further, the visualizations of dynamic interactions could be key for understanding virus interactions and treatment efficacy. Using novel liquid-transmission EM (TEM) tools, high-resolution nanoscale interactions can be visualized in <span>real time</span>, giving researchers the capability to capture <span>in situ</span> dynamics and perform structural characterization of biological assemblies in native hydrated conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B4\">4</a>]. Scanning TEM (STEM) imaging and elemental analysis such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are possible in liquid [<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B5\">5</a>] â€“ an otherwise challenging feat in cryo conditions due to destructive beam interactions with frozen specimens, limiting their use in structural biology. In STEM mode, signal interpretation is simpler based on composition and density contrast, which is a major benefit for facilitating imaging of thicker liquid samples such as whole cells or clusters of virions [<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.992-B6\">6</a>]. Despite these capabilities, limited research has explored liquid-S/TEM for structural biology research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"61cbe22ed97c5e7645229bfb07ea1d6a71cb840b0bb1ba60dfc3459695271a91","category":"Environment"}
