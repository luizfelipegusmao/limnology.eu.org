{"title":"Identifying covariate-related subnetworks for whole-brain connectome analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/2/541/7111988?rss=1","date":1681084800000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Whole-brain connectome data characterize the connections among distributed neural populations as a set of edges in a large network, and neuroscience research aims to systematically investigate associations between brain connectome and clinical or experimental conditions as covariates. A covariate is often related to a number of edges connecting multiple brain areas in an organized structure. However, in practice, neither the covariate-related edges nor the structure is known. Therefore, the understanding of underlying neural mechanisms relies on statistical methods that are capable of simultaneously identifying covariate-related connections and recognizing their network topological structures. The task can be challenging because of false-positive noise and almost infinite possibilities of edges combining into subnetworks. To address these challenges, we propose a new statistical approach to handle multivariate edge variables as outcomes and output covariate-related subnetworks. We first study the graph properties of covariate-related subnetworks from a graph and combinatorics perspective and accordingly bridge the inference for individual connectome edges and covariate-related subnetworks. Next, we develop efficient algorithms to exact covariate-related subnetworks from the whole-brain connectome data with an $\\ell_0$ norm penalty. We validate the proposed methods based on an extensive simulation study, and we benchmark our performance against existing methods. Using our proposed method, we analyze two separate resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets for schizophrenia research and obtain highly replicable disease-related subnetworks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"af65276603881320edb6fcf1afd424d94d701dd8f59088dac318ba8bd5209790","category":"Environment"}
