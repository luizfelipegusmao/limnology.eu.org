This paper adopts the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method to investigate the structural topology optimization of the L-shaped bracket in the APTS, aiming to minimize structural compliance while using volume, key point displacement, and maximum stress as constraints. In the optimization model, differences in the topology of the L-shaped bracket structure are explored to minimize structural compliance, which is done under volume, key point displacement, and stress constraints, the results are compared with the initial reinforced structure. The innovative L-shaped bracket structure obtained through topology optimization uses significantly less material than the initial reinforced design, while still meeting the displacement and stress constraints. After smoothing, rounding, and finite element analysis, the displacement and stress performance of the optimized L-shaped bracket structure satisfies the set constraints. The method proposed in this paper offers an innovative solution for the lightweight design of mechanical support structures in APTS, with significant engineering application potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"053e05b9d0bdc8d7a8f19bf25dec2a6223cf44ecf34634cc6a0996ca65427d17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
