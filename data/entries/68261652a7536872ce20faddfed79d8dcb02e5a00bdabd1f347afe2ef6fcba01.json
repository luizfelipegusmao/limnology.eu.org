{"title":"Item Development of the Family Conditions for Measuring Family Resilience: Directed Content Analysis Based on Literature and Family Interviews","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0561/v1","date":1725626663000,"content":"When experiencing a variety of family negative events, families recognized as having high family resilience maintain and improve family functioning. It is important, therefore, to be able to assess families lacking in family resilience in order to prevent, reduce, or ameliorate family symptoms. The purpose of this study was to clarify the state of exerted family resilience in order to create an assessment scale for insufficiencies in family resilience (IFR). Family resilience is defined as “when a family becomes aware of family symptoms, its power to autonomously and actively improve its own family functions.” The results of a literature review of 22 cases from 16 studies on family resilience and the results of 28 semi-structured interviews with 28 parenting-age families in Japan were qualitatively categorized, and directed content analysis was conducted based on the Concentric Sphere Family Environment Theory. A total of 157 labels, with a total of 23 categories and 47 subcategories, such as “Can utilize relatives,” “Family members can communicate with members of other families,” “Family members can share information,” “All family members can communicate with one another,” “All family members can cooperate with one another,” and “Can share time with family,” was revealed. Thus, a variety of diverse aspects contributing to a family’s resilience, including family member interactions, entire family interactions, use of social resources, and religious and spiritual support, were revealed. The results of this study should be linked to the creation of the IFR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68261652a7536872ce20faddfed79d8dcb02e5a00bdabd1f347afe2ef6fcba01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
