{"title":"Validation of ToucHb, a non-invasive haemoglobin estimation: Effective for normal ranges, needs improvement for anaemia detection","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001541","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Yogish Channa Basappa, Sumanth Mallikarjuna Majgi, Shashidhar Byrappa Shashidhar, Prashanth Nuggehalli Srinivas</p>\r\n\r\nNon-invasive methods for haemoglobin estimation hold enormous potential for early detection and treatment of anaemia, especially in limited resource settings. We sought to validate the diagnostic accuracy of ToucHb, a non-invasive haemoglobin estimation device available in the Indian market. We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of the ToucHb device using the Automated complete blood count (CBC) method as the gold standard. Persons referred for haemoglobin estimation to the central laboratory of the government medical college hospital in Mysore, southern India were included in the study. Out Of 140 people approached, 127 gave consent; 65% (n = 82) were female with median age of 37 (IQR 28â€“45). ToucHB reported median haemoglobin value of 14 g/dL compared to 13.3 g/dL for CBC. Within 1 g/dL and 2 g/dL of CBC, 55.2% (70/127) and 74% (94/127) of ToucHb haemoglobin observations fell, respectively. The Bland-Altman plot showed a mean difference of 3 g/dL in haemoglobin between ToucHb and CBC among those with anaemia. The ToucHb device showed 22.2% sensitivity and 94.5% specificity for anaemia detection. In rural resource-limited settings, point of care non-invasive devices such as ToucHb can improve access and acceptance for anaemia screening. However, ToucHb has showed low sensitivity for anaemia detection and low accuracy at lower haemoglobin values. The utility of the instrument is especially limited in detecting anaemia, while it can estimate haemoglobin accurately among those with haemoglobin is in the normal range. Based on these findings, ToucHb and devices that work on the core technology deployed in ToucHb may be better suited to monitor known haemoglobin level rather than in anaemia screening or detection in primary/ secondary care and community settings.","author":"Yogish Channa Basappa","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"1b15495a6a0b3597a310af0b6cf3b0f723a138777e2249bb6785d4234a069230","category":"Environment"}
