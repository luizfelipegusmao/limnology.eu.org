The anti-allergic inflammatory effect of β-eudesmol (BE) on the tight junction (TJ) of the airway epithelium has not previously been reported. Herein, the barrier protective effect of BE was determined by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance and by paracellular permeability assay in an IL-4/13-treated 16HBE14o- monolayer. Pre-treatment of BE concentration- and time- dependently inhibited IL-4/13-induced TJ barrier disruption, with the most significant effect observed at 20 μM. Cytotoxicity analyses showed that BE, either alone or in combination with IL-4/13, had no effect on cell viability. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that BE inhibited IL-4/13-induced mislocalization of TJ components, including occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), without affecting the expression of these two proteins. In addition, the mechanism of the TJ-protective effect of BE was mediated by inhibition of IL-4/13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, in which BE might serve as an antagonist of cytokine receptors. <i>In silico</i> molecular docking analysis demonstrated that BE potentially interacted with the site I pocket of the type 2 IL-4 receptor, likely at Asn-126 and Tyr-127 amino acid residues. It can therefore be concluded that BE is able to prevent IL-4/13-induced TJ disassembly by interfering with cytokine-receptor interaction, leading to suppression of STAT6-induced mislocalization of occludin and ZO-1. BE is a promising candidate for a therapeutic intervention for inflammatory airway epithelial disorders driven by IL-4/13.","author":"Phuntila Tharabenjasin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"42500b0adab344e4602e57812ad5b8b340f8fdc06224801edc8e0cbc41b237bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
