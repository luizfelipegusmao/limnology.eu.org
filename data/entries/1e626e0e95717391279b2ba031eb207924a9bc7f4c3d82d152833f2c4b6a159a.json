{"title":"Effect of β‐sitosterol+γ‐oryzanol‐based oleogels on protein conformation and gel properties of Nemiperus virgatus surimi","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13944?af=R","date":1728989952000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The impact of <i>β</i>-sitosterol+<i>γ</i>-oryzanol-based oleogels or peanut oil on the protein conformation and gel quality of <i>Nemiperus virgatus</i> surimi was evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A significant reduction in gel strength, texture parameters and water holding capacity (WHC) of surimi was found as oil concentration increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). However, compared with peanut oil, the gel strength, hydrophobic interaction and disulfide bond content of surimi gel containing oleogels increased by 6.919%, 32.635% and 12.409%, respectively, when the oil concentration was 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. Both oleogels and peanut oil could enhance the whiteness of surimi gel. Oleogels induced the unfolding of surimi proteins, and promoted the conformational shift from <i>α</i>-helix to <i>β</i>-sheet structure. Furthermore, oleogels filled the gaps of protein networks to make the microstructure of surimi gel more compact and uniform, improving the WHC and reducing the cooking loss.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>γ</i>-Oryzanol+<i>β</i>-sitosterol-based oleogel alleviated the adverse influences of direct addition of peanut oil on the gel and textural properties of surimi products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hongbo Mi, \nYingci Yang, \nMiaomiao Tan, \nJianrong Li, \nXuepeng Li, \nJingxin Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1e626e0e95717391279b2ba031eb207924a9bc7f4c3d82d152833f2c4b6a159a","category":"Environment"}
