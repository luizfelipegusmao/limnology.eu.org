Current works only facilitate image-level sharing and use common cryptographic algorithms. To ensure efficient, controlled, and privacy-preserving image sharing at the area level, this paper proposes an image partition security-sharing mechanism based on blockchain and chaotic encryption, which mainly includes a fine-grained access control method based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and an image-specific chaotic encryption scheme. The proposed fine-grained access control method employs smart contracts based on the ABAC model to achieve automatic access control for private areas. It employs a Cuckoo filter-based transaction retrieval technique to enhance the efficiency of smart contracts in retrieving security attributes and policies on the blockchain. The proposed chaotic encryption scheme generates keys based on the private areasâ€™ security attributes, largely reducing the number of keys required. It also provides efficient encryption with vector operation acceleration. The security analysis and performance evaluation were conducted comprehensively. The results show that the proposed mechanism has lower time overhead than current works as the number of images increases.","author":"Na Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ab9888931fa80bd25ba9685cb7ca1a4d7a61401a7d97b8563570134f0d61f789","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
