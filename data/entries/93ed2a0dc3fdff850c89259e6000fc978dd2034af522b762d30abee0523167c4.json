{"title":"Evaluation of an IoT-Enabled Smart Cradle System for Enhanced Baby Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1105/v1","date":1728933368000,"content":"In  today’s fast-paced, modern world, parents often face significant challenges in balancing their professional responsibilities with the demands  of child monitoring and nurturing. Our project addresses these challenges by developing an IoT-based Smart Cradle Monitoring System, designed to assist parents in ensuring their child's well-being while they are working. The smart cradle features an automatic swinging mechanism that activates upon detecting the sound of a baby crying, soothing the baby promptly without requiring immediate parental intervention. Additionally, a web camera provides continuous video surveillance, allowing parents to monitor their child remotely in real-time through dedicated alerts. The system leverages IoT technology to connect various components, including an Arduino microcontroller, Raspberry Pi high-sensitivity sound sensors, and a motorized swinging mechanism. This integration ensures seamless operation and remote access, offering peace of mind to working parents. By upgrading traditional cradles with modern electronics, our project provides a reliable and efficient solution that enhances child care, ensuring both the child’s well-being and the parent’s peace of mind. This smart cradle is designed to alleviate the challenges faced by working parents, offering superior results compared to conventional cradles, and helping parents focus on their work while being reassured of their child's safety and comfort.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93ed2a0dc3fdff850c89259e6000fc978dd2034af522b762d30abee0523167c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
