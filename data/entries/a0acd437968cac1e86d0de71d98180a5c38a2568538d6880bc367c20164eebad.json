{"title":"Covid19 and Pregnancy: Infected Mothers and Premature Babies?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1341/v1","date":1711103007000,"content":"Introduction: The emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread and its subsequent global pan-demic have raised significant concerns regarding its impact on pregnancy outcomes. This review aims to summarize the emerging data on the risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nMaterials and Methods: A systematic search was conducted from March 2020 to December 2023 using PubMed, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies correlating maternal COVID-19 infection with preterm birth were included.\nResults: Thirteen studies were analyzed, indicating a higher incidence of preterm birth in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women compared to controls. The average incidence rate of pre-term birth in infected patients was 18.5%, with a median of 12.75%, while non infected women showed an average incidence of preterm birth of 10% with a median of 8.2%.\nDiscussion: Studies suggest an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and increased risk of preterm birth and cesarean section. Severity of symptoms and underlying comorbidities further elevate this risk. Notably, infections during the third trimester pose the highest risk of preterm birth.\nConclusion: Preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is crucial to mitigate adverse obstetric outcomes. Close monitoring and tailored interventions for infected pregnant women, particularly those in later trimesters and with comorbidities, are imperative to reduce the risk of preterm birth and improve maternal-fetal outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0acd437968cac1e86d0de71d98180a5c38a2568538d6880bc367c20164eebad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
