{"title":"Plasma Redox Balance in Advanced Maternal Age Pregnant Women and Effects of Plasma on Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1238/v1","date":1710950163000,"content":"Pregnancy at advanced maternal age (AMA) is a condition of potential risk for the development of maternal-fetal complications with possible repercussions even in the long-term. Here, we analyzed the changes of plasma redox balance and the effects of plasma on human umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (hUMSCs) in AMA pregnant women (patients) at various timing of pregnancy. One hundred patients and twenty pregnant women younger than 40 years (controls) were recruited, and evaluated at various timings during pregnancy until after delivery. Plasma samples were used to measure the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione and nitric oxide (NO). In addition, plasma was used to stimulate the hUMSCs, which were tested for cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO release. The obtained results showed that throughout pregnancy until after delivery in patients the levels of plasma glutathione and NO were lower than those of controls, while those of TBARS were higher. Moreover, plasma of patients reduced cell viability and NO release, and increased ROS release in hUMSCs. Our results highlighted alterations in the redox balance and the presence of potentially harmful circulating factors in plasma of patients They could have clinical relevance for the prevention of complications related to AMA pregnancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5df9aeda255d8383ecc0142e1adbeb82a1bbca6cfded7c36c0a52974c383cb97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
