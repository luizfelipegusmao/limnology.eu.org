{"title":"Recycling Reinforced: The Synergistic Dynamics of Sustainable Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0615/v1","date":1712645083000,"content":"Recent research has specifically targeted the decision-making process of eco-friendly individuals, emphasizing the significance of recycling and its impact on sustainability. Our study extends this inquiry by examining the correlation between recycling participation and pro-environmental behavior among consumers, integrating the concepts of self-efficacy, feelings of pride, and social pressure into our analysis. Utilizing Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we aimed to explore the intricate relationships that underpin these behaviors. Results suggest that self-efficacy and feelings of pride significantly influence individuals' recycling behaviors, highlighting the role of psychological and social factors in promoting environmental sustainability. Interestingly, it was concluded that social pressure did not have the expected moderating effect on increasing consumers' feelings of pride and self-efficacy toward recycling activities.This study not only sheds light on the underlying mechanisms that drive pro-environmental actions but also contributes to understanding sustainability promotion through recycling and offers insights for policymakers and environmental advocates to foster environmental responsibility and behavior change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adb0e1671e54ceaa035774e2714c3ae9b71b6c6c3c76889415277a5722d00c81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
