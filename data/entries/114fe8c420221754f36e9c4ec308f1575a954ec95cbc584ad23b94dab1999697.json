This allows the fabrication of a new generation of photocathodic p-DSSCs with previously unheard of unprecedentedly high concentrations of Ag (up to 80 mol%) evenly scattered in a TiO<sub>2</sub> matrix, and this efficacy is the highest ever reported for a p-type working Ag/TiO<sub>2</sub>/chlorophyll/iodine electrode. This may enable the use of this electrode as a component of photo-sensitizer tandem devices.
