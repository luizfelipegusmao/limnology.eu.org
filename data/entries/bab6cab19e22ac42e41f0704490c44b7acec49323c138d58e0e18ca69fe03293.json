{"title":"Comparison between Traditional and Innovative NMR Methods for the Analysis of Sicilian Monovarietal Extra Virgin Olive Oils: Metabolic Profile is Influenced by Micro Pedoclimatic Zones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2056/v1","date":1721907457000,"content":"The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic analysis was applied to investigate the differences within nineteen Sicilian Nocellara del Belice mono varietal Extra Virgin Olive Oils (EVOO), grown in two zones different for altitude and soil composition. Several classes of endogenous olive oil metabolites were quantified through a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) three-experiment protocol coupled with a yet developed data-processing called MARA-NMR. This method, taking around one-hour experimental time per sample, faces the possible quantification of different class of compounds at different concentration’s range which would require at least three alternative traditional methods. NMR results were compared with the data of traditional analytical methods to quantify free fatty acidity (FFA), fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), and total phenol content. The presented NMR methodology is compared with traditional analytical practices and its consistency is also tested through slightly different data treatment. Despite the rich literature about the NMR of EVOOs, the paper points out that there are still several advances potentially improving this general analysis and overcoming the other cumbersome and multi-devices analytical strategies. Monovarietal EVOO’s composition is mainly affected by pedoclimatic conditions in turn relaying upon the nutritional properties, quality, and authenticity. Data collection, analysis and statistical processing are discussed touching the important issues related to the climate changes in Sicily and to the specific influence of pedoclimatic conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bab6cab19e22ac42e41f0704490c44b7acec49323c138d58e0e18ca69fe03293","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
