{"title":"Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and its association with cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297785","date":1713794400000,"content":"<p>by Wan-li He, Fei-xia Chang, Tao Wang, Bi-xia Sun, Rui-rong Chen, Lian-ping Zhao</p>\r\nObjective <p>To compare the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with healthy controls (HC) and evaluate the BDNF levels in T2DM patients with/without cognitive impairment.</p> Methods <p>PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for the published English literature on BDNF in T2DM patients from inception to December 2022. The BDNF data in the T2DM and HC groups were extracted, and the study quality was evaluated using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. A meta-analysis of the pooled data was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software.</p> Results <p>A total of 18 English articles fulfilled with inclusion criteria. The standard mean difference of the serum BDNF level was significantly lower in T2DM than that in the HC group (SMD: -2.04, z = 11.19, <i>P</i> &lt;0.001). Besides, T2DM cognitive impairment group had a slightly lower serum BDNF level compared to the non-cognitive impairment group (SMD: -2.59, z = 1.87, <i>P</i> = 0.06).</p> Conclusion <p>BDNF might be involved in the neuropathophysiology of cerebral damage in T2DM, especially cognitive impairment in T2DM.</p>","author":"Wan-li He","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"256223951e7c6ac39baacefde47f3246b3ae57f4703611e7b8401034e0f5cd0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
