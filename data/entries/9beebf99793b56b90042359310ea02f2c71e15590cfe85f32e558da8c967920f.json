{"title":"Characterization of individual bile acids in vivo utilizing a novel low bile acid mouse model","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/2/316/7634545?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bile acids (BAs) are signaling molecules synthesized in the liver initially by CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 in the classical and alternative pathways, respectively. BAs are essential for cholesterol clearance, intestinal absorption of lipids, and endogenous modulators of farnesoid x receptor (FXR). FXR is critical in maintaining BA homeostasis and gut-liver crosstalk. Complex reactions <span>in vivo</span> and the lack of suitable animal models impede our understanding of the functions of individual BAs. In this study, we characterized the <span>in vivo</span> effects of three-day feeding of cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at physiological/non-hepatotoxic concentrations in a novel low-BA mouse model (<span>Cyp7a1−</span><sup>/</sup><sup><span>−</span></sup>/<span>Cyp27a1−</span><sup>/</sup><sup><span>−</span></sup>, DKO). Liver injury, BA levels and composition and BA signaling by the FXR-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) axis were determined. Overall, higher basal inflammation and altered lipid metabolism in DKO mice might be associated with low BAs. CA, DCA, and UDCA feeding activated FXR signals with tissue specificity. Dietary CA and DCA similarly altered tissue BA profiles to be less hydrophobic, while UDCA promoted a more hydrophobic tissue BA pool with the profiles shifted toward non-12α-OH BAs and secondary BAs. However, UDCA did not offer any overt protective effects as expected. These findings allow us to determine the precise effects of individual BAs <span>in vivo</span> on BA-FXR signaling and overall BA homeostasis in liver physiology and pathologies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"9beebf99793b56b90042359310ea02f2c71e15590cfe85f32e558da8c967920f","category":"Environment"}
