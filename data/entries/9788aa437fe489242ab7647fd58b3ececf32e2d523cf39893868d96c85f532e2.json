One such system is twisted double bilayer (tDB-) CrI<sub>3</sub>, where spin frustration in individual moiré cells results in coexisting ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) ground states [<a href=\"#ozae044.544-B3\">3-5</a>]. However, the structure of few layer twisted CrI<sub>3</sub> still remains relatively unstudied. Dark-field transmission electron microscopy (DF-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are powerful techniques for characterization of moiré domains in twisted materials providing information on the stacking order, real-space periodicity, and soliton boundaries [<a href=\"#ozae044.544-B6\">6</a>]. These diffraction-based techniques are especially useful for air-sensitive systems like 2D vdW magnets where crystalline capping layers obscure real space signals [<a href=\"#ozae044.544-B7\">7</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9788aa437fe489242ab7647fd58b3ececf32e2d523cf39893868d96c85f532e2","category":"Environment"}
