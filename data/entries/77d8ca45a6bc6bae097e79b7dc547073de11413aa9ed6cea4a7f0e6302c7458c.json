{"title":"Design and Verification of Self-Propelled Electric Tea Seed Planter Based on Orthogonal Test","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0922/v1","date":1710501126000,"content":"A self-propelled electric tea seed-planter is designed to address the lack of tea seed seeding equipment, low seeding efficiency, and poor seeding uniformity. Based on the physical characteristics of the tea seeds and the agronomic requirements of tea planting, the key structure of the planter is designed, and the structural parameters are determined. The motor and battery configurations are determined by calculating the power consumption of the entire machine. In a field experiment, the driving gear (A), ditching depth (B), and planting gear position (C) are used as test factors, and the acceptance index (AI), replay index (RI) and leakage index (LI) are used as test indexes. The test results showed that the driving speed and planting gear position significantly affect the acceptance index, replay, and leakage index, whereas the ditching depth has little effect on the performance indexes. When the driving speed was medium, ditching depth was 30 mm, and planting gear position was in the third gear, the corresponding acceptance index was 87.22%, the replay index was 8.89%, and the leakage index was 3.89%. The test prototype has a good working quality and can provide theoretical guidance for production practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77d8ca45a6bc6bae097e79b7dc547073de11413aa9ed6cea4a7f0e6302c7458c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
