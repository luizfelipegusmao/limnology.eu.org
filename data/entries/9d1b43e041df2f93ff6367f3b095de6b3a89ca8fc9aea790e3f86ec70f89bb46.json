{"title":"Changjiang River (China) Suspended Sediment Concentration Estimation with Sentinel-2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1032/v1","date":1715785946000,"content":"Spatiotemporal variations of sediments transported along rivers play a crucial role in a wide spectrum of uses, such as navigation, recreation, habitats or hydropower production. The advancement in technology has made it possible to use various indirect techniques to study and evaluate the transport of suspended sediment in fluvial environments. To investigate large-scale phenomena, remote sensing is becoming a largely utilized approach, as it allows to combine spatially-distributed and local information. Dam-induced sediment reduction occurs in large and small rivers worldwide, having profound implications on the fluvial systems. However, the systematic change of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and its dynamic processes are not well known, and generally investigated only at the very local scale using field information. In this work, SSC maps were created by combining satellite images with local monitoring SSC data, using the Zhijiang -Chenglingji reach of the Changjiang River (China) as a case study, and analyzing how SSC dynamics changed over the period 2017-2022 in correspondence of extreme events. Multiple relationships between measured SSC and bands reflectance were tested, showing the potential of the best-performing one (R2=0.43) in mapping SSC spatiotemporal variations over an extent of dozens of kilometres, eventually providing new insights into the SSC dynamics at hotspots of the river systems, such as confluence zones, barriers, and reservoirs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d1b43e041df2f93ff6367f3b095de6b3a89ca8fc9aea790e3f86ec70f89bb46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
