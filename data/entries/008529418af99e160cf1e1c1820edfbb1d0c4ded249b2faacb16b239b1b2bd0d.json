{"title":"Clinical, Diagnostic, and Metabolic Characteristics Associated with Nephrolithiasis in the Black Women’s Health Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0888/v1","date":1726061449000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Nephrolithiasis is a common urologic condition and a significant source of patient morbidity and healthcare expenditure. Despite the higher prevalence of metabolic risk factors for nephrolithiasis among Black women, there have been few epidemiologic studies of kidney stones focusing on this group.  Methods:  We describe demographic and health characteristics, diagnostic, and metabolic profiles of women with self-reported kidney stones among participants in the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a large prospective cohort of U.S. Black women.  Results:  Among the 2,750 BWHS participants who completed an online supplemental questionnaire assessing urologic health, 201 women reported nephrolithiasis. Of this number, 62% had completed ≥16 years of education and 82% reported access to health care. Overall, 39% reported experiencing ≥2 stones in their lifetime and 29% required surgery to treat the condition. Thirty-two percent reported having completed a metabolic evaluation, while 70% had undergone a CT-scan to diagnose nephrolithiasis. The frequency of metabolic evaluation increased with the number of metabolic components reported: 3% (0 components) to 43% (3-4 components). Conclusions:  Our findings are consistent with reports of lower rates of metabolic evaluation among Black patients despite their having multiple risk factors for nephrolithiasis. Further study is needed to identify the barriers and facilitators of metabolic and diagnostic workup of nephrolithiasis in Black women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"008529418af99e160cf1e1c1820edfbb1d0c4ded249b2faacb16b239b1b2bd0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
