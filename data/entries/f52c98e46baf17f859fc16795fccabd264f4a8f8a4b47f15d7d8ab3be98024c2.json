Soft x-ray tomography (SXT), employing low energy X-rays (E ∼500 eV) in the so called ‘water-window’, is the unique technology that can image whole intact cells in 3D under normal and pathological conditions without labelling or fixation, at high throughput and spatial resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.1052-B1\">1-4</a>]. The main challenge of SXM is that the photonic illumination required for imaging has heretofore only been available at synchrotron labs [<a href=\"#ozae044.1052-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f52c98e46baf17f859fc16795fccabd264f4a8f8a4b47f15d7d8ab3be98024c2","category":"Environment"}
