{"title":"The Arabidopsis katamari2 Mutant Exhibits a Hypersensitive Seedling Arrest Response at the Phase Transition from Heterotrophic to Autotrophic Growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/3/350/7510911?rss=1","date":1701907200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Young seedlings use nutrients stored in the seeds to grow and acquire photosynthetic potential. This process, called seedling establishment, involves a developmental phase transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth. Some membrane-trafficking mutants of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), such as the <span>katamari2</span> (<span>kam2</span>) mutant, exhibit growth arrest during seedling development, with a portion of individuals failing to develop true leaves on sucrose-free solid medium. However, the reason for this seedling arrest is unclear. In this study, we show that seedling arrest is a temporal growth arrest response that occurs not only in <span>kam2</span> but also in wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis; however, the threshold for this response is lower in <span>kam2</span> than in the WT. A subset of the arrested <span>kam2</span> seedlings resumed growth after transfer to fresh sucrose-free medium. Growth arrest in <span>kam2</span> on sucrose-free medium was restored by increasing the gel concentration of the medium or covering the surface of the medium with a perforated plastic sheet. WT Arabidopsis seedlings were also arrested when the gel concentration of sucrose-free medium was reduced. RNA sequencing revealed that transcriptomic changes associated with the rate of seedling establishment were observed as early as 4â€‰d after sowing. Our results suggest that the growth arrest of both <span>kam2</span> and WT seedlings is an adaptive stress response and is not simply caused by the lack of a carbon source in the medium. This study provides a new perspective on an environmental stress response under unfavorable conditions during the phase transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"c0f6d74392b67c27898dffb6b89d4da7d4bf160c5725362620abc438b2f0a2f8","category":"Environment"}
