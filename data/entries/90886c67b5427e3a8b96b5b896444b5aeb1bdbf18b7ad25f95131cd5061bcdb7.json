{"title":"VRChances: An Immersive Virtual Reality Experience to Support Teenagers in Their Career Decisions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1763/v1","date":1721727443000,"content":"Choosing a career path is an important decision in a person’s life and forms the basis for their future direction. It impacts the future career and influences financial stability as well as the person’s well-being. Many people struggle to find out what they are interested in and talented in, making it difficult to choose a fitting career path. Therefore, the decision-making process requires careful consideration, self-reflection, and exploring numerous options. While virtual environments provide an effective way to explore different experiences, virtual reality (VR) offers users immersive interactions with simulated 3D environments. This allows the realistic exploration of different job fields in a virtual environment without being physically present. VR 360-degree videos have been shown to significantly increase job interest among students. The ability to review and refine performance makes VR an ideal tool for career skill development as well as career guidance. In this paper, we present a tool that offers young people virtual career guidance through an immersive VR experience. The study investigates the extent to which performing occupational tasks in a virtual environment influences the career perceptions of young adults and whether it enhances their understanding of professions. In total, 23 teenagers and 8 application experts were involved to assess the teenager’s expectations and the potential of the career guidance tool.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90886c67b5427e3a8b96b5b896444b5aeb1bdbf18b7ad25f95131cd5061bcdb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
