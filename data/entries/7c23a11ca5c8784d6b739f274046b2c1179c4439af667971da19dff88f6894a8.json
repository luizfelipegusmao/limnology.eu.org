{"title":"Hydration and Mechanical Properties of Cement Kiln Dust Blended Cement Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1172/v1","date":1726472510000,"content":"This study aims to investigate the effects of cement kiln dust (CKD) on the hydration reactions and mechanical properties of cement and to evaluate its potential for use as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM). The key variables are the CKD type and incorporation rate. Cement paste and mortar specimens containing CKD were prepared to examine their effects on the cement hydration and mechanical properties. The impact on hydration was assessed using setting time measurements, heat of hydration tests, and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). In addition, compressive strength tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of CKD on the mechanical properties of the cement. The results indicated that CKD promoted early cement hydration and enhanced the early age mechanical properties. However, owing to its lack of pozzolanic reactivity, it did not significantly affect long-term hydration. Given that the effects of CKD vary slightly depending on its chemical composition, careful consideration of CKD's properties suggests that its potential use as a SCM is promising.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c23a11ca5c8784d6b739f274046b2c1179c4439af667971da19dff88f6894a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
