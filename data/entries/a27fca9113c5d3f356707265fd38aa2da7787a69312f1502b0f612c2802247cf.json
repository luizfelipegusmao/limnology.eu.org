{"title":"Risk Factors Associated with Lost to Follow Up Tuberculosis Treatment in the Sanatorium Hospital of Luanda, Angola","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0058/v1","date":1714542309000,"content":"Background: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a serious public health threat that affects the most vulnerable population. Patients who are LTFU after TB diagnosis still represent one of the biggest challenges to TB control. \nMethod: In this prospective observational study, we aimed to identify and analyse the risk factors associated with LTFU among TB patients who started first-line TB treatment in the Sanatorium Hospital in Luanda. \nResult: A total of 113 patients with TB were included between August 2018 and September 2019. Seventy-six (67.3%) patients were cured, 27 (23.9%) were LTFU, 5 (4.4%) died, 4 (3.5%) were transferred and 1 (0.9%) presented a treatment failure. After excluding those dead, transferred or who failed to treatment, we observed that severe TB at the time of diagnosis (OR 9.24, 95% CI 2.18-39.04) and food insecurity were significantly associated with LTFU (OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.66-21.41). \nConclusion: The findings of our study are of enormous value to understand the reasons for the LTFU of patients with TB and can guide polices and facilitate designing measures to allow better adherence, and therefore, greater treatment success","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a27fca9113c5d3f356707265fd38aa2da7787a69312f1502b0f612c2802247cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
