{"title":"Efficacy of Curcumin-Mediated Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy on Candida spp. - A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0577/v1","date":1720422267000,"content":"Oral candidiasis is a common problem among immunocompetent patients. The frequent resistance of Candida strains to popular antimycotics makes it necessary to look for alternative methods of treatment. The authors conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The objective of this review was to determine whether curcumin-mediated aPDT and blue light could be considered as an alternative treatment for oral candidiasis. PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases were searched using a combination of the following keywords: (Candida OR candidiasis oral OR candidosis oral OR denture stomatitis) AND (curcumin OR photodynamic therapy OR aPDT OR photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy OR PACT OR photodynamic inactivation OR PDI). The review included in vitro laboratory studies with Candida spp., in vivo animal studies, and randomized control trials (RCTs) involving patients with oral candidiasis or prosthetic stomatitis, published only in English. The method of elimination of Candida species in the studies was curcumin-mediated aPDT. 757 studies were identified. Following the analysis of the titles and abstracts of the studies, only 42 studies were selected for in-depth screening, after which 26 were included in this study. All studies evaluated the antifungal efficacy of curcumin-mediated aPDT against C. albicans and non-albicans Candida. In studies conducted with planktonic cells solutions, seven studies demonstrated complete elimination of Candida spp. cells. The remaining studies demonstrated only partial elimination. In all cases, experiments on single-species yeast biofilms demonstrated partial, statistically significant inhibition of cell growth and reduction of biofilm mass. In vivo, curcumin-mediated aPDT has shown good antifungal activity against oral candidiasis also in an animal model. However, its clinical efficacy as a potent therapeutic strategy for oral candidiasis requires further RCTs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c05f87f4bab67f85f1289e179a712ab0bf3af16cd87bbcc25f2a83eea3a0c86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
