{"title":"Wood-Cement Composites: A Sustainable Approach for Mitigating Environmental Impact in Construction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0974/v1","date":1726148981000,"content":"There is a growing awareness of the detrimental environmental impact of the construction industry, primarily due to the utilization of building materials that necessitate energy-intensive processes for their production. The objective of this paper is to explore whether mixing wood and cement could serve as a viable solution to mitigate this adverse environmental effect. The data was obtained by extensively investigating the Clarivate Web of Science database, adhering to the PRISMA technique guidelines, and subsequently processed using Bibliometrix and VOSviewer software. An in-depth critical analysis of the literature revealed a heightened interest in this subject matter in recent years, with the focal points evolving from initial experimental endeavors aimed at understanding the behavior of the innovative wood cement composites, primarily in terms of their mechanical properties, to assessing their environmental impact and the advantages associated with their use. The researchers suggest that optimal results can be achieved by treating the wood with tetraethyl orthosilicate, incorporating cellulose nanocrystal particles or wollastonite into the mixture, and utilizing wood from the Pinus species. Furthermore, it was discovered that a noticeable improvement in strength is only attainable if a low percentage of wood, up to 30%, when wood ash is employed. Ongoing research concerning wood and cement composites continues to progress, with regular advancements and breakthroughs, thus offering promising prospects for the development of superior and eco-friendly building materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2cf680c76f59ed04d0ba6cb7768bb6157e5e3046b3e7e5e8c14ada009d992ae6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
