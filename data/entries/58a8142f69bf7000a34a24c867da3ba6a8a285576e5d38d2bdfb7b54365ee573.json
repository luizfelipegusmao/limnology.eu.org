{"title":"Exploring Phytochemical Therapies for Long COVID: A Computational Docking Study of Phytochemicals with GPCR Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0829/v1","date":1723464780000,"content":"Long COVID is the collective term used to describe the persistence of symptoms in individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some people who have healed from COVID-19 continue to experience new or persistent symptoms that last for weeks or months. While Long COVID is becoming more widely recognized, its fundamental causes and effective therapies remain largely unclear. This study aims to explore the potential of phytochemical medications as a cutting-edge therapeutic strategy for treating Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which play a critical role in cell signaling, were the focus of this study. GPCRs are known to be involved in immunological and inflammatory responses and are considered potential targets for Long COVID therapy. The GPCRs examined included chemokine receptors, serotonin receptors, adrenergic receptors, and histamine receptors. The docking results demonstrated high binding affinity between phytochemical drug structures and these receptors for most drug-receptor combinations.The study consists of three main parts. First, data on receptors and drugs were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and PubChem, respectively. The receptors selected are those predicted to be linked to Long COVID. The structure of the drugs was converted from SDF to PDB format using OpenBabel from ChemInfo. Docking studies were performed to assess the binding affinity between the drugs (ligands) and their respective receptors (binding sites) using iGemDock v2.1.In conclusion, the findings of this study could have significant implications for the development of alternative therapies for Long COVID.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58a8142f69bf7000a34a24c867da3ba6a8a285576e5d38d2bdfb7b54365ee573","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
