{"title":"Case Series of Mild Myocarditis: The Role of Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Detecting a Patchy Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0667/v1","date":1715329802000,"content":"There is increasing evidence that myocarditis starts as a patchy process, accordingly, the detection of segmental affection is important for early recognition of the disease and proper initiation of anti-inflammatory treatment. We present our first experience here with using speckle-tracking echocardiography to detect subtle segmental involvement of the left ventricle in two cases with suspected myocarditis. STE consolidated the diagnosis and helped with the early initiation of intravenous immunoglobulins and subsequent control of the disease. STE was also able to show the specific topography of distribution, of each pathogen linked to inflammation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94eb90e3105e47360f8e4fefba569abedef0519e526cae9d11b4164d737eb442","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
