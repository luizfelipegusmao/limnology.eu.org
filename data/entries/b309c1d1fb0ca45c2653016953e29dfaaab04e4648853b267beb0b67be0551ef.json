Transcription occurs in three steps — initiation, elongation and termination. RNAPs are multi-subunit enzymes that catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds using ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates and are structurally and functionally conserved among all three domains of life [<a href=\"#ozae044.381-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.381-B2\">2</a>]. Holoenzyme of multisubunit <span>E. coli</span> RNAP consists of a sigma factor (σ) and five subunits: two alpha (α) subunits, a small omega (ω) subunit, a beta (β) and a beta prime (β′) subunits, which together with the catalytic magnesium ion form the active site [<a href=\"#ozae044.381-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.381-B4\">4</a>].
