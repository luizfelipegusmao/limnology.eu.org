{"title":"ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 promotes auxin signalling by regulating SHY2 expression to control primary root growth in response to dehydration stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/5111/7678750?rss=1","date":1716249600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants combat dehydration stress through different strategies including root architectural changes. Here we show that when exposed to varying levels of dehydration stress, primary root growth in Arabidopsis is modulated by regulating root meristem activity. Abscisic acid (ABA) in concert with auxin signalling adjust primary root growth according to stress levels. ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3), an ABA-responsive transcription factor, stands at the intersection of ABA and auxin signalling and fine-tunes primary root growth in response to dehydration stress. Under low ABA or dehydration stress, induction of <span>ABI3</span> expression promotes auxin signalling by decreasing expression of <span>SHY2</span>, a negative regulator of auxin response. This further enhances the expression of auxin transporter gene <span>PIN1</span> and cell cycle gene <span>CYCB1;1</span>, resulting in an increase in primary root meristem size and root length. Higher levels of dehydration stress or ABA repress <span>ABI3</span> expression and promote <span>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 5</span> (<span>ABI5</span>) expression. This elevates <span>SHY2</span> expression, thereby impairing primary root meristem activity and retarding root growth. Notably, ABI5 can promote <span>SHY2</span> expression only in the absence of ABI3. Such ABA concentration-dependent expression of <span>ABI3</span> therefore functions as a regulatory sensor of dehydration stress levels and orchestrates primary root growth by coordinating its downstream regulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"407ec281f2907a418e9f3457894ec05126688a54a5f5ed3ba27eb2417f2c18dc","category":"Environment"}
