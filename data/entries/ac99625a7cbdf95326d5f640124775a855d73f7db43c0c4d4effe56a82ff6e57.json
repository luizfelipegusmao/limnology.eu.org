{"title":"Vesicle Morphogenesis in Amphiphilic Triblock Copolymer Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0069/v1","date":1712017990000,"content":"Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of vesicles (polymersomes) by the self-assembly of randomly distributed amphiphilic BAB triblock copolymers with hydrophilic A and hydrophobic B blocks in an aqueous solution. The vesiculation pathway consists of several intermediate structures, such as an interconnected network of copolymer aggregates, a cage of cylindrical micelles and a lamellar cage. The cage-to-vesicle transition occurs at a constant aggregation number and practically eliminates the hydrophobic interfacial area between the B block and solvent. Molecular reorganization under-lying the sequence of morphology transitions from a cage-like aggregate to a vesicle is nearly isentropic. The end-to-end distances of isolated copolymer chains in solution and those within a vesicular assembly follow log normal probability distributions. This is attributed to the pre-ponderance of folded chain configurations in which the two hydrophobic end groups of a given chain stay close to each other. However, the probability distribution of end-to-end distances is broader for chains within the vesicle as compared to that of a single chain. This is due to the swelling of the folded configurations within the hydrophobic bilayer. Increasing the hydropho-bicity of the B block reduces the vesiculation time without qualitatively altering the self-assembly pathway.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac99625a7cbdf95326d5f640124775a855d73f7db43c0c4d4effe56a82ff6e57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
