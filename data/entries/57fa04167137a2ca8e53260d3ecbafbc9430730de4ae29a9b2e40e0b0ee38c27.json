{"title":"TTDCapsNet: Tri Texton-Dense Capsule Network for complex and medical image recognition","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300133","date":1710511200000,"content":"<p>by Vivian Akoto-Adjepong, Obed Appiah, Patrick Kwabena Mensah, Peter Appiahene</p>\r\n\r\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are frequently used algorithms because of their propensity to learn relevant and hierarchical features through their feature extraction technique. However, the availability of enormous volumes of data in various variations is crucial for their performance. Capsule networks (CapsNets) perform well on a small amount of data but perform poorly on complex images. To address this, we proposed a new Capsule Network architecture called Tri Texton-Dense CapsNet (TTDCapsNet) for better complex and medical image classification. The TTDCapsNet is made up of three hierarchic blocks of Texton-Dense CapsNet (TDCapsNet) models. A single TDCapsNet is a CapsNet architecture composed of a texton detection layer to extract essential features, which are passed onto an eight-layered block of dense convolution that further extracts features, and then the output feature map is given as input to a Primary Capsule (PC), and then to a Class Capsule (CC) layer for classification. The resulting feature map from the first PC serves as input into the second-level TDCapsNet, and that from the second PC serves as input into the third-level TDCapsNet. The routing algorithm receives feature maps from each PC for the various CCs. Routing the concatenation of the three PCs creates an additional CC layer. All these four feature maps combined, help to achieve better classification. On fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, Breast Cancer, and Brain Tumor datasets, the proposed model is evaluated and achieved validation accuracies of 94.90%, 89.09%, 95.01%, and 97.71% respectively. Findings from this work indicate that TTDCapsNet outperforms the baseline and performs comparatively well with the state-of-the-art CapsNet models using different performance metrics. This work clarifies the viability of using Capsule Network on complex tasks in the real world. Thus, the proposed model can be used as an intelligent system, to help oncologists in diagnosing cancerous diseases and administering treatment required.","author":"Vivian Akoto-Adjepong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"57fa04167137a2ca8e53260d3ecbafbc9430730de4ae29a9b2e40e0b0ee38c27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
