{"title":"401 Effect of protein and starch supplementation level on intake and digestibility by steers consuming low-quality forage: I. Bos taurus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/378/7757158?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A deficiency of ruminally available N (RAN) caused by a basal diet of low-quality forage depresses forage utilization. Supplemental protein improves forage utilization by increasing RAN, resulting in increased intake and potentially improving digestion. Addition of starch to a supplement can increase total digestible organic matter (OM) intake (TDOMI); however, too much starch decreases RAN and pH potentially decreasing forage utilization. Our objective was to determine the effect of starch supplementation on intake and digestion in <span>Bos taurus indicus</span> steers. Accordingly, five ruminally cannulated Brahman steers [body weight (BW) = 420 ± 55 kg) were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square to evaluate the effect of decreasing supplemental starch when consuming King Ranch Bluestem hay (3.5% CP, 73% NDF). Steers received four isonitrogenous (130 mg N/ kg BW) supplements providing increasing levels of starch (2% starch = 100% soybean meal; 20% starch = 26.3% corn, 73% soybean meal, 0.7% urea; 38% starch = 51.6% corn, 47% soybean meal, 1.4% urea; 56% starch = 78.6% corn, 19% soybean meal, 2.4% urea). Five 14-d periods were conducted, consisting of 9 d adaptation and 4 d to measure intake and digestion, and 1 d for ruminal fermentation. As designed, supplement OM intake (SOMI) increased linearly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) as starch level increased. Other measures of intake, including forage OM intake (FOMI), total OM intake (TOMI), and total neutral detergent fiber intake (TNDFI) decreased in a cubic manner in response to increasing starch (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04). Forage OMI also responded with a cubic decrease (72.2, 68.9, and 69.5 g/kg BW<sup>0.75</sup>) when the protein supplement contained 2, 20, and 38% starch, respectively, but decreased to 61.2 g/kg BW<sup>0.75</sup> when the 56% starch supplement was provided. Similarly, TOMI decreased 5.3% when starch inclusion increased from 38 to 56%. Total tract OM digestion and NDF digestion were not significantly affected (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.86) by starch level in the supplement; therefore, despite TOMI and TNDFI decreasing, there was no effect on total digestible OM intake and (TDOMI) and total digestible NDF intake (TDNDFI). In conclusion, providing supplemental starch over 38% decreased forage utilization. Decreases in FOMI with starch inclusion may be attributed to competition for RAN between fiber fermenting and starch fermenting bacteria.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0775492ccb91c793186d8ade74632e4166382f964095f595819b42a4146a4cbb","category":"Environment"}
