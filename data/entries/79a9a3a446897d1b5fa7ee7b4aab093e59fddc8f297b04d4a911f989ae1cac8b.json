{"title":"Proposing New Normative Standards for Granular Base Rigid Pavements: Integrating CBR Testing with Hydraulic Conductivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1679/v1","date":1721630982000,"content":"This paper presents a novel normative framework for assessing granular base materials in rigid pavements, incorporating evaluations of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) alongside hydraulic conductivity tests. A critical component of this research adheres to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) standards, which specify a permeability coefficient range of 0.05 to 0.20 cm/sec. Our investigations indicate that increased compaction energy inversely affects permeability, highlighting a sophisticated interplay between compaction dynamics and hydraulic characteristics. The study further elucidates that CBR values are profoundly impacted by the content of coarse-grained soil, advocating for a tailored approach to base layer assessment. Multivariable CBR analysis facilitated the identification of an optimal water content, underscoring that maintaining a minimum 80% CBR—while minimizing water content—can mitigate fatigue effects and enhance structural performance under heightened energy conditions. This research proposes bespoke, scientifically validated standards that integrate local geotechnical nuances, aimed at refining material selection processes and extending the durability of pavement infrastructures through foundational yet meticulous geotechnical evaluations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79a9a3a446897d1b5fa7ee7b4aab093e59fddc8f297b04d4a911f989ae1cac8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
