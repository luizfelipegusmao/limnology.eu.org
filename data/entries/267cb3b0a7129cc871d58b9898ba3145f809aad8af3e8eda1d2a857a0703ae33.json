{"title":"Dare to be resilient: the key to future pesticide-free orchards?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/3835/7650442?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Considering the urgent need for more sustainable fruit tree production, it is high time to find durable alternatives to the systematic use of phytosanitary products in orchards. To this end, resilience can deliver a number of benefits. Relying on a combination of tolerance, resistance, and recovery traits, disease resilience appears as a cornerstone to cope with the multiple pest and disease challenges over an orchard’s lifetime. Here, we describe resilience as the capacity of a tree to be minimally affected by external disturbances or to rapidly bounce back to normal functioning after being exposed to these disturbances. Based on a literature survey largely inspired from research on livestock, we highlight different approaches for dissecting phenotypic and genotypic components of resilience. In particular, multisite experimental designs and longitudinal measures of so-called ‘resilience biomarkers’ are required. We identified a list of promising biomarkers relying on ecophysiological and digital measurements. Recent advances in high-throughput phenotyping and genomics tools will likely facilitate fine scale temporal monitoring of tree health, allowing identification of resilient genotypes with the calculation of specific resilience indicators. Although resilience could be considered as a ‘black box’ trait, we demonstrate how it could become a realistic breeding goal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"267cb3b0a7129cc871d58b9898ba3145f809aad8af3e8eda1d2a857a0703ae33","category":"Environment"}
