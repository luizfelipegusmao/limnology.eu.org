{"title":"Mitochondrial DNA patterns describe the evolutionary history of the bonnethead shark Sphyrna tiburo (Linneus 1758) complex in the western Atlantic Ocean","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15961?af=R","date":1728993816000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The apparent lack of physical barriers in the marine realm has created the conception that many groups have a constant gene flow. However, changes in ocean circulation patterns, glacial cycles, temperature, and salinity gradients are responsible for vicariant events in many fish species, including sharks. The bonnethead shark, <i>Sphyrna tiburo</i>, is an endangered small coastal shark species. Although considerable efforts have recently been undertaken, little remains known about the possible biogeographic scenario that can explain its actual distribution within the western Atlantic (WA). Here, we used 599 mitochondrial sequences to assess the phylogeographic structure and implement Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to obtain divergence times and reconstruct the ancestral geographic range. This allowed us to infer processes responsible for the diversification of <i>S. tiburo</i> into major divergent lineages. Our results indicated that <i>S. tiburo</i> in the WA represents three independent lineages, with Brazilian samples differentiated into a distinct genetic cluster. The posterior probability of ancestral range analysis indicated that the species likely originated in the northern region (Carolina Province and the southern Gulf of Mexico), where it colonized southward through the uplifting of the Central American Isthmus (CAI). The Northern and Caribbean genetic clusters appear to have arisen from the intensification of the Loop Current, which currently flows northward passing the Yucatan Peninsula, Gulf of Mexico, and east Florida. Following initial colonization, the Northeastern Brazil group differentiated from the Caribbean region due to the sediment and freshwater discharge of the Amazon-Orinoco Plume. Thus, the evolutionary history of the <i>S. tiburo</i> complex can be explained by a combination of dispersal and vicariance events that occurred over the last ~5 million years (MY). We established and confirmed the species and population limits, demonstrating that the Amazon-Orinoco Plume constitutes a significant dispersal barrier for coastal sharks. Finally, we discuss some recommendations for the conservation of the bonnethead shark.</p>","author":"Maried Ochoa‐Zavala, \nAdan Fernando Mar‐Silva, \nRodolfo Pérez‐Rodríguez, \nPaola Palacios‐Barreto, \nDouglas H.
