{"title":"Salmonids in hot water: An unprecedented warm‐water event in Labrador, a subarctic region of Canada","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12710?af=R","date":1716266029000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Unprecedented warm river temperatures in July 2023 in Labrador, a subarctic region of Canada, were the highest since monitoring began (1994–2023) and ranged from 19.4°C (Hunt River) to 22.5°C (Eagle River). Incipient lethal water temperatures were exceeded for adult Atlantic salmon and brook trout (≥25°C) on 14 days in five of seven rivers and Arctic charr (≥24°C) on 17 days in six of seven rivers. Consequently, Labrador had the greatest number of angling restrictions and closures in 2023. Recent warming serves as a warning to fishery managers of regions historically unaffected by heat waves of the need to prepare action plans that mitigate the effects of a warming climate on fishes.</p>","author":"Emilie A.
