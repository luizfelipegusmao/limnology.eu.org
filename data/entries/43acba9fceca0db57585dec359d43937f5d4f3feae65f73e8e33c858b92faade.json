However, the specific molecular mechanism between exercise and irisin in the diabetic heart remains not fully explored. This study aimed to investigate how miR-34a mediates exercise-induced irisin to ameliorate myocardial fibrosis and its underlying mechanisms. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with DCM was induced in adult male rats with high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. The DCM rats were subjected to swimming (60 min/d) and recombinant irisin (r-irisin, 500 μg/kg/d) interventions for 8 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, cardiomyocyte structure, myocardial fibrosis and its correlated gene and protein expression were analyzed. Swimming intervention alleviated insulin resistance, myocardial fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy, and promoted blood glucose homeostasis in T2DM model rats. This improvement was associated with irisin upregulation and miR-34a downregulation in the myocardium, thus enhancing cardiac function. Similar efficacy was observed via intraperitoneal injection of exogenous recombinant irisin. Inhibition of miR-34a <i>in vivo</i> exhibited an anti-myocardial fibrotic effect by promoting irisin secretion through activating sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)/fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) signal pathway and downregulating myocardial fibrosis markers (collagen I, collagen III, and transforming growth factor-β1). Therefore, swimming-induced irisin has the potential therapeutic effect on diabetic myocardial fibrosis through activating the miR-34a-mediated SIRT1/PGC-1α/FNDC5 signal pathway.","author":"Yanju Guo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"43acba9fceca0db57585dec359d43937f5d4f3feae65f73e8e33c858b92faade","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
