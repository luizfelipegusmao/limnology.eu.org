{"title":"Prediction of moisture content for a single maize kernel based on viscoelastic properties","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13483?af=R","date":1712140213000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The rapid and accurate detection of moisture content is important to ensure maize quality. However, existing technologies for rapidly detecting moisture content often suffer from the use of costly equipment, stringent environmental requirements, or limited accuracy. This study proposes a simple and effective method for detecting the moisture content of single maize kernels based on viscoelastic properties.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Two types of viscoelastic experiments were conducted involving three different parameters: relaxation tests (initial loads: 60, 80, 100 N) and frequency-sweep tests (frequencies: 0.6, 0.8, 1 Hz). These experiments generated corresponding force-time graphs and viscoelastic parameters were extracted based on the four-element Maxwell model. Then, viscoelastic parameters and data of force-time graphs were employed as input variables to explore the relationships with moisture content separately. The impact of different preprocessing methods and feature time variables on model accuracy was explored based on force-time graphs. The results indicate that models utilizing the force-time data were more accurate than those utilizing viscoelastic parameters. The best model was established by partial least squares regression based on S-G smoothing data from relaxation tests conducted with initial force of 100 N. The correlation coefficient and the root mean square error of the calibration set were 0.954 and 0.021, respectively. The corresponding values of the prediction set were 0.905 and 0.029, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>This study confirms the potential for accurate and fast detection of moisture content in single maize kernels using viscoelastic properties, which provides a novel approach for the detection of various components in cereals. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mengmeng Qiao, \nGuoyi Xia, \nYang Xu, \nTao Cui, \nChenlong Fan, \nYibo Li, \nShaoyun Han, \nJun Qian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"36cb101fe50b0db8fa5c301cd2ee3c36e8a10ecce962e94f555d2ba551f6d9f4","category":"Environment"}
