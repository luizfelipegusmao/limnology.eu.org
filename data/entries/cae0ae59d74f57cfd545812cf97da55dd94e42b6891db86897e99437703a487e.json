{"title":"Diagnosis of Two Unrelated Syndromes of Prader-Willi and Calpainopathy Using Uniparental Disomy and Joint Whole Genome Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1485/v1","date":1718958137000,"content":"Purpose: Investigation for the co-occurrence of two unrelated genetic disorders of muscular dystrophy and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) (OMIM # 176270) using joint whole genome sequencing (WGS). Methods: Trio WGS joint analysis was performed to investigate the genetic etiology in a proband with PWS, prolonged muscular hypotonia associated hyperCKemia, and early-onset obesity. The parents were unaffected. Results: Results showed maternal isodisomy uniparental disomy (UPD) in chromosome 15 expanding from 15q11.2 to 15q22.2, including PWS regions at 15q11.2-15q13. Maternal heterodisomy was detected from 15q22.2 to 15q26.3. A pathogenic variant, NM_000070.3(CAPN3):c.550del (p.Thr184fs), was identified at 15q15.1 in a  heterozygous state in the mother that was homozygous in the proband due to maternal isodisomy. Conclusion: This is the first study of the concurrent molecular etiology of PWS and calpainopathy (OMIM # 253600) in the same patient. This report highlights the utility of joint analysis and need for the assessment of autosomal recessive disease in regions of isodisomy in patients with complex and unexplained phenotype.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cae0ae59d74f57cfd545812cf97da55dd94e42b6891db86897e99437703a487e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
