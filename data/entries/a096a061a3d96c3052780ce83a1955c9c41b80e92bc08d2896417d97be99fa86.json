{"title":"Solid Oxide Cells: from 3D Microstructure to Comprehensive Quantification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.139/7719551?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Performance and durability of solid oxide cell (SOC) electrodes are closely linked to their porous microstructure properties and the microstructure evolution during the cell's lifetime. Thus, comprehensive characterization of three-dimensional (3D) microstructures is essential for SOC electrode optimization. Over the years, Ga<sup>+</sup> FIB-SEM tomography has become an extremely important technique for the three-dimensional reconstruction of solid oxide cell microscopic structures with nanometric resolution (voxel size: âˆ¼ 20 - 40 nm<sup>3</sup>) [<a href=\"#ozae044.139-B1\">1</a>]. Nevertheless, the size of the material volume accessible by Ga-based FIB-SEMs in a reasonable timeframe is limited to dozens of microns cubed. This limitation may restrict the amount of quantitative information extracted from a small material volume, which can make the data not representative for the entire cell. For the latest designs of graded SOC, Ga<sup>+</sup> FIB serial-sectioned volumes may not capture the representative volume elements (RVEs) of more complex cells. The advent of Plasma FIB-SEM (PFIB-SEM) microscopes, which offer accessed material volumes thousandfold larger than those of traditional FIB-SEMs [<a href=\"#ozae044.139-B2\">2</a>], along with the latest implementations of automated serial sectioning, multidetector SEM imaging techniques, and SEM auto-functions, make PFIB-SEM an ideal platform for investigating SOC microstructures and other porous materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a096a061a3d96c3052780ce83a1955c9c41b80e92bc08d2896417d97be99fa86","category":"Environment"}
