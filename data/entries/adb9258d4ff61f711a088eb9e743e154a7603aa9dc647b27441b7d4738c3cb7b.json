{"title":"The Impact of Vp-porin, an Outer Membrane Protein, on the Biological Characteristics and Virulence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0331/v1","date":1717653355000,"content":"Porins are crucial proteins located in the outer membrane that directly influence antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and virulence in bacteria. In this study, a porin gene (Vp-porin) was cloned in V. parahaemolyticus, and the function of Vp-porin on biological characteristics and virulence was investigated. The results of sequence analysis showed that Vp-porin is highly conserved in Vibrio spp. and the predicted 3D structure showed it could form a transmembrane channel with 20 β barrel. Membrane permeabilization provides evidence that membrane integrity of ∆Vp-porin was damaged and the sensitivity to tetracycline, polymyxin B, rifampicin and cephalothin of ∆Vp-porin obvious increased. In addition, loss of Vp-porin damaged motility due to down-regulated flagellar synthesis. Besides, ∆Vp-porin exhibited attenuated cytotoxicity to Tetra-hymena. The relative survival rate of Tetrahymena infection with ∆Vp-porin was 86%, which is much high than that with WT (49%). Take together, Vp-porin in V. parahaemolyticus plays various roles in biological characteristics in membrane integrity, antimicrobial resistance and motility, and contributes to virulence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adb9258d4ff61f711a088eb9e743e154a7603aa9dc647b27441b7d4738c3cb7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
