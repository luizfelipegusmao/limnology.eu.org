{"title":"Development and Validation of a Thermal Model for Selective Laser Melting of 316L SS and Ti6AI4V","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1080/v1","date":1724118618000,"content":"Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a complex additive manufacturing process that requires precise control of thermal conditions to ensure the quality and reliability of produced parts. The main challenge lies in accurately predicting the thermal behavior during SLM, which is influenced by rapid heating and cooling cycles, high thermal gradients, and temperature-dependent material properties. This study addresses this challenge by developing a comprehensive thermal model for the SLM process of 316L stainless steel (316L SS) and Ti6Al4V titanium alloy using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in Abaqus. The model incorporates temperature-dependent material properties and phase transformations to simulate the temperature distribution and thermal history during SLM.\nTo validate the model, experimental studies were conducted using custom-designed argon chambers and stainless-steel powder. The experimental results showed strong agreement with the simulated melt pool dimensions and thermal histories, confirming the model's accuracy. Key findings include the model's ability to predict the effects of varying processing parameters such as laser power and scanning speed on thermal behavior and melt pool characteristics. This validated model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing SLM processing parameters, enhancing the un-derstanding of thermal phenomena in additive manufacturing, and improving the quality and reliability of manufactured parts.\nDue to budget constraints, experimental validation was initially performed only on 316L SS. This approach allowed for the tuning of the finite element model before extending its application to Ti6Al4V. The successful validation with 316L SS provides a solid foundation for applying the model to more challenging materials like Ti6Al4V, ensuring cost-effectiveness and safety in initial experimentation.\nThe novelty of this research lies in its detailed and validated thermal model, which bridges the gap between experimental and numerical approaches in SLM. By accurately simulating and validating the thermal processes involved in SLM, this study contributes to the advancement of additive manufacturing technologies and offers practical insights for industrial applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd932512e64ab7e1d1340761c3323bc60b05ba84c4091ff2aa8f9557d2311304","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
