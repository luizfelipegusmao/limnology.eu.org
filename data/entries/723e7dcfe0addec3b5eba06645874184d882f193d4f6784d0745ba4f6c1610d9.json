Battery performance is evaluated by various electrochemical measurements of bulk samples.

Herein, we focus on two methods, of the liquid phase (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and liquid phase scanning electron microscopy, and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of both methods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"723e7dcfe0addec3b5eba06645874184d882f193d4f6784d0745ba4f6c1610d9","category":"Environment"}
