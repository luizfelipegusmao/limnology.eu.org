The aims of the study were to analyze the impact of SH on the incidence of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-cardiovascular death, non-fatal reinfarction, target vessel revascularization and stroke) in STEMI patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) who have been treated successfully with primary PCI (pPCI) Method: we analyzed 2,362 STEMI patients treated with successful pPCI (post-procedural flow TIMI=3) and without DM and cardiogenic shock at admission. SH was defined as plasma glucose level above 7.8mmol/L at admission. The follow-up period was 8 years. Results: Incidence of SH was 26.9%. Eight-year all-cause mortality and MACE rates were significantly higher in patients with SH, as compared to patients without SH (9.7% vs 4.2%, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"836aa8faf174697bf960b06ee1dfa7944208b1bb2a36f1141cfd630fc0b09b51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
