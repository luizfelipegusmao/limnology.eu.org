{"title":"A new theropod dinosaur from the Callovian Balabansai Formation of Kyrgyzstan","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae090/7736730?rss=1","date":1724112000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Recent fieldwork in the late Middle Jurassic Balabansai Formation of Kyrgyzstan has yielded a partial skeleton of a large theropod dinosaur. The material includes a few bones of the skull (postorbital, quadratojugal), dorsal and sacral vertebrae, fragments of the pectoral girdle and forelimbs, and an almost complete pelvic girdle and hindlimbs, and is here made the type of a new theropod taxon, <span>Alpkarakush kyrgyzicus</span> gen. et sp. nov. <span>Alpkarakush</span> can be diagnosed by an extremely developed orbital brow on the postorbital, a pneumatic opening leading into cavities in the neural arch from the centroprezygodiapophyseal fossa in the posterior dorsal vertebrae, an almost enclosed ventral sulcus in manual phalanx II-1, a narrow and deep intercondylar groove on the anterior side of the distal femur, and an epicondylar crest on the distal femur that is offset from the distal end. A second, fragmentary, and smaller specimen from the same site represents the same taxon. Based on long bone histology, the type of <span>Alpkarakush</span> represents a late subadult individual, whereas the smaller specimen is a juvenile, possibly indicating gregarious behaviour. Phylogenetic analysis places <span>Alpkarakush</span> in the Metriacanthosauridae, underlining the diversity and wide distribution of this clade in the Jurassic of Asia.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"adb6753bd7cf92f099018a40ae976e5bb2eac3d9bd8b079269f8d81cf365fad3","category":"Environment"}
