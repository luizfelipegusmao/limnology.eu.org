{"title":"Introduction to General Theory of Relativity and Interpretation of Geometrical Quantities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2015/v1","date":1727259512000,"content":"In this paper, we will describe the general theory of relativity. The special theory of relativity is based on the ideal inertial frames. These ideal inertial frames are assumed to exist in every event in space-time. In contrast, in the general theory of relativity, we do not have to make that assumption. Additionally, the space-time is considered to be part of the solution to the motion. Moreover, interpretation of geometrical quantities is introduced.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8353fb9797243b040b68548038716476adc197c1fdbdbce47a36d0e949fcf0c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
