However, a marked resurgence occurred in 2020, which coincided with a change to a clothianidin-based IRS formulations (Fludora Fusion/SumiShield). To quantify the magnitude of the resurgence, investigate causes, and evaluate the impact of a shift back to IRS with Actellic in 2023, we assessed changes in malaria metrics in regions within and near Tororo District. Malaria surveillance data from Nagongera Health Center, Tororo District was included from 2011–2023. In addition, a cohort of 667 residents from 84 houses was followed from August 2020 through September 2023 from an area bordering Tororo and neighboring Busia District, where IRS has never been implemented. Cohort participants underwent passive surveillance for clinical malaria and active surveillance for parasitemia every 28 days. Mosquitoes were collected in cohort households every 2 weeks using CDC light traps. Female <i>Anopheles</i> were speciated and tested for sporozoites and phenotypic insecticide resistance. Temporal comparisons of malaria metrics were stratified by geographic regions. At Nagongera Health Center average monthly malaria cases varied from 419 prior to implementation of IRS; to 56 after 5 years of IRS with Bendiocarb and Actellic; to 1591 after the change in IRS to Fludora Fusion/SumiShield; to 155 after a change back to Actellic. Among cohort participants living away from the border in Tororo, malaria incidence increased over 8-fold (0.36 vs. 2.97 episodes per person year, p&lt;0.0001) and parasite prevalence increased over 4-fold (17% vs. 70%, p&lt;0.0001) from 2021 to 2022 when Fludora Fusion/SumiShield was used. Incidence decreased almost 5-fold (2.97 vs. 0.70, p&lt;0.0001) and prevalence decreased by 39% (70% vs. 43%, p&lt;0.0001) after shifting back to Actellic. There was a similar pattern among those living near the border in Tororo, with increased incidence between 2021 and 2022 (0.93 vs. 2.40, p&lt;0.0001) followed by a decrease after the change to Actellic (2.40 vs. 1.33, p&lt;0.001). Among residents of Busia, malaria incidence did not change significantly over the 3 years of observation. Malaria resurgence in Tororo was temporally correlated with the replacement of <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae s</i>.<i>s</i>. by <i>An</i>. <i>funestus</i> as the primary vector, with a marked decrease in the density of <i>An</i>. <i>funestus</i> following the shift back to IRS with Actellic. In Busia, <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae s</i>.<i>s</i>. remained the primary vector throughout the observation period. Sporozoite rates were approximately 50% higher among <i>An</i>. <i>funestus</i> compared to the other common malaria vectors. Insecticide resistance phenotyping of <i>An</i>. <i>funestus</i> revealed high tolerance to clothianidin, but full susceptibility to Actellic. A dramatic resurgence of malaria in Tororo was temporally associated with a change to clothianidin-based IRS formulations and emergence of <i>An</i>. <i>funestus</i> as the predominant vector. Malaria decreased after a shift back to IRS with Actellic. This study highlights the ability of malaria vectors to rapidly circumvent control efforts and the importance of high-quality surveillance systems to assess the impact of malaria control interventions and generate timely, actionable data.","author":"Moses R.
