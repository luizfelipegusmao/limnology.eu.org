{"title":"New Nitrogen Use Efficiency Indices for Biomass Formation and Productivity in Beans under Foliar Fertilization with Molybdenum Nanofertilizer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0290/v1","date":1720017054000,"content":"Most crops are fertilized with high amounts of nitrogen, and have an alarmingly low utiliza-tion efficiency. For this reason, the coordination between the fertilizer contribution and the ni-trogen requirements of the crop is very important. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the nitrogen use efficiency, and create new NUE indices that can determine and calculate the final destination of the assimilated nitrogen, for the formation and development of green bean plant organs, fertilized with molybdenum nanofertilizer applied foliarly and combined with soil fertilization of ammonium nitrate. The plants were grown in a greenhouse covered with anti-aphid mesh and irrigated with nutrient solution. Three sources of foliar Molybdenum (Nano fertilizer, Molybdenum Chelate and Sodium Molybdate) were applied in four doses of 0, 5, 10 and 20 ppm Mo, complemented with edaphic fertilization of NH4NO3 (0, 3, 6 and 12 mM of N). As results, the NUE indices showed that with the application of the nanofertilizer, the total biomass production increased 41.65% more than with the application of the chelate, and 36.84% more than with the application of molybdate. Finally, it is con-cluded that the use of NUE indices is an important approach that evaluates the fate of nitro-gen and accurately estimates plant yield.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"976b94ca9d6d08e8cf14f0532c2eb0be5bd12af30f09f7eb1d35a810b3d03376","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
