{"title":"Modelling perspective on the climate footprint in south east Australian marine waters and its fisheries","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/1/130/7458235?rss=1","date":1701648000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>South eastern Australia is a global warming hotspot, and is also home to ~70% of Australia’s population and one of Australia’s largest fisheries—the South East Scalefish and Shark Fishery. This fishery spans shelf to deep waters, subtropical to temperate waters, employs many gears, and interacts with over 100 species. Despite following best practice fisheries management principles, including taking an ecosystem perspective to overall fisheries interactions, management interventions have failed to arrest or recover the decline of some focal species. Using an Atlantis ecosystem model developed for the fishery over the past 20 years, this paper presents simulations that suggest climate change may be a major contributor to the trajectories seen for a number of species—such as jackass morwong (<span>Nemadactylus macropterus</span>), blue warehou (<span>Seriolella brama</span>), and gemfish (<span>Rexea solandri</span>). This kind of climate influence poses many challenges for fisheries management into the future, raising questions about what to do when climate change undermines or overrides fisheries management actions and objectives.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"d7d56e9ddcba867bb677045a369a1c59da3e2ffbd9c80adc1e4bfffcc6fce5ac","category":"Environment"}
