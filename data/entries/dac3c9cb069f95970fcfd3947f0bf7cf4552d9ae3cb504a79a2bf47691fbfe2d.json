{"title":"State of the Art on Car-T Cell Therapies for Onco-Haematological Disorders and Other Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1456/v1","date":1721282592000,"content":"The use of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T cells) for the treatment of patients with malignant haematological diseases has become a well-established application, for conditions such as refractory or relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), B cell lymphomas (BCL), and multiple myeloma (MM). Nearly 35,000 patients have received autologous CAR-T cells for the treatment of these conditions only in the USA. Since their approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, over 1200 clinical trials have been initiated globally and there are at least 10 different CAR-T cells with approval by different regulatory agencies around the globe. In the USA the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 6 commercial CAR-T cells that are widely distributed worldwide. At the time of this writing, several clinical trials have been performed in patients with solid tumours such as glioblastoma, renal and pancreatic cancer, as well as in patients with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM), and systemic sclerosis (SS). There are also several studies showing the potential benefit of CAR-T cells for other non-malignant diseases such as asthma and even fungal infections. In this review, without pretending to cover all the current areas of treatments with CAR-T cells, we offer a brief summary of some of the most relevant aspects of the use of CAR-T cells for some of these conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dac3c9cb069f95970fcfd3947f0bf7cf4552d9ae3cb504a79a2bf47691fbfe2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
