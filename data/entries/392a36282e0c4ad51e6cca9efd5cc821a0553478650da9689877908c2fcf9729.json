Based on these changes, tumor and cancer formation can be detected in the early stages, and by storing the right information in the brain; it created the context for sending appropriate messages to return the cells to a normal state.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"392a36282e0c4ad51e6cca9efd5cc821a0553478650da9689877908c2fcf9729","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
