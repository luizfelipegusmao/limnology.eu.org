{"title":"Challenges in Echocardiography for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Non-ischemic Hypertensive Heart Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0531/v1","date":1709912966000,"content":"It has been well established that hypertension is considered as a predominant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the link between hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension may directly affect the cardiac function leading in heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). There are echocardiographic findings indicating hypertensive heart disease (HHD) defined as altered cardiac morphology (left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, left atrium dilatation) and function (systolic or diastolic dysfunction) in patients with persistent hypertension irrespective of cardiac pathologies to which it contributes, such as coronary artery disease and kidney function impairment. In addition to classical echocardiographic parameters, novel indices, like speckle tracking of the left ventricle and left atrium, 3D volume evaluation, myocardial work in echocardiography may provide more accurate and reproducible diagnostic and prognostic data in patients with hypertension. However, their use is still underappreciated. An early detection and prompt therapy of HHD will greatly improve the prognosis. Hence, in the present review, we shed light on the role of echocardiography in the contemporary diagnostic and prognostic approach of HHD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8158f54ac8adc1ba97cae1213caea24a568322119df3feab34e9de41231c46bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
