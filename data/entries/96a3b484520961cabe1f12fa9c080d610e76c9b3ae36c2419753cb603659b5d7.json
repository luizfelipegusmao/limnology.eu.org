{"title":"Poikilodermatous Plaque-like Hemangioma: Case Presentation and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0227/v1","date":1714982689000,"content":"Poikilodermatous plaque-like hemangioma (PPH) is a recently described clinical and pathological entity, with only 18 cases reported in the literature. Although uncommon, this benign condition presents consistent clinical and histological findings. We present a new case of PPH in an 81-year-old male and review the existing literature. The persistence over time and the need to distinguish PPH from more significant lesions underscore the importance of its clinical and pathological recognition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96a3b484520961cabe1f12fa9c080d610e76c9b3ae36c2419753cb603659b5d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
