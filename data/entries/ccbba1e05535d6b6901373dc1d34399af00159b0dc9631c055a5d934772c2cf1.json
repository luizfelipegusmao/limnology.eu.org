{"title":"Changes in isotope fractionation during nitrate assimilation by marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic algae under different pH and CO2 conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12546?af=R","date":1716913718000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The impact of environmental factors on nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope effects during algal nitrate assimilation causes uncertainty in the field application of sedimentary N isotope records and nitrate isotopes to understand the marine nitrogen cycle. Ocean acidification is predicted to change nitrogen cycling including nitrate assimilation, but how N and O isotope effects during algal nitrate assimilation vary in response to changes in seawater pH and partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) remains unknown. We measured N and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilation and physiological states of the marine diatom <i>Thalassiosira weissflogii</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i> under different pH (8.1 or 7.8) and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> (400 or 800 <i>μ</i>atm) conditions. Low pH and/or high <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> equally decreased N and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilation by diatoms possibly due to reducing cellular nitrate efflux/uptake ratio and decreased isotope effects for nitrate uptake, whereas they did not affect those by <i>Synechococcus</i> with low intracellular nitrate concentration and limited nitrate efflux. Our results provide compelling experimental evidence showing different changes in N and O isotope effects during nitrate assimilation by marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton at low pH and/or high <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>. These findings suggest new insight into environmental controls on variability in the isotope effect during algal nitrate assimilation, and have implications for improving a predictive understanding of N and O isotope tools in acidified oceans.</p>","author":"Yawen Chen, \nJin‐Yu Terence Yang, \nJin‐Ming Tang, \nHaizheng Hong, \nShuh‐Ji Kao, \nMinhan Dai, \nDalin Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"ccbba1e05535d6b6901373dc1d34399af00159b0dc9631c055a5d934772c2cf1","category":"Environment"}
