We find that there is also a resistance change along with the domain transition. Atomically, the collective hopping of Cu<sup>+</sup> ions triggered by electric fields or mechanical strains is the cause of the domain transition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d963c60e2878dea4f007a0004a28d378720916df7eb62720325fbccd4ce56fdb","category":"Environment"}
