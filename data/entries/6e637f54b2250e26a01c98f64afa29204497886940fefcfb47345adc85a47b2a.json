{"title":"Presenting decision-relevant numerical information to Dutch women aged 50–70 with varying levels of health literacy: Case example of adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309668","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Inge S. van Strien-Knippenberg, Daniëlle R. M. Timmermans, Ellen G. Engelhardt, Inge R. H. M Konings, Olga C. Damman</p>\r\nBackground <p>If communicated adequately, numerical decision-relevant information can support informed and shared decision making. Visual formats are recommended, but which format supports patients depending on their health literacy (HL) levels for specific decisions is unclear.</p> Study aim <p>The aim of this study is to investigate: 1) the effect of survival rates and side-effects presentation formats on comprehension and ‘feeling informed’; 2) differential effects among women with higher/lower HL, with adjuvant systemic breast cancer therapy as case example.</p> Methods <p>Two online experiments among women from the Dutch population without a history of breast cancer were conducted. Experiment 1 had a 3 (survival rate format: text block–bar graph–icon array) x 2 (HL: low–high) between-subjects design. Experiment 2 had a 5 (side-effects format: no probability information–probability information in numbers with or without a visualisation–probability information in numbers with or without a visualisation accompanied by a description of the side-effects) x 2 (HL: low–high) design. Primary outcomes were comprehension and feeling informed (Experiment 2 only). Formats were previously designed in co-creation with patients.</p> Results <p>In Experiment 1, presentation format did not affect gist or verbatim comprehension. Higher HL was associated with higher gist comprehension. Experiment 2 showed an interaction between presentation format and HL on ‘feeling informed’. When provided with visualised probability information without a description of the side-effects, women with lower HL felt better informed than women with higher HL.</p> Conclusion <p>Visual formats did not enhance comprehension of survival rate information beyond a well-designed text block format. However, none of the formats could overcome HL differences. When designing decision-relevant information, visualisations might not necessarily provide an advantage over structured numerical information for both patients with lower and higher HL. However, a deeper understanding of presenting side-effect information is warranted.</p>","author":"Inge S. van Strien-Knippenberg","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6e637f54b2250e26a01c98f64afa29204497886940fefcfb47345adc85a47b2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
