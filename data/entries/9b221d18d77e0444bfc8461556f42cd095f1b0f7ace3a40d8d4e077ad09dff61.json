{"title":"Update on a brain-penetrant cardiac glycoside that can lower cellular prion protein levels in human and guinea pig paradigms","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308821","date":1727186400000,"content":"<p>by Shehab Eid, Wenda Zhao, Declan Williams, Zahra Nasser, Jennifer Griffin, Pavel Nagorny, Gerold Schmitt-Ulms</p>\r\n\r\nLowering the levels of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is widely considered a promising strategy for the treatment of prion diseases. Building on work that established immediate spatial proximity of PrP<sup>C</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (NKAs) in the brain, we recently showed that PrP<sup>C</sup> levels can be reduced by targeting NKAs with their natural cardiac glycoside (CG) inhibitors. We then introduced C4’-dehydro-oleandrin as a CG with improved pharmacological properties for this indication, showing that it reduced PrP<sup>C</sup> levels by 84% in immortalized human cells that had been differentiated to acquire neural or astrocytic characteristics. Here we report that our lead compound caused cell surface PrP<sup>C</sup> levels to drop also in other human cell models, even when the analyses of whole cell lysates suggested otherwise. Because mice are refractory to CGs, we explored guinea pigs as an alternative rodent model for the preclinical evaluation of C4’-dehydro-oleandrin. We found that guinea pig cell lines, primary cells, and brain slices were responsive to our lead compound, albeit it at 30-fold higher concentrations than human cells. Of potential significance for other PrP<sup>C</sup> lowering approaches, we observed that cells attempted to compensate for the loss of cell surface PrP<sup>C</sup> levels by increasing the expression of the prion gene, requiring daily administration of C4’-dehydro-oleandrin for a sustained PrP<sup>C</sup> lowering effect. Regrettably, when administered systemically <i>in vivo</i>, the levels of C4’-dehydro-oleandrin that reached the guinea pig brain remained insufficient for the PrP<sup>C</sup> lowering effect to manifest. A more suitable preclinical model is still needed to determine if C4’-dehydro-oleandrin can offer a cost-effective complementary strategy for pushing PrP<sup>C</sup> levels below a threshold required for long-term prion disease survival.","author":"Shehab Eid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9b221d18d77e0444bfc8461556f42cd095f1b0f7ace3a40d8d4e077ad09dff61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
