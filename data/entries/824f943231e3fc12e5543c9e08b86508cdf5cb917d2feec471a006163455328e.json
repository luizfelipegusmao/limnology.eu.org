{"title":"Drivers of Influence in Top Transplant Journals: Predictors of Positive Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0395/v1","date":1722918008000,"content":"The impact of scientific articles is often measured using metrics such as the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and CiteScore, which rely on citation counts and publication volume. In this study, we aimed to identify the predictors of article impact in the leading solid organ transplantation journals from 2019 to 2020. Article impact was determined using its citation count in 2021 compared to the JIF. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics to identify significant predictors of positive impact on the JIF. A total of 2,461 articles and reviews were included, with variations observed among the top transplantation journals. Factors such as the number of authors, open access publishing, and authors from top affiliations were found to significantly influence the impact of articles. Articles discussing kidney transplantation and COVID-19 were associated with a positive impact on the JIF, while those discussing lung transplantation had a negative impact. The findings suggest that collaborative research with more authors and involvement of top institutions enhances impact. Open access publishing also correlated with increased citations and a positive impact on the JIF. Further research incorporating a broader range of journals and years would provide a more comprehensive understanding of factors influencing article impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"824f943231e3fc12e5543c9e08b86508cdf5cb917d2feec471a006163455328e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
