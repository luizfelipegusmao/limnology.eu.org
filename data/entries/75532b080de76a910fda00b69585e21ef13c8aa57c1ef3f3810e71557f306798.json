{"title":"Enhancing Aerodynamic Performance in UAV Design: CFD Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0340/v1","date":1725504671000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive study on the design and aerodynamic optimization of a hybrid surveillance drone, conducted within the academic framework of Abu Dhabi University. The research primarily focuses on the comparison between flying wing and conventional aircraft layouts, with an emphasis on reducing drag coefficients and enhancing stall behavior through integrated design strategies. Utilizing SST k-omega viscous model (CFD) simulations, the study evaluates the aerodynamic performance of the drone model, analyzing lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients against existing models. The paper further explores winglet selection and propeller dynamics, aiming to optimize the lift-to-drag ratio and achieve desired lift-to-weight ratios through careful consideration of propeller-wing interactions. Findings from the study indicate a notable improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, with the new drone model achieving a maximum lift coefficient (Cl, max) of 0.746, a minimum drag coefficient (Cd, min) of 0.039, and a peak lift-to-drag ratio (Cl/Cd) of 8.507. The research contributes significantly to the fields of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, providing a foundation for future advancements in drone design and application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75532b080de76a910fda00b69585e21ef13c8aa57c1ef3f3810e71557f306798","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
