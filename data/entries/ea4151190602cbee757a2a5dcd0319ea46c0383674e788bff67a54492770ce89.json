We experimentally assessed the role of visual and chemical cues in finding food in tadpoles of the invasive species <i>Lithobates catesbeianus</i>. In the two-choice experiment, using rectangular containers that offer visual and/or chemical food cues on opposite ends, tadpoles chose the side where the chemical cues of the food were present consistently. The visual cues alone showed an initial transient attraction of tadpoles, which disappeared after a few minutes, suggesting that tadpoles are potentially capable of seeing contrasting objects, at least, at a close range and in clear waters and daylight conditions. We also evaluated the foraging behaviour and the capability of tadpoles to find food in an open field experiment under two different lighting conditions: natural daylight and darkness. Results showed that tadpoles find food faster in dark conditions, confirming that chemical cues alone are sufficient for tadpoles of this species to find food. Moreover, the time spent feeding and the number of tadpoles simultaneously exploiting the food patch were greater in darkness suggesting that environments with low visibility conditions could favour the establishment of <i>L. catesbeianus</i>. Understanding the sensory modalities used by tadpoles of this invasive species to find food could help to understand the potential abilities to expand and establish in novel environments.</p>","author":"Araceli Rita Coceres, \nAndrea Gabriela Pozzi, \nAgust√≠n Nahuel Oliveras, \nLucas David Jungblut","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"ea4151190602cbee757a2a5dcd0319ea46c0383674e788bff67a54492770ce89","category":"Environment"}
