{"title":"Reproductive performance of lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>, L. 1758) females: Effects of integrated photoperiod and temperature manipulations on sexual maturation and spawning","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311735","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Frank Thomas Mlingi, Erik Burgerhout, Maren Mommens, Helge Tveiten, Jonna Tomkiewicz, Elin Kjørsvik, Velmurugu Puvanendran</p>\r\n\r\nA successful control of sexual maturation is crucial for year-round production of lumpfish juveniles destined as cleaner fish in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. This study investigated the combined effects of photoperiod and temperature manipulations on sexual maturation and spawning in lumpfish females. Lumpfish juveniles were exposed to simulated natural and nine-month compressed annual photoperiods, with subsequent temperature elevation. Body weight (BW), condition factor (K), gonadosomatic index (GSI), ovarian development, plasma levels of 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and spawning were assessed. Compressing the natural photoperiod caused a clear increase and decrease in GSI, T, 11-KT and E2 towards and during the spawning period. Before the temperature elevation, GSI, T, 11-KT, E2 and ovarian development were advanced in the compressed photoperiod. After the temperature elevation, GSI, T, 11-KT and E2 fluctuated more in the compressed photoperiod, while in the natural photoperiod, E2 declined, and GSI, T and 11-KT increased. Spawning was advanced by 1 month in the compressed photoperiod compared to the natural photoperiod. Temperature elevation led to higher levels, earlier peaks and declines of T, 11-KT or E2 in both photoperiods, and advanced spawning by 1.5 months in the compressed photoperiod compared to the natural photoperiod. Temperature elevation also led to increased ovulation recruitment and increased cumulative weight of spawned eggs in the natural photoperiod. Compressing the natural photoperiod and elevating temperature can thus advance sexual maturation and spawning in lumpfish females. Due to the lower amounts of spawned egg weights in the high temperature compressed photoperiod, further studies on effects of photoperiod and timing of temperature manipulations on spawning, fecundity and egg quality could optimize the photothermal manipulations on lumpfish broodstock.","author":"Frank Thomas Mlingi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"405cc5934789f51958839f66c768786fb76a6bc9accdf09a717af658fae7db21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
