{"title":"Impact of Carbon Fiber Content and Length on the Rheological Properties and Coating Performance for Lost Foam Casting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1783/v1","date":1721734846000,"content":"This study explores the impact of carbon fiber length and content on the rheological properties and performance of coatings used in lost foam casting. The investigation encompassed fiber lengths of 1 mm, 3 mm, and 6 mm, and fiber contents of 0.2%, 0.5%, and 0.8%. The effects on coating viscosity, shear stress, coating weight, and surface morphology were meticulously evaluated. The results demonstrate that incorporating carbon fibers significantly enhances coating viscosity and shear stress compared to fiber-free coatings, with more pronounced effects observed at higher fiber contents and longer fiber lengths. Nevertheless, excessive fiber content and length can lead to agglomeration, negatively impacting coating uniformity. Optimal fiber length and content were identified, striking a balance between improved rheological properties and coating performance. These findings provide critical insights for the development and industrial application of high-performance coatings in lost foam casting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d87adbb29cbab19eab7856b7e7bb6a9ea6a2a11d61c56d26adbbc6645b332579","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
