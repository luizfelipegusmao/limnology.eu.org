{"title":"1,2-Dicinnamoyl-Sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine Enhances Insulin Sensitivity and Increases the Expression Level of mtDNA-Encoded Genes in Insulin-Resistant 3T3-L1 Adipocytes &ndash; a Preliminary Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0342/v1","date":1722858384000,"content":"Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by a reduced biological response to insulin. It is one of the most common metabolic diseases of modern civilization. Numerous naturally occurring substances have shown to have a positive effect in restoring the proper sensitivity to insulin. Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with artificially induced insulin resistance by palmitic acid (16:0) were used for the study. Cinnamic acid and 1,2-dicinnamoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholin (1,2-diCA-PC) were tested at three concentrations: 25 μM, 50 μM, and 125 μM. The number of mitochondria and the expression of genes encoded by mtDNA were elucidated in control and experimental cells. In experimental cells treated with 1,2-diCA-PC, we displayed increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by an increase in mtDNA copy number. Moreover, in experimental cells treated with 1,2-diCA-PC at the concentration of 125 μM, we observed a significant increase in the expression level of all analyzed genes encoded by mtDNA compared to control cells. Our study showed a relationship between improved cellular sensitivity to insulin by 1,2-diCA-PC and an increase in the number of mitochondria and expression levels of genes encoded by mtDNA. Summarizing, the results suggest a therapeutic potential of cinnamic acid derivative 1,2-diCA-PC in enhancing the insulin sensitivity of adipocytes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7680ed3cf4afc12b21fc7ab929fff204ef71b7a61c5a020d7f67d86cd044f6cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
