Nevertheless, scant attention has been given to investigating the dispersion of phytoplankton communities and the factors influencing them across expansive areas. In this study, we present the results of a survey on the distribution of phytoplankton community and the effects of different driving factors in 11 lakes along Inner Mongolia in July–August 2020. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis and variance decomposition (VPA) were used to elucidate the distribution of phytoplankton communities and the response of drivers. A total of 169 species of phytoplankton from 8 phyla were detected. Both the abundance and diversity of phytoplankton in the Inner Mongolia lakes showed a trend of high in the east and low in the west (with Daihai Lake as the boundary). The Margalef index of phytoplankton significantly negatively correlated with salinity (<span>r</span> = −0.707, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and total dissolved solids (<span>r</span> = −0.720, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), and both density and biomass highly significantly positively correlated with the suspended solids, Chlorophyll a and trophic level index. The VPA explained 38.9% of the changes in the phytoplankton community with the highest rate of explanation of land use. Therefore, preventing anthropogenic impacts, as well as reducing nutrient loads, can effectively ensure the ecological diversity of lake phytoplankton in lake populations with large geographical spans and varying levels of nutrients.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"ad0d17173dd53c73b956f77b950d00cd6bd4f6fdb174bddbfffd420ece67ad80","category":"Environment"}
