{"title":"The effects of genotype-by-environment interactions on body condition score across three winter supplemental feed environments in a composite beef cattle breed in Montana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae024/7616208?rss=1","date":1709164800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cattle operations in the Northern Great Plains region of the United States face extreme cold weather conditions and require nutritional supplementation over the winter season in order for animals to maintain body condition. In cow–calf operations, body condition scores (BCS) measured at calving and breeding have been shown to be associated with several economically important health and fertility traits, so maintenance of BCS is both an animal welfare and economic concern. A low-to-medium heritability has been found for BCS when measured across various production stages, indicating a large environmental influence but sufficient genetic basis for selection. The present study evaluated BCS measured prior to calving (late winter) and breeding (early summer) under three winter supplementation environments in a multitrait linear mixed model. Traits were discretized by winter supplementation and genetic correlations between environments were considered a reflection of evidence for genotype-by-environment interactions between BCS and diet. Winter supplementation treatments were fed October through April and varied by range access and protein content: 1) feedlot environment with approximately 15% crude protein (CP) corn/silage diet, 2) native rangeland access with 1.8 kg of an 18% CP pellet supplement, and 3) native rangeland access with a self-fed 50% CP and mineral supplement. A total of 2,988 and 2,353 records were collected across multiple parities on 1,010 and 800 individuals for prebreeding and precalving BCS, respectively. Heifers and cows came from a composite beef cattle breed developed and maintained by the USDA Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory near Miles City, Montana. Genetic correlations between treatments 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 were 0.98, 0.78, and 0.65 and 1.00, 0.98, and 0.99 for precalving and prebreeding BCS, respectively. This provides moderate evidence of genotype-by-environment interactions for precalving BCS under treatment 3 relative to treatments 1 and 2, but no evidence for genotype-by-environment interactions for prebreeding BCS. Treatment 3 differed substantially in CP content relative to treatments 1 and 2, indicating that some animals differ in their ability to maintain BCS up to spring calving across a protein gradient. These results indicate the potential for selection of animals with increased resilience under cold weather conditions and high protein, restricted energy diets to maintain BCS.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"bd72697113cd72d48886ed67a9ff6b4b2a758f44bf9a6c131e9d48602d10c8be","category":"Environment"}
