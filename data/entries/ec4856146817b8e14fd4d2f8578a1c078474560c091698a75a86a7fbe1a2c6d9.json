Many researchers have reported both experimental and theoretical studies. Recently, our group has investigated the SiGe grown on Ge(111) wafers and on Ge/Si(111) [<a href=\"#ozae044.267-B1\">1-3</a>]. The crack formation behaviors were shown in these papers, but the precise observation at the TEM level was still not enough. We believe that more precise TEM and SEM observations are needed for future discussion to reveal the exact crack formation mechanism. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the crystallographic characteristics of the cracks formed in the SiGe/Ge/Si(111).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ec4856146817b8e14fd4d2f8578a1c078474560c091698a75a86a7fbe1a2c6d9","category":"Environment"}
