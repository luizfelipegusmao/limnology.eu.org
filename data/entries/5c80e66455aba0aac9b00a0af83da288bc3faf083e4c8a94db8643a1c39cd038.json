{"title":"Preoperative diagnostic criteria for scleroatrophic gallbladder: A systematic review protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300336","date":1710338400000,"content":"<p>by Renato Bessa-Melo, Cristina Fernandes, Ana Aguiar, Santiago Lopez-Ben, Luís Guimarães, Pedro Serralheiro</p>\r\nBackground <p>Although scleroatrophic gallbladder is a rare condition, it presents significant clinical challenges in diagnosis and management. More agreement is needed on this disorder’s diagnostic criteria and optimal management approach. We will conduct a systematic review to summarise the scleroatrophic gallbladder’s preoperative diagnostic criteria, including imaging modalities.</p> Methods <p>A systematic review will be undertaken using the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024503701). We will search in Medline (via PubMed), Embase, SCOPUS, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to find original studies reporting about scleroatrophic gallbladder or synonymous. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts following the eligibility criteria. We will include all types of studies that describe any diagnostic criteria or tools. After retrieving the full text of the selected studies, we will conduct a standardised data extraction. Finally, a narrative synthesis will be performed. The quality of the identified studies will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies- 2 tool.</p> Discussion <p>This systematic review will provide information on the preoperative diagnostic criteria of the scleroatrophic gallbladder and the value of imaging studies in its diagnosis. In addition, this work will aid doctors in the decision-making process for diagnosing scleroatrophic gallbladder and propose treatment approaches to this condition.</p> Systematic review registration <p>The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024503701).</p>","author":"Renato Bessa-Melo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5c80e66455aba0aac9b00a0af83da288bc3faf083e4c8a94db8643a1c39cd038","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
