{"title":"Information Data Length Theory of Human Emotions, How, What and Why","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0557/v1","date":1710144253000,"content":"The current paper provides a cutting-edge information data length- theoretic approach to human emotions. This is a revolutionary breakthrough that unifies information data length and the dynamics of emotions. The significant impact of both time and its mean value associate on both the upper and lower bounds of the obtained information data length is observed and noted. The paper concludes with some challenging open problems, combined with concluding remarks and future research pathways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5328cde8c2eb97eef5e2608bb874d2e9155baab888e14e848ee40f821b187ed2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
