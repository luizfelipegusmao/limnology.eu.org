Fascinating progress has been made in understanding beam-induced atomic rearrangements in monolayer-thick materials such as graphene and MoS<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.716-B1\">1-4</a>]. However, in thicker crystals we generally have limited knowledge, at the atomic length scale, of the dose delivered to each part of the sample and the changes induced by this dose. Here we analyse electron beam effects in a three-dimensional crystal, tens of atoms in thickness. We propose that measuring both dose and atomic rearrangements with high spatial and temporal resolution can improve our understanding of beam-solid interactions more generally.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"955b0c22c610de21d7212cb3d73d52a966e9b1f4264828d38d7daf3c027d54c9","category":"Environment"}
