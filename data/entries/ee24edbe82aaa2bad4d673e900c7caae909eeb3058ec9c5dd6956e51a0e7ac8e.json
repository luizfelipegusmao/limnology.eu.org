{"title":"Sustainable feed formulation to community‐based aquaculture: Oreochromis niloticus fingerlings performance and antioxidant status","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13040?af=R","date":1712550638000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Community-based aquaculture can reduce dependence on natural resources, promote biodiversity conservation, and improve local economies and food security. However, this activity is highly dependent on local conditions regarding natural resources, such as the availability of produced organisms, adequate feeds, and environmental factors. As ectothermic organisms, fish are more susceptible to temperature fluctuations in culture conditions. A set of raw ingredients (e.g., cassava and local beans) produced or available in villages from Cabo Delgado (Mozambique) with nutritional potential for fish feed were selected to produce an experimental diet. The following objectives were defined: (1) evaluate growth performance of tilapia fingerlings fed a diet produced with local ingredients, compared with a commercial-like diet; and (2) evaluate the response to thermal stress (18, 26, and 32°C) by tilapia fingerlings fed with tested diets. Tilapia fed with an experimental diet presented lower growth rates, lower DNA damage, higher neurophysiological, and antioxidant activity, leading to increased oxidative stress. Regarding energy budget, tilapia fed with the experimental diet presented higher protein content at 26°C and lipids at 18°C, leading to greater energy available at these temperatures. Overall, local ingredients can be successfully used as an additional feed source for tilapia production in community-based aquaculture in earthen ponds.</p>","author":"Sílvia F. S.
