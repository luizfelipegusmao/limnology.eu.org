Numerous studies have been carried out to improve this performance, reducing the reflectance in C-Si-based solar cells [<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B3\">3</a>]. A common strategy to achieve this is using anti-reflective coatings (ARC) [<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B4\">4</a>]. Among the most widely used ARCs for silicon solar cells is silicon nitride, which is reported to reduce the integrated reflection to around 10% [<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B4\">4</a>]. Macroporous silicon (MPS) is a material that can be obtained by electrochemical anodization from monocrystalline silicon surfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B6\">6</a>]. By carefully selecting the manufacturing parameters, it is possible to obtain porous structures consisting of cylindrical pores with a high aspect ratio. In this way, it is feasible to manufacture pores of approximately one micrometer in diameter. The presence of empty spaces in a silicon matrix reduces the reflectance since this new material modifies its optical properties by combining the refractive indices of silicon and air [<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B7\">7</a>]. The generation of inverted pyramids from the marking of silicon by photolithography and, subsequently, an attack with alkaline solutions such as KOH or NaOH also minimize the reflectance due to multiple internal reflections in the inverted pyramid of the incident light beam [<a href=\"#ozae044.270-B8\">8</a>]. In this work, we optimized the thickness of the porous layer to reduce the reflectance and, subsequently, a chemical attack with KOH; both techniques left a reflectance at 365 nm of 17% compared to crystalline silicon of 72%.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0556863833cec6961b0c644ba4846f865c395903eccf43c53b450f2ae82cc4c9","category":"Environment"}
