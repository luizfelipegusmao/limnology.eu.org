Active predators outperformed ambush predators but were less effective when ambush predators were within resource patches. Various factors, like prey resource regeneration and uncertainty in prey capture, influenced outcomes. Interactions between these factors yielded unexpected results, highlighting the need to consider system traits when predicting predator success.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Many predators ambush prey rather than pursue them or shift between foraging modes. Active predators typically encounter prey more frequently than ambush predators. I designed a simulation model to examine whether this always holds and how active and ambush predators fare in capturing mobile prey. Prey foraged for clumped resources using area-restricted search, shifting from directional movement before resource encounter to less directional movement afterward. While active predators succeeded more than ambush predators, the advantage of active predators diminished when ambush predators were positioned inside resource patches rather than outside. I investigated the impact of eight treatments and their interactions. For example, regeneration of prey resources increased the difference between ambush predators inside and outside patches, and uncertain prey capture by predators decreased this difference. Several interactions resulted in outcomes different from each factor in isolation. For instance, reducing the directionality level of active predators impacted moderately when applied alone, but when combined with resource regeneration it led to the worst success of active predators against ambush predators inside patches. Ambush predators may not always be inferior to active predators, and one should consider the key traits of the studied system to predict the relative success of these two foraging modes.</p>","author":"Inon Scharf","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"1cb5db34446ccbc2e4dcd38ced1e6e935486b3212b7cc6522120cfb08813de1a","category":"Environment"}
