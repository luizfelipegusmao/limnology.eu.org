{"title":"Concentrations of PFAS in vegetables from Sydney and Newcastle, Australia","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13491?af=R","date":1711609200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>This study investigated per - and polyfluoro alkyl substance (PFAS) in 53 fruit and vegetable samples collected from a local wholesale and retail market in Sydney and a local supermarket in Newcastle. As there are limited information about PFAS levels in vegetables on the markets, this study aimed to fill this gap and assess potential risks for human through consumption of these vegetables.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>QuEChERS extraction- a solid phase extraction method, a portmanteau word formed from ‘quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe’ followed by enhanced matrix removal (EMR)-lipid cleaning along and LC–MS/MS analysis were used to detect 30 PFASs in vegetables.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>PFOA was detected in 7 out of the 53 samples, with concentrations of 0.038–1.996 ng/g fresh weight; PFOS was detected in 2 samples only, with concentrations ranging from 0.132 to 0.911 ng/g fresh weight. PFHxS was not detected in any sample in this study. PFOA and PFOS concentrations measured in vegetables in this study constituted daily intake of 2.03 ng/kg body weight (BW) and 1.98 ng/kg BW, respectively, according to recommended daily vegetable intake and body weight data from Australian Bureau of Statistics. The most sensitive population group is girls of 4–8 years of age. These estimated exposure levels represent up to 1.3% of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for PFOA (160 ng/kg BW) and 9.9% for PFOS (20 ng/kg BW) by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Consumption of the vegetables from the study locations poses a marginal risk to human health.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
