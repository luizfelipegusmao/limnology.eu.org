{"title":"Versatile Use of Para-Toluenesulfonic Acid in Organic Synthesis. A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1337/v1","date":1713862055000,"content":"p-Toluenesulfonic acid is commercially available, non-toxic, cheap organic compound with robust stability. p-Toluenesulfonic acid is solid, non-corrosive and a strong organic acid that can be handled easily. Due to this p-toluenesulfonic acid could be the better replacement of other conventional acids like nitric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid and AlCl3 in organic transformations. Moreover, p-toluenesulfonic acid could be used synergistically with other mode of catalysis like transition metal catalysis and photocatalysis. In recent years, the use of this solid organic acid in organic and polymer synthesis has grown tremendously. In this review, we present an overview of p-toluenesulfonic acid promoted various organic reactions with particular emphasis to the more recently reported methods. In some cases, we also detailed the understanding of the reactions by providing the reaction mechanism. Despite these advances, there are still many opportunities for the development of new reactions using PTSA. Industry and academia have become more conscious to adopt sustainable chemical processes using safer reagents and solvents and the use of PTSA in this context is highly significant. This review will inspire researchers for further reaction development employing p-toluenesulfonic acid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87098489538a16055dff207d42175b86a9f3ec762c22f5f18907973c4064297a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
