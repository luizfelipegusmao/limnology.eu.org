{"title":"How to Cristallize a Glass with a Femtosecond Laser","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1590/v1","date":1713940082000,"content":"Crystallization of glass through conventional thermal annealing in a furnace is a well-understood process. However, crystallization by femtosecond (fs) laser brings another dimension to this process. The pulsed nature of the irradiation necessitates a reevaluation of parameters for optimal crystallization and to understand the particularities in the case of using fs laser. This includes adjusting the laser pulse energy, the repetition rate, and the writing speed to either initiate nucleation or achieve substantial crystal growth. Therefore, a key challenge to this work is to establish reliable calculations for understanding the relation of the size of the crystallized region with respect to an ongoing transition (e.g., solid-to-solid, liquid-to-solid), and accounting for the aforementioned laser parameters. In this context and based on previous work, we simulate a temperature distribution (in space and time) to model the thermal treatment at any point in the glass. By setting the condition that the temperatures are between the glass transition and melting temperature, we can deduce the crystallized region size to be compared with experimental observations. For that purpose, the knowledge of the beam width at the focal point and of the absorbed beam energy fraction are critical inputs that were extracted from experiments found in the literature. After that, management of the crystallization process and the width of the crystallization line can be achieved according to pulse energy e.g. crystallite size, and also the effect of the scanning speed can be understood. Among the main conclusions to highlight, we disclose the laser conditions that determine the extent of the crystallized area and deduce that it is never interesting to increase the pulse energy too much but rather the repetition rate for uniform crystallized line.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e824e98e83c21de19bd8c570dd0388247be470b8e562928fa34d31b6efb4042","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
