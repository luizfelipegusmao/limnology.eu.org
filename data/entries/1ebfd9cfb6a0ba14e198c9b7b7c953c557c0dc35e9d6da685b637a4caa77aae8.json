{"title":"Effective Predictor Factors for Lymphy Node Metastasis and Survival in Patients with Betel Nut-Ralated Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1007/v1","date":1728962593000,"content":"Background: Statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare reported oral cancer as one of the most prevalent malignant cancers, with the third highest incidence and the fifth leading cause of death among men in Taiwan. Lymph node metastasis in oral cancer usually has a low survival rate, with no significant improvement in the past 30 years. Therefore, a more effective survival predictor is warranted. Many cancer studies revealed that monitoring tumor thickness and lymph node density, in addition to tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stages, can provide more accurate predictions.Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from 612 patients with oral cancer who had the habit of chewing betel nuts. The study focused on tumor thickness, lymph node density, and the regional distribution of lymph node metastasis to determine their effectiveness as predictors.Results: The results revealed that a tumor thickness of 6 mm indicated cervical lymph node metastasis and was the optimal cutoff point for overall survival. The optimal cutoff value for lymph node density was 0.04. Patients with a tumor thickness of &gt;6 mm and a lymph node density of &gt;0.04 had significantly lower overall survival rates. Additionally, patients with &gt;1 lymph node metastasis level and lower cervical metastasis exhibited a relatively worse prognosis.Conclusion: Therefore, in addition to TNM staging, tumor thickness, lymph node density and metastasis level are suitable as a parameter for predictors that can be used as references for adjuvant therapies for better therapeutic effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ebfd9cfb6a0ba14e198c9b7b7c953c557c0dc35e9d6da685b637a4caa77aae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
