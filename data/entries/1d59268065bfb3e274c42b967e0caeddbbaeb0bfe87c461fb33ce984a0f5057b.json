The two new species are morphologically compared with the other eight congeners, and can be distinguished by characters of the carapace and the male first gonopods. A phylogenetic tree was produced based on sequences of partial COX1. The establishment of the two new species was supported by both the results of the molecular analyses and the morphological descriptions,. This study brings the number of <span>Bottapotamon</span> species to ten.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"1d59268065bfb3e274c42b967e0caeddbbaeb0bfe87c461fb33ce984a0f5057b","category":"Environment"}
