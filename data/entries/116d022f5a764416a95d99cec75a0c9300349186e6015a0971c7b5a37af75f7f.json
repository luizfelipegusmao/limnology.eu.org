Some endosymbiotic bacteria, such as <span>Wolbachia</span>, cause their insect hosts to exclusively produce female offspring through male killing (MK) or feminization. In some lepidopteran insects, MK is achieved by affecting the sex-determining process in males, and a unique mechanism of MK and its functional link with feminization have been implicated. However, comparative analysis of these phenotypes is often difficult because they have been analyzed in different hostâ€“symbiont systems, and transinfection of <span>Wolbachia</span> across different hosts is often challenging. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of nine <span>Wolbachia</span> strains on the splicing of sex-determining genes in Lepidoptera by fixing the host genetic background using a cell culture system. Cell transinfection assays confirmed that three MK-inducing <span>Wolbachia</span> strains and one feminization-inducing <span>Wolbachia</span> strain increased the female-type splicing products of the core sex-determining genes <span>doublesex</span>, <span>masculinizer</span>, and <span>zinc finger protein 2</span>. Regarding <span>Wolbachia</span> strains that do not induce MK/feminization, three had no effect on these sex-determining genes, whereas two strains induced female-type splicing of <span>masculinizer</span> and <span>doublesex</span> but not <span>zinc finger protein 2</span>. Comparative genomics confirmed that homologs of <span>oscar</span>, the <span>Wolbachia</span> gene responsible for MK in <span>Ostrinia</span>, were encoded by four MK/feminizing <span>Wolbachia</span> strains, but not by five non-MK/nonfeminizing strains. These results support the conserved effects underlying MK and feminization induced by <span>oscar</span>-bearing <span>Wolbachia</span> and suggested other potential mechanisms that <span>Wolbachia</span> might employ to manipulate host sex.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"116d022f5a764416a95d99cec75a0c9300349186e6015a0971c7b5a37af75f7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
