{"title":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on Covid-19 incidence and mortality in the United States","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301830","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Fang Fang, John David Clemens, Zuo-Feng Zhang, Timothy F. Brewer</p>\r\nBackground <p>Given the waning of vaccine effectiveness and the shifting of the most dominant strains in the U.S., it is imperative to understand the association between vaccination coverage and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease and mortality at the community levels and whether that association might vary according to the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strains in the U.S.</p> Methods <p>Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate associations between U.S. county-level cumulative vaccination rates and booster distribution and the daily change in county-wide Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) risks and mortality during Alpha, Delta and Omicron predominance. Models were adjusted for potential confounders at both county and state level. A 2-week lag and a 4-week lag were introduced to assess vaccination rate impact on incidence and mortality, respectively.</p> Results <p>Among 3,073 counties in 48 states, the average county population complete vaccination rate of all age groups was 50.79% as of March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2022. Each percentage increase in vaccination rates was associated with reduction of 4% (relative risk (RR) 0.9607 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9553, 0.9661)) and 3% (RR 0.9694 (95% CI: 0.9653, 0.9736)) in county-wide COVID-19 cases and mortality, respectively, when Alpha was the dominant variant. The associations between county-level vaccine rates and COVID-19 incidence diminished during the Delta and Omicron predominance. However, each percent increase in people receiving a booster shot was associated with reduction of 6% (RR 0.9356 (95% CI: 0.9235, 0.9479)) and 4% (RR 0.9595 (95% CI: 0.9431, 0.9761)) in COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the community, respectively, during the Omicron predominance.</p> Conclusions <p>Associations between complete vaccination rates and COVID-19 incidence and mortality appeared to vary with shifts in the dominant variant, perhaps due to variations in vaccine efficacy by variant or to waning vaccine immunity over time. Vaccine boosters were associated with notable protection against Omicron disease and mortality.</p>","author":"Fang Fang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c6f0ca0195ed3dcb38d25b2e48a0db4650894478089c5d8b7a7254225f342417","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
