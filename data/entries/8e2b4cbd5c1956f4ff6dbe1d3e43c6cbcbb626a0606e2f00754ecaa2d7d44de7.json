{"title":"Clostridial Infections in Cattle: A Comprehensive Review with Emphasis on Current Data Gaps in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0408/v1","date":1722933778000,"content":"Clostridial infections in cattle are a significant concern for Brazilian livestock. These diseases are caused by various species of Clostridium, which are known for their ability to produce potent toxins. Botulism in cattle is a serious and often fatal condition caused by the ingestion of neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum. This bacterium thrives in decomposing organic matter, such as spoiled feed, carcasses, and contaminated water. Tetanus while less common, tetanus is a serious disease following contamination of wounds with Clostridium tetani spores. It results in muscle stiffness, spasms, and often death due to respiratory failure. Blackleg (C. chauvoei) is this disease primarily affects young cattle, leading to acute lameness, swelling, and high fever. Malignant edema (C. septicum and others) is characterized by rapid onset of swelling at wound sites, malignant edema can occur after injuries or surgical procedures. Enterotoxemia is triggered by the rapid growth of C. perfringens in the gut following excessive carbohydrate intake. This leads to toxin production that causing sudden death. In conclusion, clostridial bovine infections remain a persistent challenge for Brazilian cattle farmers. With continued focus on vaccination, good management practices, and research, the impact of these diseases can be minimized, safeguarding the livestock industry's economic viability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e2b4cbd5c1956f4ff6dbe1d3e43c6cbcbb626a0606e2f00754ecaa2d7d44de7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
