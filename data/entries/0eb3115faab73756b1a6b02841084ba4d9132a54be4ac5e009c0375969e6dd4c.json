{"title":"Multiple risk factors are associated with an incremental increase in acute venous thromboembolism risk after total joint arthroplasty: A pearldiver cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308813","date":1723212000000,"content":"<p>by Mandeep Kumar, Regina O. Kostyun, Matthew J. Solomito, Mitchell McClure</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Several risk factors are associated with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However, there is a lack of literature regarding the cumulative impact of multiple risk factors. To address this gap, we utilized the PearlDiver database, an insurance billing claims database containing de-identified data from 91 million orthopedic patients.</p> Methods <p>The PearlDiver database was queried for records of patients who underwent total hip and knee arthroplasty from 2010 to 2019 using ICD-10 and CPT codes. Twelve persistent and two transient risk factors were analyzed for their association with the occurrence of acute VTE within three months after surgery. Univariate and logistic regression analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were conducted to determine the odds associated with each risk factor and the impact of multiple concurrent risk factors.</p> Results <p>A total of 988,675 patients who underwent hip and knee arthroplasty met the inclusion criteria, of whom 1.5% developed acute VTE after three months. The prevalence of VTE risk factors ranged from 0.2 to 38.6%. Individual, persistent risk factors demonstrated 14â€“84% increased odds of VTE compared to a 1.2% increase for a transient risk factor (acute myocardial infarction). Three or more persistent risk factors were associated with a higher risk of VTE.</p> Conclusion and relevance <p>Persistent risk factors were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative VTE than transient risk factors. An incremental increase in risk was noted if three or more persistent risk factors were present.</p>","author":"Mandeep Kumar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0eb3115faab73756b1a6b02841084ba4d9132a54be4ac5e009c0375969e6dd4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
