This comparison is crucial for identifying discrepancies that may arise during the fabrication process, potentially impacting the chip's performance. The GDSII file format, standing as a cornerstone in this process, encapsulates the design data essential for manufacturing and verification purposes. Extracting the GDSII from the actual chip necessitates high-resolution imaging to capture the intricate details of different chip layers, followed by sophisticated image processing techniques for segmentation and GDSII extraction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"55cd93b5178110bc779c6bad0521ab2f02730897ca63968af86dfb04078672ae","category":"Environment"}
