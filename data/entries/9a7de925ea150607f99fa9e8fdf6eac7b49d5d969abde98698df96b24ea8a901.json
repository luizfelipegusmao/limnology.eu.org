{"title":"Network analysis retrieving bioactive compounds from Spirulina (<i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) and their targets related to systemic lupus erythematosus","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309303","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Amnart Chaiprasert, Ping Han, Teeraphan Laomettachit, Marasri Ruengjitchatchawalya</p>\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressive drugs are essential for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment, but there are concerns about their toxicity. In this study, <i>Arthrospira platensis</i> was used as a resource for screening of the SLE-related bioactive compounds. To discover the potential compounds, a total of 833 compounds of <i>A</i>. <i>platensis</i> C1 were retrieved from the Spirulina-Proteome Repository (SpirPro) database and by literature mining. We retrieved structures and bioassays of these compounds from PubChem database; and collected approved and potential drugs for SLE treatment from DrugBank and other databases. The result demonstrated that cytidine, desthiobiotin, agmatine, and anthranilic acid, from the alga, has Tanimoto matching scores of 100% with the following drugs: Î²-arabinosylcytosine/cytarabine, d-dethiobiotin, agmatine, and anthranilic acid, respectively. The bioassay matching and disease-gene-drug-compound network analysis, using VisANT 4.0 and Cytoscape, revealed 471 SLE-related genes. Among the SLE-related genes, MDM2, TP53, and JAK2 were identified as targets of cytarabine, while PPARG and IL1B were identified as targets of d-dethiobiotin. Binding affinity between the drug ligands and the algal bioactive compound ligands with their corresponding receptors were similarly comparable scores and stable, examined by molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations, respectively.","author":"Amnart Chaiprasert","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9a7de925ea150607f99fa9e8fdf6eac7b49d5d969abde98698df96b24ea8a901","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
