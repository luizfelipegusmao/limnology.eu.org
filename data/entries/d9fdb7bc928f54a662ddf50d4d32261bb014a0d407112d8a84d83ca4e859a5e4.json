{"title":"Genetic Markers of Helicobacter pylori Antibiotic Resistance in Moscow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0812/v1","date":1712886827000,"content":"The Maastricht VI/Florence consensus recommends, as one of the measures to enhance the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection eradication, a personalized treatment approach involving the selection of an antimicrobial agent based on the pre-determined resistance of H. pylori. To meet the need to develop test systems for personalized drug selection, we conducted a study of H. pylori molecular resistance in Moscow using a self-developed Sanger sequencing test platform. We validated our test system on 25 pure culture samples of H. pylori with known resistance. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting resistance to clarithromycin was 100%, and to levofloxacin - 93% and 92%, respectively. Then we tested our platform on 112 H. pylori -positive patients who had not previously received proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or antibacterial drugs. Mutations indicating resistance to clarithromycin were found in 27 (24%) samples, and to levofloxacin in 26 (23%) samples. Double resistance was observed in 16 (14%) samples. The most common mutations leading to clarithromycin resistance were 2143G and 2142G, to levofloxacin resistance – 261A and 271A in the gyrA gene, which account for 69% of all identified genetic determinants in levofloxacin-resistant bacteria. Thus, a personalized approach to the selection of H. pylori eradication therapy based on the detection of bacterial resistance before prescribing first-line therapy could help avoid the prescription of ineffective H. pylori eradication therapies and, overall, contribute to the control of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9fdb7bc928f54a662ddf50d4d32261bb014a0d407112d8a84d83ca4e859a5e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
