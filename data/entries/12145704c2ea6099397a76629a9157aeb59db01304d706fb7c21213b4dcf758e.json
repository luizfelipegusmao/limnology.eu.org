Female, male, and juvenile seahorses had feeding sounds characterized for peak (dominant) frequency (Hz), sound pressure level (SPL), and duration (ms). Subject body size and condition was estimated by standard length (SL, cm), to determine an estimate of body condition index (BCI). An inverse correlation between mean peak frequency (Hz) of clicks and SL was found for females. A negative correlation between peak frequency (Hz) of clicks and a residual BCI was determined for both males and females, suggesting that acoustic signals may contain information regarding fitness.</p>","author":"Brittany A.
