{"title":"Possibilities of Increasing the Ampacity of Overhead Lines Using HTLS Conductors in the Electric Power System of the Slovak Republic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2077/v1","date":1717077207000,"content":"The examination of ampacity in overhead transmission lines offers a comprehensive overview, covering its definition, thermal evaluation methodologies, standards, practical applications, and the potential of high-temperature low-sag (HTLS) conductors. By navigating through static and dynamic approaches to thermal evaluation and detailing methodologies prescribed by international standards like those from CIGRE and IEEE, this study provides a solid understanding of how ampacity is determined and optimized. Furthermore, the exploration of HTLS conductors introduces a forward-looking perspective on enhancing transmission capacity whereas mitigating the need for extensive infrastructure modifications. Through an analysis of regional considerations and preferences using Slovak standards and CIGRE Technical Brochure 601, insights are provided on how environmental factors influence transmission line performance. The analysis of the transition from traditional ACSR to advanced ACCC (Aluminium Conductor Composite Core) conductors demonstrates the tangible benefits of adopting advanced conductor technologies in real-world scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa31724b6c3ebabd6284c9f3e117795d68f8201d7c222acc0f7b62aec672b629","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
