{"title":"The Escalating Antibiotic Crisis in Nigeria: A Violation of Human Rights and Ethical Imperatives &ndash; Commentary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1295/v1","date":1726567389000,"content":"The escalating antibiotic crisis in Nigeria presents a critical challenge, violating fundamental human rights and ethical obligations. Skyrocketing antibiotic costs severely restrict access to essential medications, particularly for vulnerable populations. This crisis not only exacerbates health disparities but also fuels the emergence of antibiotic resistance, posing grave public health risks. Rooted in regulatory gaps, lack of transparency in drug pricing, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, the crisis demands a comprehensive, collaborative response. Policy interventions targeting antibiotic affordability, regulatory reforms, and healthcare infrastructure investments are imperative. Upholding ethical standards and accountability mechanisms is essential to ensuring equitable access to antibiotics and safeguarding public health in Nigeria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"694f6df66554b5a3f49086fe28be9e1312d7b108045f8cababe4163ae5378621","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
