{"title":"An Ultra-Selective and Sensitive Fluorescent Chemosensor based on Phage Display Derived Peptide with N-Terminal Cu(II)-Binding Motif","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2254/v1","date":1727686914000,"content":"Copper, along with gold, was among the first metals that humans employed. Thus, copper pol-lution of the world's water resources is escalating, posing a significant threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems. It is crucial to develop a detection technology that is both low-cost and fea-sible, as well as ultra-selective and sensitive. This study explores the use of the NH2-Xxx-His motif-derived peptide from phage display technology for ultra-selective Cu2+ detection. Various Cu-binding M13 phage clones were isolated, and their affinity and cross-reactivity for different metal ions were determined. A detailed analysis of the amino acid sequence of the unique Cu-binding peptides was employed. For the development of an optical chemosensor, a peptide with an NH2-Xxx-His motif was selected. The dansyl group was incorporated during solid phase peptide synthesis, and fluorescence detection assays were employed. The efficacy of the Cu2+-binding peptide was verified through spectroscopic measurements. In summary, we de-veloped a highly selective and sensitive fluorescent chemosensor for Cu2+ detection based on a peptide sequence from phage display library that carries the N-terminal Xxx-His motif.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbe66dfed92e73f75f64ae81a501a4ae360db725ee7865ff8fb4b362497589b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
