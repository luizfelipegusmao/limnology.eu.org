{"title":"Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors in the Treatment of Epilepsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2300/v1","date":1727680113000,"content":"Epilepsy is a brain disease characterized by a persistent predisposition to epileptic seizures. The current issue is the development of new methods of epilepsy therapy, In particular, using gene therapy methods. Promising areas of research in this field are the modulation of the expression of a number of neuropeptides, ion channels, transcription factors, neurotrophic factors, etc., as well as the use of antisense oligonucleotides. One of the optimal vectors for the delivery of therapeutic transgenes is the adenoassociated virus (AAV), which is most often used in the gene therapy of neurological disorders due to the high transduction ability of neuronal tissues and low immunogenicity/cytotoxicity. In this study, we analyze the existing achievements in the use of AAV vectors in the treatment of epilepsy of various etiologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"431c7b64fd90e963083c02e35c1fe5cca8c135bd22e4e5badb926ed2636bea6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
