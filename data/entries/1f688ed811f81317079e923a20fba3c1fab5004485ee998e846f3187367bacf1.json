{"title":"Exploring Short-Range Ordering in Semiconducting Materials","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.565/7719924?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Short-range ordering (SRO) has been widely observed in bulk alloys and significantly affects their mechanical properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.565-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.565-B2\">2</a>]. However, the investigation of ordering characteristics in semiconductors has been largely unexplored. The ability to tune the band gap within a single structure via SRO has the potential to revolutionize the semiconductor industry and the design of reconfigurable transistors [<a href=\"#ozae044.565-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.565-B4\">4</a>]. For instance, adding Sn to Si/Ge structures can lead to distinct electronic structures for the same composition simply via ordering phenomena on the atomic scale [<a href=\"#ozae044.565-B5\">5</a>]. Therefore, studying the precise characteristics of ordering in semiconducting materials provides an exciting opportunity to better tailor their electrical behavior. Semiconducting thin films provide a unique opportunity to study the structure-property relationship inside an electron microscope and to investigate the effects of SRO on electronic structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.565-B6\">6</a>]. In this work we present a systematic approach to (1) visualize SRO in semiconductors and to (2) manipulate the ordering using ion beam irradiation. As a sample system we use thin films consisting of multiple stacks with varying compositions of Si-Ge-Sn. Figure 1a shows a HAADF (high-angle annular dark-field) STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) image of such a sample consisting of Ge-Sn and Ge-Sn-Si layers. The comparison of different growth methods and the variation in composition enables us to comprehensively explore SRO effects on electronic structure. To visualize SRO in our material systems, we use energy-filtered 4DSTEM which allows us to analyze the diffuse intensity distribution in between the sharp Bragg discs. Figure 1b illustrates the approach to visualize the diffusive intensities via electron diffraction and figure 1c shows an experimental mean 4DSTEM diffraction pattern of the multilayered Ge-Sn/Ge-Sn-Si sample. The dashed circle indicates the position of the aperture used for the virtual dark field image. To interpret the experimental data, we perform diffraction pattern simulations (<span>abTEM</span>) using a corresponding supercell. By identifying characteristic motifs using a machine learning approach within the experimental and simulated dataset, we can draw conclusions about the atomic structure that are causing the diffusive intensities. After understanding the SRO in semiconducting nanostructures, we can tune the atomic ordering via ion beam irradiation. In addition to thermal annealing, we identify scanning focused helium ion beam irradiation as a promising tool to directly change the local ordering leading to a tunable writing and reading approach [<a href=\"#ozae044.565-B7\">7</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1f688ed811f81317079e923a20fba3c1fab5004485ee998e846f3187367bacf1","category":"Environment"}
