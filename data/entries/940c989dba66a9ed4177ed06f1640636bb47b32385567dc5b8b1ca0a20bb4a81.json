{"title":"Dynamics of actinotrichia, fibrous collagen structures in zebrafish fin tissues, unveiled by novel fluorescent probes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae266/7706382?rss=1","date":1720137600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Collagen fibers provide physical support to animal tissues by orienting in the correct position and at optimal density. Actinotrichia are thick collagen fibers that are present at the tips of fish fins and serve as scaffolds for bone formation. The arrangement and density of actinotrichia must be constantly maintained with a high degree of regularity to form spatial patterns in the fin bones, but the mechanisms of this process are largely unknown. To address this issue, we first identified two fluorescent probes that can stain actinotrichia clearly in vivo. Using these probes and time-lapse observation of actinotrichia synthesized at different growth stages, we revealed the following previously unknown dynamics of actinotrichia. (i) Actinotrichia do not stay stationary at the place where they are produced; instead, they move towards the dorsal area during the notochord bending and (ii) move towards the distal tip during the fin growth. (iii) Actinotrichia elongate asymmetrically as new collagen is added at the proximal side. (iv) Density is maintained by the insertion of new actinotrichia. (v) Actinotrichia are selectively degraded by osteoclasts. These findings suggest that the regular arrangement of actinotrichia is the outcome of multiple dynamic processes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"940c989dba66a9ed4177ed06f1640636bb47b32385567dc5b8b1ca0a20bb4a81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
