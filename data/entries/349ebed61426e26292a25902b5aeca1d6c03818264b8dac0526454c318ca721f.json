{"title":"Functional studies of McSTE24, McCYP305a1, and McJHEH, three essential genes act in cantharidin biosynthesis in the blister beetle (Coleoptera: Meloidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae070/7710976?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cantharidin is a toxic defensive substance secreted by most blister beetles when attacked. It has been used to treat many complex diseases since ancient times and has recently regained popularity as an anticancer agent. However, the detailed mechanism of the cantharidin biosynthesis has not been completely addressed. In this study, we cloned <span>McSTE24</span> (encoding STE24 endopeptidase) from terpenoid backbone pathway, <span>McCYP305a1</span> (encoding cytochrome P450, family 305) and <span>McJHEH</span> [encoding subfamily A, polypeptide 1 and juvenile hormone (JH) epoxide hydrolase] associated to JH synthesis/degradation in the blister beetle <span>Mylabris cichorii</span> (Linnaeus, 1758, Coleoptera: Meloidae). Expression pattern analyses across developmental stages in adult males revealed that the expressions of 3 transcripts were closely linked to cantharidin titer exclusively during the peak period of cantharidin synthesis (20â€“25 days old). In contrast, at other stages, these genes may primarily regulate different biological processes. When RNA interference with double-stranded RNA suppressed the expressions of the 3 genes individually, significant reductions in cantharidin production were observed in males and also in females following <span>McJHEH</span> knockdown, indicating that these 3 genes might primarily contribute to cantharidin biosynthesis in males, but not in females, while females could self-synthesis a small amount of cantharidin. These findings support the previously hypothesized sexual dimorphism in cantharidin biosynthesis during the adult phase. <span>McCYP305a1</span> collaborates with its upstream gene <span>McSTE24</span> in cantharidin biosynthesis, while <span>McJHEH</span> independently regulates cantharidin biosynthesis in males.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"349ebed61426e26292a25902b5aeca1d6c03818264b8dac0526454c318ca721f","category":"Environment"}
