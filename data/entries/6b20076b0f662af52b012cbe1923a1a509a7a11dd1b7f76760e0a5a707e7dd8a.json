{"title":"Open-Source Code: Data Logger System for Monitoring and Fault Detection in Bench Testing of Combustion Engines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1329/v1","date":1718779528000,"content":"This paper describes the proposal and development of a proof of concept (PoC) for a data logger system designed for operation and fault detection in bench testing of combustion engines. The main objective was to develop a data logger system that collects data on vibration, sound, temperature, and CO2 levels to identify ignition and combustion faults, thereby contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The paper presents (i) the proposal and development and (ii) the open-source code: proof of concept for a data logger system focused on detecting faults and monitoring the operational condition of benchtop combustion engines. The results indicate the feasibility of the PoC for data acquisition and dataset creation for Research and Development purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b20076b0f662af52b012cbe1923a1a509a7a11dd1b7f76760e0a5a707e7dd8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
