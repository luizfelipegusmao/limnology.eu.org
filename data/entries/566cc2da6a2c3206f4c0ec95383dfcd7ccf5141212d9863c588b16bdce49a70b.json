{"title":"An Assessment of Local People's Knowledge and Management Practices of Freshwater Macrophytes in Three Kenyan Lakes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lre.12461?af=R","date":1721383161000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>It is increasingly being recognised that local people's knowledge can contribute to the ecological and socioeconomic goals of natural resource management programmes. Yet, few studies have examined local people's knowledge concerning freshwater macrophyte diversity. Consequently, the extent to which local people's knowledge can contribute to mitigating freshwater macrophyte degradation and supporting their management remains largely unknown. To contribute towards filling this knowledge gap, we investigated local people's knowledge, perceptions and management practices of freshwater macrophyte species. Data collection involved conducting face-to-face in-depth interviews and focus group discussions among local people who lived in areas adjacent to Lake Baringo, Nyanza Gulf of Lake Victoria and the Kenyan side of Lake Jipe. The sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents were summarised using descriptive statistics. Then, generalised linear mixed-effect models were used to test whether the respondent's sociodemographic characteristics were associated with their macrophyte species recognition skills, benefits and problems associated with macrophytes and management practices. Our respondents named a total of 35 macrophyte species, with each respondent naming an average of six species. Our results showed that respondents who were not involved in fishing and fish-related activities identified more macrophytes than those who participated in such activities. Additionally, individuals who frequently visited the lake named more macrophyte species compared to those who visited either daily or occasionally. While our respondents acknowledged various benefits and problems associated with macrophytes, there was a higher recognition rate for those that directly impacted humans. Regarding local management practices, it was observed that macrophytes were not conserved, with management efforts focusing solely on problematic species. Overall, macrophyte naming skills, knowledge on provisioning and supporting ecosystem services, direct adverse macrophyte impacts and management methods increased with age. We identified knowledge gaps regarding alien species and the indirect impacts of macrophytes. Addressing these gaps is crucial.</p>","author":"Rebeccah Kwamboka Onwong'a, \nAyub M. O.
