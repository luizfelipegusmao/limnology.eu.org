Scaling the production of In microbumps and pads to larger substrates such as 300 mm wafers requires novel manufacturing processes such as electroplating to replace the commonly used lift-off process. Tight control of layer thickness, impurities, intermetallic formation, possible interface voiding and filling behavior of the In structures by cross-sectional SEM imaging is required to support the process development. Mechanical cleaving, sawing or that grinding is not suitable for cross-sectioning, because it deforms the soft In structures, leading to strong preparation artifacts in the images. Preparing cross-sections by Ga<sup>+</sup> or Xe<sup>+</sup> focused ion beam (FIB) at room temperature results in severe alterations of the In structure as well, such as delamination and void formation. While the cause of these artifacts has not yet been conclusively clarified, it has been shown that they can be minimized by cryo-FIB, i.e., by cooling the sample to cryogenic temperatures during the milling [<a href=\"#ozae044.613-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.613-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7039df624b9ab3c79f5c6656dcabb26e76b593781e2589f2d2c628a85b6d03f1","category":"Environment"}
