{"title":"Feasibility of a Personal Neuromorphic Emulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1147/v1","date":1721039718000,"content":"The representation of intelligence is achieved by patterns of connections among neurons in brains and machines. Brains grow continuously, such that their patterns of connections develop through activity-dependent specification with the continuing ontogenesis of individual experience. The theory of active inference proposes that the developmental organization of sentient systems reflects general processes of informatic self-evidencing, through the minimization of free energy, that may be described in information terms that are not dependent on a specific physical substrate. At a certain level of complexity, self-evidencing of living (self-organizing) information systems becomes hierarchic and reentrant, such that effective consciousness emerges as the consequence of a good regulator. These principles imply that an adequate reconstruction of the computational dynamics of an individual human brain is possible with a sufficient neuromorphic emulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f2526e2f3b88f57634c8a1a7add7f1cae4043dc6fd4d54e9e170aad423f9fa7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
