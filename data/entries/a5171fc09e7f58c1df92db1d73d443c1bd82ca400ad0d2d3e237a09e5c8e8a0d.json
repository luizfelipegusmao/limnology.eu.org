{"title":"Identification and molecular docking of tyrosinase inhibitory peptides from allophycocyanin in Spirulina platensis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13249?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Tyrosinase, a copper-containing metalloenzyme with catalytic activity, is widely found in mammals. It is the key rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes melanin synthesis. For humans, tyrosinase is beneficial to the darkening of eyes and hair. However, excessive deposition of melanin in the skin can lead to dull skin color and lead to pigmentation. Therefore, many skin-whitening compounds have been developed to decrease tyrosinase activity. This study aimed to identify a new tyrosinase inhibitory peptide through enzymatic hydrolysis, <i>in vitro</i> activity verification, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A tripeptide Asp-Glu-Arg (DER) was identified, with a ‘-CDOCKER_Energy’ value of 121.26 Kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. DER has effective tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Research shows that its half maximal inhibitory concentration value is 1.04 ± 0.01 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>. In addition, DER binds to tyrosinase residues His85, His244, His259, and Asn260, which are key residues that drive the interaction between the peptide and tyrosinase. Finally, through MD simulation, the conformational changes and structural stability of the complexes were further explored to verify and supplement the results of molecular docking.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This experiment shows that DER can effectively inhibit tyrosinase activity. His244, His259, His260, and Asn260 are the critical residues that drive the interaction between the peptide and tyrosinase, and hydrogen bonding is an important force. DER from <i>Spirulina</i> has the potential to develop functional products with tyrosinase inhibition. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zhipeng Yu, \nHong Lv, \nMingjie Zhou, \nPengcheng Fu, \nWenzhu Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a5171fc09e7f58c1df92db1d73d443c1bd82ca400ad0d2d3e237a09e5c8e8a0d","category":"Environment"}
