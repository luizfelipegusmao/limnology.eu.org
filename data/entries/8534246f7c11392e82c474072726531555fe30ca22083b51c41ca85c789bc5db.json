{"title":"Chronic Rheumatologic Disease in Chikungunya Virus Fever: Results from a Cohort Study Conducted in Piedecuesta, Colombia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1519/v1","date":1726741264000,"content":"This study aimed to determine the incidence of post-chikungunya chronic rheumatism (pCHIK-CR) its impact on quality of life (QoL) and chronic fatigue in adult seven years after the 2014-2015 CHIKV outbreak in Piedecuesta, Colombia. We evaluated 78 adults (median age: 30 years, IQR: 21.0; women 60.3%) with confirmed CHIKV infection. In 2022, participants underwent a GALS examination and completed surveys on disability, stiffness, health status, and fatigue. A rheumatologist evaluated patients who reported arthralgia, morning stiffness, and abnormal GALS examination. Chronic fatigue was defined as fatigue persisting for over six months. Seven years after infection, 14.1% of participants were classified as pCHIK-CR cases, 41.0% as having non-inflammatory pain likely degenerative (NIP-LD), and 44.9% without rheumatic disease (Wo-RM). Patients with pCHIK-CR and NIP-LD exhibited significantly worse QoL compared to Wo-RM cases. Chronic fatigue prevalence increased from 8.6% in Wo-RM patients to 25.0% in NIP-LD and 54.6% in pCHIK-CR cases. This study implemented a comprehensive clinical as-sessment to objectively estimate and characterize the incidence of chronic rheumatological disease attributed to CHIKV infection. One in seven cases with CHIKV infection develops pCHIK-CR, which impacts both QoL and chronic fatigue. This study contributes to understanding the burden of these arboviruses in the medium term.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8534246f7c11392e82c474072726531555fe30ca22083b51c41ca85c789bc5db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
