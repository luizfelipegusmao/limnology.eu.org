{"title":"Plant-Derived Exosomes: Nano-Inducers of Cross Kingdom Regulations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2048/v1","date":1721961094000,"content":"Exosomes are produced by all cell types, their biogenesis is of endosomal origin, originating as a result of cell membrane invagination. Furthermore, physiochemical characteristics are important prerequisites for their commercial application. The representative size range of exosomes is 50-200 nm. Whereas, comparative to animal cell, exosomes from plant cell sources have a relatively larger size range, moreover, exhibit broader therapeutic potential. In this review study, we have briefly discussed the research potential of plant-derived exosomes. Including their earlier studies on biogenesis, characterization, isolation methods, and possible therapeutic applications. Additionally, we have quoted targeted drug delivery for targeted therapies and have provided insights of methods for customizing exosomes produced from plants with various drugs. Most-importantly, here we have embodied exosomes from plant sources are natural nano-inducers possessing the ability for inter-kingdom communication, resulting in cross-kingdom regulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"223a573451229fa042671e36b3d6b5e5019b1c957544f98e3b54bf912284d36c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
