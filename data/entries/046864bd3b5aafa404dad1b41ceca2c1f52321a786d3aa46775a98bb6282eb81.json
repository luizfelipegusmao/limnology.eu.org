{"title":"Predicting Blockchain Technology Adoption in Education: An Application of the UTAUT2 Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0210/v1","date":1714976621000,"content":"This quantitative, predictive correlation study examined the factors influencing behavioral intentions to adopt blockchain technology in educational settings across the United States. Grounded in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model, the research investigated the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit on intentions to use blockchain in education among IT officers. Data was collected from 160 participants through an online survey and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings revealed that performance expectancy and social influence significantly predicted behavioral intentions towards blockchain adoption, while effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit did not exhibit significant relationships. Furthermore, behavioral intention emerged as a strong predictor of actual blockchain technology utilization in educational institutions. The study contributes to the burgeoning field by validating UTAUT2's applicability to blockchain acceptance in education and providing insights to drive strategic implementation approaches. However, limitations related to causality, measurement, generalizability, and sample size are acknowledged, paving the way for future research endeavors across diverse stakeholder groups, contextual factors, and longitudinal perspectives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"046864bd3b5aafa404dad1b41ceca2c1f52321a786d3aa46775a98bb6282eb81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
