{"title":"Spatio-Temporal Influence of the Distribution of Forensically Relevant Blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Gyeongsangnam-Do, South Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1903/v1","date":1719449186000,"content":"The study of blowfly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) biodiversity and distribution is crucial for forensic investigations. Abiotic and biotic factors, such as seasonal and habitat type, have significant impact on blowfly populations. However, only a few forensic entomology studies have been conducted in South Korea, particularly in the Gyeongsangnam-do region. To address this, an extensive year-long survey was conducted to analyze the compositions, habitat preferences, distribution, and seasonal abundance of forensically relevant blowflies in urban and forested habitats of Gyeongsangnam-do, utilizing mouse carcass-baited traps set for 48 h each month. A total of 3,478 adult blowflies were recorded, encompassing six genera and 14 species, with a noted absence of specimens during the winter months. The predominant species was Lucilia porphyrina, accounting for 37.1% of the total sample, followed by Chrysomya pinguis (27.5%), Lucilia sericata (7.6%), and Lucilia illustris (7.1%). The species composition was consistent across all surveyed regions; however, seasonal variation in species diversity was evident, with a peak in spring and a decline in summer. Notably, certain species exhibited clear preferences for either urban (Calliphora calliphoroides and L. sericata) or forested habitats (L. porphyrina and Ch. pinguis). This pioneering study elucidates the diverse blowfly communities in Gyeongsangnam-do, highlighting significant seasonal and habitat-dependent variations. These findings enrich our understanding of blowfly ecology in this region, offering valuable insights for forensic applications and underscoring the necessity for ongoing entomological surveillance and research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78a8a01eee8cd70f757c3e52e9832bf29211425710342ad000553dcf8540c93c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
