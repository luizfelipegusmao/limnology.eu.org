{"title":"Removal of older males increases extra-pair siring success of yearling males","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002584","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Emmi Schlicht, Carol Gilsenan, Peter Santema, Agnes Türk, Andrea Wittenzellner, Bart Kempenaers</p>\r\n\r\nIn animals, reproductive performance typically improves over time early in life. Several ultimate and proximate mechanisms may contribute to such an age-related improvement and these mechanisms can act in a relative or in an absolute sense. Low performance of young individuals may be the consequence of a comparison or competition with older individuals (relative), or it may be due to specific traits of young individuals and be unrelated to the presence of older competitors (absolute). Here, we perform a test to disentangle whether the effect of age class (yearling or older) on male extra-pair siring success is relative or absolute. Male age is the most consistent predictor of male extra-pair siring success across bird species, yet the mechanisms underlying this pattern are not well understood. Low extra-pair siring success of yearling males may be a consequence of the presence of older (“adult”) males (hypothesis 1), because adult males are more successful in intra- and intersexual interactions or because females prefer to copulate with adult males when available (relative preference). Alternatively, low extra-pair siring success of yearlings may be independent of the presence of adult males (hypothesis 2), for example, if yearling males on average invest less in extra-pair behavior or if females avoid them as extra-pair mates, independent of the availability of older males (absolute preference). To distinguish between these 2 hypotheses, we experimentally manipulated the age structure of a nest-box-breeding population of blue tits (<i>Cyanistes caeruleus</i>) by removing almost all adult males, and compared patterns of extra-pair paternity in the experimental year with those from the preceding 15 “control” years. Removal of adult males resulted in a substantial increase in the extra-pair siring success of yearling males compared to the “control” years, but did not affect the population-level frequency of extra-pair paternity or its spatial patterns. Our results provide clear evidence that extra-pair siring success of yearlings can increase and that it depends on the presence of older males in the population, indicating a relative effect of age on reproductive performance. These results suggest that older males outcompete yearling males in direct or indirect interactions, in sperm competition or as a result of differences in attractiveness to females.","author":"Emmi Schlicht","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"1d0fe229d013b90848263ebe2f2a748b455cad98d80daf0e6cc38bc46b05f590","category":"Environment"}
