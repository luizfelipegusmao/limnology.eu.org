{"title":"Pathological Study of Demyelination with Cellular Reactions in the Cerebellum of Dogs Infected with Canine Distemper Virus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0627/v1","date":1728464604000,"content":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between demyelination and glial cell responses in the cerebellum of CDV-infected dogs. We subdivided the disease staging by adding the degree of demyelination determined by LFB staining to the previously reported disease staging from the acute stage to the chronic stage, and investigated the relationship between demyelination in cerebellum and the number and histological changes of astroglia, microglia and Purkinje cells in each stage. Reactions of astrocytes and microglia were observed at an early stage when demyelination was not evident. Changes progressed with demyelination. Demyelination initially began in the medulla adjoining the fourth ventricle and gradually spread to the entire cerebellum, including lobes. CDV immune-positive granules were seen from the early stage, and inclusion bodies also appeared at the same time. CDV immune-positive reaction and inclusion bodies were observed in astrocytes, microglia, neurons, ependymal cells, and even leptomenin-geal mononuclear cells. On the other hand, infiltration of CDV immunoreactive particles from the pia mater to the gray matter and further into the white matter through the granular layer was observed from an early stage. Purkinje cells decreased from the intermediate stage, and a decrease in cells in the granular layer was also observed. There was no clear association between age and each stage, and the stages did not progress with age.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5194cd27bdba6246c986c8e4047c79f20f6efb9c7470e6c2a6bc9e2708d5f409","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
