{"title":"Highly Oxygenated Cyclobutane Ring in Biomolecules: Insights into Structure and Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1471/v1","date":1713870711000,"content":"This review explores the unique structural and functional characteristics of natural products featuring highly oxygenated cyclobutane rings, with a specific focus on oxetane and 1,2-dioxetane motifs. It presents the structures and biological activities of compounds containing these rings, highlighting their contribution to molecular stability and pharmacological potency. Through detailed case studies and recent research findings, it has been demonstrated that these oxygen-rich rings enhance the molecular diversity and biological efficacy of natural products, potentially offering new avenues for drug development. Notably, these compounds are predominantly synthesized by microorganisms and can also be found in extracts from fungi, plants, and certain marine invertebrates. Compounds with oxetane and 1,2-dioxetane rings are primarily noted for their strong antineoplastic properties, among other biological activities. In contrast, most 1,2-dioxetanes exhibit potent antiprotozoal effects. It is important to note that 1,2-dioxetanes often serve as intermediate products in oxidation reactions, characterized by their instability and propensity to decompose into new compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be648d935d4cb929f859ede8d1ff74632dac69c736d4fafc102c47ff556fa45b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
