{"title":"Characteristics of a 1200Â V Hybrid Power Switch Comprising a Si IGBT and a SiC MOSFET","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2085/v1","date":1727343166000,"content":"Hybrid Power Switches (HPS) combine the advantages of SiC unipolar and Si bipolar devices and therefore can bridge the gap between these technologies. In this paper, the performance of a hybrid power switch configuration based on the latest SiC MOSFET and Si IGBT technologies is presented. The device is evaluated through experimental measurements of its characteristics under various conditions. The results show the HPS can achieve switching losses as low as a SiC MOSFET while offering the high current capability of the IGBT without significant increase in costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"490d556a918525cdb800644e5ee89de97318201041c8fd7bf58c6e525348d687","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
