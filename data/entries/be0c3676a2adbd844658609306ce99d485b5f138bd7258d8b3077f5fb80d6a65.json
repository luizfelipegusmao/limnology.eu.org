{"title":"Guided Transformation of Abandoned Hydrocarbon Fields into Heat Storage Solutions Using Enhanced MCDA-AHP Geostatical Based Method, Hungarian Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0894/v1","date":1718250910000,"content":"This study introduces a robust methodology utilizing Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) combined with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to repurpose abandoned hydrocarbon fields for energy storage, supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. We use a geostatistical approach integrated with Python scripting to analyze reservoir parameters—including porosity, permeability, thickness, lithology, temperature, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity—from a decommissioned hydrocarbon field in Southeast Hungary. Our workflow leverages stochastic simulation data to identify potential zones for energy storage, categorizing them into high, moderate, and low suitability scenarios. This innovative approach provides rapid and precise analysis, enabling effective decision-making for energy storage implementation in depleted fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be0c3676a2adbd844658609306ce99d485b5f138bd7258d8b3077f5fb80d6a65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
