{"title":"Influence of Ceramic Size and Morphology on Interface Bonding and Mechanical Properties of TWIP Steel Matrix Composites Produced by Lost Foam Casting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0596/v1","date":1723100159000,"content":"This study investigates the fabrication and characterization of large-sized ceramic-reinforced TWIP (Twinning-Induced Plasticity) steel matrix composites using the lost foam casting technique. Various ceramic shapes and sizes, including blocky, flaky, rod-like, and granular forms, were evaluated for their suitability as reinforcement materials. The study found that rod-like and granular ceramics exhibited superior structural integrity and formed strong interfacial bonds with the TWIP steel matrix, compared to blocky and flaky ceramics, which suffered from cracking and fragmentation. Detailed microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and industrial computerized tomography (CT) revealed the mechanisms influencing the composite formation. The results demonstrated that rod-like and granular ceramics are optimal for reinforcing TWIP steel composites, providing excellent mechanical stability and enhanced performance. This work contributes to the development of advanced composite materials with potential applications in industries requiring high-strength and durable materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba605ea5000754e3955e441093ef5c993404ffc776b1865ed52e867f91b76ce5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
