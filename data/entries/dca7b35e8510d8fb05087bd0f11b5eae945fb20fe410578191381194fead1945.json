{"title":"Bio‐ORACLE v3.0. Pushing marine data layers to the CMIP6 Earth System Models of climate change research","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13813?af=R","date":1708930775000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Impacts of climate change on marine biodiversity are often projected with species distribution modelling using standardized data layers representing physical, chemical and biological conditions of the global ocean. Yet, the available data layers (1) have not been updated to incorporate data of the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which comprise the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios; (2) consider a limited number of Earth System Models (ESMs), and (3) miss important variables expected to influence future biodiversity distributions. These limitations might undermine biodiversity impact assessments, by failing to integrate them within the context of the most up-to-date climate change projections, raising the uncertainty in estimates and misinterpreting the exposure of biodiversity to extreme conditions. Here, we provide a significant update of Bio-ORACLE, extending biologically relevant data layers from present-day conditions to the end of the 21st century Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios based on a multi-model ensemble with data from CMIP6. Alongside, we provide R and Python packages for seamless integration in modelling workflows. The data layers aim to enhance the understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity and to support well-informed research, conservation and management.</p>\n<h2>Main Types of Variable Contained</h2>\n<p>Surface and benthic layers for, chlorophyll-<i>a</i>, diffuse attenuation coefficient, dissolved iron, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ocean temperature, pH, phosphate, photosynthetic active radiation, total phytoplankton, total cloud fraction, salinity, silicate, sea-water direction, sea-water velocity, topographic slope, topographic aspect, terrain ruggedness index, topographic position index and bathymetry, and surface layers for air temperature, mixed layer depth, sea-ice cover and sea-ice thickness.</p>\n<h2>Spatial Location and Grain</h2>\n<p>Global at 0.05° resolution.</p>\n<h2>Time Period and Grain</h2>\n<p>Decadal from present-day to the end of the 21st century (2000–2100).</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa and Level of Measurement</h2>\n<p>Marine biodiversity associated with surface and epibenthic habitats.</p>\n<h2>Software Format</h2>\n<p>A package of functions developed for Python and R software.</p>","author":"Jorge Assis, \nSalvador Jesús Fernández Bejarano, \nVinícius W.
