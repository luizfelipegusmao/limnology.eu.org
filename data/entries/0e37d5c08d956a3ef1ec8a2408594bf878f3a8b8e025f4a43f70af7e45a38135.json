Dunn, Lyndy Harden, Mary Fosnaught, Siddhartha Thakur</p>\r\n\r\nExtended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>) is an emerging pathogen of high concern given its resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Broiler chicken, which is the number one consumed meat in the United States and worldwide, can be a reservoir of ESBL <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. Backyard poultry ownership is on the rise in the United States, yet there is little research investigating prevalence of ESBL <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> in this setting. This study aims to identify the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles (phenotypically and genotypically) of ESBL <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> in some backyard and commercial broiler farms in the U.S. For this study ten backyard and ten commercial farms were visited at three time-points across flock production. Fecal (n = 10), litter/compost (n = 5), soil (n = 5), and swabs of feeders and waterers (n = 6) were collected at each visit and processed for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. Assessment of ESBL phenotype was determined through using disk diffusion with 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and that with clavulanic acid. Broth microdilution and whole genome sequencing were used to investigate both phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles, respectively. ESBL <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> was more prevalent in backyard farms with 12.95% of samples testing positive whereas 0.77% of commercial farm samples were positive. All isolates contained a <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub> gene, the dominant variant being <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-1</sub>, and its presence was entirely due to plasmids. Our study confirms concerns of growing resistance to fourth generation cephalosporin, cefepime, as roughly half (51.4%) of all isolates were found to be susceptible dose-dependent and few were resistant. Resistance to non-beta lactams, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, was also detected in our samples. Our study identifies prevalence of <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub> type ESBL <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> in U.S. backyard broiler farms, emphasizing the need for interventions for food and production safety.","author":"Jessica L.
