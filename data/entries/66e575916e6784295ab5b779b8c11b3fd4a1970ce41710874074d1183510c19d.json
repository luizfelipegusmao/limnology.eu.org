{"title":"Consumer Perceptions of Ethical Supply Chains and Their Effect on Brand Loyalty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1074/v1","date":1718604155000,"content":"This qualitative study explores consumer perceptions of ethical supply chains and their implications for brand loyalty in contemporary markets. Ethical supply chain practices, encompassing sustainability, transparency, and social responsibility, are increasingly pivotal in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviors. A semi-structured interview approach was utilized to gather insights from a diverse sample of consumers, revealing nuanced perspectives on how ethical considerations influence brand preferences and loyalty. Findings indicate that consumers value brands that demonstrate genuine commitment to ethicality, viewing transparency and accountability in supply chain operations as essential for building trust and credibility. Emotional responses such as admiration and respect were commonly associated with brands perceived as ethical, highlighting the emotional resonance of ethical supply chain practices in consumer decision-making processes. Challenges such as greenwashing and perceived discrepancies between brand promises and actions underscore the importance of authentic communication in aligning consumer perceptions with brand behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized the role of ethical supply chains in ensuring business resilience and consumer trust during global disruptions. Brands that exhibited ethical leadership during the crisis reinforced their reputational capital and strengthened relationships with ethically conscious consumers. This study contributes to understanding the strategic imperative for businesses to integrate and communicate ethical supply chain practices effectively, thereby fostering sustainable competitive advantages and enhancing long-term brand loyalty. Future research directions include exploring evolving consumer expectations, emerging ethical challenges, and innovative strategies for embedding ethicality into supply chain management.This qualitative study explores consumer perceptions of ethical supply chains and their implications for brand loyalty in contemporary markets.
