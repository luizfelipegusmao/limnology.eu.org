{"title":"LC–MS-MS quantification of Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, THCV isomers and their main metabolites in human plasma","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/7/499/7688112?rss=1","date":1717545600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In recent years, potential therapeutic applications of several different cannabinoids, such as Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), its isomer Δ<sup>8</sup>-THC and Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCV), have been investigated. Nevertheless, to establish dose–effect relationship and to gain knowledge of their pharmacokinetics and metabolism, sensitive and specific analytical assays are needed to measure these compounds in patients. For this reason, we developed and validated an online extraction high-performance liquid/liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC–MS-MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 13 cannabinoids and metabolites including the Δ<sup>8</sup> and Δ<sup>9</sup> isomers of THC, THCV and those of their major metabolites in human plasma. Plasma was fortified with cannabinoids at varying concentrations within the working range of the respective compound and 200 µL was extracted using a simple one-step protein precipitation procedure. The extracts were analyzed using online trapping LC/LC–atmospheric pressure chemical ionization–MS-MS running in the positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. The lower limit of quantification ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 ng/mL, and the upper limit of quantification was 400 ng/mL for all analytes. Inter-day analytical accuracy and imprecision ranged from 82.9% to 109% and 4.3% to 20.3% (coefficient of variance), respectively. Of 534 plasma samples following controlled oral administration of Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV, 236 were positive for Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV (median; interquartile ranges: 3.5 ng/mL; 1.8–11.9 ng/mL), 383 for the major metabolite (−)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ<sup>8</sup>-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV-COOH) (95.4 ng/mL; 20.7–328 ng/mL), 260 for (−)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCV-COOH) (5.8 ng/mL; 2.5–16.1 ng/mL), 157 for (−)-11-hydroxy-Δ<sup>8</sup>-tetrahydrocannabivarin (11-OH-Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV) (1.7 ng/mL; 1.0–3.7 ng/mL), 49 for Δ<sup>8</sup>-THC-COOH (1.7 ng/mL; 1.4–2.3 ng/mL) and 42 for Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCV (1.3 ng/mL; 0.8–1.6 ng/mL). We developed and validated the first LC/LC–MS-MS assay for the specific quantification of Δ<sup>8</sup>-THC, Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC and THCV isomers and their respective metabolites in human plasma. Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV-COOH, 11-hydroxy-Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV and Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCV-COOH were the major Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV metabolites in human plasma after oral administration of 98.6% pure Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCV.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"5729b9ee8dfc7ae212db429536363e2a139f7a992849eeaa4a2df06a85c6a10d","category":"Environment"}
