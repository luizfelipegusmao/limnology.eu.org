Asiatic acid (AA) is a natural triterpene, which is recognized as effect of antioxidant and antitumor. Sorafenib (Sor), an orally target drug, has been applicate for the HCC therapy. However, the synergistic effect of AA and Sor on human HCC is still unclear. Here, we explore the effect of combined treatment with AA and Sor in the HCC cell line SK-HEP-1 and HepG2. Compared with treating alone, our results demonstrated that AA combined with Sor synergistically inhibited proliferative rates in MTT assay and colony formation assay. We also found that AA combined with Sor in HCC cells strongly caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and affected the protein level of cyclin D1 and SKP2. Furthermore, combination treatment strongly enhanced ferroptosis through cellular accumulation of iron ions, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis-related proteins (GPX4 and FTH1) in HCC cells. In addition, the combined treatment resulted in higher phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in the promotion of ferroptosis than drug treatment alone. These results indicate that AA combined with Sor synergistically improved ferroptosis in HCC cells through the regulation of JNK1/2 signaling. Taken together, the combinatorial strategy may serve as the potential treatment in HCC.</p>","author":"Yong‐Syuan Chen, \nChien‐Hsing Lee, \nYi‐Hsien Hsieh, \nHui‐Ling Chiou, \nMing‐Chun Hung, \nHsiang‐Lin Lee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"d95778a7f83cfcb3f75da512e2fc07180ad837f5b9005e1ea1a2afa67233c288","category":"Environment"}
