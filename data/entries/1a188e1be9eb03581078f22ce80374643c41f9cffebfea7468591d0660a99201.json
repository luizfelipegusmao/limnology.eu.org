{"title":"Objective Refraction Status Before and After Cycloplegia: From Childhood to Young Adulthood","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0419/v1","date":1720092796000,"content":"To accurately determine the refractive error of the eye, sufficient relaxation of eye accommodation is essential, either through the fogging technique or pharmacological cycloplegia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical information revealed after cycloplegia and assess how age and non-cycloplegic refractive status influence the classification of eye refractive error. We analyzed the records of 472 non-population-based subjects aged 3–28 years (mean ± SD: 9.1 ± 4.6) who attended a private ophthalmology practice from January 2018 to December 2020. Cycloplegia was induced with one drop of cyclopentolate 1% in each eye, and refraction was measured 30 ± 5 min later using an objective autorefractometer. The average spherical equivalent (SE) difference (mean ± SD) induced by cycloplegia was 0.72 ± 0.73 D, with the highest difference observed in the 3-5 years age group (1.18 ± 0.85 D). Gender had no significant effect on the SE values before or after cycloplegia (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Cycloplegia caused a hyperopic refractive shift in 83% of participants, no shift in 12%, and a myopic refractive shift in 6%. This study highlights the importance of cycloplegia use in children and young adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a188e1be9eb03581078f22ce80374643c41f9cffebfea7468591d0660a99201","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
