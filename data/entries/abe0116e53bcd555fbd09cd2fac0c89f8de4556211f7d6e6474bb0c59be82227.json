{"title":"The effectiveness of preventive home visits on resilience and health-related outcomes among community dwelling older adults: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306188","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Dayang Balkis Ramli, Suzana Shahar, Sumaiyah Mat, Norhayati Ibrahim, Noorlaili Mohd Tohit</p>\r\nBackground <p>This research aimed to assess the effectiveness of preventive home visits (PHVs) in enhancing resilience and health-related outcomes among older adults living in the community.</p> Methods <p>A comprehensive literature search was conducted in nine databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library. The search was undertaken between March 15 and 31, 2022 with subsequent updates performed on October 15, 2023 and April 10, 2024. This review also included grey literature sourced via Google, Google Scholar and backward citation searches.</p> Results <p>Out of 5,621 records, 20 articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria with a total of 8,035 participants involved and the mean age ranged from 74.0 to 84.4 years. Using McMaster Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies, we ascertained that the studies included in our analysis had moderate to high levels of quality. In addition to health-related outcomes, PHV interventions were also conducted to evaluate psychological effects (16 studies) and social outcomes (seven studies). Five studies conducted financial assessment to evaluate the costs of health and social care utilisation during PHV interventions. Regarding the results of the review, seven studies showed favourable outcomes, five indicated no effect and eight had equivocal findings. Only one study assessed resilience and determined that PHV had no effect on the resilience of the subjects.</p> Conclusion <p>This review found that the effectiveness of PHV interventions was uncertain and inconclusive. PHV interventions often prioritise health-related objectives. The incorporation of a holistic approach involving psychosocial health into PHV interventions is relatively uncommon. Due to the paucity of research on resilience as PHV outcome, we are unable to draw a conclusion on the effectiveness of PHV on resilience. Resilience should be prioritised as a psychological assessment in the future development of comprehensive PHV interventions, as it enables older adults to adapt, manage, and respond positively to adversities that may arise with age. Performing financial analysis such as costs and benefits analysis to incorporate the return on investment of PHV interventions is an added value for future research on this topic.</p> Clinical trial registration <p>PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022296919.</p>","author":"Dayang Balkis Ramli","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"abe0116e53bcd555fbd09cd2fac0c89f8de4556211f7d6e6474bb0c59be82227","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
