{"title":"457 Prediction of methane emissions using rumination time and milk mid-infrared spectral data via artificial neural networks","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/319/7757221?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cattle methane emissions (ME) account for approximately 6% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Given the challenges in measuring ME directly from individual animals, there is a need for the development of novel indirect methods. Rumination time (RT) and milk mid-infrared spectral data (MIR) show promise for the indirect assessment of ME in dairy cows. Both traits have been used as indicators of reproduction, production, and gas emission traits. Methodologies combining the use of MIR and machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANN) for the prediction of ME have been successful; however, the inclusion of RT has not been assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of RT on milk MIR-based models using ANN for the prediction of ME. One-week averages for RT, ME, and MIR from first-lactation Canadian Holstein cows (n = 412) were calculated. Six data sets were evaluated using a multilayer perceptron ANN. All sets included age at calving, season of calving and days in milk as model factors, but varied in using milk MIR data points (1,060 or 235) and including or not including RT. The ANN architecture consisted of one input layer, one hidden layer with one or more neurons, and one output layer. Results showed that sets using both RT and milk MIR data achieved correlations from 0.5 to 0.6 between predicted and observed ME. Notably, the inclusion of RT did not improve the performance of the models. Predictions may be improved through the use of larger data sets, the use of daily records, and inclusion of data across herds and lactations. Optimizing parameters of the ANN could also improve predictions. Further research is needed to fully assess the potential of RT as a predictor of ME in dairy cows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d726e25cd1f1e29399a9754634d3f50d08f892f8030de1dcc642e11f384404b3","category":"Environment"}
