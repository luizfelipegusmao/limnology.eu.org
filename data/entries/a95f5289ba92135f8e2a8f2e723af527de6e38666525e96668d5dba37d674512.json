{"title":"BK Polyomavirus in Pediatric Renal Transplantation. What We Know and What We Don&rsquo;t.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0564/v1","date":1712583608000,"content":"BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is still a real threat in the management of kidney transplantation. Immunosuppressive treatment disrupts the equilibrium between virus replication and immune response, and uncontrolled BKPyV replication leads to nephropathy (BKPyV nephropathy). The first evidence of BKPyV reactivation in transplant recipients is the detection of viral shedding in urine, which appears in 20% to 60% of patients, followed by BKPyV viremia in 10-20% of kidney transplant recipients. BKPyV nephropathy eventually occurs in 1-10% of this population, mainly within the first 2 years post-transplantation, causing graft loss in about half of those patients. Few data exist regarding the pediatric population and we focus on them. \nIn this paper, we review the existing diagnostic methods, we summarize the evidences on the role of BKPyV humoral and cellular immunity in the modulation of the clinical course of BKPyV infection and as potential predictors of the outcome. We look at the known risk factors of BKPyV nephropathy in the immunosuppressed patient. Finally, we propose a sensible clinical attitude in order to screen and manage BKPyV  infection in kidney transplant children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a95f5289ba92135f8e2a8f2e723af527de6e38666525e96668d5dba37d674512","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
