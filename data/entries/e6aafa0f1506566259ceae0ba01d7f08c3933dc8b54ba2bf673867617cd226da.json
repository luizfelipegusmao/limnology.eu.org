{"title":"Association between dyslipidaemia knowledge & lipid testing practice among adults, a community-based study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306428","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Haranee Paramalingam, Aqil M. Daher, Sumaira Hussain</p>\r\n\r\nVarious factors have been described in the literature to explain the tendency of an individual to undergo medical screenings. This study aimed to assess the association between the level of knowledge about dyslipidaemia and the frequency of lipid testing, as well as the potential impact of predisposing, enabling, and need factors on the uptake of blood lipid screening. This study was a cross-sectional survey involving 314 participants who were Malaysian residents of Taman Selatan, Klang, aged 30 and above. The study utilized a 42-item paper-based bilingual questionnaire to evaluate the predisposing, enabling, and need factors that could potentially influence the practice of lipid testing. Out of the 314 residents approached, 271 responded to the questionnaire yielding a response rate of 86.31%. The median knowledge score was 5 out of 17. Lower monthly income (OR = 3.225, 95% CI = 0.255 to 2.141), higher number of comorbidities (OR = 2.724, 95% CI = 0.037 to 2.013), higher total knowledge score (OR = 1.334, 95% CI = 0.063 to 0.512) and respondent’s belief and attitude (OR = 0.813, 95% CI = -2.033 to -0.539), were found to be significantly associated with the frequency of lipid testing. In conclusion, the knowledge level regarding dyslipidaemia was below average and associated with a lower tendency to undergo frequent lipid testing. There is a need for innovative health awareness such as active educational campaigns in various settings of the community. Further qualitative studies that explore the understanding of the publics’, and antecedents of their, lipid screening behaviour are required. Appropriate communication by healthcare providers should be encouraged during patient consultations for higher impact.","author":"Haranee Paramalingam","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e6aafa0f1506566259ceae0ba01d7f08c3933dc8b54ba2bf673867617cd226da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
