{"title":"MicroRNAs Monitoring in Human Alveolar Macrophages from Patients with Smoking-Related Lung Diseases: A Preliminary Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0679/v1","date":1712726489000,"content":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that is commonly considered to be a potent driver of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development and related mortality. A growing body of evidence supports the role of the immune system, mainly played by alveolar macrophages (AMs), as key axes regulating the development of COPD or NSCLC phenotypes in response to harmful agents. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that influence most biological processes and interfere with several regulatory pathways. The purpose of this study was to assess miRNA expression patterns in patients with COPD, NSCLC, and ever- or never-smoker controls to explore theirinvolvment in smoking-related diseases. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were collected from a prospective cohort of 43 sex-matched subjects to determine expression of hsa-miR-223-5p, 16-5p, 20a-5p, -17-5p, 34a-5p and 106a-5p by RT-PCR. In addition, bioinformatic analysis of miRNA target genes linked to cancer was performed. Distinct and common miRNA expression levels were identified in each pathological group suggesting their possible role as an index of NSCLC or COPD microenvironment. Moreover, we identified miRNA targets linked to carcinogenesis using in silico analysis. In conclusion, this study identified miRNA signatures in AMs, allowing us to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying smoking-related conditions and potentially providing new insight for diagnosis or pharmacological treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6031d1b947d3b6dcabdc79c18eea3fb5d7dd5c805750f47abf0018cafb6500a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
