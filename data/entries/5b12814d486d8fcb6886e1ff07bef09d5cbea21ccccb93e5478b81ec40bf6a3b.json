{"title":"Metal Bionanohybrids against Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion (MIC) Consortia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1594/v1","date":1721383359000,"content":"Present worldwide difficulties in healthcare and the environment have motivated the investigation and research of novel materials in an effort to find novel techniques to address the current chal-lenges and requirements. In particular, the use of nanomaterials has demonstrated a significant promise in the fight against bacterial infections and the problem of antibiotic resistance. Metal na-noparticles and carbon-based nanomaterials in particular have been highlighted for their excep-tional abilities to inhibit many types of bacteria and pathogens. In order for these materials to be as effective as possible, synthetic techniques are crucial. Therefore, in this review article, we high-light some recent developments in the design and synthesis of various nanomaterials, including metal nanoparticles (e.g., Ag, Zn, or Cu), metal hybrid nanomaterials, and the synthesis of mul-ti-metallic hybrid nanostructured materials. Following that, examples of these materialsâ€™ applica-tions in antimicrobial performance targeted at eradicating multi-drug resistant bacteria, material protection such as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), or additives in construction ma-terials have been described.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b12814d486d8fcb6886e1ff07bef09d5cbea21ccccb93e5478b81ec40bf6a3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
