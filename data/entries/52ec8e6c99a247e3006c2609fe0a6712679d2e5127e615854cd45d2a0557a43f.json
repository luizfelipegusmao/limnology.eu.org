{"title":"Conservation and Protection Treatments for Cultural Heritage: Bibliometric Analysis, Novel Insights and Future Trends","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0191/v1","date":1717499207000,"content":"Cultural heritage is a fundamental part of the societyâ€™s identity, and its conservation is of great relevance as it transcends time and memory. To minimize its deterioration, cultural heritage has traditionally undergone diverse preservation and maintenance treatments and the attention of researchers to develop new and innovative methods for state diagnosis and protection treatments has been increasing in the recent decades. Therefore, in this study, a literature review using a bibliometric analysis and LDA methodology was conducted to systematically map scientific research outputs on cultural heritage conservation and protection. Data was retrieved from the Scopus database and the annual publications, countries, most-cited publications, authors, institutions, and keywords have been comprehensively analyzed, leading to the detection of research trends. Findings show an increasing number of studies in this field in the last decades, particularly since 2010. Italy, home to the largest number of UNESCO heritage sites, is the most prolific country. Most of the studies are related to metal, paper and stone as substrate to be protected. Significant progress has been made in understanding the deterioration processes through precise diagnosis and the development of innovative treatments for protection. In this sense, latest trends have been detected such as the use of non-invasive techniques for diagnosis and the use of nanotechnology and nature-based treatments for the conservation treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52ec8e6c99a247e3006c2609fe0a6712679d2e5127e615854cd45d2a0557a43f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
