{"title":"Acquisition of green algal photobionts enables both chlorolichens and chloro-cyanolichens to activate photosynthesis at low humidity without liquid water","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae025/7659657?rss=1","date":1714348800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cyanobacteria require liquid water for photosynthesis, whereas green algae can photosynthesise with water vapour alone. We discovered that several <span>Lobaria</span> spp. which normally have cyanobacteria as the sole photobiont, in some regions of the trans-Himalayas also harboured green algae. We tested whether green algal acquisition was: limited to high elevations; obtained from neighbouring chloro-<span>Lobaria</span> species; enabled photosynthesis at low humidity. <span>Lobaria</span> spp. were collected from 2000 to 4000 m elevation. Spectrophotometry quantified green algal abundance by measuring chlorophyll <span>b</span> (absent in cyanobacteria). Thalli cross-sections visually confirmed green algal presence. We sequenced gene regions: <span>Lobaria</span> (<span>ITS-EF-1Î±-RPB2</span>), green algae (<span>18S-RBC-L</span>) and <span>Nostoc</span> (<span>16S</span>). Phylogenetic analysis determined myco-photobiont associations. We used a custom closed-circuit gas exchange system with an infrared gas analyser to measure CO<sub>2</sub> exchange rates for desiccated specimens at 33%, 76%, 86% and 98% humidity. Cross-sections revealed that the photobiont layers in putative cyano<span>-Lobaria</span> contained both cyanobacteria and green algae, indicating that they should be considered chloro-cyanolichens. Chloro-<span>Lobaria</span> had no visible cephalodia nor cyanobacteria in the photobiont layer. Chloro-<span>Lobaria</span> and chloro-cyano-<span>Lobaria</span> had comparable levels of chlorophyll <span>b</span>. Chloro-<span>Lobaria</span> usually contained <span>Symbiochloris.</span> Chloro-cyano-<span>Lobaria</span> mainly associated with <span>Parachloroidium</span> and <span>Nostoc</span>; infrequently with <span>Symbiochloris</span>, <span>Apatococcus, Chloroidium</span>, <span>Pseudochlorella, Trebouxia</span>. Sequences from two green algal genera were obtained from within some thalli. Desiccated specimens of every <span>Lobaria</span> species could attain net photosynthesis with light exposure and 33% humidity. CO<sub>2</sub> exchange dynamics over a five-day period differed between species. At all elevations, chloro-cyano-<span>Lobaria</span> spp. had abundant green algae in the photobiont layer, but green algal strains mostly differed to those of chloro-<span>Lobaria</span> spp. Both chloro-<span>Lobaria</span> and chloro-cyano-<span>Lobaria</span> were capable of conducting photosynthesis without liquid water. The data strongly suggest that they attained positive net photosynthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"28e4decde1c061ebe6aa6e4413af31045fc180865af37a5fd03ebbf884325e3a","category":"Environment"}
