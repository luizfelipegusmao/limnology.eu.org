{"title":"Extra food provisioning does not affect behavioral lateralization in nestling lesser kestrels","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/69/1/66/6553664?rss=1","date":1648080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Costs and benefits of brain lateralization may depend on environmental conditions. Growing evidence indicates that the development of brain functional asymmetries is adaptively shaped by the environmental conditions experienced during early life. Food availability early in life could act as a proxy of the environmental conditions encountered during adulthood, but its potential modulatory effect on lateralization has received little attention. We increased food supply from egg laying to early nestling rearing in a wild population of lesser kestrels <span>Falco naumanni</span>, a sexually dimorphic raptor, and quantified the lateralization of preening behavior (head turning direction). As more lateralized individuals may perform better in highly competitive contexts, we expected that extra food provisioning, by reducing the level of intra-brood competition for food, would reduce the strength of lateralization. We found that extra food provisioning improved nestling growth, but it did not significantly affect the strength or direction of nestling lateralization. In addition, maternal body condition did not explain variation in nestling lateralization. Independently of extra food provisioning, the direction of lateralization differed between the sexes, with female nestlings turning more often toward their right. Our findings indicate that early food availability does not modulate behavioral lateralization in a motor task, suggesting limited phenotypic plasticity in this trait.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"ba32edfff4b03077acb2524545881dd68a382a5c6f03fd40e8a799e530e406db","category":"Environment"}
