{"title":"Selectivity Control in Nitroaldol (Henry) Reaction by Changing the Basic Anion in a Chiral Copper(II) Complex Based on (S)-2-Aminomethylpyrrolidine and 3,5-Di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0444/v1","date":1728378868000,"content":"This article is a continuation of our previous research on the catalytic capability of chiral copper complex based on commercially available (S)-2-aminomethylpyrrolidine and 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde with various counter-anions in the asymmetric Henry reaction. Our findings indicate that depending on the type of base used, chiral nitroalcohols with yields up to 97% and ee values up to 78%, as well as Î²-nitrostyrenes with yields up to 82% can be produced. Additionally, it has been found that the outcome of the reaction and the catalytic properties of copper(II) complexes (S)-Cu1 and (S)-Cu2 are influenced by the structure of the aldehyde used.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"064da9883bad82b3e5d7580e847f2b208ab73e85e812ba21c489ba4887593080","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
