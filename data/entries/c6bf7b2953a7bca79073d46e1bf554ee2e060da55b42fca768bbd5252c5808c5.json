{"title":"Unveiling the Vital Role of Critical Neck Protection Devices for Motorcycle Riders: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0224/v1","date":1712063469000,"content":"Fatal motorcycle accidents on- and off-road continue to be overlooked in the literature. Research is scant on morbidity and mortality due to neck injury, which leaves patients and their families debilitated chronically. Great Lakes EMS Inc. conducted a 10-year retrospective case study, which highlighted that motocross riders who do not wear a neck brace are at an 89% higher risk of a critical cervical spine injury; highly unstable cervical spinal fractures have a sustainably higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Proposed mechanisms of motocross neck braces displace the forces on the neck onto the helmet of the rider to provide a smooth distribution of forces, whereas lack of neck brace use places riders at risk for upper cervical spine fractures such as Jefferson fractures, Hangman's fractures, and Odontoid fractures. Further, evidence suggests the use of back protectors may increase the risk of thoracic and upper spine injuries during a motorcycle crash. The limited data on this topic continues to be a challenge, as there is a lack of understanding of the nature of these injuries, which are likely preventable with proper neck protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6bf7b2953a7bca79073d46e1bf554ee2e060da55b42fca768bbd5252c5808c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
