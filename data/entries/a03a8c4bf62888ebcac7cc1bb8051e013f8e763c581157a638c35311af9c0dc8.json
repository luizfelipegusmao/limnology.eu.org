{"title":"Will the Globe Encounter the Warmest Winter after the Hottest Summer in 2023?","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-023-3330-0","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>In the boreal summer and autumn of 2023, the globe experienced an extremely hot period across both oceans and continents. The consecutive record-breaking mean surface temperature has caused many to speculate upon how the global temperature will evolve in the coming 2023/24 boreal winter. In this report, as shown in the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) prediction released by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a medium-to-strong eastern Pacific El Niño event will reach its mature phase in the following 2–3 months, which tends to excite an anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific and the Pacific-North American teleconnection, thus serving to modulate the winter climate in East Asia and North America. Despite some uncertainty due to unpredictable internal atmospheric variability, the global mean surface temperature (GMST) in the 2023/24 winter will likely be the warmest in recorded history as a consequence of both the El Niño event and the long-term global warming trend. Specifically, the middle and low latitudes of Eurasia are expected to experience an anomalously warm winter, and the surface air temperature anomaly in China will likely exceed 2.4 standard deviations above climatology and subsequently be recorded as the warmest winter since 1991. Moreover, the necessary early warnings are still reliable in the timely updated medium-term numerical weather forecasts and sub-seasonal-to-seasonal prediction.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"a03a8c4bf62888ebcac7cc1bb8051e013f8e763c581157a638c35311af9c0dc8","category":"Environment"}
