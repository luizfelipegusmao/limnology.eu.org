{"title":"Numerical Simulation of Non-darcy Flow in Naturally Fractured Tight Gas Reservoirs for Enhanced Gas Recovery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1724/v1","date":1721662482000,"content":"In this work, we analyzed non-Darcy two-component single-phase isothermal flow in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs for enhanced gas recovery (EGR) and carbon dioxide storage as a possible application. We used the Peng-Robinson equation of state to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of the components, and we performed the discretization of the governing partial differential equations using the Finite Volume Method. This process leads to two subsystems of algebraic equations, which, after linearization and use of an operator splitting method, are solved by the Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGSTAB) methods for determining the pressure and fraction molar, respectively. We include inertial effects using the Barree and Conway model, gas slippage via a more recent model than Klinkenbergâ€™s and we use a simplified model for the effects of effective stress. We also utilize a mesh refinement technique to represent the discrete fractures. Finally, we implemented simulations to show the influence of inertial, slippage and stress effects on production in fractured tight gas reservoirs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67a33ef3aee1d48aabdc75bdd5345e0074b4bd01fce9fd39048574c9c5f4dbde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
