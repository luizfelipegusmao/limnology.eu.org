Factors leading to this condition include genetic, nutritional and environmental conditions. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of conformation traits and their correlation with osteochondrosis. This study, based on the radiographic screenings of young horses born in Wallonia (266 individuals, 532 forelimbs), evaluated the correlation between foot, fetlock conformations of the front limb, height at the withers and presence of osteochondral fragments. Moreover, for all traits significantly associated with the presence of osteochondral fragments, a Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve and optimal cut-off value were calculated to predict the occurrence of fragments. Mean dorsal hoof wall angle was 52.36°, dorsal and palmar angle of the third phalanx were respectively 49.83° and 2.99°, and dorsal metacarpophalangeal angle 147.99°. Moreover, the prevalence of upright feet, defined as having an inclined profile of &gt;2° steeper in relation to its contralateral counterpart, was 24%. Increased palmar angle of the distal phalanx was significantly correlated (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) with presence of fragments located at the dorso-proximal margin of the proximal phalanx. The associated area under the curve was 0.623 (95% CI: 0528–0.717, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and the optimal cut-off value to predict fragment occurrence was 2.95° (sensitivity 77.3%; specificity 52.9%). Furthermore, the third metacarpal bone diameter of the left forelimb and height at the withers were significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) correlated with the presence of osteochondral fragments in general and within tarsocrural and metatarsophalangeal joints specifically. The area under the curve was 0.585 (95% CI: 0.513–0.656, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) with an optimal cut-off value of 152.5 cm (sensitivity 85.1%; specificity 31.2%) for height at the withers to predict presence of osteochondral fragment; to predict the occurrence of osteochondral fragment in any joint on the basis of the third metacarpal bone diameter, the area under the curve was 0.595 (95% CI: 0.524–0.667, <i>P</i> &lt;0.05) and the optimal cut-off value 34.9 mm (sensitivity 52.5%; specificity 64.9%). This study provides information about phenotypic traits associated with osteochondral fragments in horses. Although the diagnostic accuracy of these traits to detect osteochondral fragment was limited, the identification of more phenotypic characteristics could, in the future, make it possible to generate models for accurately identifying individuals at high risk of osteochondral fragments on the basis of their phenotype.","author":"Raphaël Van Cauter","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"769111b7d0fe68325098da143d2b6aa7d1ea0c24e4c7bf396ee11f875cc08d22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
