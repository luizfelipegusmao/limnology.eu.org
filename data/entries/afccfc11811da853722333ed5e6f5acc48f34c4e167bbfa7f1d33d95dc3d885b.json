We pooled the prevalence of individual studies using the random effect model.</p> Results <p>Our systematic search showed 36 articles that meet the eligibility criteria. Most included studies were cross-sectional. The most used questionnaire to assess depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale—21 Items (DASS-21), and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among Iranian medical students were 43% (95%CI: 33%–53%%, I2 = 98%), 44% (95%CI: 31%–58%%, I2 = 99%), 48% (95%CI: 39%–56%%, I2 = 97%), respectively. The results of subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed questionnaires used and the place of the medical school were significantly associated with the prevalence of aforementioned outcomes. Funnel plot and Begg’s regression test did not show a significant source of funnel plot asymmetry for depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, our study showed that nearly half of the medical students had some type of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance problems. To address this serious national public health issue, efficient preventive measures, routine screenings, and prompt interventions are required.</p>","author":"Arman Shafiee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"afccfc11811da853722333ed5e6f5acc48f34c4e167bbfa7f1d33d95dc3d885b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
