In this study, we examined the influence of environmental settings on the protein profiles of culturable bacteria using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS). We compared the protein profiles of bacteria collected from geographically distinct port environments (Kolkata, a freshwater port, and Kandla, a marine port) from India. The results indicated that bacterial species were distinctly different between the two ports, except for a few bacteria, that were common, such as <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>, <i>Micrococcus luteus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>P. putida</i>, <i>P. stutzeri</i>, <i>P. mosselii</i> and <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>. Mass spectra of these common bacterial species, a few pathogenic among them, differed in their protein profiles and relative intensity of peaks. These variations point out that environmental settings/factors have a significant role in the protein expression and can result in differentiated virulence of pathogens. Identifying these risk factors is crucial in developing appropriate environmental port management practices.</p>","author":"Lidita Khandeparker, \nLaxman Gardade, \nArga Chandrashekar Anil","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"6513c31aead74d43fe327d02bf7a497814047ded5161208104c4545a40997186","category":"Environment"}
