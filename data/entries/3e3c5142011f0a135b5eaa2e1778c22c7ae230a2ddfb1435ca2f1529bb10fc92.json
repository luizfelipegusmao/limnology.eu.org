{"title":"Reaction Thermodynamic and Kinetics for Esterification of Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether and Acetic Acid over Ion-exchange Resin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0316/v1","date":1725418808000,"content":"The esterification of propylene glycol methanol (PM) and acetic acid (AA) is an important reaction for the production of propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PMA). Herein, we used macroporous ion exchange resin Amberlyst-35 as a catalyst to explore the effects of reaction conditions on the reaction rate and equilibrium yield of PMA. Under the optimized conditions of reaction temperature of 353 K, initial reactant PM/AA molar ratio of 1:3, and catalyst loading of 10 wt%, PMA equilibrium yield reached 78%, which is the highest equilibrium yield so far. The reaction equilibrium constants and activity coefficients were estimated to obtain reaction thermodynamic properties, indicating the exothermicity of the reaction. Furthermore, Pseudo-homogeneous (PH), Eley-Rideal (ER), and Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hogen-Watson (LHHW) kinetic models were fitted based on experimental reaction kinetic data. The results demonstrate that the LHHW model is the most consistent with experimental data, indicating surface reaction controlled process and exhibiting an apparent activation energy of 62.0 kJ/mol. This work represents a valuable example of calculating the reaction thermodynamic and kinetics, which are particularly essential for promising industrial reactor design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e3c5142011f0a135b5eaa2e1778c22c7ae230a2ddfb1435ca2f1529bb10fc92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
