{"title":"BMI Status of Children with Celiac Disease Has Changed in the Last Decades: A 30-Year Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2150/v1","date":1721982226000,"content":"The presenting pattern of celiac disease (CD) at diagnosis in children has changed over time, with a reduction of malabsorption-related phenotypes and an increase in regular or even excessive growth patterns. We retrospectively reviewed the body mass index (BMI) distribution of all patients with a new diagnosis of CD made in a Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic in 1990-2011, compared to those diagnosed in 2012-2022, according to their clinical and serological characteristics. The 1990-2011 and 2012-2022 cohorts included 250 (M:F=90:160, mean age 7.3±6.1 years) and 243 children (M:F=81:162, mean age 7.1±3.7 years, NS), respectively. The prevalence of underweight (UW) was higher in the 1990-2011 cohort (61/250, 24.4% in 1990-2011 vs. 31/243, 12.7% in 2012-2022, p=0.0001), whereas that of overweight (OW) and obese (OB) subjects was significantly higher in 2012-2022 (10/250, 4% in 1990-2011 vs. 24/243, 9.9% in 2012-2022, p=0.012, and 1/250, 0.4% in 1990-2011 vs 8/243, 3.3% in 2012-2022, p=0.018, respectively). In both cohorts, gastrointestinal symptoms were more frequent in OW/OB than in UW children (6/11, 54.5% vs. 5/61, 8.2% in 1990-2011, p&lt;0.0001, and 24/32, 75% vs. 10/31, 32.3%, p&lt;0.0001 in 2012-2022) and the extent of anti-transglutaminase antibodies increase was similar in OW/OB and UW subjects. The prevalence of children with a normal or even high BMI at CD diagnosis has increased in the past three decades, therefore CD should be suspected regardless of the BMI status.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a981991579730deb054007e2bbf80005467ecc0b9804eb597adb43d2f7eb3ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
