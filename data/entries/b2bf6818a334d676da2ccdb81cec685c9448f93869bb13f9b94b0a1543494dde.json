Rapeseeds, Pinus radiata sawdust, oat husks, and pressed olive served as the studied biomasses. One hundred twenty-eight experiments were conducted to assess the effects on mass yield (MY), energy yield (EY), higher heating value (HHV), and final ash content (ASH) by a Factorial Experimental Design. The derived model equations demonstrated a robust fit to the experimental data, averaging an R<sup>2</sup> exceeding 0.94, affirming their predictive accuracy. The observed energy yield ranged between 65% and 80%, notably with sawdust and olive blends securing EY levels surpassing 70%, while rapeseed blends exhibited the highest HHV at 25 MJ/kg. Temperature emerged as the most influential factor, resulting in an 11% decrease in MY and a substantial 2.20 MJ/kg increase in HHV. Contrastingly, blend composition and additive presence significantly impacted ASH and EY, with all blends exhibiting increased ASH in the presence of additives. Higher initial hemicellulose and aqueous extractive content in raw biomass correlated proportionally with heightened HHV.","author":"Fidel Vallejo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b2bf6818a334d676da2ccdb81cec685c9448f93869bb13f9b94b0a1543494dde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
