{"title":"Short-term salt stress reduces photosynthetic oscillations under triose phosphate utilization limitation in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2994/7618574?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Triose phosphate utilization (TPU) limitation is one of the three biochemical limitations of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate in C<sub>3</sub> plants. Under TPU limitation, abrupt and large transitions in light intensity cause damped oscillations in photosynthesis. When plants are salt-stressed, photosynthesis is often down-regulated particularly under dynamic light intensity, but how salt stress affects TPU-related dynamic photosynthesis is still unknown. To elucidate this, tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) was grown with and without sodium chloride (NaCl, 100 mM) stress for 13 d. Under high CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, rapid increases in light intensity caused profound photosynthetic oscillations. Salt stress reduced photosynthetic oscillations in leaves initially under both low- and high-light conditions and reduced the duration of oscillations by about 2 min. Besides, salt stress increased the threshold for CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure at which oscillations occurred. Salt stress increased TPU capacity without affecting Rubisco carboxylation and electron transport capacity, indicating the up-regulation of end-product synthesis capacity in photosynthesis. Thus salt stress may reduce photosynthetic oscillations by decreasing leaf internal CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and/or increasing TPU capacity. Our results provide new insights into how salt stress modulates dynamic photosynthesis as controlled by CO<sub>2</sub> availability and end-product synthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"3d1baae06d001ffc389c63ebb7c37354721a9721c954873a5c11364b2eabfabd","category":"Environment"}
