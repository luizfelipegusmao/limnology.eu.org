{"title":"Investigation of the toxicity and safety concerns of transgenic maize seeds expressing immunogenic F and HN protein genes against Newcastle disease virus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae143/7758865?rss=1","date":1726531200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Introduction</div>The presented study investigated the potential toxicity and safety concerns associated with transgenic maize seeds expressing immunogenic F and HN protein genes against Newcastle disease virus (NDV).<div>Methodology</div>The experiment involved feeding Sprague–Dawley rats with transgenic maize seeds formulated into standard diets at levels of 30% (w/w) for a duration of 90 days. The rats were divided into three groups, with 10 rats per group. We assessed various parameters including overall appearance, feed consumption, body weight, organ weight, hematological parameters, serum chemistry, and histopathology.<div>Results</div>The results of these assessments were compared between the control group and the treatment groups. The study findings revealed that there were no significant differences between the control and treatment groups in terms of overall appearance, feed consumption, body weight, organ weight, hematological parameters, serum chemistry, microscopic histopathology, and gross appearance of tissues. These observations suggest that the consumption of transgenic maize seeds did not lead to any treatment-related adverse effects or toxicological issues. Furthermore, the transgenic maize seeds were found to be nutritionally equivalent to their non-transgenic counterpart.<div>Conclusion</div>Overall, no physiological, pathological, or molecular toxicity was observed in the Rats fed with transgenic feed.However, it is important to note that this study focused specifically on the parameters measured and the outcomes observed in Sprague–Dawley rats, and further research and studies are necessary to fully evaluate the safety and potential applications of transgenic edible vaccines in humans or other animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"d19019a289990628eee234bf3f1c283cbc49454af8d399537f2e153d9841e089","category":"Environment"}
