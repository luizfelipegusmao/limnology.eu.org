{"title":"Evaporation Estimation of the Gecitkoy Reservoir Using MODIS and Review of Various Evaporation Suppression Methods","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-65960-7_10","date":1735689600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This research analyzes the patterns of Gecitkoy Reservoir, North Cyprus's evapotranspiration (ET), using MODIS 16 APPEARS data and various climatological datasets observed from January 2020 to December 2022. This study presents a new measure of net evaporation and points out the impact of climatic change on water bodies. All possible new methods of combating evaporation, whether biological (windbreaks: floating plants; palm fronds), mechanical (hanging models; coverings), or chemical waterways that have been exploited by human cunning in the past, are carefully considered. The paper ends with recommendations for integrated water and reservoir management, essential public awareness on the subject, and ongoing research to add resilience to Northern Cyprus's future generation of food crops. Their results provide crucial insights that can be utilized for governance regimes. It also suggests using modern technology, such as satellite-based systems, to guide strategic direction in aquatic resource management.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"3ee9c27097bc3d94f3e07afa9e64bd3a60f34270057492ed0a0fb55ff8249f50","category":"Environment"}
