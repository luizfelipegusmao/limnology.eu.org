{"title":"Error Model of the Measurement Chain Containing the Discrete Wavelet Transform Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0081/v1","date":1712017640000,"content":"The paper presents an error model of a measurement chain containing link performing discrete wavelet transform algorithm which is most often the last stage of measurement signal processing. The goal is to determine the uncertainty budget of the input quantities of the wavelet transform algorithm. The error model takes into account parts of analog, analog-to-digital and digital processing, describing the properties of subsequent fragments of the chain using their transmittance and processing functions. The proposed model enables the description of both deterministic and non-deterministic properties of signal errors. The proposed model was validated using an example measurement chain created for this purpose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"715da5f03df99d56af01372377bbe4c3ff339dd7c8a8a2e8569fd8fe56a9a64b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
