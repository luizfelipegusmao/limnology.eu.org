{"title":"Moisture Content Assessment of Commercially Available Diesel Fuel Using Impedance Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1646/v1","date":1711507387000,"content":"Diesel is consistently a very popular fuel for internal combustion engines. Its consumption in the European Union has been rising over recent years, as has the number of engines increasingly sensitive to fuel contamination. One of the most important parameters affecting diesel quality is water content. Although its exceedances of the standard’s permissible amount are not common, they carry the risk of serious damage to expensive, modern fuel injection systems. Current methods of measuring water content require both specialised personnel and equipment, as well as transporting the sample to a suitable laboratory. The research presented in this paper was aimed at verifying whether it would be possible to test the moisture content of diesel using impedance spectroscopy. Once refined, such measurement method could be used in situ. Analysing the properties of diesel is challenging, mainly because many types of the fuel are sold, the chemical composition of which is always a well-guarded manufacturer’s secret. The experimental results obtained on many types of commercially available diesel show that it is possible to use impedance spectroscopy to estimate the water content of different types of diesel fuel. The measurement accuracy achieved makes it possible to detect approaching or exceeding the permissible water content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3927ee4ef8a638c8cc62ca8db62a6cb55e30dc7892a9b3bfe53fb60da4a6734","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
