{"title":"Testicular protective effects of hesperidin against chemical and biological toxicants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae078/7680463?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Toxic agents can adversely impact the male reproductive system mainly via activating oxidative stress affecting the seminiferous epithelia, spermatogenesis, sperms, and the testis. Toxic agents lead to the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide anions. ROS exert a cytotoxic effect and oxidative damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane lipids. Hesperidin is a pharmacologically active phytoflavone abundantly occurring in citrus fruits, such as oranges and lemons. It has shown various pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, analgesic, antiviral, anti-coagulant, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic effects. Hesperidin has been found to exert protective effects against natural and chemical toxins-induced organ toxicity. Considerable evidence has implicated the testicular protective effects of hesperidin against the toxicological properties of pharmaceutical drugs as well as biological and chemical agents, and in the present review, we discussed, for the first time, the reported studies. The resultant data indicate that hesperidin can exert testicular protective effects through antioxidant properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"278b3ab4b074a1bc0f32e1343a44407ef977e39d9ba3f3e37d11fafa0c6ce659","category":"Environment"}
