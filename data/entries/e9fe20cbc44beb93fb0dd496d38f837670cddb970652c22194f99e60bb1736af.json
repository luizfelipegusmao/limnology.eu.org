{"title":"Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Among HIV-1 Patients From Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1615/v2","date":1714355998000,"content":"Two decades after the antiretroviral therapy (ART) introduction, several challenges still prevail in maintaining people living with HIV (PLHIV), even with \"Test and Treat\" and/or \"Rapid Start of ART\" initiatives, as well as the scale-up of ART worldwide to promote access and adherence to treatment. This review examined articles on ART adherence in Africa between 2016 and 2023, published in English and indexed in PubMed. A total of 16 articles out of 2415 were eligible and included for analyses. Overall, ART adherence rates in SSA regions ranged from 43% to 84%. Rates in the centre of the SSA region ranged from 58% to 80%, in the north from 50% to 83%, in the south from 77% to 84%, in the west from 43% to 60% and in the east from 69% to 73%. Most African countries use the self-report to assess treatment adherence, although unreliable. The main factors with negative influence on ART adherence were comorbidities, lack of motivation, socioeconomic difficulties or side effects. Conclusion: Adherence to ART is a good indicator for controlling the spread of HIV. It is important to overcome the barriers that make it difficult to comply with ART and reinforce the factors that facilitate the accession of medication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9fe20cbc44beb93fb0dd496d38f837670cddb970652c22194f99e60bb1736af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
