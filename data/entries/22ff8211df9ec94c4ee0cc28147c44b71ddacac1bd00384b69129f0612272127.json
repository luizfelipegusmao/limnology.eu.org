{"title":"Human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus genotypes in Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) cases at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0131/v2","date":1712298261000,"content":"Infant mortality remains a major global concern. Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) is reported globally and in the Western Cape of South Africa it accounted for 40% of all infant deaths between 2012 and 2016. Research highlighting molecular typing of respiratory viruses in SUDI cases is lacking. A total of 116 PCR-positive human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) swab samples collected from the lungs and trachea of SUDI cases admitted to Tygerberg Medico-legal Mortuary in Cape Town between 2015 and 2019 were included and underwent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Three distinct HRV species were identified; HRV-A (n=28), HRV-C (n=11), and HRV-B (n=4), including eight HRV-A, seven HRV-C and one HRV-B genotypes. For RSV, both RSV-A (n=5) and -B (n=5) were detected, but no RSV-A. After amino acid alignment indicating 20 amino acid duplication and nine substitutions, two BA9 genotypes were confirmed. This study describes the first molecular and phylogenetic characterisation of respiratory viruses in SUDI cases in South Africa. The rapid decline in viral viability in post-mortem samples and the retrospective study design employed for the current study did not allow for any correlations between viral genotypes and cause of death and future prospective studies should investigate temporality and specific viral strains associated with clinical disease severity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22ff8211df9ec94c4ee0cc28147c44b71ddacac1bd00384b69129f0612272127","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
