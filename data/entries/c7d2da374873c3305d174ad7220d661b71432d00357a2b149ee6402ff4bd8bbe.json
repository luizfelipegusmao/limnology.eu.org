{"title":"Code-mixing unveiled: Enhancing the hate speech detection in Arabic dialect tweets using machine learning models","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305657","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Ali Alhazmi, Rohana Mahmud, Norisma Idris, Mohamed Elhag Mohamed Abo, Christopher Ifeanyi Eke</p>\r\n\r\nTechnological developments over the past few decades have changed the way people communicate, with platforms like social media and blogs becoming vital channels for international conversation. Even though hate speech is vigorously suppressed on social media, it is still a concern that needs to be constantly recognized and observed. The Arabic language poses particular difficulties in the detection of hate speech, despite the considerable efforts made in this area for English-language social media content. Arabic calls for particular consideration when it comes to hate speech detection because of its many dialects and linguistic nuances. Another degree of complication is added by the widespread practice of \"code-mixing,\" in which users merge various languages smoothly. Recognizing this research vacuum, the study aims to close it by examining how well machine learning models containing variation features can detect hate speech, especially when it comes to Arabic tweets featuring code-mixing. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess and compare the effectiveness of different features and machine learning models for hate speech detection on Arabic hate speech and code-mixing hate speech datasets. To achieve the objectives, the methodology used includes data collection, data pre-processing, feature extraction, the construction of classification models, and the evaluation of the constructed classification models. The findings from the analysis revealed that the TF-IDF feature, when employed with the SGD model, attained the highest accuracy, reaching 98.21%. Subsequently, these results were contrasted with outcomes from three existing studies, and the proposed method outperformed them, underscoring the significance of the proposed method. Consequently, our study carries practical implications and serves as a foundational exploration in the realm of automated hate speech detection in text.","author":"Ali Alhazmi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c7d2da374873c3305d174ad7220d661b71432d00357a2b149ee6402ff4bd8bbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
