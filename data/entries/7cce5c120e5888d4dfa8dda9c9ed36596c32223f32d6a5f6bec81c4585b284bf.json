{"title":"Bacillus subtilis alleviates excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in intrauterine growth restriction suckling piglets via the members of Bcl‐2 and caspase families","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13525?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The intestine is a barrier resisting various stress responses. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can cause damage to the intestinal barrier via destroying the balance of intestinal epithelial cells' proliferation and apoptosis. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> has been reported to regulate intestinal epithelial cells' proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if <i>B. subtilis</i> could regulate intestinal epithelial cells' proliferation and apoptosis in intrauterine growth restriction suckling piglets.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Compared with the normal birth weight group, the IUGR group showed greater mean optical density values of Ki-67-positive cells in the ileal crypt (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). IUGR resulted in higher ability of proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, by upregulation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) or proteins expression of <i>leucine rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptor 5</i>, <i>Caspase-3</i>, <i>Caspase-7</i>, <i>β</i>-catenin, cyclinD1, B-cell lymphoma-2 associated agonist of cell death, and BCL2 associated X (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and downregulation of the mRNA or protein expression of <i>B-cell lymphoma-2</i> and B-cell lymphoma-2-like 1 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). However, <i>B. subtilis</i> supplementation decreased the mRNA or proteins expression of <i>leucine rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptor 5</i>, <i>SPARC related modular calcium binding 2</i>, <i>tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19</i>, <i>cyclinD1</i>, <i>Caspase-7</i>, <i>β</i>-catenin, B-cell lymphoma-2 associated agonist of cell death, and Caspase-3 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and increased the mRNA expression of <i>B-cell lymphoma-2</i> (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>IUGR led to excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, which induced compensatory proliferation. However, <i>B. subtilis</i> treatment prevented intestinal epithelial cells of IUGR suckling piglets from excessive apoptosis. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zechen Xie, \nYang Yun, \nGe Yu, \nXin Zhang, \nHao Zhang, \nTian Wang, \nLili Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7cce5c120e5888d4dfa8dda9c9ed36596c32223f32d6a5f6bec81c4585b284bf","category":"Environment"}
