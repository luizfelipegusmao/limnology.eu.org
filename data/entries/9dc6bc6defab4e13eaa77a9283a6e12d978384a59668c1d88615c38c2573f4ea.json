{"title":"Seasonal and Spatial Distribution of Fall Armyworm Larvae in Maize Fields: Implications for Integrated Pest Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1429/v1","date":1729225908000,"content":"The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, a major pest in maize production, was assessed for its temporal and spatial distribution in maize fields during both the off and rainy seasons of 2021 and 2022. In this study, 30 and 50 maize plants were randomly sampled using a \"W\" pattern during the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. Larval density, infestation rates, and damage severity were monitored over time. Taylor's power law and the mean crowding aggregation index were applied to evaluate the dispersion patterns of the larvae. The results indicate a higher infestation rate and larval density in agroecological zone AZE 8 (fisheries zone of South Benin) compared to AZE 6 (ferralitic soils zone) during the off-season. In the rainy season, while the percentage of damaged plants was higher in AZE 8, no significant differences in larval density between the two zones were observed. The dispersion analysis revealed moderate aggregation (aggregation index = 1.25) with a basic colony of 2.08 larvae, reflecting the aggregation oviposition behavior of FAW. This study provides valuable monitoring data on the FAW's distribution, offering insights for further research on population dynamics and developing predictive models for integrated pest management strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9dc6bc6defab4e13eaa77a9283a6e12d978384a59668c1d88615c38c2573f4ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
