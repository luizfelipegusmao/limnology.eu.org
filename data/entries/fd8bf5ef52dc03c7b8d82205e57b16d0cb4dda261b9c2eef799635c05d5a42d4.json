The fungivorous beetle <i>Triplax ainonia</i> Lewis (Erotylidae) is an important pest which prefers to feed on <i>Pleurotus</i> mushrooms. In order to clarify the types, number, and distribution of the antennal sensilla of male and female <i>T</i>. <i>ainonia</i>, scanning electron microscopy was used. The results showed that there were five sensillum types on the antennae of adults male and female, including Böhm’s bristles (BB), sensilla chaetica (three subtypes: SC 1, SC 2, and SC 3), sensilla basiconica (three subtypes: SB 1, SB 2, and SB 3), sensilla trichodea (ST), and sensilla styloconica (SS). Among all the sensilla, the number of SB 2 was the most abundant in both sexes. We found that there was no sexually dimorphic in the sensillum types, but there were differences in the number, lengths, and diameters of some sensilla between males and females. Based on the information of the morphology and distribution of the sensilla, the potential functions of the antennal sensilla of <i>T</i>. <i>ainonia</i> adults were discussed. The results of this study provide a basis for further study on the behavioral ecology and electrophysiology of the fungivore beetles of the Erotylidae.","author":"Xiao-Long Hou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fd8bf5ef52dc03c7b8d82205e57b16d0cb4dda261b9c2eef799635c05d5a42d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
