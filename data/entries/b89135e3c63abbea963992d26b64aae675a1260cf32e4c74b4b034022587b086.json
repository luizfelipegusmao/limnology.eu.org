{"title":"Resilient Urban Communities: Cvjetno Housing Estate, A Modern Period Predecessor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1764/v1","date":1716841643000,"content":"The paper presents an analysis of the concept of resilience within the context of a modern period example in Croatia, the Cvjetno housing estate in Zagreb, recognized as a cultural and historical complex. While extensive literature exists on the estate's architectural and historical significance, limited research explores its resilience. This study aims to fill this gap by examining Cvjetno estate's resilience to natural hazards, financial and economic challenges, and social crises. It investigates the estate's design, historical context, and physical characteristics through archival documents, historical records, and field research. The analysis focuses on the estate's planned resilience to natural disasters, particularly flooding from the nearby river Sava and seismic risks due to its location in a seismically active area. Drawing from the literature on resilient communities, the study draws on key characteristics and principles of resilience and explores how Cvjetno estate exemplifies these traits. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of resilience in urban planning and provides insights for enhancing resilience in similar historical settlements facing contemporary challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b89135e3c63abbea963992d26b64aae675a1260cf32e4c74b4b034022587b086","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
