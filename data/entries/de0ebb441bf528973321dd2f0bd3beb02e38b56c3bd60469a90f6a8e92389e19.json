{"title":"Energy Availability and Body Composition in Elite Athletes: Two Sides of the Same Coin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2203/v1","date":1727428416000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Energy availability (EA) is essential for maintaining physiological func-tions, significantly influencing athletes' health and performance. Nutritional behaviours, how-ever, vary across sports. This study aims to assess EA levels in athletes from different disciplines, focusing on the relationship between EA and body composition in endurance athletes compared to rugby players. Methods: The study involved 18 endurance athletes (15 men, 3 women) and 36 rugby players (all men). Data were gathered through interviews, questionnaires, and bioim-pedance analysis. Energy intake (EI) was measured with a 24-hour dietary recall, and exercise energy expenditure (EEE) was calculated using the IPAQ questionnaire. EA was calculated as EA = (EI - EEE) / fat-free mass (FFM), with results categorized into clinical, subclinical, and optimal ranges. Results: The endurance group had a lower average FFM (57.81 kg) compared to the rugby players (67.61 kg). EA was also significantly lower in endurance athletes (11.72 kcal/kg FFM) than in rugby players (35.44 kcal/kg FFM). Endurance athletes showed more restrictive nutritional behaviour with lower EI and higher EEE, but both groups maintained body composition within normal ranges. Conclusions: Endurance athletes exhibit greater nutritional restrictions compared to rugby players, though their body composition remains healthy. Further research is required to investigate the long-term effects of low EA on performance, injury risk, and potential impairment when EA falls below the optimal threshold of 45 kcal/kg FFM/day.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de0ebb441bf528973321dd2f0bd3beb02e38b56c3bd60469a90f6a8e92389e19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
