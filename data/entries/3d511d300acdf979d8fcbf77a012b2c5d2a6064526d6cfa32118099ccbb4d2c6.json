{"title":"Loading Round Wood in Forestry Trucks and Forestry Platforms: A Case Study for Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0141/v1","date":1722573667000,"content":"One of the main products of the forest, which has the greatest economic impact, is wood. Due to its characteristics, the wood requires certain types of vehicles for transport it. For this reason, the accessibility of the stands with forest roads plays significant role in the efficiency of the wood logging process, which aims to bring the wood from the forest to the harvesting area located, frequently, next to a permanent transport route. The process of wood transport from the forest initially takes place on forest roads and after that on public roads. The technological process of wood transport represents an important stage in this process, and its good organization can have implications on the final price of the wood material. Based on those mentioned above, the paper aims to highlight the factors that can influence productivity in the case of loading wood in forestry trucks and forestry platforms, in different conditions. Thus, the research was carried out in four counties in Romania and addressed the loading of wood in different forestry trucks and platforms, with or without trailers. Following the evaluation of the work phases specific to the process of round wood loading in vehicles of transport, it was found that sometimes a significant importance is given to the working phases that can be carried out before the loading process, as phases of preparation of the wooden material in order to load it. Also, the facilities of the transport vehicles, the assortments of wood material, as well as the experience of the operators are the main factors that can lead to an increase in productivity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d511d300acdf979d8fcbf77a012b2c5d2a6064526d6cfa32118099ccbb4d2c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
