In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 participants to examine their attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors towards brands that emphasize ethical considerations in their supply chain operations. Thematic analysis revealed several key findings. Transparency and authenticity emerged as critical factors influencing consumer trust and perceptions of brand integrity. Participants valued brands that communicated clearly and honestly about their ethical sourcing practices, viewing transparency as indicative of reliability and ethical commitment. Ethical considerations significantly influenced consumer purchase decisions, with participants emphasizing the importance of factors such as fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and responsible sourcing in shaping their perceptions of product quality and brand value. Brands that integrated these ethical principles into their supply chain management were perceived as offering higher-quality products, which enhanced consumer willingness to pay a premium and bolstered brand reputation. The study also highlighted varying levels of consumer awareness and engagement with ethical supply chain practices, underscoring the importance of effective communication and consumer education. Ethical supply chain practices were found to foster brand loyalty and trust, with brands perceived as ethical and socially responsible enjoying stronger consumer relationships and loyalty. Overall, the findings suggest that ethical supply chain practices play a crucial role in enhancing brand equity by aligning business operations with consumer values and expectations. The study contributes to existing literature by providing empirical insights into the mechanisms through which ethical considerations influence consumer perceptions and behaviors towards brands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"832be1ec620d2bd52995ea57ccb48f0055d6bc821f6bdc77f8352489bfa90022","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
