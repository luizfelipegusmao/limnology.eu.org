Coppery titi monkey (<i>Plecturocebus cupreus</i>) offspring form selective bonds with their fathers, making them ideal for investigating how father–daughter bonds influence juveniles’ responses to oxytocin (OT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) manipulations. We quantified the expression of father–daughter bond-related behaviors in females (<i>n</i> = 10) and gave acute intranasal treatments of saline, low/medium/high OT, low/high AVP, or an OT receptor antagonist (OTA) to subjects prior to a parent preference test. While females spent more time in proximity to their parents than strangers, we found a large degree of individual variation. Females with greater expression of bonding behaviors responded to OT treatments in a dose-dependent manner. Subjects also spent less time in proximity to strangers when treated with High OT (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and Low OT (<i>p</i> = 0.007), but more time when treated with High AVP (<i>p</i> = 0.007), Low AVP (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and OTA (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Findings from the present study suggest that variation in the expression of bond-related behaviors may alter responsiveness to OT and AVP, increasing engagement with unfamiliar social others. This enhanced sociality with strangers may promote the formation of pair bonds with partners.</p>","author":"Lynea R. Witczak, \nJaclyn Samra, \nMadison Dufek, \nLeana R. Goetze, \nSara M.
