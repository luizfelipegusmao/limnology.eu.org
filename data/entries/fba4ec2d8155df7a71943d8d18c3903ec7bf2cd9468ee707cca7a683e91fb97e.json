{"title":"Gerontogen as the Toxicology of Aging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0659/v1","date":1712711830000,"content":"Aging causes various degenerative diseases in the older adult population. Senescence, a state of permanent cell-cycle arrest accompanied by the production of various pro-inflammatory factors known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), is considered a significant contributor to the aging process and its chronic diseases. Ample evidence showed that various stressors could induce senescence, including DNA damage, telomere shortening and damage, activation of oncogenes, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Numerous credible findings indicate that environmental agents can induce senescence, including UV radiation, a high-fat diet, heavy metal exposure, and cigarette smoke. These findings posed the possibility that many more environmental agents may induce senescence and accelerate aging but remain unidentified. Senescence also becomes more intriguing due to its promising future as a pharmacological target to blunt the detrimental effects of aging and prevent aging-related diseases, either by eliminating the senescent cells or by controlling the SASP. On the other hand, investigating senescence has become more intricate due to the need for a multi-marker approach and translation in vivo analysis. This review will discuss senescence and its biomarkers, how to identify gerontogens in vivo, and also the development of senotherapy that targets senescent cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fba4ec2d8155df7a71943d8d18c3903ec7bf2cd9468ee707cca7a683e91fb97e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
