{"title":"A Calcium Channel Alpha2delta Subunit Theory of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0704/v1","date":1728477221000,"content":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease whose etiology is currently unknown. This paper presents a novel theory in which ALS is caused by an impairment of the alpha2de;ta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), most likely due to autoimmune targeting. I show how the impairment mechanistically induces chronic calcium, which in turn explains the major clinical, epidemiological, and pathological evidence known about the disease. The same theory explains the major variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) that greatly overlaps with ALS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c8f63aeda1d6f11aa5ed44019451d2e4e2a6e29b2f0bab80a3851ebed65a728","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
