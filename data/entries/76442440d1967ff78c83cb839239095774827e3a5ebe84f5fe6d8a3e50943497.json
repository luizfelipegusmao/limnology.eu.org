This study investigated changes in oral health conditions, salivary parameters, halitosis, systemic diseases, and medication usage with aging.\nMethods\nThis study was retrospectively conducted using the medical records of patients who presented with complaints of xerostomia or halitosis between August 2020 and May 2023. A total of 274 patients (66 males, 208 females, mean age 59.39 Â± 16.10 years) were included in this study.\nResults\nAging was found to be significantly associated with the presence of sticky saliva, poor oral hygiene, tongue coating, and halitosis (all p &lt; 0.05). Correlation analyses further revealed significant associations between aging and several conditions, including hypertension (r = 0.495, p &lt; 0.001), diabetes mellitus (r = 0.255, p &lt; 0.001), amlodipine usage (r = 0.249, p = 0.001), osteoporosis (r = 0.195, p = 0.001), cardiovascular disease (r = 0.150, p = 0.013), and the presence of tongue coating (r = 0.205, p = 0.001). Conversely, none of the salivary parameters demonstrated a significant relationship with aging. Furthermore, halitosis did not exhibit significant differences across age groups (all p &gt; 0.05), with the exception of methyl mercaptan levels, which were notably higher among patients in their 20s (p = 0.049).\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study can help clinicians develop targeted strategies to address specific oral health challenges associated with aging in elderly patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76442440d1967ff78c83cb839239095774827e3a5ebe84f5fe6d8a3e50943497","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
