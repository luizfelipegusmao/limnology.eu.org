{"title":"Microscopy of Surface Microstructural Phenomena in 8620 Steel After Annealing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.300/7720371?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>This report focuses on the effects of annealing on the surface microstructures of a high-iron content steel for the support of the direct growth of graphene. Initially, 8620 steel is composed of ferrite and pearlite grains, and a polished surface appears rough. After annealing in an H<sub>2</sub> and Ar environment, the surface became smoother, grain size increased, and grain morphology changed. In contrast, annealing under H<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> resulted in unchanged grain size and graphene precipitation on the polished smooth surface. Secondary electron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) images allowed for identification of ferrite and pearlite in the original microstructure [<a href=\"#ozae044.300-B1\">1</a>]. SEM was used to compare the surface structures after the two annealing environments, H<sub>2</sub> + Ar or H<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2.</sub> The sample annealed in H<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> had graphene form on the surface. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the multilayer graphene (MLG) coating, with few-layer graphene (FLG) and single layer graphene (SLG) in coating gaps. These methods demonstrate the annealing environment's influence on 8620 steel surfaces, to improve the growth of graphene on these surfaces toward the achievement of high-quality coatings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cd9074ad56d81570bae50d7ff89e65dab01270a071469d36f568ee18827ac652","category":"Environment"}
