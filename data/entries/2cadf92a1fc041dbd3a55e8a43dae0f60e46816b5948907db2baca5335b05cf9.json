{"title":"Exploring Dietary Interventions in Autism Spectrum Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1037/v1","date":1723657543000,"content":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves social communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors, with a growing prevalence worldwide. Symptoms include cognitive impairments, gastrointestinal (GI) issues, feeding difficulties, and psychological problems. A significant concern in ASD is food selectivity, leading to nutrient deficiencies. Common GI issues in ASD, such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, stem from abnormal gut flora and immune system dysregulation. Sensory sensitivities and behavioral challenges exacerbate these problems, correlating with neurological symptom severity. Children with ASD also exhibit higher oxidative stress due to low antioxidant levels like glutathione. Therapeutic diets, including ketogenic, high-antioxidant, gluten-free, and casein-free, show potential in managing ASD symptoms like behavior, communication, GI issues, and oxidative stress, though the evidence is limited. Various studies have focused on different populations, but there is increasing concern about the impact on children. This review examines the effect of food selectivity, GI problems, and antioxidant deficiencies in ASD and revises the effectiveness of various therapeutic diets, highlighting the need for further research to confirm their long-term benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2cadf92a1fc041dbd3a55e8a43dae0f60e46816b5948907db2baca5335b05cf9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
