{"title":"Overlapping Shoeprint Detection by Edge Detection and Deep Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0041/v1","date":1717462363000,"content":"In the field of 2-D image processing and computer vision, accurately detecting and segmenting objects in scenarios where they overlap or are obscured remains a challenge. This difficulty is worse in the analysis of shoeprints used in forensic investigations because they are embedded in noisy environments such as the ground and can be indistinct. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), despite their success in various image analysis tasks, struggle with accurately delineating overlapping objects due to the complexity of segmenting intertwined textures and boundaries against a background of noise. This study introduces employs the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model enhanced by edge detection and image segmentation techniques to improve the detection of overlapping shoeprints. By focusing on the critical boundary information between shoeprint textures and the ground, our method demonstrates improvements in sensitivity and precision, achieving confidence levels above 85% for minimally overlapped images and maintaining above 70% for extensively overlapped instances. Heatmaps of convolution layers were generated to show how the network converges towards successful detection using these enhancements. This research may provide a potential methodology for addressing the broader challenge of detecting multiple overlapping objects against noisy backgrounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb815959cf44c82e75da2fbd779825ee2600c57634647255c8d2faecb8ba1582","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
