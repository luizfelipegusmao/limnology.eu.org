{"title":"Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Relationships. I. Cellular and Molecular Common Pathological Mechanisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0605/v1","date":1715255009000,"content":"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's disease are two diseases with a high incidence today that share similar pathophysiological mechanisms suggesting a potential causal relationship between them. In fact, Alzheimer-associated Mellitus Diabetes is also known as Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus and constitutes a diabetes intricately linked to Alzheimer's disease. Central to this association is insulin resistance, a key factor leading to decreased insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and impaired glucose uptake. Because of this, the brain is altered resulting in energy deficits and neuronal damage associated with neurodegenerative disorder characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Both diseases exhibit common biochemical and physiological characteristics such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the formation of advanced glycation end products. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of Type 3 Mellitus Diabetes and identifying common features shared with Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are essential steps towards potential therapeutic interventions targeting the insulin resistance pathway. The authors of this review on the relationships between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease have developed two works. In the first (Relationships between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease. I. Common pathogenic mechanisms), authors explore the shared (physiological, genetics and molecular) pathological changes occurring in Type 2 Mellitus Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease as well as pathways such as AMPK, PPARÎ³, cAMP, and PI3K/Akt as potential targets for managing Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus. By exploring these intricate mechanisms, the goal is to uncover their interdependencies and facilitate the discovery of innovative pharmacological and nutritional (epigenetics) strategies. In the second paper (Relationships between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease. II Potential therapies) we describe possible nutritional intervention, particularly dietary patterns and phytochemicals that can enhance the effects of pharmaceutical drugs designed against pathological mechanisms involved in the complex dual disease Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's disease (or in Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus as other authors consider).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f47d326dac931ddb65031a34f398291810ecb176592d67eff95ae46a6468188","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
