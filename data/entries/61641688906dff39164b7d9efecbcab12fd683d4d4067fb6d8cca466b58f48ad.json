{"title":"Factors Influencing Employeeʹs Productivity: A Case Study of UK‐Based Construction Company","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0101/v1","date":1727854552000,"content":"Given its substantial impact on project outcomes, increasing productivity in construction has been a major industry priority. Researchers studying construction have been focusing more on it and supporting various enhancement measures since determining the elements influencing labour productivity is a crucial step in this process. This research article uses questionnaires given to direct employees and midlevel employees to discover and comprehend the productivity elements influencing projects at a construction company located in the United Kingdom. After the questionnaire's answers were examined, it was simpler to pinpoint organisational and managerial flaws and to contrast the findings with those of previous productivity studies. The findings helped formulate suggestions for raising productivity. The primary conclusions show that truck availability, worker motivation dynamics, rework, tools, and machinery were the key factors influencing construction productivity. These findings are in line with earlier research conducted in the UK and the US. Salary expectations, the main reason for employee turnover in the organisation under investigation, was a component left out of previous studies. Finally, additional research seems to suggest that some productivity-affecting factors are common to international construction projects, supporting the gathering of data and the possibility of learning from experience in a variety of settings and even at different times of occurrence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61641688906dff39164b7d9efecbcab12fd683d4d4067fb6d8cca466b58f48ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
