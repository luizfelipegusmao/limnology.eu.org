{"title":"A Cross-Sectional Study of Pre-prepared Foods Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of College Students in Central China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0220/v1","date":1725412092000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to pre-prepared foods among college students in Central China. In May 2024, we completed a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. A total of 1,676 questionnaires were distributed online, and 1,566 valid questionnaires were collected. The survey results showed that the average score for knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pre-prepared foods was 11.98 (0.00-32.00), and the average scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 5.42 (0.00-8.00), 2.94 (0.00-11.00) and 3.62 (0.00-20.00), respectively. Ethnicity, place of residence, the number of children in the family, academic qualifications, monthly family income, monthly living expenses, satisfaction with school catering services, and body mass index were associated with college students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pre-prepared foods. College students have a high level of knowledge of pre-prepared foods. However, they have a more negative attitude towards pre-prepared foods, and their overall level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pre-prepared foods are relatively low. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the education of college students on the knowledge related to pre-prepared food to enhance their cognitive level and to improve students' attitudes towards pre-prepared foods by adjusting the campus food service to be more positive. Healthy eating behaviors should also be encouraged.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d53138636d87efc4e4c6e7a1914687b776de816375a6623388bfbff578a7fba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
