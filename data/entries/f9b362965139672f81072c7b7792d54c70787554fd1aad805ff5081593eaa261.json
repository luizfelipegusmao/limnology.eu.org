{"title":"Point Cloud Densification Algorithm for Multiple Cameras and Lidars Data Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0706/v1","date":1720505908000,"content":"Fusing data from many sources helps to achieve higher results of analysis. In this work, we present a new algorithm to fuse data from multiple cameras with data from multiple lidars. This algorithm was developed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of autonomous vehicle perception systems, where the most accurate sensors measuring the vehicleâ€™s surroundings are cameras and lidar devices. Perception systems based on data from one type of sensor do not use complete information and have lower quality. The camera provides two-dimensional images; lidar produces three-dimensional point clouds. We developed a method for matching pixels on a pair of stereoscopic images using dynamic programming inspired by an algorithm to match sequences of amino acids used in bioinformatics. We improve the quality of the basic algorithm using additional data from edge detectors. We also improve the algorithm performance by reducing the size of matched pixels determined by available car speeds. We perform point cloud densification in the final step of our method, fusing lidar output data with stereovision output. We implemented our algorithm in C++ with Python API, and we provided the open-source library named Stereo PCD. This library very efficiently fuses data from multiple cameras and multiple lidars. In the article, we present the results of our approach to benchmark databases in terms of quality and performance. We compare our algorithm with other popular methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9b362965139672f81072c7b7792d54c70787554fd1aad805ff5081593eaa261","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
