{"title":"A critical review of soil algae as a crucial soil biological component of high ecological and economic significance","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13444?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Aero-terrestrial algae are ecologically and economically valuable bioresources contributing to carbon sequestration, sustenance of soil health, and fertility. Compared to aquatic algae, the literature on subaerial algae is minimal, including studies of distinctive habitats such as forest soils, agricultural fields, deserts, polar regions, specific subaerial zones, artificial structures, and tropical soils. The primary goal here was to identify the gaps and scope of research on such algae. Accordingly, the literature was analyzed per sub-themes, such as the “nature of current research data on terrestrial algae,” “methodological approaches,” “diversity,” “environmental relationships,” “ecological roles,” and “economic significance.” The review showed there is a high diversity of algae in soils, especially members belonging to the Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) and Chlorophyta. Algal distributions in terrestrial environments depend on the microhabitat conditions, and many species of soil algae are sensitive to specific soil conditions. The ecological significance of soil algae includes primary production, the release of biochemical stimulants and plant growth promoters into soils, nitrogen fixation, solubilization of minerals, and the enhancement and maintenance of soil fertility. Since aero-terrestrial habitats are generally stressed environments, algae of such environments can be rich in rare metabolites and natural products. For example, epilithic soil algae use wet adhesive molecules to fix them firmly on the substratum. Exploring the ecological roles and economic utility of soil and other subaerial algae could be helpful for the development of algae-based industries and for achieving sustainable soil management.</p>","author":"Jebin Joseph, \nJoseph George Ray","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"b7362c86f0462e342de344bb5a51d498d9ab340e452946163c23e92c685050eb","category":"Environment"}
