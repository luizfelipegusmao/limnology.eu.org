{"title":"Effect of Heat Stress on Subsequent Estrous Cycles Induced by PGF2&alpha; in Cross-Bred Holstein Dairy Cows Raised in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1644/v1","date":1711524347000,"content":"The study aimed to determine the effect of heat stress (HS) on reproductive parameters [calving to first service (CTFS) and first service conception rate (FSCR)] and general physiological responses [rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR)] in tropical Holstein Friesian dairy cows raised in Ratchaburi province, Thailand. Cows were divided into a moderate HS (n = 22) and a mild HS (n = 22) group. Cycling cows were detected and injected with PGF2α at the beginning of the experimental period. Reproductive and physiological parameters were recorded. The average temperature humidity indices experienced by the cows were 80.67 ± 0.79 and 77.81 ± 1.09 for the moderate and mild HS groups, respectively. Cows showed significantly lower RT and RR in the mild (38.47 ± 0.21°C and 41.04 ± 4.55 bpm, respectively) than in the moderate HS group (38.87 ± 0.15°C and 51.17 ± 10.52 bpm). Under mild HS, cows showed a better response to injection of PGF2α than those under moderate HS. The percentage of cows that ovulated after being induced by PGF2α and showed estrus signs was higher in the mild than the moderate HS groups (54.55% versus 18.18%). Furthermore, the FSCR of cows under mild HS tended to be higher than in the moderate HS group (54.55 % and 42.11%, respectively), while the average CTFS interval was significantly shorter under mild than moderate HS (69.47 ± 18.18 and 84.60 ± 27.68, respectively). These results indicate that HS impairs reproductive performance in cross-bred Holstein cows, especially in moderate HS conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e51f32f0b2aa660320b4ff1fafffcacab26b3fa0bad427686e3a1f110e2a9656","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
