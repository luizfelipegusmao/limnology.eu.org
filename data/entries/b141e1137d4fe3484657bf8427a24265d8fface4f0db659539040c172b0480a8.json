In this study, we explore how deep learning can be used to identify behaviors of interest in STEM imaging data. Specifically, we explore the use of variational autoencoder (VAE) to understand the identification of individual structural building blocks in complex data [<a href=\"#ozae044.1027-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b141e1137d4fe3484657bf8427a24265d8fface4f0db659539040c172b0480a8","category":"Environment"}
