{"title":"Fed‐batch fermentation strategy for efficient welan gum production by Sphingomonas sp. FM01","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13884?af=R","date":1727086880000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>As a novel type of extracellular polysaccharide produced by <i>Sphingomonas</i> sp., welan gum has been widely applied in various fields because of its excellent properties. The study has improved the fermentation process.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The initial sucrose concentration, temperature and stirring speed were set to 20 g L<sup>−1</sup>, 33 °C and 400 rpm, respectively, and 13.3 g L<sup>−1</sup> sucrose was added at 24, 40 and 56 h. The temperature and stirring speed were then set at 28 °C and 600 rpm from 24 to 48 h and 28 °C and 600 rpm from 48 to 72 h, respectively. As a result, welan gum production, dry cell weight, sucrose conversion rate and viscosity were correspondingly increased to 38.60 g L<sup>−1</sup>, 5.47 g L<sup>−1</sup>, 0.64 g g<sup>−1</sup> and 3779 mPa·s, respectively. In addition, the mechanism by which fermentation strategy promotes welan gum synthesis was investigated by transcriptome analysis.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Improving respiration and ATP supply, reducing unnecessary protein synthesis, and alleviating competition between cell growth and welan gum synthesis contribute to promoting the fermentation performance of <i>Sphingomonas</i> sp., thus providing a practical strategy for efficient welan gum production. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hui Liu, \nHailin He, \nLulu Wei, \nYinfeng Lei, \nMengyu Liu, \nYifei Ding, \nXiaochun Su, \nJinxuan Wang, \nJian Yang, \nShubo Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8a405419b5ad8eeadfa697a6b56128049482d314789076e83147a156ef6fa7ee","category":"Environment"}
