{"title":"Maximum sustainable yield as a reference point in the presence of fishing effort that follows an ideal free distribution","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nrm.12390?af=R","date":1707819326000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), and the underlying Schaefer model, remain relevant in fisheries management today in spite of past difficulties. However, this model is often applied without the consideration of the spatial structure or dynamics of fishing activities. We expand the Schaefer model to account for multiple fishing sites and fishing activities (effort) that follow an ideal free distribution (IFD, a form of Nash equilibrium) driven by exploitation. We explore this conceptual model using both analytical and numerical solutions. MSY across the fishery is unaffected by the spatial structure when fishing is allocated independently within sites. However, in other cases IFD effort dynamics depress MSY and modify the values of associated reference points. The game theoretic aspect of fleet dynamics should be considered in the use of MSY as a management reference point or during the application of the Schaefer model to data-limited fisheries.</p>","author":"Darren M.
