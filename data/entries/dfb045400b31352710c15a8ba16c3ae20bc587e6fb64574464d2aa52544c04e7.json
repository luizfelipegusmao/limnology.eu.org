{"title":"Synthesis of Biowaste Activated Carbon for Water Purification: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0981/v1","date":1715690523000,"content":"The escalating global demand for clean water has propelled research into sustainable and cost-effective purification methods. Activated carbon (AC) derived from biowaste materials presents an environmentally friendly and economically viable solution for water treatment. This review article provides an extensive overview of the synthesis techniques, characterization methods, and applications of biowaste activated carbon (BAC) for water purification. It discusses the diverse sources of biowaste, such as agricultural residues, food waste, and biomass, and explores various activation methods including physical, chemical, and biological processes. Furthermore, the article examines the adsorption mechanisms, performance factors, regeneration strategies, and emerging trends in BAC synthesis and application. Insights from this review can guide future research endeavors and facilitate the development of sustainable water purification technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfb045400b31352710c15a8ba16c3ae20bc587e6fb64574464d2aa52544c04e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
