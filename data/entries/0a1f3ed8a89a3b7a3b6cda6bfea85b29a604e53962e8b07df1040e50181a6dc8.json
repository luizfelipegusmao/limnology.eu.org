In this study, biodiversity and FFGs in a large shallow lake, Lake Hongze, differed between littoral and pelagic habitats, with the spatial variability of littoral assemblages more correlated with nutrient concentrations, whilst pelagic assemblages were more associated with wave-induced disturbance (e.g., mean effective fetch). Species diversity was poorly correlated with measures of nutrient concentrations, whereas functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and functional feeding groups are promising indicators of nutrient concentrations. Lastly, our findings support the use of biodiversity and FFGs to disentangle the effects of nutrients and wave-induced disturbance on macroinvertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, monitoring both littoral and pelagic habitats in large shallow lakes is recommended to better understand and quantify ecosystem changes.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"0a1f3ed8a89a3b7a3b6cda6bfea85b29a604e53962e8b07df1040e50181a6dc8","category":"Environment"}
