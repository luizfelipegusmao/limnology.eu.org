{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Crypto-Ransomware on Critical Industries: Case Studies and Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1325/v1","date":1726622572000,"content":"Crypto-ransomware has emerged as one of the most significant cybersecurity threats in recent years. Ransomware attacks, particularly those involving the encryption of data and demanding payment in cryptocurrency, have caused severe disruptions across various critical industries, including healthcare, energy, and finance. The proliferation of these attacks is largely attributed to the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency transactions and the increasing sophistication of cybercriminal tactics. The impact of ransomware extends beyond immediate financial losses, often leading to prolonged operational downtime, reputational damage, and even risks to public safety. In this research paper, we explore the growing threat of crypto-ransomware by examining real-life case studies in key industries, analyzing the countermeasures taken, and proposing additional solutions to mitigate the risk. The goal is to raise awareness and provide actionable insights for organizations to better protect themselves against this pervasive threat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3aff618c8d8e5f536b779daf22feceaa5f161feb7cfcc28470d429ab5d90dba3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
