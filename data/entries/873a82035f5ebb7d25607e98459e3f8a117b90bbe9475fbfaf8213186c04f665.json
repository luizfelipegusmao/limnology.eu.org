{"title":"The Variation of Bioproperties of Mineral Waters Used in Balneotherapy After Contamination with Coliform Bacteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1413/v1","date":1729231662000,"content":"The presence of fecal indicator bacteria in therapeutic mineral waters (TMWs) represents an important factor that can alter their chemical properties and therapeutic  effect, correlated with an increased health risk for patients.\nThe purpose of study was to evaluate the interrelationship between the level of contamination with coliform bacteria/Escherichia coli determined by the culture-dependent method and the concentrations of major ions, trace elements and gases in mineral waters that are used for curative or prophylactic purposes. Coliform bacteria showed a degree of survival modulated by the physical-chemical profile of TMWs, their viable count being statistically correlated with T°C, pH, TDS, EC and major ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42-). The prevalence of E.coli bacteria was not sen-sitive to the oscillation of the values of T°C; pH; TDS; EC of TMWs, but on the other hand, for the concentration variations of Cl-, HCO3-, total miner-alization from the composition of lakes/bathing pools, a positive correla-tion was identified with its numerical density. For sulfurous TMWs, the results showed a negative correlation between H2S concentration and the level of CB or E.coli, and in carbonated TMWs, CO2/CB values varied di-rectly proportionally, while E.coli evolved numerically independently of CO2 concentration fluctuations, as expected, being aerobe/facultative an-aerobic bacteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"873a82035f5ebb7d25607e98459e3f8a117b90bbe9475fbfaf8213186c04f665","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
