{"title":"The Prevalence of Orthostatic Hypotension in Cancer Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1183/v1","date":1710919484000,"content":"Background: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with higher risk of mortality in general population however not studied in cancer population. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of OH in cancer patients compared to the non-cancer population. Methods: A total of 411 patients (mean age 63.5 ± 10.6 years) were recruited: patients with active cancer (n = 223) and patients hospitalized for other reasons but without cancer diagnosis (n = 188). Medical history was collected and an orthostatic challenge test was performed. OH was defined as blood pressure (BP) decrease on standing ≥ 20 mmHg for systolic or ≥ 10 mmHg for diastolic BP in 1 or 3 minutes; or systolic BP decrease &amp;lt; 90 mmHg. Results: The prevalence of OH in cancer was significantly higher than in subjects without cancer- 28.7% vs. 16.5%, respectively, P = 0.003). OH was the most common in lung cancer, 57.5%. In single variable analysis, the predictors of OH were: cancer presence, age ≥ 65 years, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2. In the multivariable model, the strongest independent predictor of OH was cancer status doubling the risk of OH; BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and diabetes. Conclusions: Cancer patients are characterized by a high prevalence of OH. In this population, the recommendation of routine orthostatic challenge tests should be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68fd21fab1c4251dd1ec7d46438299639bd239f43a7e19e1831fc8932b9a4ea7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
