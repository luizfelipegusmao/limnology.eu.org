This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of everolimus combined with EP regimen chemotherapy (etoposide + cisplatin, EP) in the first-line treatment for LCNEC. The patients were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group, with 20 patients in each group. The experimental group received the mTOR inhibitor everolimus 5 mg once a day combined with EP ivgtt, d1-3, every 3 weeks for 4â€“6 cycles. The control group received EP only and the infusion method was the same as that of the experimental group. The safety in the experimental group was controllable and not inferior to that in the control group. Serious adverse effects were observed in approximately 10% of patients. Objective response rate (ORR) for the experimental and control groups were 15% vs. 0 (P=0.231), disease control rate (DCR) was 100% vs. 32% (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15121a2a9a741b84534f25a0778309b3f72b6b9aaab583d0e0fe97e889996fe7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
