{"title":"Phylogenomic characterization of Flavobacterium psychrophilum isolates retrieved from Turkish rainbow trout farms","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13961?af=R","date":1716362976000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i>, a devastating fish pathogen, is responsible for bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD), also known as rainbow trout fry syndrome. <i>F. psychrophilum</i> is the main causative agent of outbreaks in rainbow trout farms, especially at early live stages. In the present study, we aimed to characterize <i>F. psychrophilum</i> Turkish isolates. Eighteen isolates were retrieved from BCWD outbreaks between 2014 and 2021. In vitro phenotypic characterization showed gelatin and casein hydrolysis capacities and in vitro adhesion for all isolates, whereas elastinolytic activity was present for 16 of 18 isolates. We used complete genome sequencing to infer MLST-type, serotype and phylogenetic reconstruction. Strikingly, one strain isolated from Coruh trout (FP-369) belongs to ST393, a previously undescribed ST, and is phylogenetically distant from the other isolates. However, all strains retrieved from rainbow trout belong to the well-characterized clonal complex CC-ST10, 12 of 17 were tightly connected in a single cluster. Several serotypes (Types -1, -2 and -3) were represented among isolates, but no correlation was observed with geographic origins. This analysis suggests a regional dissemination of an epidemic, disease-producing bacterial population. This study provides a basis for epidemiological surveillance of isolates circulating in Turkey and phenotypic data for future molecular studies of virulence traits of this important fish pathogen.</p>","author":"Izzet Burcin Saticioglu, \nMuhammed Duman, \nNihed Ajmi, \nSoner Altun, \nTatiana Rochat, \nEric Duchaud","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"1e6bd9ab58c0dce77c1ee12db8dfdeb1bda2cf126dfc88b9269284114b7b0e93","category":"Environment"}
