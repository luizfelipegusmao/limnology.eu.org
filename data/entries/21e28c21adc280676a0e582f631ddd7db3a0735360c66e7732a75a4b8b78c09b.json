{"title":"The low and high doses administration of lutein improves memory and synaptic plasticity impairment through different mechanisms in a rat model of vascular dementia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302850","date":1715781600000,"content":"<p>by Hamideh Asadi nejad, Amirhossein Yousefi Nejad, Somayeh Akbari, Maryam Naseh, Seyed Mostafa Shid Moosavi, Masoud Haghani</p>\r\nBackground and aim <p>Vascular dementia (VD) is a common type of dementia. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low and high doses of lutein administration in bilateral-carotid vessel occlusion (2VO) rats.</p> Experimental procedure <p>The rats were divided into the following groups: the control, sham-, vehicle (2VO+V) groups, and two groups after 2VO were treated with lutein 0.5 (2VO+LUT-o.5) and 5mg/kg (2VO+LUT-5). The passive-avoidance and Morris water maze were performed to examine fear and spatial memory. The field-potential recording was used to investigate the properties of basal synaptic transmission (BST), paired-pulse ratio (PPR), as an index for measurement of neurotransmitter release, and long-term potentiation (LTP). The hippocampus was removed to evaluate hippocampal cells, volume, and MDA level.</p> Result <p>Treatment with low and high doses improves spatial memory and LTP impairment in VD rats, but only the high dose restores the fear memory, hippocampal cell loss, and volume and MDA level. Interestingly, low-dose, but not high-dose, increased PPR. However, BST recovered only in the high-dose treated group.</p> Conclusions <p>Treatment with a low dose might affect neurotransmitter release probability, but a high dose affects postsynaptic processes. It seems likely that low and high doses improve memory and LTP through different mechanisms.</p>","author":"Hamideh Asadi nejad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"21e28c21adc280676a0e582f631ddd7db3a0735360c66e7732a75a4b8b78c09b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
