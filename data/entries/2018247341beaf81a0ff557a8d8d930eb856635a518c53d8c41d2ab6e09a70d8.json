{"title":"Range and Depth Estimates of Whale Signals Recorded by Triplets of Hydrophones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1227/v1","date":1728997878000,"content":"The hydroacoustic in-water stations of the International Monitoring System (IMS) network consist of three hydrophones placed at Sound Fixing and Ranging (SOFAR) channel depths and about 2 km away from each other. Whale signals recorded in the vicinity of a hydrophone triplet offer the opportunity to verify simple models of propagation in the immediate neighborhood of the triplet, by comparing arrival times and amplitudes between the three hydrophones. Two examples of whales passing by hydrophone triplets are presented and conclusions drawn about waveform coherency and amplitude of the signals recorded at the three hydrophones in the 0-50 Hz frequency band. On the examples recorded at the HA11 IMS hydroacoustic station, the amplitude decay law of one over the distance is verified, and analysis of hundreds of calls located almost above the hydrophone triplet lead to the possibility that the H11S3 hydrophone may be located further from H11S1 and H11S2, and the H11S1 hydrophoneâ€™s depth may be deeper than expected from the published locations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2018247341beaf81a0ff557a8d8d930eb856635a518c53d8c41d2ab6e09a70d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
