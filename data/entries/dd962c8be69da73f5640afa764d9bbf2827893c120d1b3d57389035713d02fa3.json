{"title":"Oligodendrocyte Progenitors in Glial Scar: A Bet on Remyelination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0488/v1","date":1715158416000,"content":"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) represent a subtype of glia giving rise to oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system (CNS). While OPCs are highly proliferating during development, they become relatively quiescent during adulthood, when their fate is strictly influenced by the extracellular context. In traumatic injuries and chronic neurodegenerative conditions including those of autoimmune origin, oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis, and demyelination starts. Adult OPCs become immediately activated, they migrate at the lesion site and proliferate to replenish the damaged area, but their efficiency is hampered by the presence of a glial scar, a barrier mainly formed by reactive astrocytes, microglia, and the deposition of inhibitory extracellular matrix components. If, on one hand, glial scar limits the lesion spreading, it also blocks tissue regeneration. Therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing astrocyte or microglia activation and shifting them toward a neuroprotective phenotype have been proposed, whereas the role of OPCs has been largely overlooked. In this review, we have considered glial scar from the perspective of OPCs, analysing their behaviour when lesions originate and exploring the potential therapies aimed at sustaining OPCs to efficiently differentiate and promote remyelination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd962c8be69da73f5640afa764d9bbf2827893c120d1b3d57389035713d02fa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
