{"title":"COVID-19, Tattoos and How It Has Affected Locus of Control, Risk-Taking Behaviour, Self-Esteem and Body Image: A Quantitative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0517/v1","date":1710209150000,"content":"This study explores how the covid-19 pandemic affected some psychological factors in people who got tattoos during or after the lockdown, the psychological factors assessed were self-esteem, risk taking behaviour, body image and locus of control. The study used a quantitative, between-subjects design to investigate the experiences of participants who acquired tattoos during the pandemic compared to those who did not. The results showed that participants who got a tattoo during the pandemic reported higher levels of self-esteem and body image satisfaction compared to those who did not get a tattoo. Furthermore, the findings suggest that individuals with tattoos may have a more external locus of control. Participants with tattoos exhibited higher levels of risk-taking behaviour compared to those without tattoos, furthermore sex affected risk-taking behaviour in tattooed individuals, and females with tattoos displayed a higher risk taking tendency than their tattooed male counterparts. Further research needs to be done while acknowledging the limitations of this study. Overall, this study is pivotal in establishing how the pandemic may have affected the aforementioned psychological factors in people with tattoos. It also adds to the growing body of  literature in body modification and psychology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85d2c1152c3790f7f459284886a8c4f875b5df660384f357b97a01d443b8862d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
