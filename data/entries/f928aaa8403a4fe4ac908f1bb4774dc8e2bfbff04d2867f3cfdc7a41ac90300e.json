{"title":"Enhancing the energy level of regional digital innovation ecosystems: A configuration perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309229","date":1727791200000,"content":"<p>by Rong Huang, Shuai Mao</p>\r\n\r\nThis study introduces the concept of \"energy level\" into the analysis of innovation ecosystems. Drawing on the theory of \"architects\", we have identified the key architects of regional digital innovation ecosystems. By integrating Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) and Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we examined the configuration effects of internal architects, external architects, and digital innovation habitats on the energy level of these ecosystems, utilizing data from 30 provinces in China as case studies. The results indicate that the contribution of a single architect to achieving a high energy level in a regional digital innovation ecosystem is limited and cannot be regarded as a necessary condition for driving a high energy level. However, core innovation actors and digital infrastructures emerge as more significant core conditions. The architects of regional digital innovation ecosystems exhibit multiple concurrent causal relationships. The configuration paths of high and non-high energy levels of ecosystems display a causally asymmetric “multiple paths to the same outcome” relationship. The three identified paths for driving high energy levels are categorized as \"core actor-infrastructure\"-driven paths. The findings of this paper hold substantial theoretical and practical significance for fostering the healthy development of regional digital innovation ecosystems.","author":"Rong Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f928aaa8403a4fe4ac908f1bb4774dc8e2bfbff04d2867f3cfdc7a41ac90300e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
