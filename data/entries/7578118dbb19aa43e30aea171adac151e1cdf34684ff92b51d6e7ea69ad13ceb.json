{"title":"Advancements in water and ecological risk assessment in the Yellow River Delta, North China: Implications for legal frameworks in environmental protection and public health","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12895?af=R","date":1707382863000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Yellow River Delta (YRD) is an important agricultural and industrial region in China, yet its water resources have been increasingly affected by shortages and pollution due to human activities and the impact of climate change. This has resulted in severe damage to the water ecosystem in the YRD, thereby necessitating the adoption of effective legal measures to safeguard these resources. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research findings on water resources and water ecology in the YRD. Specifically, it summarizes the changes and characteristics of the geographical distribution, quantity and quality of water resources in the region and analyzes the effects of climate change, economic development and population growth on water resources. In light of the vulnerability and risks to the water resources and ecosystems in this area, this paper evaluates the impact of human activities on regional water security and proposes strategies for the sustainable utilization of water resources and the protection of public health. The insights and measures presented in this paper provide valuable guidance and references for water resource management and environmental protection in the YRD.</p>","author":"Yifan Huo, \nMei Yang, \nMengyue Lei, \nPeng Wu, \nXiaohe Tian, \nTingzhang Yang, \nZhao Wang, \nYan Mao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"7578118dbb19aa43e30aea171adac151e1cdf34684ff92b51d6e7ea69ad13ceb","category":"Environment"}
