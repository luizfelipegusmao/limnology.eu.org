At the atomic level, vibrations of atoms known as thermal ellipsoids exhibit significant anisotropies due to local symmetries and have been traditionally estimated by diffraction methods with limitations in spatial and energy resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.561-B1\">1</a>]. This leads to an averaging of thermal ellipsoids across the entire phonon spectrum, obscuring the linkage between atomic vibrations and specific material responses associated with acoustic or optical phonon modes. Advances in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) within scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), featuring few-meV energy and sub-nm spatial resolutions, enable the detection of defect-induced phonon modes and their dynamic behaviors [<a href=\"#ozae044.561-B2\">2â€“3</a>]. Yet, differentiating elements, crystalline positions, or vibrational anisotropies in crystals remains challenging. Here, we develop a novel momentum-selective dark-field EELS approach with controlled momentum exchanges to reveal the vibrational anisotropies of individual oxygen atoms in a centrosymmetric cubic-phase SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (STO) thin film.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a024fd6d827e4b5470d427da13cb42d8d9fcd0d021ef2ffce33da4122c93ba71","category":"Environment"}
