{"title":"Toward the Development of Garlic Varieties: The First Attempts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0829/v1","date":1718207033000,"content":"Aimed to obtain purple garlic varieties, 360 bolting bulbs from the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) “Las Pedroñeras” were selected for their size, and the presence of abundant external scales. After a further selection, 243 out of the 360 bulbs were discarded due to undesired characteristics, as light purple color, high number of small cloves, cloves affected by Fusarium spp. and mites, among other. It was stablished that each bulb would give rise to a family. Thus, 117 families were planted under a random design during season 2021-2022. Either physiological, morphological and phenological traits were assessed for each family, and the affectations by pest and pathogens were also controlled. After the assessment of this trial, 103 out 117 families remained in the program, and were used for the establishment of a second trial the next season. Unlike the first trial, after the evaluations only 23 families remained in the program. There was observed a high variability for most of traits, with a great influence of families. The phenotypic behavior of families was significative influenced by environment, highlighting the need of their assessment under different environmental conditions. The high variability registered for the target sample, opens the possibility to select new garlic varieties from this PGI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"989bef22ebdbdb2a6a100db4b2e5c8dd7c9d2a464158d65628c0de88ab4b8249","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
