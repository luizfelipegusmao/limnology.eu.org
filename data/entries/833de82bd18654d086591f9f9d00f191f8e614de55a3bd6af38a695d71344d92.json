This results in better bonding performance and excellent structural rigidity and integrity. The automotive, aerospace, medical, and energy industries, among others, have increased their brazing applications because of such advantages. Brazing is a subcategory of welding processes where the materials are heated above the filler material´s melting point. A filler material has a characteristic liquidus temperature around 450 °C, which must be lower than the solidus temperature of the base materials. Such a difference allows the filler to melt and penetrate the base material, producing a strong joint upon solidification. Joining involves phenomena such as surface wetting, interdiffusion, and possibly some chemical reactions. Flow and spread of the filler occur mainly by capillarity and surface wetting, including significant diffusion of different chemical elements between both materials. The nature of the filler and base materials determines the atomic bonding between them, i.e. metallic, ionic, covalent, or mixed [<a href=\"#ozae044.257-B1\">1-4</a>]. A heat input uniformly distributed and a controlled process time are the most critical brazing variables to avoid corrosion and oxidation of the joined component's surface, they also allow a close control of the final gran size [<a href=\"#ozae044.257-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"833de82bd18654d086591f9f9d00f191f8e614de55a3bd6af38a695d71344d92","category":"Environment"}
