{"title":"An Economic Assessment of Fresh Water Reallocation by Treated Wastewater for Irrigation in Northern Jordan Valley","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1260/v1","date":1724044259000,"content":"The study investigates the economic feasibility and farmer acceptance of utilizing treated wastewater (TWW) for agricultural irrigation, particularly in the Northern Jordan Valley. Despite its potential to mitigate water scarcity, concerns persist regarding its impact on soil health, crop yield, and land utilization, hindering widespread adoption. The research aims to measure farm profitability and farmers' willingness to embrace TWW through various blending scenarios with traditional surface water sources. The yield response function to salinity was incorporated into profit function to simulate crop profitability and water values. Results indicate that the introduction of TWW negatively affects salt-sensitive crops like citrus but positively impacts others such as date palm, olives, tomatoes, and peppers due to increased fertilizer content in irrigation water. Economic performance indicators reveal a gradual decrease in water net productivity for citrus with increasing blending ratios of TWW, with the water value decreasing accordingly. Higher percentages of treated water do not consistently lead to increased productivity, profitability, or net value added, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and understanding of economic risks associated with specific crops and water quality. To mitigate the impact of water salinity on citrus production, growers are advised to improve soil quality, periodically flush the soil with low-salinity water, and use salt-tolerant rootstocks. Regular monitoring of soil and water salinity levels is crucial for informed decision-making. While using TWW, water may offer cost savings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53908e9e3ddf8594ca9a31c8d2670dc471dededfc7d474863cc7bfab0926afe4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
