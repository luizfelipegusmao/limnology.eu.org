{"title":"The Impact of Supplier Relationship Management on E-commerce Brand Reputation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1080/v1","date":1721065402000,"content":"This qualitative research explores the impact of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) on e-commerce brand reputation, focusing on the strategic imperatives, operational challenges, and economic implications within digital supply chains. Trust emerges as a foundational element in effective SRM practices, facilitating consistent product quality, timely delivery, and consumer trust, thereby enhancing brand credibility and loyalty. Strategic alignment of SRM with organizational goals enables e-commerce brands to leverage supplier capabilities for mutual growth and innovation. Operational challenges such as technological constraints and logistical complexities underscore the importance of digital integration and proactive risk management strategies to optimize SRM effectiveness. Digital technologies, including AI and blockchain, play a transformative role in enhancing transparency, efficiency, and resilience in SRM strategies, enabling e-commerce firms to mitigate risks and capitalize on market opportunities. Emotional intelligence (EI) competencies among supply chain professionals facilitate effective communication, conflict resolution, and sustainable supplier relationships that bolster brand reputation resilience. Economically, effective SRM practices yield cost efficiencies, improved financial performance, and resilience against supply chain disruptions, supporting sustainable growth in competitive digital markets. This study contributes valuable insights for practitioners and scholars aiming to enhance SRM strategies, optimize supplier relationships, and strengthen brand reputation management in e-commerce. By prioritizing trust, strategic alignment, digital innovation, EI competencies, and proactive risk management, e-commerce brands can navigate complexities, capitalize on opportunities, and foster positive brand reputations in the evolving landscape of digital commerce.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"186d65a87e7afdbb1f2503ec5570a6b9f4ccf861e2b73f63910d2bb935b3febf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
