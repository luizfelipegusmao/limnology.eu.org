The study delves into the activities, strategies, and influences of the MWL, particularly in the past decade, from 2014 to 2024. Given the evolving dynamics of global geopolitics, the MWL's initiatives in fostering religious diplomacy, cultural exchange, and humanitarian efforts are critically analyzed. The Secretary General, Dr. Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, plays a pivotal role in shaping and advancing the organization's objectives internationally. Using a blend of descriptive and analytical methodologies, this paper investigates how the MWL leverages soft power to address issues faced by the Muslim community worldwide. The research also uncovers the interconnected factors influencing the effectiveness of the MWL's programs and policies. Through a comprehensive review of literature, examination of previous studies, and an analysis of the theoretical frameworks, this study identifies gaps and offers insights for future research. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the MWL's impact on global Muslim populations and the broader implications for international relations and soft power theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5234248f4d4b6db3c76a5b7c6ac2110d4f1060480e631a0cce86b31256f56a13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
