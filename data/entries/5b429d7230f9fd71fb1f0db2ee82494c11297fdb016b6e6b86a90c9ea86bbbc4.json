{"title":"Vortex Characterisation and Parametric Study of Miniature Vortex Generators and Their Near Field Boundary Layer Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2164/v1","date":1721982424000,"content":"Delaying the onset of laminar-turbulent transition is an attractive method in reducing skin friction drag, especially on streamlined bodies where Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities are the dominating mechanism for transition. Miniature vortex generators (MVGs) offer an effective approach to attenuate these instabilities by generating counter-rotating vortex pairs. They are placed in pairs within an array and resemble small winglet-type elements. The conventional methodology involves adjusting MVG parameters and conducting computationally expensive DNS and/or downstream stability analyses to assess their effectiveness. However, analyzing the vortex parameters of MVG-generated vortices can potentially guide a more targeted approach in modifying MVG parameters and identifying critical factors for transition delay. Therefore, this study investigates changes in three primary MVG parameters, namely inner distance, periodicity and height, and utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to create a dataset that examines the characteristics of the generated counter-rotating vortex pairs and their potential in drag reduction. The objective is to establish correlations among these parameters and their influence on delaying transition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b429d7230f9fd71fb1f0db2ee82494c11297fdb016b6e6b86a90c9ea86bbbc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
