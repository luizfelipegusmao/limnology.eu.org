{"title":"Ecological Adaptations and Conservation Challenges of Schizothoracids in High Altitude Environments: A Mini Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1107/v1","date":1715853564000,"content":"The fish found in the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas are referred to as schizothoracids, and they have evolved unique biological adaptations to high elevations. These adaptations include changes in the shape of the mouth, size, and length of gill rakers according to the prey size, sucking attachment organs to cope with fast currents, and genetic differences due to hypoxia and UV light. Nevertheless, there are recent threats like destruction of natural habitats, pollution, overfishing, and global warming that have posed serious conservation issues for numerous species. Conservation measures have been initiated even though well-articulated management techniques or other protective measures are absent from several protected areas for freshwater fisheries located in India. To resolve these issues, Schizothoracid population rescue, rehabilitation and restocking in safe water bodies should be implemented. For achieving their sustainability, scientists, conservationists, and legislators need to coordinate with each other.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccf3f42639ab63b0101197efa7e6714474e3ae4633e0533721d84aa10503771a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
