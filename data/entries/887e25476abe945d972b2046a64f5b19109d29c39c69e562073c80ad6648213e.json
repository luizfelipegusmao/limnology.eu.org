{"title":"Enhancing the Potential of PHAs in Tissue Engineering Applications: A Review of Chemical Modification Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1474/v1","date":1729243062000,"content":"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of polyesters produced by many microbial species. These naturally occurring polymers are widely used in tissue engineering because of their in vivo degradability and excellent biocompatibility. The most well-studied among them is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and its copolymer with 3-hydroxyvaleric acid (PHBV). Despite their superior properties, PHB and PHBV suffer from high crystallinity, poor mechanical properties, slow resorption rate, and inherent hydrophobicity. Not only PHB and PHBV are hydrophobic, but almost all members of the PHA family struggle because of this characteristic. One can overcome the limitations of microbial polyesters by modifying their bulk or surface chemical composition. Therefore, researchers have put much effort into developing the methods for chemical modification of PHAs. This paper reviews the chemical modification methods of PHAs that make them more suitable for scaffold fabrication. Different chemical strategies for improving the wettability and mechanical properties of the PHA scaffolds are discussed in this review. Emphasis is placed on the methods used to modify the chemical structure of PHB and PHBV, the most important polymers of the PHA family. The properties of PHAs that are important for their applications in tissue engineering are also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"887e25476abe945d972b2046a64f5b19109d29c39c69e562073c80ad6648213e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
