{"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Ca1−xMnxHPO4·nH2O Compounds for Biomedical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1132/v1","date":1715943615000,"content":"The objective of this research was to explore the impact of a gradual replacement of Ca2+ with Mn1+ on the crystal structure of CaHPO4·2H2O, which could be beneficial for producing Ca1−xMnxHPO4·nH2O compounds. In order to prepare the starting solutions required for this study, Ca(NO3) 2·4H2O, (NH4)·2HPO4, and MnNO3·4H2O were used at various molar concentrations. The findings reveal that Mn substitutes Ca partly at low Mn/Ca molar ratios, and Mn doping reduces the unit cell of CaHPO4·2H2O. The produced biphasic compound was composed of monoclinic CaHPO4·2H2O and triclinic/monoclinic nanostructured Mn3PO4O11 after a continuous increase in the Mn/Ca molar ratio to 1. When the Ca/Mn molar ratio is 1.5, a triphasic compound of monoclinic CaHPO4·2H2O, triclinic Mn3P4O11, and Orthorhombic MnHPO4·(H2O)3 phases is formed. The formation of the monophasic MnHPO4·(H2O)3 compound was achieved by increasing the Mn/Ca molar ratio above 4. By adjusting the Mn/Ca molar ratio in the initial solutions, it is possible to produce biomaterials with specific and bespoke characteristics in the future. The Mn/Ca ratio of the starting solution can be modified to produce Ca1-xMnxHPO4-nH2O phases with weight percent compositions, as established. For the first time, Ca1−xMnxHPO4·nH2O compounds were synthesized using novel methods in this manuscript.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d55cb99153272e828749a8ccf74e432a803c841c91914a8de779cdb849b89c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
