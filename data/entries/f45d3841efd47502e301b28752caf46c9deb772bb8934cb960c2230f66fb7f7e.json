{"title":"Clinical analysis of the influence of surface roughness in the primary stability and osseointegration of dental implant: Study in humans","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0955/v1","date":1718335092000,"content":"The first treatments with dental implants had low success rates (75%). Nowadays, oral rehabilitation with titanium dental implants has a high success rate (95-98%). The success rate significantly increases due to increased scientific knowledge about osseointegration, changes in surgical techniques, and the development of implant surface treatments. Despite the high success rate of implants, no protocol defines the time for the prosthesis to be installed and loaded after surgery. This work compares a new dental implant's primary (mechanical) and secondary (osseointegration) stability. Dental implant with micro- and nano-roughness surface was placed in 24 patients with a minimum of 35 N.cm and a maximum of 60 N.cm. Primary stability was quantified with a torque wrench and Ostell Mentor. The secondary stability 45 and 60 days after surgery was measured with Ostell. The results showed no statistical difference in secondary stability at 45 and 60 days postoperatively among implants. The success rate of dental implants can be associated with the surface morphology with micro and nano-roughness and the shape of the fillets of the implant threads. When the manufacturer's guidelines are followed, it is possible to prosthetically rehabilitate the patient with an implant 45 days after surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f45d3841efd47502e301b28752caf46c9deb772bb8934cb960c2230f66fb7f7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
