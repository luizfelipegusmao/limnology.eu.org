{"title":"The Role of LEED Certification in Enhancing Sustainability in Design-Build Construction Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0590/v1","date":1725865442000,"content":"Sustainability in construction has emerged as a critical focus in response to growing environmental challenges. This article review explores the intersection of LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification and design-build construction, highlighting how these two frameworks enhance sustainability in the built environment. By examining the findings of a selected article, the review emphasizes the advantages of LEED certification in promoting energy efficiency, reducing waste, and improving overall environmental performance. The design-build method, with its integrated and collaborative approach, complements LEEDâ€™s objectives by ensuring that sustainability is prioritized from the initial planning stages. This review also critically analyzes the strengths and limitations of the article, including its coverage of cost-related challenges and the applicability of LEED in diverse project scales. Ultimately, the review underscores the significant role that LEED certification plays in advancing sustainable construction practices, particularly within the design-build model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31180e9b14aeaea50a474e82336cff06d7418dce71feae3beaf4b620adebe1e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
