{"title":"“Beyond the Knife” - Applying Theranostic Technologies to Enhance Outcomes in Neurosurgical Oncology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0258/v1","date":1725386434000,"content":"Current standard of care for brain tumor management includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent advances in image-guided surgical techniques have enhanced the precision of tumor resections, yet there remains a critical need for innovative technologies to further improve patient outcomes. The emerging use of theranostic technologies to improve surgical outcomes can further augment the efficacy of adjuvant radiosurgery/radiotherapy and systemic therapies. Stanford Neurosurgery is a leader in the field of translational neuro-oncology. In this review, we provide an expert view of how theranostics can be integrated into future therapeutic treatment algorithms to help improve survival for patients with brain tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32f352680b4d340c792866a8d2c823cd338a2160825a598b850805f627b34fd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
