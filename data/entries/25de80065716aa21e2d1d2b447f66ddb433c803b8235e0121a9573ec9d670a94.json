{"title":"TFAB002s, novel CD20-targeting T cell-dependent bispecific Fab-FabCH3 antibodies, exhibit potent antitumor efficacy against malignant B-cell lymphoma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310889","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Qinghong Li, Kunming Zhang, Yao Yu, Zeng Yu, Jingyi Xu, Wenyan Shen, Lin Zhang, Aidong Qu, Hongyuan Liang</p>\r\n\r\nB-cell lymphoma, clinically, comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies that encompass various subtypes. CD20 is an optimal target for therapeutic antibodies in B-cell lymphoma immunotherapy since approximately 90% of B-cell malignancies typically exhibit CD20 expression on their surface, while its presence is limited in normal tissues. In this study, we have developed a series of novel non-IgG-like T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies by constructing Fab-FabCH3, referred to as Tandem Antigen-binding Fragment 002 (TFAB002), which specifically target CD20 for the treatment of malignant B-cell lymphoma. TFAB002s display strong binding affinity with CD20 and moderate binding affinity with CD3, thereby triggering target-specific T-cell activation, cytokine release, and tumor cell lysis <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, TFAB002s exhibit potent cytotoxicity against B-cell malignancies that express varying levels of CD20. Besides, the TFAB002s show potent pharmacodynamic activity <i>in vivo</i> in the WIL2-S cells CDX mouse model. Collectively, these results underscore the potential of TFAB002s as a highly promising therapeutic approach for selectively depleting CD20-positive B cells, thereby warranting further clinical evaluation as a viable treatment option for CD20-expressing B-cell malignancies.","author":"Qinghong Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"25de80065716aa21e2d1d2b447f66ddb433c803b8235e0121a9573ec9d670a94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
