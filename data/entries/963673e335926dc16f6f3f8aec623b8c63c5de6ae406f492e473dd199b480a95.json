{"title":"Structural Units: A New Unit System for Quantifying Spacetime to Unify Physics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1460/v1","date":1724156972000,"content":"Structural Units (SU) is a novel unit system, proposed as compatible to the International System of Units (SI), rooted in Spacetime Structure. Unlike SI, which evolved over history without a fixed reference frame, SU defines one Structural Unit as the space and time between two vertices in the Spacetime Structure. This perspective offers a unique viewpoint, where space and time units are proportionate. This correlation results in Natural constants being expressible through algebraic relationships involving the pure numbers π, φ (the Golden ratio), and α (the Fine Structure constant), not only simplifying Fundamental constants but also introducing a harmonious integration of geometric concepts. In contrast, SI currently relies on fixed values for seven constants derived from CODATA. It's crucial for Structural Units to seamlessly integrate with the existing International System of Units, proposing a theoretical framework, hitherto nonexistent, for the values of the various Fundamental Constants that have been experimentally obtained in our scientific endeavor. To ensure compatibility, the four Planck Units, (length, mass, time, and temperature), introduced by Max Planck in 1899, will be recalculated in SU and then converted back to SI using dimensional analysis. Additionally, to further validate this compatibility, we will examine the Schwarzschild radius from Relativity, the photon energy from Quantum Mechanics, and propose a new interpretation of the Uncertainty Principle under the SU framework. This potential harmonization of geometry and Natural constants in SU could offer a deeper understanding of the inherent order in the fabric of the Universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"963673e335926dc16f6f3f8aec623b8c63c5de6ae406f492e473dd199b480a95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
