{"title":"Bioactive Bioxanthracene and Cyclodepsipeptides from the Entomopathogenic Fungus Blackwellomyces roseostromatus BCC56290","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1132/v1","date":1718619718000,"content":"In the course of our ongoing research targeting the identification of potential biocontrol agents from entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), we explored a solid-state rice fungal extract of Blackwellomyces roseostromatus BCC56290 derived from infected lepidopteran larvae. Chemical and biological prospections afforded four unprecedently reported natural products differentiated into one dimeric naphthopyran bioxanthracene ES-242 derivative (1) and three cyclodepsipeptides (2-4) in addition to two known cyclodepsipeptides, cardinalisamides B (5) and C (6). Chemical structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated through comprehensive 1D/2D NMR and HR-ESI-MS data together with comparisons to the reported literature. The absolute configuration of the isolated cyclodepsipeptide was determined using Marfeyâ€™s method. All isolated compounds were assessed for their antimicrobial, cytotoxic and nematicidal activities with some compounds revealed significant activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7d472e6265ed4604b460d4205ce92188a0161f486b12844c786f4ef4cefce75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
