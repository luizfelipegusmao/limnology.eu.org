{"title":"Nanoparticles as Potential Delivery System of Phenothiazine Derivatives for Anticancer Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0517/v1","date":1728370584000,"content":"Cancer remains a one of a leading cause of death worldwide, and thus there is a need for the de-velopment of innovative and more effective treatment strategies. The aim of the study was to evaluate two types of nanoparticles â€“ nanospheres and micelles obtained from PLA-based pol-ymers for discovering their potential for delivery of four types of phenothiazine derivatives. The morphology, drug loading properties, cytocompatibility, hemolytic properties and anti-cancer activity has been analyzed. The micelles exhibited significantly higher drug loading properties, release process and cytotoxic activity against cancer cells compared to the nano-spheres. The micelles containing 5-methyl-12H-quino[3,4-b][1,4]benzothiazinium chloride with OH group as substituent in 10-position of the quinobenzothiazine ring showed the highest drug loading content, the most efficient drug release, the lowest hemolytic activity and the most sig-nificant cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells. The conducted study enabled to develop delivery system for the new anticancer compound and showed that the choice of drug carrier has a crucial effect on its cytotoxic potential against cancer cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"240ac6cf4549a4d1f2cd0bda33ed956f3848441e6df5bbebe3bd8bb847936b4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
