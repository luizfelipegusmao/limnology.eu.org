{"title":"The Combined Use of Hard X-ray Scanning Nanoprobe and Confocal Microscopy in Single Pancreatic Cells Revealed Novel Physiologically Relevant Iron-Regulating Structures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.230/7719794?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Using hard X-ray scanning nanoprobe, we described novel iron-specific cellular structures in single pancreatic beta-cells. We termed these structures â€“ iron puncta, and first described them in pancreatic beta-cells in 2021 [<a href=\"#ozae044.230-B1\">1</a>]. We showed that iron puncta are heterogeneous structures that are scattered thought cytosol of pancreatic cells and differ in size, iron load, and contain iron exclusively [<a href=\"#ozae044.230-B1\">1</a>]. Ours and other groups have showed similar iron structures in neurons [<a href=\"#ozae044.230-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.230-B3\">3</a>]. However, the function and identity of these cellular structures and their role in cellular iron handling remains unidentified. Pancreatic beta-cells are a unique cellular model to study iron dynamics and iron puncta because these cells are highly susceptible to iron damage and iron-induced cell death ferroptosis [<a href=\"#ozae044.230-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.230-B5\">5</a>]. In the follow up studies, presented here, we used combination of hard X-ray scanning nanoprobe, confocal microscopy and molecular techniques to define the physiological function and identity of iron puncta in pancreatic beta-cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3e81fd730c92ec808ff97655a9d4bc3c0f1c736d501b57c7f096c08e8f47d303","category":"Environment"}
