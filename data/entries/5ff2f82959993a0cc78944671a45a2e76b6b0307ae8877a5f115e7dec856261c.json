Understanding their movement ecology can be difficult due to their wide distribution and ability to inhabit both inshore and offshore reef habitats. BSB have been studied using a range of tagging techniques, and here we present the results of the first deployments of pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) on this species. During 2019 and 2021, we conducted four fishing trips within the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight region of the NW Atlantic and tagged a total of 30 fish with T-bar tags and external data loggers, of which 4 received a PSAT and the rest received a Star-Oddi conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) archival tag. All PSATs transmitted some data, with short attachment durations (8–32 days) relative to the programmed release of 250 days, and we did not recover a Star-Oddi tag. External tag attachment techniques need to be examined and improved before continued deployment of larger data loggers on BSB.</p>","author":"Samir H.
