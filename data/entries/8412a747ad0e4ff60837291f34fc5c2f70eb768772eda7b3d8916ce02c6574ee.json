For example, the proton conducting proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) play a crucial role in promoting hydrogen energy technology [<a href=\"#ozae044.582-B1\">1-5</a>]. In a PCFC, the electrolyte is typically a solid oxide material that enables proton transport and can operate at temperatures lower than those of traditional oxygen ion conducting fuel cells [<a href=\"#ozae044.582-B6\">6</a>]. The reduced operating temperature of PCFCs contributes to their durability, scalability, and efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.582-B7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.582-B8\">8</a>].
