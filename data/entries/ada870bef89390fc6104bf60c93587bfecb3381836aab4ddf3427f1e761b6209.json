{"title":"Design of a Novel Intraoperative Sensor for Load Balancing and Tracking during Total Knee Replacements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1464/v1","date":1713870851000,"content":"Intraoperative load sensors have been developed with the aim of balancing the soft tissue in the knee during Total Knee Replacements (TKRs). Literature has shown success in soft tissue bal-ancing however, concerns regarding the accuracy of these sensors remain. For this reason, pre-vious research has attempted to create robust sensors for intraoperative use. The design of the sensor in this research has aimed to address the concerns outlined in the literature to create a new and novel smart-sensor for soft-tissue balancing. This new intraoperative load sensor included design features to increase accuracy while artificial intelligence allowed for comprehensive sensing across the entirety of the sensor, providing unparalleled insight during the operation. Notably, the sensor was designed to withstand loads of at least 450 N, ensuring robust perfor-mance of the sensor. To optimize the design process while minimizing cost, Finite Element Analysis was employed. This approach ensured the design features fulfilled their function while maintaining structural integrity to withstand loads. Moreover, the novelty of using training data from simulated data will reduce the iterative process of the labor-intensive collection of training data for the artificial intelligence while reducing human error associated with it. Results from the evaluation demonstrated the ability of this design to successfully bridge the current gap in the market by fulfilling all essential design criteria established within the literature. This innovative smart-sensing tool will in turn enhance patient outcomes and alleviate financial burdens to pa-tients and the healthcare systems by reducing the need for early revision surgeries associated with improper joint tension.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ada870bef89390fc6104bf60c93587bfecb3381836aab4ddf3427f1e761b6209","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
