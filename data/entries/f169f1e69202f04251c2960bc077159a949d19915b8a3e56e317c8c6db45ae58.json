{"title":"Sutureless Aortic Prosthesis Valves versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Intermediate Risk Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1230/v1","date":1721119588000,"content":"Aortic stenosis continues to be still the most frequently valvular pathology in the elderly population of the Western countries. According to the latest guidelines, the therapeutic choice of aortic stenosis depends on the age of the patient (&amp;lt;75 years or &amp;gt;75 years) and the risk class (STS-Prom/ Euroscore II &amp;lt; o &amp;gt; 4%). Therefore, if the surgical indication is clear in young and low risk patients and percutaneous treatment is the gold standard in older and high-risk patients, the therapeutic choice is still debated in intermediate-risk patients. In this group of patients the aortic valve stenosis treatment depends on the patient's global evaluation, on the experience of the center and no less important on the patient's will. Two main therapeutic options are debated: surgical aortic valve replacement with sutureless prosthesis versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation. In addition, the progressive development of mininvasive techniques for aortic valve surgery (right -anterior minitoracotomy) has also reduced the peri and post -operative risk in this group of patients. The goal of our review is to analyze the literature evidence of the best therapeutic choice in intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f169f1e69202f04251c2960bc077159a949d19915b8a3e56e317c8c6db45ae58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
