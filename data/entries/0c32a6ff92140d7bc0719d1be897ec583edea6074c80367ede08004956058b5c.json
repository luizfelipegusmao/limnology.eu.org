{"title":"Processing to improve the sustainability of chickpea as a functional food ingredient","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13532?af=R","date":1714641588000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Chickpea is a field crop that is playing an emerging role in the provision of healthy and sustainable plant-based value-added ingredients for the food and nutraceutical industries. This article reviews the characteristics of chickpea (composition, health properties, and techno-functionality) and chickpea grain that influence their use as whole foods or ingredients in formulated food. It covers the exploitation of traditional and emerging processes for the conversion of chickpea into value-added differentiated food ingredients. The influence of processing on the composition, health-promoting properties, and techno-functionality of chickpea is discussed. Opportunities to tailor chickpea ingredients to facilitate their incorporation in traditional food applications and in the expanding plant-based meat alternative and dairy alternative markets are highlighted. The review includes an assessment of the possible uses of by-products of chickpea processing. Recommendations are provided for future research to build a sustainable industry using chickpea as a value-added ingredient. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mary Ann Augustin, \nJia‐Ying Chen, \nJian‐Hui Ye","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"0c32a6ff92140d7bc0719d1be897ec583edea6074c80367ede08004956058b5c","category":"Environment"}
