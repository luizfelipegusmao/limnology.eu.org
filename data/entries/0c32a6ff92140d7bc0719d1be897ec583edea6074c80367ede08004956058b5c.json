{"title":"Processing to improve the sustainability of chickpea as a functional food ingredient","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13532?af=R","date":1713186178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Chickpea is a field crop that is playing an emerging role in the provision of healthy and sustainable plant-based value-added ingredients for the food and nutraceutical industries. This paper reviews the characteristics of chickpea (composition, health properties and techno-functionality) of the chickpea grain which influence its use as a whole food or an ingredient in formulated food. It covers the exploitation of traditional and emerging food processes for conversion of chickpea into value-added differentiated food ingredients. The influence of processing on composition, health promoting properties and techno-functionality of chickpea are discussed. The opportunities for tailoring chickpea ingredients to facilitate their incorporation in traditional food applications and in the expanding plant-based meat alternative and dairy alternative markets are highlighted. The review includes an assessment of the possible uses of byproducts of chickpea processing, which is necessary for building a more sustainable future for chickpea. Recommendations for future research to build a sustainable chickpea value-added ingredient industry are provided.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
