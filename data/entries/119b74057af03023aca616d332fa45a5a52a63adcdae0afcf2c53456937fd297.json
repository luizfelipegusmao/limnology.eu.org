While many taxa exhibit similar trophic discrimination factors (TDFs), crayfish, exhibit omnivorous feeding strategies, yet TDFs are missing. In this study, we determined TDFs and tissue biokinetic parameters of the marbled crayfish <em>Procambarus virginalis</em> as a model species. Moreover, we compared commonly used TDFs and those determined from this study and applied them across species and ecosystems as a first attempt to compare the effect of species-specific TDFs in Bayesian trophic mixing models. Our results revealed differences between the TDFs of different tissues and biokinetic parameters of crayfish. Our result also revealed TDFs differences between crayfish relying mostly on plants versus those relying on an animal diet. We found differences of TDF suitability among species and ecosystems, highlighting the need for specific TDFs for different crayfish species. This study improves our understanding and the need for species-calibrated TDFs for robust statistical analysis of stable isotope data. Our approach is widely applicable across taxa and ecosystems to reduce the bias introduced by using unspecific TDFs in Bayesian mixing models.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"119b74057af03023aca616d332fa45a5a52a63adcdae0afcf2c53456937fd297","category":"Environment"}
