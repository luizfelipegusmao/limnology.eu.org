{"title":"Unveiling Respiratory Muscle Strength in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Beyond Spirometry and Nutritional Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0333/v1","date":1717652666000,"content":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most prevalent progressive muscular dystrophy, and the guidelines recommend the regular assessment of respiratory muscle function. This study aimed to assess the relationship between maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) measurements and upright-supine spirometry parameters in children with DMD, predictability of upright-supine spirometry in terms of diaphragm involvement, and impact of nutrition on muscle strength. This prospective cross-sectional study examined patients with DMD by comparing upright and supine FVC, MIP, MEP, and SNIP measurements. Forty-four patients were included in the study. The mean patient age was 10.8Â±2.9 years. Twenty-five patients were ambulatory. A significant decrease in FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 values was detected in the supine position in both ambulatory and nonambulatory patients (p&amp;lt;0.05). All patients had low MIP, MEP, and SNIP measurements (less than 60 cm H2O). MIP, MEP, and SNIP values were significantly lower in patients with malnutrition than in those without (p&amp;lt;0.05). To accurately assess respiratory muscle strength, supine FVC should be combined with upright FVC, MIP, MEP, and SNIP measurements. It is crucial to regularly screen patients for malnutrition, as this can significantly affect respiratory muscle function during pulmonology follow-up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52e284b21a94a0696b2e989d49c66ba64b9c0940c9d512fb6d61181717cc1e82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
