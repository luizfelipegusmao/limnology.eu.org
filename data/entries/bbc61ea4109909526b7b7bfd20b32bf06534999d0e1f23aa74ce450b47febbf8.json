R tools for the removal of arching and bending in fish specimens for geometric morphometric shape analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15947?af=R","date":1727676925000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Geometric morphometrics is a powerful tool for studying fish body shape; however, body posture can be a hindrance to these analyses. Here I introduce new R language tools for correcting multiple types of bending of 3D data based on the TPS suite (geometric morphometric software) “unbend specimens” methodology. In a sample dataset of darters, these R tools adequately accounted for posture artifacts otherwise evident across multiple principal component axes. I hope these new tools will facilitate the incorporation of 3D landmark data into the comparative analysis of fish body shape.</p>","author":"Jessica Hilary Arbour","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"bbc61ea4109909526b7b7bfd20b32bf06534999d0e1f23aa74ce450b47febbf8","category":"Environment"}
