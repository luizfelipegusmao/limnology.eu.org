{"title":"Improving Satellite Chlorophyll-a Retrieval in the Turbid Waters of the Bay of Fundy, Canada","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12237-024-01334-x","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The Bay of Fundy is a highly productive ecosystem within the Northwest Atlantic where extreme tides and strong currents result in a large gradient of sediment concentrations across and along the bay. We processed daily satellite data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite from 2003 to 2021 at 300-m resolution to understand and quantify spatial and temporal trends in chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a, a measure of phytoplankton biomass), and suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM) in the Bay of Fundy surface waters. To account for high sediment loading (up to 100’s g m<sup>−3</sup>) and moderate chl-a (median in situ chl-a of 1.5 mg m<sup>−3</sup> from 2003 to 2021), coefficients of the OC3M chl-a algorithm were regionally tuned using in situ chl-a data, and satellite-derived SPM was incorporated within the chl-a retrieval algorithm to account for possible bias. The updated new algorithm was denoted as OC<sub>X-SPMCor</sub>. Chl-a computed using OC<sub>X-SPMCor</sub> showed better performance against in situ chl-a than the generic OC3M with a coefficient of determination that increased from 0.01 to 0.28 and a root mean square logarithmic error that decreased by 35%. Unlike previous remote sensing studies, OC<sub>X-SPMCor</sub> correctly predicted the particular chl-a seasonality in the Bay of Fundy, which does not follow the typical occurrence of spring/fall blooms as observed in the adjacent Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf. For the first time, satellite-predicted chl-a aligned with the phenology of in situ chl-a, where chl-a continually increased from April to June and remained high all summer, with a small secondary summer peak before decreasing in the fall. SPM seasonality followed an opposite trend where SPM reached a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer. A small number of matchups and high temporal variability on the hourly time scale precluded a robust assessment of the satellite-derived SPM. However, comparisons between time series of remotely sensed and in situ SPM demonstrated the ability of the satellite-derived SPM to capture temporal variations, though the absolute values may be slightly underestimated. Accurate maps of phytoplankton biomass and sediment concentrations are essential variables required for effective management and conservation of marine ecosystems in the Bay of Fundy.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"c58241330558990b49e156c268cdb06bc14542ff233e111f71583971ab76b239","category":"Environment"}
