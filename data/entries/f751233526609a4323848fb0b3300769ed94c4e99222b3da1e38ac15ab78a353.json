{"title":"Joint Toxicity and Interaction of Carbon-based Nanomaterials with Co-existing Pollutants in Aquatic Environment: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2458/v1","date":1722351091000,"content":"This review paper focuses on the joint toxicity and interaction of carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) with co-existing pollutants in aquatic environments. It explores the potential harmful effects of chemical mixtures on living organisms, emphasizing the importance of scientific mod-eling to predict mixed toxic effects. The study involved a systematic literature review to gather information on the joint toxicity and interaction between CNMs and various co-contaminants in aquatic settings. A total of 53 publications were chosen and analyzed, categorizing the studies based on the tested CNMs, types of co-contaminants, and the used species. Common test models included fish and microalgae, with zebrafish being the most studied species. The review under-scores the necessity of conducting mixture toxicity testing to assess whether the combined effects of CNMs and co-existing pollutants are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. The development of in silico models based on the solid foundation of research data represents the best opportunity for joint toxicity prediction, eliminating the need in a great quantity of experimental studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f751233526609a4323848fb0b3300769ed94c4e99222b3da1e38ac15ab78a353","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
