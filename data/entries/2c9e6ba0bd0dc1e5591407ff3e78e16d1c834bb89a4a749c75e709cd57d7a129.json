Understanding the spatial variations in mechanical properties in complex alloys can aid in optimizing alloy chemistry and microstructure through material synthesis or processing for the desired application. One major difficulty in characterizing mechanical heterogeneity is the laborious process of aligning separately measured mechanical property and microstructure maps.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c9e6ba0bd0dc1e5591407ff3e78e16d1c834bb89a4a749c75e709cd57d7a129","category":"Environment"}
