{"title":"A New Approach for Vertical Plant Cultivation Maximizing Crop Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1047/v1","date":1718606019000,"content":"The publication presents an innovative tower cultivation device designed to significantly increase vertical farming efficiency. The device divides the cultivation system into separate chambers. One division corresponds to the different growth phases of the plants, while another reflects the daily variation in conditions. Each chamber presents slightly different conditions and cultivation patterns from the others. For the early stages, crops are grown horizontally in trays once they mature, transplanted into mobile cultivation towers. The closed circulation of ventilation and irrigation reduces water consumption by up to 95%. A unique separate day-night division optimises light, temperature and humidity conditions, mimicking natural growth patterns. This approach not only saves water and energy but also optimises cultivation in a three-dimensional space. The presented solution focuses on the often overlooked aspects of cultivating in vertical farms and makes this method of growing much more cost-effective and feasible to implement on a large scale.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b70a67a71f3a61e6b6b74eff0793cf308afaa5a3904ec08a40613b9f7ce3d70d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
