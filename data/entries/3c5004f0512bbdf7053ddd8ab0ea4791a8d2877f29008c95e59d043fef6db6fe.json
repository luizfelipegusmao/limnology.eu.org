Voskuil, Farahnaz Movahedzadeh</p>\r\n\r\nWe have identified an acyl-carrier protein, Rv0100, that is up-regulated in a dormancy model. This protein plays a critical role in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, which is important for energy storage and cell wall synthesis in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB). Knocking out the <i>Rv0100</i> gene resulted in a significant reduction of growth compared to wild-type MTB in the Wayne model of non-replicating persistence. We have also shown that <i>Rv0100</i> is essential for the growth and survival of this pathogen during infection in mice and a macrophage model. Furthermore, knocking out <i>Rv0100</i> disrupted the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates, the virulence-enhancing lipids produced by MTB and <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>. We hypothesize that this essential gene contributes to MTB virulence in the state of latent infection. Therefore, inhibitors targeting this gene could prove to be potent antibacterial agents against this pathogen.","author":"Hiten J.
