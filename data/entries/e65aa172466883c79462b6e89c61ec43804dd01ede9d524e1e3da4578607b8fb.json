Yet we destroy ecosystems and drive species to extinction. We submit that anthropogenic biodiversity loss does not yet receive sufficient public attention, although biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use are key to mitigate global crises. Effective communication of biodiversity-related knowledge with diverse audiences is therefore crucial and should contribute to ensuring that evidence guides environmental decision-making. In this context, it is essential to stimulate multi-directional dialogues between science, policy, and society. Here, we suggest Dos and Don’ts that can guide science communication for scientists working in biodiversity research and beyond. Moreover, we emphasize the role of science journalism and other institutions specialized in science communication in critically mediating the complexity of scientific knowledge.","author":"Jonas Geschke","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"e65aa172466883c79462b6e89c61ec43804dd01ede9d524e1e3da4578607b8fb","category":"Environment"}
