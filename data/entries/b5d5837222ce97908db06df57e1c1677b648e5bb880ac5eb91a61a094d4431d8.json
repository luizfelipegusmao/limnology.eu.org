{"title":"Molecular mechanisms regulating GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORS activity in plant growth, development, and environmental responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4360/7658593?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants rely on complex regulatory mechanisms to ensure proper growth and development. As plants are sessile organisms, these mechanisms must be flexible enough to adapt to changes in the environment. GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORS (GRFs) are plant-specific transcription factors that act as a central hub controlling plant growth and development, which offer promising biotechnological applications to enhance plant performance. Here, we analyze the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate GRFs activity, and how their natural and synthetic variants can impact on plant growth and development. We describe the biological roles of the GRFs and examine how they regulate gene expression and contribute to the control of organ growth and plant responses to a changing environment. This review focuses on the premise that unlocking the full biotechnological potential of GRFs requires a thorough understanding of the various regulatory layers governing GRF activity, the functional divergence among GRF family members, and the gene networks that they regulate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"b5d5837222ce97908db06df57e1c1677b648e5bb880ac5eb91a61a094d4431d8","category":"Environment"}
