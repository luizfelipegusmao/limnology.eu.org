{"title":"Spatiotemporal Evolution and Tapio Decoupling Analysis of Energy-Related Carbon Emissions Using Nighttime Light Data: A Quantitative Case Study at the City Scale in Northeast China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1567/v1","date":1724252283000,"content":"As the world’s second-largest economy, China has undergone rapid industrialization and urbanization, leading to high energy consumption and significant carbon emissions. This development has exacerbated conflicts between human-land relations and environmental conservation, contributing to global warming and urban air pollution, both of which pose serious health risks. This study utilizes nighttime light (NTL) data from 2005 to 2019, combined with scaling techniques and statistical analysis, to estimate city-scale energy carbon emissions over a 15-year period. Our focus is on Northeast China, a traditional industrial region comprising 36 cities across three provinces, rich in natural resources but now facing severe aging challenges. We analyzed the spatial patterns of energy carbon emissions, while spatiotemporal evolution was assessed through spatial autocorrelation and dynamic changes. These dynamic changes were further evaluated using standard deviation ellipse (SDE) parameters and SLOPE values. Additionally, we examined the conflict between city-scale emissions and economic growth using the Tapio decoupling index. Our findings for the 36 cities over the 15-year period include: (1) Heilongjiang shows low emissions with a downward trend; Jilin shows overall improvement; Liaoning has high and steadily increasing emissions. (2) The global spatial autocorrelation of energy carbon emissions is significant, with a positive Moran’s I, while significant local Moran’s I clusters are concentrated in Heilongjiang and Liaoning. (3) The SDE shows the greatest changes in city-scale emissions occurred in 2015, followed by 2019, 2005, and 2010. (4) Emission growth across the 36 cities is fastest in Heilongjiang, followed by Liaoning and Jilin. (5) Tapio decoupling analysis shows overall positive decoupling in Heilongjiang, a decline in decoupling quality in Jilin, and no significant change in Liaoning. Finally, we recommend strategies to reduce emissions from the perspectives of government, industry, and residents. This research offers a quantitative foundation for achieving dual carbon goals and supports the implementation of policies focused on energy transition and sustainable urban planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"149786d62d4f2700ea111d6fb79ec8d68ffb8edada969234b3fb93678faba619","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
