{"title":"Energy Efficiency Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1808/v2","date":1719480936000,"content":"This article continues research efforts on performance and energy efficiency of intelligent algorithms and its role for green and sustainable computing. The introduction focusses on Bremermann's Limit and its effect on extensive approach for improvement of computers performance. The article aims to identify role of Intelligent Algorithms energy efficiency, how it differs from general software energy efficiency. An improved empirical investigation on heuristic methods for search and optimisation illustrates algorithms' energy efficiency. Experimental results and consideration of further work conclude the article.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38491ffd5cc9e46b650d27497b1b1d7d2f75d643f0b63dc0219424aaee73ebda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
