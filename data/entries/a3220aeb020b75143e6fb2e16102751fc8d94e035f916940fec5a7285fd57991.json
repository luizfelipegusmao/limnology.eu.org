{"title":"Gossypol Inhibits Metastasis of Lung Cell Carcinoma by Reversing Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition and Suppressing Proteases Activity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24363?af=R","date":1729043194000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Gossypol, a natural polyphenolic compound, possesses antivirus activity and induces cell death of different types of tumors. However, the efficacy of gossypol on lung carcinoma metastases and epithelial to mesenchymal transition remains unknown. The aim of the present work was to determine the cellular and molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer and anti-metastatic efficacies of gossypol on human lung carcinoma cells. Gossypol showed a marked suppression of the viability, motility, and invasion in H1299 and A549 cells. Zymography assay showed that gossypol was sufficient to suppress the activities of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase-2. Gossypol reversed TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Gossypol reduced vimentin, p-FAK, p-Src and p-paxillin. In vivo studies of gossypol were performed using subcutaneous inoculation and tail vein injection of A549 into immunodeficient BALB/c nude mice and severe combined immunodeficient mice.</p>","author":"Yih‐Shou Hsieh, \nChing‐Han Yu, \nShu‐Chen Chu, \nChin‐Yin Lin, \nPei‐Ni Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"a3220aeb020b75143e6fb2e16102751fc8d94e035f916940fec5a7285fd57991","category":"Environment"}
