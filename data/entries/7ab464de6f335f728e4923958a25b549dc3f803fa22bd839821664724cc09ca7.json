{"title":"Stress response membrane protein OsSMP2 negatively regulates rice tolerance to drought","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3300/7623332?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In a gene chip analysis, rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) <span>OsSMP2</span> gene expression was induced under various abiotic stresses, prompting an investigation into its role in drought resistance and abscisic acid signaling. Subsequent experiments, including qRT–PCR and β-glucuronidase activity detection, affirmed the <span>OsSMP2</span> gene’s predominant induction by drought stress. Subcellular localization experiments indicated the OsSMP2 protein primarily localizes to the cell membrane system. Overexpressing <span>OsSMP2</span> increased sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid, reducing drought resistance and leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation under drought stress. Conversely, in simulated drought experiments, <span>OsSMP2</span>-silenced transgenic plants showed significantly longer roots compared with the wild-type Nipponbare. These results suggest that <span>OsSMP2</span> overexpression negatively affects rice drought resistance, offering valuable insights into molecular mechanisms, and highlight <span>OsSMP2</span> as a potential target for enhancing crop resilience to drought stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7ab464de6f335f728e4923958a25b549dc3f803fa22bd839821664724cc09ca7","category":"Environment"}
