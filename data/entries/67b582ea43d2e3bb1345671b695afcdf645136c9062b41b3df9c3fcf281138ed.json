{"title":"The Genomic Variation in Textured Hair: Implications in Developing a Holistic Hair Care Routine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1218/v1","date":1721048740000,"content":"Human hair is characterised by significant variability, determined by genetic and macromolecular factors. Whilst European hair type has been a focus of extensive research, Afro-textured hair care faces challenges created by insufficient knowledge of its unique properties. Applications of hair care products that are incompatible with Afro-textured hair frequently have detrimental effects on the scalp, including alopecia. This highlights the need for scientific and clinical partnerships to bridge the gap between research and hair care practices and address challenges related to Afro-textured hair. In this review, we performed data mining of the existing literature and in-silico network analysis of the biomarkers relevant to Afro-textured hair. The approaches to hair maintenance are highlighted in the context of hair anatomy and growth cycles, organisation of keratins, surface lipids and chemical bonds. We discuss a range of biomarkers affecting hair fibre's shape and mechanical strength, with the gene interactive network pointing to the hierarchical organisation of important traits, notably hair shaft diameter, keratinisation, hair follicle development and patterning. We propose a better understanding of the genetic traits, molecular structure and biomechanics of Afro-textured hair is required to initiate more effective hair care solutions that would benefit the wider population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67b582ea43d2e3bb1345671b695afcdf645136c9062b41b3df9c3fcf281138ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
