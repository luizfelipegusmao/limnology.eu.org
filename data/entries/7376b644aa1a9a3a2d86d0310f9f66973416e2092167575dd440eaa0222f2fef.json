{"title":"Architectural Design Studio Works Exploring Archetype based on Ecological Sensibilities from Experiencing Najdi Architecture of At-Turaif town and Modern Riyadh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0845/v1","date":1728632604000,"content":"The numbness to human loss becomes ordinary. Indifference to human affairs seems normal after experiencing the global lockdown. Bringing up empathy becomes the most challenging task in architectural design studiosÂ after COVID pandemic. Examining otherness solidified after global pandemic would be a way to revive the empathy to engage more in architecture design studios. The physiological disparity between the modern and the vernacular environments narrows down with the revival of Najd architecture, Salmani architecture style and Diriyah Gate Project in Riyadh, KSA. The disparity is caused by intangible factors such as speed and density, but the revival focuses heavily on the tangible, formal expression. The architectural elements in the vernacular, Najd architecture, have different meanings and roles more than being a decorative motif. The feeble values of the vernacular undermined by touristic images are challenged by a series of radical design projects not to be generalized again by picturesque replicas of the past. Seeing the lost, the ecological sensibility of a community or collective will that embraced the harshest land with full respect, might not be visual but radically experiential like a serendipitous breeze in Riyadh. This paper introduces a series of studio works that challenged how to bring back the living structure in the harshest environment to daily lives through experimental and speculative design processes. It proposes how a community is called onto guard the environmental landscape again defying the visual interpretation of Najd architecture in the political landscape dominated by high fence walls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7376b644aa1a9a3a2d86d0310f9f66973416e2092167575dd440eaa0222f2fef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
