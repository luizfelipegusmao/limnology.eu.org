{"title":"THE INDUS SCRIPT: Recognition as an Alphabet","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1144/v1","date":1721032229000,"content":"This paper introduces a ground-breaking approach to deciphering the Indus script, employed by the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) from c. 3300 to 1900 BCE. Moving beyond previous methods, my research delves into the intricate structure of the script's signs, aiming to definitively settle the debate regarding its categorization. Specifically, I investigate whether the Indus script functions as an alphabet, presenting compelling evidence for the number of primary signs it comprises. My methodology meticulously examines over 400 signs, encompassing the entire corpus rather than relying on limited samples. This holistic approach utilizes a novel grid-based decomposition technique to visually dissect compound signs, identify diacritics with consistent usage patterns, and uncover the underlying principles of sign extraction. Through this rigorous analysis, I successfully isolate the essential primary signs and illuminate their potential phonetic representations within an alphabetic system. However, I acknowledge the intricate variations in writing styles present across the Indus corpus. These stylistic subtleties, encompassing formation, composition, and combination strategies, contribute to the apparent plurality of signs. Nonetheless, my findings reveal a core set of only 40 fundamental signs, suggesting a remarkably concise system beneath the surface complexity. By presenting this new paradigm for understanding the Indus script, I pave the way for further advances in its decipherment. Continued exploration of the identified core signs and their phonetic associations holds immense potential for unlocking the linguistic insights encoded within this enigmatic script, shedding light on a crucial chapter in human history.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9397dacbbd02f1232c6c26b6f4b7fd4afe744d7e2c60762f3fdf3bb341198495","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
