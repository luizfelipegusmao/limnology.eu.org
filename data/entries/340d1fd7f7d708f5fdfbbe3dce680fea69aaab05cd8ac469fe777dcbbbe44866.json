This study focuses on developing an eco-friendly and cost-effective biochar-zeolite composite (BZC) adsorbent using waste materials—spent coffee ground biochar (CGB) and steel slag zeolite (SSZ). Initially, the biochar was prepared from spent coffee ground, and zeolite was prepared from steel slag; their co-pyrolysis resulted in novel adsorbent material. Later, the physicochemical characteristics of the BZC were examined, which showed irregular structure and well-defined pores. Dye removal studies were conducted, which indicate that BZC adsorption reach equilibrium in 2 h, exhibiting 95% removal efficiency compared to biochar (43.33%) and zeolite (74.58%). Moreover, the removal efficiencies of the novel BZC composite toward dyes methyl orange (MO) and crystal violet (CV) were found to be 97% and 99.53%, respectively. The kinetic studies performed with the dyes and phosphate with an adsorbent dosage of 0.5 g L<sup>−1</sup> suggest a pseudo-second-order model. Additionally, the reusability study of BZC proves to be effective through multiple adsorption and regeneration cycles. Initially, the phosphate removal remains high but eventually decreases from 92% to 70% in the third regeneration cycle, highlighting the robustness of the BZC. In conclusion, this study introduces a promising, cost-effective novel BZC adsorbent derived from waste materials as a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment. Emphasizing efficiency, reusability, and potential contributions to environmentally conscious water treatment, the findings highlight the composite's significance in addressing key challenges for the removal of toxic pollutants from the aqueous solutions.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nA novel biochar-zeolite composite (BZC) material has been synthesized.\nExcellent removal of dyes by BZC (~95%) was achieved as compared to their counterparts\nThe kinetic studies performed suggest a pseudo-second-order model.\nBZC proves to be highly effective for multiple adsorption studies.\nExcellent reusability showed potential as a robust adsorbent\n</p>","author":"Shazia Noorin, \nTanushree Paul, \nArnab Ghosh, \nJurng‐Jae Yee, \nSung Hyuk Park","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"340d1fd7f7d708f5fdfbbe3dce680fea69aaab05cd8ac469fe777dcbbbe44866","category":"Environment"}
