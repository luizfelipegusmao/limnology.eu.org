Many of these HE-BMGs, including Pd<sub>20</sub>Pt<sub>20</sub>Ni<sub>20</sub>Cu<sub>20</sub>P<sub>20</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.668-B1\">1</a>] and Ti<sub>20</sub>Zr<sub>20</sub>Cu<sub>20</sub>Ni<sub>20</sub>Be<sub>20</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.668-B2\">2</a>], showed superior properties, such as higher glass-forming ability and yield strength, as compared to their conventional BMG counterparts. While these effects are typically attributed to high entropy, the actual effects of configurational entropy on the BMG’s properties have been largely unexplored. A more detailed study on the configurational entropy was performed on CuZr-based HE-BMGs [<a href=\"#ozae044.668-B3\">3</a>], where the equiatomic binary Cu<sub>50</sub>Zr<sub>50</sub> was systematically expanded to denary (CuNiBeCoFe)<sub>50</sub>(ZrTiHfTaNb)<sub>50</sub> HE-BMG while minimizing the eﬀect of the atomic size diﬀerence and enthalpy of mixing among the atoms. The results showed that there is a linear change in the mechanical properties measured by nanoindentation (e.g., hardness, (Fig. 1b), while glass-forming ability was at its maximum at the intermediate composition (CuNiBe)<sub>50</sub>(ZrTiHf)<sub>50</sub> (Fig. 1a) [<a href=\"#ozae044.668-B3\">3</a>], suggesting a complex relationship between the configuration entropy and the properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c8226b5829a52bf9d67ba37369edd743ead6d86e8afb48e308ede92ef6b8075","category":"Environment"}
