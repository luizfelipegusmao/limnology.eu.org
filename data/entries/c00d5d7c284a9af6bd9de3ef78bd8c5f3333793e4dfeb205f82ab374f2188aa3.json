{"title":"Data-Aided Sensing for Semantic Communication: A Brief Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0520/v1","date":1725842397000,"content":"Recent advancements in semantic communication (SC) have shown the potential to surpass the limitations of the Shannon theorem, by leveraging an understanding of the meaning of data instead of the data itself. In networks, data-aided sensing (DAS) presents a powerful tool that can significantly reduce communication overhead, aligning perfectly with the goals of SC by providing more powerful semantic messages. This survey explores the synergy between DAS and SC and investigates how their convergence can lead to more efficient and effective communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c00d5d7c284a9af6bd9de3ef78bd8c5f3333793e4dfeb205f82ab374f2188aa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
