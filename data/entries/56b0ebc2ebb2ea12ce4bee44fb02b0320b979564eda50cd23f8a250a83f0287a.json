{"title":"78 Estimates of genetic parameters for weight, wool, and carcass traits of Rambouillet sheep","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/44/7664770?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Rambouillet sheep breed is the foundation to most western range sheep in the U.S. Through the National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP), Rambouillet breeders seek to improve economically relevant traits. However, the parameters used in the NSIP genetic evaluation were last estimated two decades ago. Our aim was to re-estimate genetic parameters for body weight (BW), carcass, and wool traits. Data were provided by NSIP, which included BW at birth (BWT; n = 28,817), weaning [WWT; n = 5,633; age: 68 (SD 16) day], early post-weaning [PWTE; n = 23,303; 128 (SD 22) d], late post-weaning [PWTL; n = 7,689; 201 (SD 45) d] and as yearlings [YWT; n = 5,830; 375 (SD 33) d]. Yearling ultrasound scans of 12<sup>th</sup> rib backfat depth (YCF; n = 2,447) and eye muscle depth (YEMD; n = 2,457) were also available. Yearling wool traits were fiber curvature (YFC; n = 6,009), fiber diameter (YFD; n = 9,880), fiber diameter coefficient of variation (YFDCV; n = 8,803), greasy fleece weight (YGFW; n = 11,859) and staple length (YSL; n = 11,270). The pedigree consisted of 36,297 individuals. Animals with phenotypic records were progeny of 333 sires and 1,727 dams. A succession of univariate animal models was fitted. The most comprehensive model included direct and maternal additive genetic effects, their genetic covariance, and maternal permanent environmental and residual effects. Phenotypes were pre-adjusted for birth-rearing type category and, as covariates, dam age and age at recording. Contemporary group—a concatenation of flock, year, season, management group, sex, and, excluding BWT, recording date—was the only fixed effect fitted in the model. Model selection was based on the log-likelihood ratio test, and Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. The data structure, namely dams and their daughters and granddaughters contributing data, allowed reliable testing of the maternal effect terms. The direct-maternal genetic covariance did not explain variation for any trait (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.18). The most parsimonious model for BW traits included direct and maternal additive genetic, and maternal permanent environmental, effects. For carcass and wool traits, only direct additive genetic effects were included in the final model. Such was unsurprising, as maternal effects often diminish as animals age. For the final models fitted (Table 1), direct heritabilities (± SE) for body weights ranged from 0.14 ± 0.01 (BWT) to 0.38 ± 0.04 (PWTL); the maternal heritabilities ranged from 0.04 ± 0.02 (PWTL; YWT) to 0.13 ± 0.01 (BWT). For carcass traits, direct heritabilities were 0.13 ± 0.04 (YCF) and 0.31 ± 0.05 (YEMD). For wool traits, they ranged from 0.37 ± 0.02 (YSL) to 0.58 ± 0.02 (YFD). These re-estimated parameter values are consistent with those used by NSIP, with the exception of PWTL (greater) and YSL (lower). With genomic data accumulating in Rambouillet, further refinements in parameter estimation are planned.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"56b0ebc2ebb2ea12ce4bee44fb02b0320b979564eda50cd23f8a250a83f0287a","category":"Environment"}
