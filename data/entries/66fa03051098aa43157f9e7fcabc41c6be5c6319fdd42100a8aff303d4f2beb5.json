{"title":"A Comparative Study for Using Deep LSTMs and ARIMA for Imputing Missing Data for Wind Data in the Irish Sea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1179/v1","date":1716280440000,"content":"Achieving Net Zero emissions target is driving up the need for offshore wind as an alternate energy source. Ireland has the capacity to produce upwards of 30GWof power through offshore wind alone. Wind resource assessments are extremely vital in determining the long term trends of a site. The instruments used for this often suffer breakdowns or miss readings which impacts the long term trend analysis. Wind time series data from Ireland’s Marine Institute is used which is shown to have significant gaps in it’s 20 years of service. Data imputation is necessary to fill in these gaps as accurately as possible. This paper compares LSTMs and ARIMA as two competing methodologies for data imputation. LSTMs are shown to be marginally superior to ARIMA imputation with a mean squared error of 0.45 compared to that of ARIMA of 0.60.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66fa03051098aa43157f9e7fcabc41c6be5c6319fdd42100a8aff303d4f2beb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
