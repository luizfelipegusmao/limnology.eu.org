{"title":"Evalution of the efficiency of using an oxidizer in the leaching process of gold-containing concentrate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1805/v1","date":1711702290000,"content":"The article presents the results of cyanide leaching of gold-containing concentrate using the trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) oxidizer. Gold-containing concentrate obtained from a gold tailings sample from a gold recovery factory (GRF) in one of the deposits of Kazakhstan that was not previously studied for concentrability. According to X-ray phase analysis and energy dispersive spectrometry (DSM) data, the main compounds in the tailings sample under study are: pyrite FeS2, quartz SiO2, calcite CaCO3, albite NaAlSi3O8, muscovite KAl2Si3AlO10(OH)8, dolomite CaMg(CO3)2, and oxidized iron compounds. Microscopic studies have established the presence of gold grains in free form, ranging in size from 0.9-10.2 mkm Au-ultrafine and fine gold. Obtaining a gold-containg concentrate with a gold content of 15.95 g / t is possible according to the enrichment scheme, which includes centrifugal separation, classification according to the fineness class -0.05 mm, additional grinding of hydrocyclone sands to a fineness of 90.0-95.0% of the class finer than 0.050 mm, and control centrifugal separation. Since pyrite in technogenic raw materials is the main gold-containing mineral, this paper presents studies on the oxidizability of pyrite with the TCCA oxidizer. The results of studies on the oxidation of pyrite using the TCCA oxidizer show that the products of its hydrolysis oxidize pyrite with the formation of various iron compounds on its surface. Pretreatment of gold-containing concentrate with oxidizer TCCA for 3 hours before the cyanidation process (20 hours) allows to increase the recovery of gold in the solution by 5.8 %.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17d0f6abd53df70d66e2f19513f0e33beb730c9b0e654bf1187594d61edf4c14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
