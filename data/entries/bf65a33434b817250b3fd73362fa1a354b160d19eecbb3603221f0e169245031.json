{"title":"Co‐encapsulation of curcumin and anthocyanins in bovine serum album–fucoidan nanocomplex with a two‐step pH‐driven method","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13201?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Curcumin (CUR) and anthocyanins (ACN) are recommended due to their bioactivities. However, their nutritional values and health benefits are limited by their low oral bioavailability. The incorporation of bioactive substances into polysaccharide–protein composite nanoparticles is an effective way to enhance their bioavailability. Accordingly, this study explored the fabrication of bovine serum albumin (BSA)–fucoidan (FUC) hybrid nanoparticles using a two-step pH-driven method for the delivery of CUR and ACN.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Under a 1:1 weight ratio of BSA to FUC, the point of zero charge moved from pH ⁓ 4.7 for BSA to around 2.5 for FUC-coated BSA, and the formation of BSA–FUC nanocomplex was pH-dependent by showing the maximum CUR emission wavelength shifting from 546 nm (CUR-loaded BSA–FUC at pH 4.7) and 544 nm (CUR/ACN-loaded BSA–FUC nanoparticles at pH 4.7) to 540 nm (CUR-loaded BSA–FUC at pH 6.0) and 539 nm (CUR/ACN-loaded BSA–FUC nanoparticles at pH 6.0). Elevated concentrations of NaCl from 0 to 2.5 mol L<sup>−1</sup> caused particle size increase from about 250 to about 800 nm, but showing no effect on the encapsulation efficiency of CUR. The CUR and ACN entrapped, respectively, in the inner and outer regions of the BSA–FUC nanocomplex were released at different rates. After incubation for 10 h, more than 80% of ACN was released, while less than 25% of CUR diffused into the receiving medium, which fitted well to Logistic and Weibull models.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In summary, the BSA–FUC nanocomposites produced by a two-step pH-driven method could be used for the co-delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic nutraceuticals. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiao Chen, \nHao Qin, \nJia‐Ming Zhai, \nJun‐Hu Wang, \nYu‐He Zhang, \nYang Chen, \nYan‐Chao Wu, \nHui‐Jing Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"bf65a33434b817250b3fd73362fa1a354b160d19eecbb3603221f0e169245031","category":"Environment"}
