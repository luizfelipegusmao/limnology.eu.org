One of the most widely used methods for synthesizing SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles is the St√∂ber method, developed in 1968 [<a href=\"#ozae044.627-B1\">1</a>]. This method involves the hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in a solution of ethanol and ammoniacal water. The reactions can be carefully controlled to produce monodisperse nanoparticles with tunable sizes between 50-2000 nm. The importance of the synthesis method is reflected in the various properties that these particles can acquire. These different synthesis routes (thermal, sol-gel, precipitation, etc.) provide us with the necessary variants for the diverse biomedical applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.627-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7a5351342f666b913ad024b0986356b8ab99f5cd77952d85ffe8076e8bbd80b2","category":"Environment"}
