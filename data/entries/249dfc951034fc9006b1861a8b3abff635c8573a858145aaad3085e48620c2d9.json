{"title":"Vitamin D&rsquo;s Essential Role from Natural Sources in Preventing Rhinosinusitis, Nasopharyngitis, and Otitis Media: Ensuring Optimal Care in Patients with Behavioral Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1929/v1","date":1727230684000,"content":"Background/Objective: Adequate serum vitamin D levels are essential for overall health, particularly in preventing oropharyngeal infections. This study aims to explore the relationship between serum vitamin D (25(OH)D3) levels and the prevalence of oropharyngeal diseases—specifically rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and nasopharyngitis—in patients at a private specialist medical clinic. Materials and Methods: The study involved 311 patients with an average age of 15.96±15.06 years. Statistical analyses, including Student's t-test and chi-square test, were conducted to evaluate the significance of the findings. Results: Nasopharyngitis was highly prevalent, affecting 83.27% of participants, with higher recurrence rates in those with lower vitamin D levels (p=0.001). Otitis media was present in 53.37% of cases, while rhinosinusitis was less common and more frequently associated with higher vitamin D levels. Patients with behavioral disorders had significantly higher mean vitamin D levels (34.82 ng/mL ±11.85) compared to those without (28.49 ng/mL ±14.37) (p=0.001). Conclusion: Lower serum vitamin D levels are associated with an increased incidence of oropharyngeal diseases. This study highlights the importance of maintaining optimal vitamin D levels for pediatric health and suggests that higher vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of oropharyngeal infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"249dfc951034fc9006b1861a8b3abff635c8573a858145aaad3085e48620c2d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
