{"title":"Off the beaten pathway: Powering carbon capture with alternative photosynthetic electron transfer pathways","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/3899/7681912?rss=1","date":1716508800000,"content":"<span>During photosynthesis, light drives the formation of NADPH by powering a linear electron flow (LEF) from water, through PSII and I, to NADP. Additionally, LEF generates a proton motive force (<span>pmf</span>) across the thylakoid membrane, which is utilized to generate ATP. However, LEF is insufficient for providing the ATP requirements for various metabolic processes, including carbon fixation in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Alternative electron pathways may provide the additional required energy (<a href=\"#koae155-B1\">Allen 2003</a>). During cyclic electron flow (CEF), electrons are recycled around PSI (<a href=\"#koae155-B4\">Nawrocki et al. 2019</a>). In pseudo-CEF (PCEF), electrons are ejected from the photosynthetic electron chain by reducing O<sub>2</sub> on the PSI acceptor side (<a href=\"#koae155-B3\">Chaux et al. 2017</a>). Both pathways promote <span>pmf</span> generation and ATP production (<a href=\"#koae155-F1\">Fig. 1</a>). Transferring reductants from the chloroplast to the mitochondria, where they are converted to ATP in the respiratory chain and shuttled back to the chloroplast, may also provide additional ATP for carbon fixation (<a href=\"#koae155-B6\">Raghavendra and Padmasree 2003</a>). This process is termed chloroplast to mitochondria electron flow (CMEF; <a href=\"#koae155-F1\">Fig. 1</a>). Although the mechanisms of alternative photosynthetic electron flows were described, the importance of each pathway for carbon fixation remains elusive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"16544dc3dac2e280371d6df79fe553206dc4765bd4157cb6e5ab6ccea4185970","category":"Environment"}
