{"title":"Mechanisms of Male Reproductive Sterility Triggered by Dysbiosis of Intestinal Microorganisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1553/v1","date":1714051032000,"content":"The intestinal microbiota, comprised of bacteria, archaea, and phages, inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of the organism. Male reproductive sterility is currently a prominent topic in medical research. Increasing research suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis can result in various reproductive health problems. This article specifically investigates the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on male reproductive infertility development. Gut microbiota imbalances can disrupt the immune system and immune cell metabolism, affecting testicular growth and sperm production. This dysfunction can compromise the levels of hormones produced and secreted by the endocrine glands, affecting male reproductive health. Furthermore, imbalance of the gut microbiota can disrupt the gut-brain-reproductive axis, resulting in male reproductive infertility. This article will explore how the imbalance of the gut microbiota impacts male reproductive infertility through immune regulation, endocrine regulation, and interactions of the gut-brain-reproductive axis, concluding with recommendations for prevention and treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92f5fc4f4989119df8862a6ab35607036b893b3bc32af36da8d9c01260e17f4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
