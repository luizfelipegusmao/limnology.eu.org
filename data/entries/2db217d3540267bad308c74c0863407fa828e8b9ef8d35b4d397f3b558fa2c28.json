{"title":"The Role of HLA Class I Genes in Genital HPV Pathogenesis in African Women: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0469/v1","date":1720155450000,"content":"Most cervical cancer cases are a result of persistent high-risk Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Cervical cancer is prevalent in LMICs especially in SSA where it is second most prevalent cancer. In South Africa, it is the second most common cancer affecting women aged between 15 and 44 years. The host immune response has been shown as an important factor in controlling the progression or regression of high-risk HPV infection of the cervix to cervical cancer. The risk of cervical cancer is known to be influenced by the host's genetic diversity, particularly by immune response-regulating genes such as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I and II genes. HLA class I genes present viral peptides to CD8+ T cells which are restricted and pre-programmed for cytotoxic functions. There is very little known about the HLA genes of South African women and how these influence outcome of HPV infections. This review aims to understand the role and influence of HLA class I genes in HPV clearance,  persistence, and CD8+ T cell mediated immunity in African women by examining existing literature in this area. Understanding this role can  influence and inform therapeutic vaccine design that is population specific.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2db217d3540267bad308c74c0863407fa828e8b9ef8d35b4d397f3b558fa2c28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
