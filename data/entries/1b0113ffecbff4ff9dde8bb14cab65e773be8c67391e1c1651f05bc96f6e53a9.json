Carlsson, Lars B. Dahlin, Erika Nyman</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Pain in conjunction with surgery for ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow is seldom highlighted in the literature. This study aimed to explore patients’ experiences of living with chronic pain (≥3 months duration) in conjunction with surgery for ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow, the consequences and the coping strategies applied.</p> Material and methods <p>In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 participants aged 18–60 years. The narratives were analyzed using an inductive approach and content-analysis.</p> Results <p>The analysis revealed seven main categories: “<i>Physical symptoms/impairments</i>” and “<i>Mood and emotions</i>”comprise symptoms caused by ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow and chronic pain; “<i>Consequences in daily life</i>” includes challenges and obstacles in every-day life, impact on leisure activities and social life; “<i>Struggling with self-image</i>” embraces experiences closely related to identity; “<i>Coping strategies</i>” covers adaptive resources; “<i>Experience of relief</i> “describes perceived improvements; “<i>Key message for future care</i>” comprises important aspects for healthcare providers to consider.</p> Conclusions <p>The results clarify the need for healthcare personnel to adopt a biopsychosocial approach when treating patients with ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. Emotional symptoms and sleep disturbances should be identified and treated properly since they contribute to the heavy burden experienced by the individual.</p>","author":"Alice Giöstad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1b0113ffecbff4ff9dde8bb14cab65e773be8c67391e1c1651f05bc96f6e53a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
