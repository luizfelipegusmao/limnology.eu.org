{"title":"From Mechanical Machining Technology: A New Solution that Integrates Blades to the Implant to Control the Stress to the Peri-Implant Cortical Bone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1751/v1","date":1727089023000,"content":"Background: To prevent excessive compression of the cortical layer, which can lead to marginal bone loss, various companies have introduced specialized drills. However, these drills often lack the necessary precision, as the operatorâ€™s hand may not be stable enough to prevent ovalization and over-widening, nor precise enough to maintain coaxial alignment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a device capable of achieving calibrated cortical preparation in terms of both dimension and coaxiality. Methods: A machining technology based on drilling principles was employed to create the device. Results: Nine blades were incorporated between the transmucosal neck and the implant threads, enabling the blades to cut the cortical bone coaxially during the implant insertion process. Conclusions: The implant with integrated blades was engineered to facilitate precise cortical bone preparation, ensuring both accurate dimensions and coaxial alignment. This ensures that the radial compressive stresses transmitted from the implant to the peri-implant bone during surgery can be precisely controlled. The experimental study outcomes discussed in this article validate the effectiveness of the implant design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce9fd09256efffad7f07c87e7490407e798c8c7d62352732af5ac1190d5c8ad7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
