{"title":"Characterization of Postbiotics Derived from Bifidobacterium bifidum Strains and Influence of Postbiotic-Enriched Alginate Coating on Microbial and Physicochemical Quality of Turkey Breast Meat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0814/v2","date":1718273207000,"content":"Postbiotics are metabolites, cell components, and other bioactive molecules produced during the fermentation process by beneficial microorganisms such as probiotics. They can exhibit various biological activities, including immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. This study aimed to explore the in vitro antioxidant activity of postbiotics derived from Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20456 and B.bifidum BB12 strains, and to evaluate the effects of postbiotic-enriched alginate coatings on the microbial and physicochemical quality of turkey breast meat stored at refrigerator temperature for 7 days. Hence, the antimicrobial properties, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and 1,1-difenil-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) of the postbiotics were determined. The results revealed that the TPC (87.13 ± 2.24-90.89 ± 1.63 mg GAE/100 mL), TFC (18.83 ± 2.21-24.20 ± 0.25 mg CE/ 100 mL), and DPPH (50.28 ± 0.20-51.56 ± 1.63 mg TEAC/100 mL) values of the tested postbiotics exhibited potential antioxidant capacity. The analysis results indicated that alginate coating with postbiotics caused significant differences in pH, b* (yellowness), and yeast/mold values of turkey meat during storage (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The yeast and mold values increased significantly, while the pH and b* values of the samples (except for the control and bb groups) decreased during storage (p &amp;lt; 0.05). On day 7, the abundance of yeast and mold in the bb group was 1.2 log CFU/g lower than in the control group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, L* (brightness), a* (redness), lipid oxidation, total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, psychrotrophic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes counts were not affected for 7 days (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium postbiotic treatment did not adversely affect the microbiological and physicochemical properties of turkey breast meats. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that postbiotic-enriched alginate coatings may be a practical solution for the meat industry to improve and maintain the quality features of poultry meat products during storage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"068f08136d6f1579238b2c36c057d26a8304efb557189e6f51e68111ef4b05b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
