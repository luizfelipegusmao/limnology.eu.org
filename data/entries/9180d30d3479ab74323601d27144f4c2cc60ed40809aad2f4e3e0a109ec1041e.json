{"title":"Effect of light on ascorbic acid biosynthesis and bioinformatics analysis of related genes in Chinese chives","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307527","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Yuxuan Qian, Jing Tong, Ning Liu, Baoju Wang, Yanhai Ji, Zhanhui Wu</p>\r\n\r\nAscorbic acid (AsA) is an essential nutritional component and powerful antioxidant in vegetables, and in plants, AsA levels are regulated by light. AsA levels in the leaves of Chinese chive (<i>Allium tuberosum</i> Rottler ex Spr), a popular vegetable, are poorly understood. Thus, this study was performed to assess the influence of light on AsA biosynthesis in chive and select related genes (<i>AtuGGP1</i> and <i>AtuGME1</i>); in addition, bioinformatic analyses and gene expression level assays were performed. The biological information obtained for <i>AtuGGP1</i> and <i>AtuGME1</i> was analysed with several tools, including NCBI, DNAMAN, and MEGA11. After different light treatments were performed, the Chive AsA content and <i>AtuGGP1</i> and <i>AtuGME1</i> expression levels were determined. These results suggest that 1) compared with natural light, continuous darkness inhibited AsA synthesis in chives. 2) The amino acid sequences of <i>AtuGGP1</i> and <i>AtuGME1</i> are very similar to those of other plants. 3) The trends observed for the expression levels of <i>AtuGGP1</i> and <i>AtuGME1</i> were consistent with the AsA content observed in chives. Hence, we speculated that light controls AsA biosynthesis in chives by regulating <i>AtuGGP1</i> and <i>AtuGME1</i> expression. This study provided impactful and informative evidence regarding the functions of GGP and GME in chives.","author":"Yuxuan Qian","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9180d30d3479ab74323601d27144f4c2cc60ed40809aad2f4e3e0a109ec1041e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
