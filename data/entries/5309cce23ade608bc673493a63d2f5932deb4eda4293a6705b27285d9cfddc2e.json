{"title":"Evaluation and Optimization of a Decentralized Incineration Facility for Animal By-Products: Performance, Cost Analysis, and Resource Recovery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2259/v1","date":1722232232000,"content":"In this study, a decentralized incineration facility was evaluated over a three-year period, focusing on performance aspects such as burning rate, ash production, fuel and electricity consumption, and ash composition while processing animal by-products (ABP). The total cost for ABP incineration was determined to be 159 â‚¬ per ton of ABP, with the major components being capital depreciation (42%), maintenance expenditures (26%), labor (18%), and transportation costs (9%). Liquified petroleum gas (LPG) consumption ranged from 3-7 kg per ton of ABP, while electricity use was between 15-20 kWh per ton of ABP incinerated. The incineration process generated 7-10% (by weight) ABP ash, which was characterized by high calcium and phosphorus content and low levels of hazardous trace elements. Leaching tests demonstrated the potential for recovering the alkaline supernatant for flue gas treatment and the phosphorus-rich slurry for fertilizer production. The findings suggest that energy recovery and valorization are crucial for minimizing operational costs and environmental impact, emphasizing the benefits of integrating advanced resource recovery techniques in ABP incineration facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5309cce23ade608bc673493a63d2f5932deb4eda4293a6705b27285d9cfddc2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
