One of the strengths of a modern S/TEM is the ability to subject the sample to various conditions <span>in situ</span> using specialized sample holders [<a href=\"#ozae044.628-B1\">1</a>]. However, some experiments require conditions which cannot be produced via off-the-shelf solutions, and many exciting applications are identified after the initial purchases have been made resulting in equipment that is not suitable for the desired experiments. The combination of these factors often necessitates modification of the microscope or holders, which is generally a time-consuming and expensive process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eca3e4a0d062b9cf16b53017eebf82f893aec0a2c2a5200970233ae79dfd2307","category":"Environment"}
