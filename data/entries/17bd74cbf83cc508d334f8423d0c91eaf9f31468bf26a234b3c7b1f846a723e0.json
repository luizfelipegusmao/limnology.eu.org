{"title":"Emerging issues in fisheries science by fisheries scientists","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15683?af=R","date":1724066766000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The current epoch in fisheries science has been driven by continual advances in laboratory techniques and  increasingly sophisticated approaches to analysing datasets. We now have the scientific knowledge and tools to proactively identify obstacles to the sustainable management of marine resources. However, in addition to technological advances, there are predicted global environmental changes, each with inherent implications for fisheries. The 2023 symposium of the Fisheries Society of the British Isles called for “open and constructive knowledge exchange between scientists, stakeholders, managers and policymakers” (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fsbi.org.uk/symposium-2023/\">https://fsbi.org.uk/symposium-2023/</a>), a nexus of collaborative groups best placed to identify issues and solutions. Arguably, the Centre of Environment, Aquaculture and Fisheries Science (Cefas) and their Scientific Advice for Fisheries Management (SAFM) Team sit at the centre of such a network. SAFM regularly engages with managers and stakeholders, undertakes scientific research, provides fisheries advice to the UK government, and are leading experts within the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). As such, this paper is an opinion piece, linked to individual authors specialisms, that aims to highlight emerging issues affecting fisheries and suggest where research efforts could be focused that contribute to sustainable fisheries.</p>","author":"David S.
