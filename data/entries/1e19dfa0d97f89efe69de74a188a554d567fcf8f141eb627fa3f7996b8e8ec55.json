{"title":"Microscopy of Woven and Nonwoven Face Covering Materials: Implications for Particle Filtration","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/1/27/7584953?rss=1","date":1705881600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A suite of natural, synthetic, and mixed synthetic-natural woven fabrics, along with nonwoven filtration layers from a surgical mask and an N95 respirator, was examined using visible light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and micro-X-ray computed tomography (<span>µ</span>XCT) to determine the fiber diameter distribution, fabric thickness, and the volume of solid space of the fabrics. Nonwoven materials exhibit a positively skewed distribution of fiber diameters with a mean value of ≈3 <span>μ</span>m, whereas woven fabrics exhibit a normal distribution of diameters with mean values roughly five times larger (&gt;15 <span>μ</span>m). The mean thickness of the N95 filtration material is 1093 <span>μ</span>m and is greater than that of the woven fabrics that span from 420 to 650 <span>μ</span>m. A new procedure for measuring the thickness of flannel fabrics is proposed that accounts for raised fibers. <span>µ</span>XCT allowed for a quantitative nondestructive approach to measure fabric porosity as well as the surface area/volume. Cotton flannel showed the largest mean isotropy of any fabric, though fiber order within the weave is poorly represented in the surface electron images. Surface fabric isotropy and surface area/volume ratios are proposed as useful microstructural quantities to consider for future particle filtration modeling efforts of woven materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1e19dfa0d97f89efe69de74a188a554d567fcf8f141eb627fa3f7996b8e8ec55","category":"Environment"}
