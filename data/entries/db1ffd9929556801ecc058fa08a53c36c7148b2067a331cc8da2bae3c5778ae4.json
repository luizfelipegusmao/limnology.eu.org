{"title":"Combining Erection Restoration and Factual Penile Enhancement Based on Revolutionary Penile Fibro-vascular Assembly","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1178/v1","date":1728983889000,"content":"Objective: Both conventional penile venous surgery for erection restoration and surgical therapy for penile augmentation have been controversial. Based on De Novo penile fibrovascular assembly, we report on innovative penile venous stripping (PVS) and factual penile girth enhancement (FPGE).\nMethods: From 2013 to 2023, 18 men underwent PVS and FPGE, all confirmed with veno-occlusive dysfunction (VOD). PVS involves stripping erection-related veins, primarily one deep dorsal vein and a pair of cavernosal veins, after ligating each emissary vein closest to the outer tunica albuginea using 6-0 nylon. FPGE was performed along the tunica albuginea bilaterally; then, the two tunic defects were repaired with a 70.0x30.0 mm venous stripe and covered with either autologous venous walls (AVW, n=10) or Surgiform (SF, n=8). The penile girth was measured, and radio-opaque contrast was used to compare intracorporeal retention. The abridged 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score and the Erection Hardness Scale (EHS) were used yearly during follow-up via the Internet.\nResults: The follow-up period was 5.3±1.5 years. Radiopacity was consistently enhanced. Although there was indifference between AVW and SF, there was a significant improvement (both P＜ 0.01) in IIEF-5 and EHS scores (9.7±2.8 vs. 20.8±2.3; 1.7±0.6 vs. 3.2±0.2, respectively). Both the diameters of the glans and penile shaft increased (28.0±2.3mm and 28.3±2.1mm vs 35.3±2.2mm and 36.3±2.1mm respectively). The satisfaction rate was 81.3% (13/16).\nConclusions: This novel combination of PVS and FPGE is promising, although further validation requires a larger sample size.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db1ffd9929556801ecc058fa08a53c36c7148b2067a331cc8da2bae3c5778ae4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
