We evaluated the effects of estuarine salinity and short-term leaf dehydration on photosynthetic (PSII) heat tolerance (<i>P</i>\n<sub>HT</sub>).\n\nIn the leaves of 12 mangrove species sampled at contrasting salinities along a 20 km estuarine salinity gradient, we measured minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (<i>F</i>\n<sub>0</sub>) with increasing leaf temperature to determine <i>T</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> (the temperature beyond which PSII is destabilized and <i>F</i>\n<sub>0</sub> rises rapidly) and <i>T</i>\n<sub>max</sub> (the temperature where <i>F</i>\n<sub>0</sub> declines rapidly with catastrophic cell membrane failure). Furthermore, to assess the impacts of leaf dehydration on <i>P</i>\n<sub>HT</sub> over short time scales, we re-measured leaves following a bench-drying dehydration treatment.\n\n<i>T</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> was ~2.51°C higher in leaves of high-salinity-distributed mangrove species, increasing by ~0.74°C per practical salinity unit (PSU, ppt) along the estuarine salinity gradient. <i>T</i>\n<sub>max</sub> was ~1.1°C higher in high-salinity-distributed species, increasing by ~0.38°C ppt<sup>−1</sup>. Following dehydration, <i>T</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> increased by ~3.4°C in low-salinity-distributed species; however, no increase in <i>T</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> was observed in high-salinity-distributed species. Following dehydration, <i>T</i>\n<sub>max</sub> increased by ~1.8°C in both low and high-salinity-distributed mangrove species.\n\nOur results illustrate that spatial gradients in salinity, and the variation in growth environments they produce, are associated with gradients in <i>P</i>\n<sub>HT</sub> across mangrove species differing in salinity tolerance and within species with broad salinity tolerances. Further, we show that variation in leaf hydration over short time scales influences <i>P</i>\n<sub>HT</sub>, with leaf dehydration improving the heat tolerance of PSII. Combined, these results highlight that both tissue and environmental water availability gradients may produce cross-tolerance in PSII, that is, increasing stability at high temperatures. Our results underscore the need for greater resolution of the interactive effects of plant water relations, hydration status and photosynthetic thermal safety across biomes and in a warming world.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/01/17/cross-tolerance-salinity-gradients-and-leaf-dehydration-increase-photosynthetic-heat-tolerance-in-mangroves/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Callum Bryant, \nRosalie J.
