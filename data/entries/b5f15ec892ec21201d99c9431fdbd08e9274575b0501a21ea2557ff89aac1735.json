{"title":"PSVI-5 Extruded blend of Nannochloropsis oculata microalgae and flaxseed and its effects on ruminal fermentation and nutrient digestion","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/340/7664781?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients for mammals, and are required for cellular growth and synthesis of numerous cellular signaling molecules. NBO3 Technologies, LLC (Manhattan, KS) has developed an omega-3 supplement consisting of an extruded blend of flaxseed and <span>Nannochloropsis oculata</span> microalgae (GreatOplus; GOP). Our objective was to evaluate effects of GOP on dry matter intake (DMI), water intake (WI), ruminal metabolism, and apparent total tract nutrient disappearance in cannulated Holstein steers (n = 11; initial body weight 586.4 ± 49.7 kg). Treatments consisted of backgrounding diets (40% roughage, 60% concentrate) containing 0% (CON) or 10% GOP (dry basis). Feed and water intake were recorded using an Insentec Roughage and Water monitoring system (Hokofarm Group; Emmeloord, The Netherlands). Steers were utilized in a cross-over design with two 19-d periods. Each period consisted of a 15-d adaptation phase and a 4-d collection phase. Ruminal contents, duodenal digesta, and feces were collected at 8-h intervals for 4 d starting at 1000 h on d 16. The sampling schedule was advanced by 2 h with each subsequent sampling day, thus generating a 24-h profile at 2-h intervals post-feeding over the 4-d sampling phase. Titanium dioxide (15 g) was dispensed directly into the rumen of each steer 15 min before feeding and to estimate apparent ruminal flow and fecal excretion of nutrients. There was a Treatment X Day interaction for DMI (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001); DMI was greater for steers fed GOP some of the days during the adaptation phase compared with steers fed the control diet, but intakes were similar during the collection phase. Ruminal fluid pH, ruminal ammonia concentration, and WI were not affected by treatment (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). As expected, ruminal outflows of total fatty acids (195.6 vs 338.1 g/d for CON and GOP, respectively) and α-linolenic acid (ALA; 1.6 vs 6.3 g/d, respectively) were greater for steers fed GOP compared with steers fed CON (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05); however, ruminal disappearance (i.e., biohydrogenation) of ALA was extensive, with only 8% and 4.7% of ALA intake exiting the rumen for CON and GOP, respectively. Apparent total tract digestion of organic matter was not impacted by diet (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20; 78.1 and 76.8% for CON and GOP, respectively). Supplementing an extruded blend of flaxseed and microalgae can effectively increase the amount of α-linolenic acid available for absorption in the small intestine, but overall recovery of dietary α-linolenic acid is relatively low due to extensive biohydrogenation by microbes within the rumen.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b5f15ec892ec21201d99c9431fdbd08e9274575b0501a21ea2557ff89aac1735","category":"Environment"}
