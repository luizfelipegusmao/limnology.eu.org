{"title":"Review of Probabilistic Modeling of Pavement Performance Using Markov Chains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1863/v1","date":1721832422000,"content":"Reliable models of pavement performance play a crucial role in effective decision-making for maintaining and rehabilitating this class of infrastructure assets. Probabilistic modeling approaches have gained popularity in pavement performance modeling because they account not only for the stochastic nature of pavement behavior and deterioration factor variations but also for the imperfections and inadequacy of pavement condition data in certain situations. One of these approaches, Markov chains, has been used extensively to model the probabilistic performance of pavements through an interesting variety of methodological tweaks in the Markov model structure. Unfortunately, the current literature lacks a synthesis of Markov chain models and their associated methodologies, as used in this manner. It is anticipated that a comprehensive synthesis of these models and their various forms can provide some insight into the variations of Markov model forms and methodologies, and the appropriate Markov model type to use for pavement deterioration and performance modeling under given conditions of data types and availability. To address this issue, this paper reviews Markov chain models used in the literature to model pavement deterioration and the methodologies used to estimate the transition probabilities matrix which is the key feature of Markov chain models. The paper presents a critical analysis of various aspects of Markov chain models as they were applied in the literature, reveals gaps in knowledge, and offers suggestions to address these gaps. The paper also develops a decision tree to select the appropriate Markov model type and TPM estimation methodology to model pavement deterioration under given conditions of data availability. This paper therefore provide guidance and decision support for researchers and highway agencies in selecting an appropriate probabilistic technique for modeling their pavement infrastructure performance in a robust manner.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e622119998246f72b9c0541e8a746e6152bc472bebd733a24913f8c34552d343","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
