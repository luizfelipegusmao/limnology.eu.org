{"title":"Evaluation of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) as a Functional Feed Ingredient on Growth Improvement, Stress Reduction, Immune Enhancement and Disease Resistance in Olive Flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) under High Stocking Density","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0062/v1","date":1711966981000,"content":"Aquaculture is an important source of food for the growing global population. To meet the increasing demand for fish, intensive aquaculture methods are commonly used. However, these methods can lead to stress and disease in fish, which can result in significant economic losses. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid that is found in the brain and central nervous system of animals as inhibitory neurotransmitter. It has been shown to have a variety of physiological functions, including stress reduction and immune enhancement. This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation of GABA on growth, serum biochemistry, innate immunity and disease resistance in juvenile olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) challenged with Edwardsiella tarda under high stocking density. A control diet and three experimental diets were prepared, with 150 mg/kg (GABA150), 200 mg/kg (GABA200), and 250 mg/kg (GABA250) of GABA added to each diet, respectively. The actual GABA content of the experimental diets was analyzed and found to be 63.9 mg/kg (CON), 231.3 mg/kg (GABA150), 291.6 mg/kg (GABA200), and 323.9 mg/kg (GABA250). Each experimental diet was fed to olive flounder with an initial weight of 12.75 g ± 0.3 g in 40 L tanks at two stocking densities: normal density (20 fish/tank) and high density (40 fish/tank). The experiment was conducted in triplicate for each diet and stocking density. The water temperature was maintained at 17.5 ± 1℃ and the salinity at 33 ± 1 ppt. After 8 weeks of feeding trial, growth, feed utilization, whole-body proximate composition, blood analysis, non-specific immune response, and challenge test were performed. There were no significant difference in weight gain and specific growth rate among the GABA concentrations and density × GABA concentration interaction groups. However, the low-density groups showed significantly higher values than the high-density groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio among all groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the whole-body general composition analysis (P &amp;gt; 0.05). In the hematological analysis, there was no significant difference in cortisol in terms of diet and density × GABA concentration interaction, but the high-density experimental group showed a significantly higher value. Blood GABA significantly increased in proportion to the addition amount regardless of the density group (P&amp;lt;0.05). Superoxide dismutase activity in the non-specific immune response showed that the GABA-added experimental group had a significantly higher value than the control group, but there was no significant effect of the density densities or density × GABA concentration interaction (P&amp;lt;0.05). Myeloperoxidase activities in fish fed the GABA200 and GABA250 diets showed significantly higher values, and a density × GABA concentration interaction effect was observed (P&amp;lt;0.05). Lysozyme activity was significantly higher in the GABA150 group than in the CON, GABA200, and GABA250 groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). After 15 days of challenge test by intraperitoneal injection of Edwardsiella tarda, the cumulative survival rates of the GABA150, GABA200, and GABA250 groups were significantly higher than that of the CON group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The results suggested that the optimal dietary GABA level for juvenile olive flounder culture is 150 mg/kg, regardless of rearing density, to enhance growth, immune function and disease resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eabdb3b6d55609213e3bd3f29b160683d9f3a875a5a59440c221c9b97655d564","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
