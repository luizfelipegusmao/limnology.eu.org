{"title":"Experimental and Numerical Analysis of the Assembling Stresses in Parabolic Leaf Springs for Railway Freight Wagons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0986/v1","date":1710753383000,"content":"Leaf springs are suspension components constituted of several structural and assembly components. Once the leaves are assembled, a stress state due to the assembly process is developed. Thus, the quantification of the assembly stress level should be known in order to be accounted for in the structural design. The aim of this article is precisely to quantify the assembly stress level in parabolic leaf springs for railway freight wagons. An experimental method with the aid of extensometry is considered to evaluate elastic assembly stresses. Next, a numerical model of the leaf spring assembly process with the required boundary conditions is developed to support the experimental results and allow obtaining a distribution of surface stresses along the master leaf length. The development of this work resulted in a surface stress profile along the length of the master leaf generated by the assembly process, where the deviations of the numerical outcomes regarding the analysed spots with strain gauges are mostly of little relevance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68bd37d497832328c3c2f894fb2dd6fc002d864e57f6a15dfd4b7d6ba22bf9c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
