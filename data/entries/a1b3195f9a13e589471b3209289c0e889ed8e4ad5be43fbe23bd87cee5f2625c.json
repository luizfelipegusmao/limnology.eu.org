{"title":"Urban Legislation and SDG Localization: A Pathway for Amman's Sustainable Future","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1794/v1","date":1724648007000,"content":"Significant global challenges, particularly in the areas of economics, society, and the environment, are posed by urbanization. In this researcher-led study, we look at how Jordan is trying to bring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to life in its capital, Amman, by bringing urban laws in line with these global goals. The paper finds legislative flaws that prevent SDG incorporation through a thorough analysis of the Amman Building and Regulation Act of 2019. Some of the main points covered are public participation, the use of renewable energy sources, sustainable construction practices, resilience in urban areas, and the management of natural resources. Although a lot of work has gone into it, the analysis shows that if Jordan wants to accomplish the 2030 Agenda and have sustainable urban growth in the future, it must overcome these institutional and legal barriers. As a model for other cities facing a similar challenge, Amman is being asked to lead the way in SDG localization through more public involvement, new laws, and innovative resource management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1b3195f9a13e589471b3209289c0e889ed8e4ad5be43fbe23bd87cee5f2625c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
