Specific use cases involving predicting trihalomethane formation and detecting faults in assets are highlighted, showcasing the practical applications and potential of Digital Twins in water network management.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This paper showcases the successful development and implementation of two Digital Twin prototypes within the Lab Digital Twins project, designed to enhance the efficiency and quality control of Aigües de Barcelona's drinking water network. The first prototype focuses on asset management, using (near) real-time data and statistical models, and achieving a 70% success rate in predicting pump station failures 137 days in advance. The second prototype addresses water quality monitoring, leveraging machine learning to accurately forecast trihalomethane levels at key points in the distribution system, and enabling proactive water quality management strategies, ensuring compliance with stringent safety standards and safeguarding public health. The paper details the methodology of both prototypes, highlighting their potential to revolutionize water network management.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nDigital representation of assets and processes in the drinking water treatment network\nEarly fault detection in assets, and predictions of trihalomethane formation in the drinking water distribution network\nReduction on monitoring time and incident response for target assets by means of Digital Twins\nImprovement in visualization, prediction, and proactive measures for asset management and water quality control\nContribution to the growing knowledge on Digital Twins and their potential to revolutionize water network operations\n</p>","author":"Sergi Baena‐Miret, \nMarta Alet Puig, \nRafael Bardisa Rodes, \nLaura Bonastre Farran, \nSantiago Durán, \nMarta Ganzer Martí, \nEduardo Martínez‐Gomariz, \nAntonio Carrasco Valverde","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"945ae9096dbcf56a98456d986a538992af0060eda10e5c610c9192c5c994fbdb","category":"Environment"}
