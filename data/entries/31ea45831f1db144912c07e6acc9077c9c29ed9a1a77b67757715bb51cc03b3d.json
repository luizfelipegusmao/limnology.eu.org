{"title":"Stable Middle Miocene Seawater Isotopes in the Eastern North Atlantic Ocean","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024PA004852?af=R","date":1727331596000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Middle Miocene is characterized by a long-term increase in the stable oxygen isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O<sub>benthic</sub>). However, it is unclear to what extent this increase reflects changes in seawater isotopic composition or deep water temperature. We present a high-resolution alkenone hydrogen isotope (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>2</sup>H<sub>C37</sub>) record of the Middle Miocene from a core taken at the upper slope edge (about 409 m water depth) of the Porcupine Basin continental margin in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, Site U1318 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. The <i>δ</i>\n<sup>2</sup>H<sub>C37</sub> values vary between −174 and −200‰ with an average of −191 ± 5‰, similar to modern open-ocean values. Importantly, they do not show a long-term increase in surface seawater isotopes (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>2</sup>H<sub>SSW</sub>) during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition. Indeed, when <i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O<sub>benthic</sub> is corrected for subsurface temperature, the bottom seawater oxygen isotopes (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O<sub>BSW</sub>) show no significant increase in this period. When the latter record is translated into the hydrogen isotopic composition of bottom seawater using the modern open-ocean waterline, it has an average value of 5.8 ± 1.5‰, similar to the <i>δ</i>\n<sup>2</sup>H<sub>SSW</sub> of 5.2 ± 3.1‰ derived from <i>δ</i>\n<sup>2</sup>H<sub>C37:2,</sub> suggesting a relatively small difference between bottom and surface waters. Our results suggest a stable global surface seawater isotope evolution during the Middle Miocene, coupled with a long-term decrease in bottom water temperature.</p>","author":"Katrin Hättig, \nStefan Schouten, \nStephen Louwye, \nMarcel van der Meer","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"31ea45831f1db144912c07e6acc9077c9c29ed9a1a77b67757715bb51cc03b3d","category":"Environment"}
