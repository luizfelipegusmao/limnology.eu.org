{"title":"The potential Association of Bisphenol A exposure and type 1 diabetes mellitus among Dakahlia Governorate’s children sample, Egypt","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae093/7696518?rss=1","date":1718841600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupter affecting glucose homeostasis.<div>Objectives</div>This study aimed to investigate BPA’s relationship with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in Dakahlia Governorate’s children, in Egypt.<div>Subjects, materials and methods</div>The study had two parts: clinical and experimental. Clinical Study was conducted on 200 children, equally divided into control and T1DM groups. They underwent: demographic data, height, weight, body mass index, glycosylated HbA1C, random blood glucose, and urinary BPA measurements. Experimental Study was conducted on 60 adult albino rats. Rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: control group: received 0.5 mL of pure olive oil, group 1: received 20 mg/kg/day BPA, and group 2: received 100 mg/kg/day BPA orally for 6 weeks. Fasting and two hours postprandial glucose levels were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Histopathological examination and imaging study of the pancreas were done.<div>Results</div>In clinical study: HbA1C and random blood glucose levels in diabetic children showed a significant increase compared to control. Children in control group showed controlled HbA1C, while the T1DM group showed 86% with poor diabetic control. There was a significant increase in BPA level in the T1DM group compared to the control. Rats that received BPA showed a marked increase in fasting and two hours postprandial glucose levels, histopathological changes in the pancreas with more changes determined in the high dose group, and a significant decrease in the islets of Langerhans diameters with group 2 more affected.<div>Conclusion</div>So, BPA exposure could be considered a risk factor for T1DM in children.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"f65db004df1ac28ca8647c07b1f80e0bb146a92f08c6a2aa38d1bb5d798f878a","category":"Environment"}
