{"title":"Institutional data repositories are vital | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0789","date":1726146060000,"content":"As funding agencies and publishers reiterate research data-sharing expectations (1), many higher-education institutions have demonstrated their commitment to the long-term stewardship of research data by connecting researchers to local infrastructure, with dedicated staffing, that eases the burden of data sharing. Institutional repositories are an example of this investment (2). They provide support for researchers in sharing data that might otherwise be lost: data without a disciplinary repository, data from projects with limited funding, or data that are too large to sustainably store elsewhere. The staffing and technical infrastructure provided by institutional repositories ensures responsible access to information while considering long-term preservation and alignment with international standards (3â€“5). To ensure continued access to invaluable research data, it is essential that publishers and funding agencies recognize institutional repositories as responsible and reliable data-sharing solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"0db9627174ffa5be52173da1be55ee64e3eb0a8b65d03145ea58e8f93750280c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
