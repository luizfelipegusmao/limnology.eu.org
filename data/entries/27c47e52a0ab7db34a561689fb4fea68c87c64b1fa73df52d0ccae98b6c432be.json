{"title":"Urban Land: Toward a Consilient Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2341/v1","date":1722317829000,"content":"It is widely recognized that rapid urbanization and urban change are defining traits of the contemporary era, bringing both daunting challenges and hopeful opportunities. It is therefore critical that we have a clear and actionable model of the nature of urban space and the dynamics of its functions and dysfunctions to guide policy and practice. Yet the field today includes a range of definitions that are often inconsistent and often conflating very different properties of urban land, often expressed in some version of the conflated characterization, “over half of humanity now lives in cities.” In the last several decades, more articulated theoretical models have been advanced, with notable differences and discrepancies as well as partial commonalities. Here we assess the various models, and we formulate a consolidated and “consilient” theoretical model that may help guide policy and practice through an era of increasingly daunting urban challenges. In particular, the model focuses upon the cellular network structure of public and private spaces, and the dynamics of their evolution under human control – a theoretical model we refer to as Place Network Theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27c47e52a0ab7db34a561689fb4fea68c87c64b1fa73df52d0ccae98b6c432be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
