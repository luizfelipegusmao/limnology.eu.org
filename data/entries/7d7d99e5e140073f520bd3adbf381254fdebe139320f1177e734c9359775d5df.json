{"title":"m-QAM Receiver Based on Data Stream Spectral Clustering for Optical Channels Dominated by Nonlinear Phase Noise","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0005/v1","date":1727776527000,"content":"Optical communication systems pose significant challenges, including the effects of nonlinear noises. The nonlinearities, including Kerr-induced phase noise, become more problematic in m-QAM as the orden of the format increases becoming a highly densed set of data-symbols and therefore, requiring advanced signal processing for successful separation of symbols at the demodulation stage. Machine learning techniques have recently been applied to improve signal integrity in such scenarios. This paper explores the application of a spectral clustering algorithm adapted to deal with data streaming to mitigate nonlinear noise in long-haul optical channels dominated by nonlinear phase noise, offering a promising solution to a pressing issue. We demonstrate that the spectral clustering algorithm outperforms the k-means algorithm in the face of nonlinear phase noise in -90, -100, and -110 dBc/Hz scenarios at 1 MHz in a simulated 10 GHz symbol rate channel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d7d99e5e140073f520bd3adbf381254fdebe139320f1177e734c9359775d5df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
