{"title":"Periprosthetic Knee Infection: From Diagnosis to Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1663/v1","date":1724379258000,"content":"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the major complications resulting from the implantation of a joint prosthesis. Staphylococci are responsible for more than 50% of prosthetic infections, about 20% can be polymicrobial, 15% are gram-negative and about 10% of cultures are negative. The complete eradication of the infection is extremely difficult. For a correct treatment is first of all useful to perform a clinical staging based on the anatomical location of the infection and on the immune characteristics of the host. However, regardless the area of infection, the role of the surgeon is crucial, firstly in terms of timing and secondly in assessing the degree of invasiveness of the infected and necrotic tissues required. The goal of the treatment must be to eradicate the infection ensuring the maximum functional result.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b4ad8898f59e1243c2c47b0a76c564cf7aea0dad90c4b28b63013bdc4bed6df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
