{"title":"Conserved cis-elements enable NODULES WITH ACTIVATED DEFENSE1 regulation by NODULE INCEPTION during nodulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4622/7732770?rss=1","date":1723507200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Symbiotic nitrogen fixation within nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC) plants is thought to have arisen from a single gain followed by massive losses in the genomes of ancestral non-nodulating plants. However, molecular evidence supporting this model is limited. Here, we confirm through bioinformatic analysis that <span>NODULES WITH ACTIVATED DEFENSE1</span> (<span>NAD1</span>) is present only in NFC plants and is thus an NFC-specific gene. Moreover, <span>NAD1</span> was specifically expressed in nodules. We identified three conserved nodulation-associated <span>cis</span>-regulatory elements (NACE1–3) in the promoter of <span>LjNAD1</span> from <span>Lotus japonicus</span> that are required for its nodule specific expression. A survey of NFC plants revealed that NACE1 and NACE2 are specific to the Fabales and Papilionoideae, respectively, while NACE3 is present in all NFC plants. Moreover, we found that nodule inception (NIN) directly binds to all three NACEs to activate <span>NAD1</span> expression. Mutation of <span>L. japonicus LjNAD1</span> resulted in the formation of abnormal symbiosomes with enlarged symbiosome space and frequent breakdown of bacteroids in nodules, resembling phenotypes reported for <span>Medicago truncatula Mtnad1</span> and <span>Mtnin</span> mutants. These data point to NIN–NAD1 as an important module regulating rhizobial accommodation in nodules. The regulation of <span>NAD1</span> by NIN in the NFC ancestor represent an important evolutionary adaptation for nodulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1d362f245a0d16abbfa62d79c123d0ff3984df5c4362b82b79e8ecafe56b950c","category":"Environment"}
