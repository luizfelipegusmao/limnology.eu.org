{"title":"The life history consequences of host switching in Ooencyrtus egeria (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), a parasitoid of stink bug eggs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/753/7731553?rss=1","date":1723420800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The stink bugs <span>Acrosternum arabicum</span> Wagner and <span>Brachynema germari</span> Kolenati (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) damage developing pistachio nuts in Iran. <span>Ooencyrtus egeria</span> Huang and Noyes (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) parasitizes eggs of both species, alternating between them seasonally. We compared the biological and life history attributes of <span>O. egeria</span> reared for 3 generations on each host species with those that had been transferred to the alternate host for 2 generations. We also tested female responses to host egg density. Eggs of <span>B. germari</span> were parasitized at higher rates and yielded faster wasp development, heavier female progeny with greater fecundity, and a more female-biased sex ratio, than eggs of <span>A. arabicum</span>. Rearing on <span>A. arabicum</span> did not diminish wasp fitness on <span>B. germari</span>, and the F1 progeny of wasps switched to <span>A. arabicum</span> inherited some beneficial parental effects from rearing on <span>B. germari</span>. Regardless of host species, females parasitized fewer eggs in 8 h as density increased from 10 to 30 eggs, but progeny sex ratio (% female) increased. The anomalous response to host density appears to arise from a combination of behavioral and egg load constraints. Females mature only 10â€“12 eggs per day. Carefully inspect egg clusters before selecting the most suitable eggs for oviposition, a more time-consuming process for large clusters. Our results indicate that rearing <span>O. egeria</span> on eggs of <span>A. arabicum</span>, which are more convenient and cost-effective to produce than those of <span>B. germari</span>, will not diminish its performance on <span>B. germari</span> following augmentative release, beyond a slight reduction in female fecundity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"6ae48c680f0b4ecef3a2f78d9a8affac1cc53716e725e0a79edd7d9fd203668d","category":"Environment"}
