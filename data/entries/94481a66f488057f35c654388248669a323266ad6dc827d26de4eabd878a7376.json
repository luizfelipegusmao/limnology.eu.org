{"title":"In Vitro Self-Circularization Methods Based on Self-Splicing Ribozyme","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0377/v1","date":1722940967000,"content":"In vitro circular RNA (circRNA) preparation methods have been gaining a lot of attention recently as several reports suggest that circRNAs are more stable with better performances in cells and in vivo than linear RNAs in various biomedical applications. Self-splicing ribozymes are considered a major in vitro circRNA generation method for biomedical applications due to their simplicity and efficiency in circularization of gene of interest. This review summarizes updates and discusses recently developed self-circularization methods based on the self-splicing ribozyme such as group I and II intron ribozymes and pros and cons of each method to prepare circRNA in vitro.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94481a66f488057f35c654388248669a323266ad6dc827d26de4eabd878a7376","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
