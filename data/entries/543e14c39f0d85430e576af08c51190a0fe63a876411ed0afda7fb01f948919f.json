{"title":"Simulating NVH Advances in Electric Vehicle Powertrains: Strategies and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0239/v1","date":1719973375000,"content":"The study examines the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) management of electric vehicle (EV) powertrains, considering the challenges of the automotive industry's transition to electric drivetrains. The growing popularity of EVs brings new NVH challenges, as the lack of internal combustion engine (ICE) noise makes drivetrain noise more prominent. Key to managing NVH in EV powertrains is understanding the noise from electric motors, inverters, and gear systems. Noise from electric motors, mainly resulting from electromagnetic forces, and high-frequency noise generated by inverters significantly impact overall NVH performance. The article details sources of mechanical noise and vibration, including gear defects in gear systems and shaft imbalances. Methods presented in the publication include simulation and modeling techniques that help identify and solve NVH difficulties. Tools like multi-body dynamics (MBD), finite element method (FEM), and multi-domain simulation are crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems. With the support of simulations, engineers can predict noise and vibration challenges and develop effective solutions during the design phase. The study emphasizes the importance of a system-level approach in NVH management, where the entire drivetrain is modeled and analyzed together, not just individual components.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"543e14c39f0d85430e576af08c51190a0fe63a876411ed0afda7fb01f948919f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
