{"title":"High Dose Neutrophil Depleted Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1413/v1","date":1721206462000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Encouraging results reported of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) treatment for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The present retrospective study reports the efficacy and safety of a high dose of neutrophile and red blood cell-depleted PRP to treat 212 patients with KOA. Methods: 212 consecutive patients diagnosed with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading 1-3 KOA chronic knee pain for at least 1 year were treated with 3 injections at 15-day intervals with a high dose of neutrophil-depleted PRP (4 billion platelets). Clinical outcomes were retrospectively recorded as a percentage of responders at 3,6, and 12-month follow-up, following the OMERACT-OARSI criteria. Pain through VAS score and WOMAC score have also been recorded. Results: 4ml of PRP containing 4X109 platelets were obtained by single spin centrifugation and injected intra-articular into each patient with no pre-activation. The overall responder rate of patients responding to OMERACT-OARSI criteria at 3,6,12 months was 68.9%, 72,7% and 70,6%. There was a significant improvement in VAS and WOMAC scores at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up compared to the pre-treatment value (p&amp;lt; 0.01). The lowest VAS score was observed at 6 months overall and in all three-grade KL groups. KL2 groups showed the best results regarding pain reduction and WOMAC score at 6 months (p&amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: a high dose of neutrophil-depleted PRP is an effective treatment for KL1-3 KOA. It provides symptomatic relief, can potentially reduce disease progression, and has sustained effects for up to 12 months.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1601378cd3e5d4ad3971fee712518863fefea474bb10a5521c41e10fd7a93c50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
