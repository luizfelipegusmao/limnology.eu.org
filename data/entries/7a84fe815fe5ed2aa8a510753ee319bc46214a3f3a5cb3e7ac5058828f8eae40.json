{"title":"Accurate Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 by Sanger Sequencing of Receptor-Binding Domain Is Needed for Clinical Evaluation of Its Immune Evasion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0562/v1","date":1710144123000,"content":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 has the highest number of amino acid mutations in its receptor binding domain (RBD) and has acquired a hallmark L455S mutation. The immune evasion capability of JN.1 is a subject of scientific investigation. The US CDC used RT-qPCR SGTF as the proxy indicator of JN.1 infections for evaluation of the effectiveness of updated monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID-19 vaccines against JN.1 and recommended that all persons aged â‰¥6 months should receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine dose.\nObjective: Recommend Sanger sequencing for diagnosis of JN.1 infections to generate the data based on which guidelines are made to direct vaccination policies.\nMethods: The RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with clinical respiratory infection was subjected to nested RT-PCR, targeting a 398-base segment of the N-gene and a 445-base segment of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for amplification. The DNA sequences were analyzed for amino acid mutations. \nResults: The N-gene sequence showed Q229K, usually associated with Omicron BA.2.86 (+JN.1). The RBD sequence showed 24 amino acid mutations, including the hallmark L455S mutation for JN.1 and the V483del for BA.2.86 lineage. \nConclusions:  The CDC should consider Sanger sequencing of the RBD to diagnose JN.1 infections for statistical analysis in making vaccination policies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a84fe815fe5ed2aa8a510753ee319bc46214a3f3a5cb3e7ac5058828f8eae40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
