{"title":"CircTAOK1 regulates high glucose induced inflammation, oxidative stress, ECM accumulation, and apoptosis in diabetic nephropathy via targeting miR‐142‐3p/SOX6 axis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24076?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a complication caused by diabetes. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a kind of RNA with a closed circular structure, which has high stability and is involved in many disease-related processes. The mechanism of circRNA TAO kinase 1 (circTAOK1) in the pathogenesis and development of DN is unclear.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>CircTAOK1, microRNA (miR)-142-3p, and sex-determining region Y-box transcription factor 6 (SOX6) mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were used to analyze cell proliferation. Cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. Western blot assay was performed to test B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), cleaved-caspase 3, and fibronectin (FN), collagen I (Col I), and collagen IV (Col IV) protein levels. ELISA assay was used to measure interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) levels. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed by the corresponding kits. And the correlation between miR-142-3p and circTAOK1 or SOX6 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull down assay.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>CircTAOK1 and SOX6 expression levels were up-regulated, while miR-142-3p expression was down-regulated in DN serum and HG-treated HK-2 cells. Knockdown of circTAOK1 could inhibit cell injury of HG-induced HK-2 cells. The inhibitory effect of circTAOK1 knockdown on HG-induced HK-2 cell injury was restored by miR-142-3p downregulation. CircTAOK1 acted as a sponge for miR-142-3p, and SOX6 was targeted by miR-142-3p. The overexpression of SOX6 could recover the effect of miR-142-3p overexpression on HG-induced HK-2 cell injury. CircTAOK1 regulated the expression of SOX6 by targeting miR-142-3p.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>CircTAOK1 knockdown inhibited HG-induced HK-2 cell damage in DN by the miR-142-3p/SOX6 axis.</p>","author":"Shu‐yan Liu, \nHong Wang, \nBo Yang, \nBaohua Hou, \nLi‐sha Sun, \nHui Pang, \nHui‐hui Wang, \nYan‐ping Fan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"189ea2fb7fd8fdbed6cfc2280d5bc7bd3c63d0627f3f384e831d1c210d6cce35","category":"Environment"}
