{"title":"Ranging Atom Probe Spectra to Reduce Measurement Bias","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.027/7719434?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Atom probe tomography (APT) is emerging as an essential characterization tool in a wide variety of science and engineering fields. For example, APT is helping to foster nascent fields, such as nano-geology [<a href=\"#ozae044.027-B1\">1</a>], and is increasingly being adopted by the semiconductor industry. APT provides the unique capability to access 3-dimensional information about both the chemical and the isotopic distributions within a nano-scale sample of material. However, APT spectra are complex, and there is currently no community-wide consensus on how best to attribute regions of interest in the spectrum to specific ion species (<span>i.e</span>., ion ranging). Ion ranging is thus an active area of research within the community. In this work, we summarize our findings regarding some limited sources of measurement bias in APT quantitative analysis and discuss ion ranging strategies that can improve accuracy and repeatability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3f6ae2fd7669cfa1ee47f49480b6c4b32b4f422a2ab7bfc224e973d31fc60a6f","category":"Environment"}
