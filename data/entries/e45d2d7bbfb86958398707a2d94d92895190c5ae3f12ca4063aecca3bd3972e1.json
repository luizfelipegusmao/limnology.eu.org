{"title":"Particularities of the Sustainable Agrotourism Model in Protected Areas. Machalilla, Ecuador","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1047/v1","date":1723627142000,"content":"The objective of the research is to provide theoretical assessments on the relevance of sustainable agrotourism in protected natural areas as an alternative for sustainable development in areas of great ecological value, where the protection and conservation of the environment is a priority and the integration of agricultural activities with the preservation of biodiversity is achieved for the promotion of practices that not only minimize the environmental impact, but also contribute to the conservation of the natural environment. The research was carried out in the context of the Machalilla National Park in Ecuador using the deductive method, which allowed the analysis of the problem and the general theories linked to sustainable agro-tourism in protected natural spaces, the establishment of premises and the development of objectives to reach conclusions on the subject studied. Mixed research is presented, which allowed the integration of contributions from the analyses carried out for the treatment and processing of the information. Among the results, the systematization of sustainable agro-tourism in the context of protected areas is expected. The results show the need to broaden the debate on the relevance of sustainable agrotourism in protected natural areas as a sustainable development alternative for rural communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e45d2d7bbfb86958398707a2d94d92895190c5ae3f12ca4063aecca3bd3972e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
