{"title":"28 Integrating homeostasis in practical mineral supplementation recommendations","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/80/7757033?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A long-established objective in ruminant nutrition is an accurate supply of the 4 main trace metal nutrients Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe, respecting bioavailability, nutritional interactions, and nutrient tolerance. Although, current dietary supplementation practices, justified by the multiple uncertainties of trace metal supply, results in dietary levels that widely exceed nutritional guidelines. Additionally, reference feeding recommendations are defined assuming fixed and highly conservative uptake coefficients, an approach that disregards the opportunity, and limitations, of absorptive regulation, the main homeostatic mechanism of these nutrients. Mitigating deficiency risks by generous supplementation can result in a generally overlooked risk, exceeding tolerable trace metal availability. Complete nutrient balance studies have recently described the overwhelming homeostatic downregulation of trace metals at dietary levels that are not uncommon in practice. This finding calls for a novel approach to define supplementation that resolves this conundrum of trace metal adequacy. This approach integrated 3 elements: a stochastic analysis of native dietary supply; a stochastic analysis of net nutrient requirements; and the identification of the upper and lower boundaries of homeostatic regulation for these 4 nutrients in the bovine species. This last, aims to resolve the main limitation of current dietary guidelines, using the potential maximum uptake rates in homeostatic upregulation, and the minimum uptake rates achievable by downregulation, instead of assuming fixed uptake rates. As result, this approach delivers dietary supply ranges of adequate supply, instead of a minimum dietary level to meet dietary adequacy. The probability distribution of nutrient supply was determined by dry-matter intake variability, diversity in dietary composition, and variability of nutrient occurrence in feedstuffs. The probability distribution of net nutrient requirements was defined by the variability of the components of a classic factorial requirement approach applied to different animal conditions. A maximum apparent absorption efficiency was determined to define lower supply boundaries using published datasets. Upper boundaries were defined as the dietary supply level beyond which apparent absorption empirically has shown to exceed net requirements. As expected, this risk-based approach resulted in much lower supplementation recommendations than current reference models. However, it supports the value of preventive supplementation of Zn and Cu to growing and lactating animals, and Cu to non-lactating non-growing cows. This assessment also indicates merit in Mn supplementation to growing bovines. Furthermore, it confirms that under all circumstances native dietary Fe meets nutritional needs, but it also illustrates a tolerance risk to native Fe supply under multiple productive scenarios. Most interestingly, this analysis illustrates the risk of exceeding trace metal tolerance boundaries with common levels of supplementation under common conditions. This approach offers a novel perspective to trace metal supplementation, pointing at an opportunity to improve nutritional adequacy by reconsidering supplementation practices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ce903359fa2afcfe7864b2031c5661cca6c118fc6f144eddff2f3a05adf6300b","category":"Environment"}
