{"title":"High expression of AlkB homolog 5 suppresses the progression of non‚Äêsmall cell lung cancer by facilitating ferroptosis through m6A demethylation of SLC7A11","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24272?af=R","date":1718077862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a prevailing LC characterized by poor outcomes. AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) functions as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. This study delved into the role of ALKBH5 in NSCLC development.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>TCGA database predicted ALKBH5 expression in NSCLC patients. ALKBH5 levels in NSCLC and human bronchial epithelial cells were determined. pcDNA3.1-ALKBH5/NC, pcDNA3.1-SLC7A11/NC, and ferrostatin-1 were used to explore the interactions among ALKBH5, SLC7A11, and ferroptosis. SLC7A11 mRNA and its protein levels were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Transwell. Total N6-methyladenosine (m6A) quantification and its enrichment on SLC7A11 mRNA were determined, followed by the observation of Ki67, ALKBH5 and SLC7A11-positive cell numbers. Glutathione (GSH), lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid-ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and iron ion contents were determined. Animal experiments further analyzed the role of ALKBH5 in tumor development and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Bioinformatics analysis revealed the lowly-expressed ALKBH5 in LC patients. ALKBH5 was downregulated in NSCLC cells and its upregulation repressed proliferation activity, invasion, and migration, and facilitated apoptosis. ALKBH5 upregulation decreased GSH, increased lipid-ROS, MDA, and iron ion contents, and downregulated SLC7A11 by reducing m6A modification. SLC7A11 upregulation partly annulled the effect of ALKBH5 overexpression on cell ferroptosis and malignant behaviors. In vivo assays elucidated the suppression of ALKBH5 upregulation on tumor development and GPX4 levels.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>ALKBH5 upregulation downregulates SLC7A11 transcription by decreasing m6A modification, thus promoting NSCLC cell ferroptosis and ultimately repressing NSCLC progression.</p>","author":"Zhangzhou Huang, \nGen Lin, \nYaping Hong, \nLihong Weng, \nKai Zhu, \nWu Zhuang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"e5af9a58550526b9a94ac9d50b856361d178574171b769ccc0a867dc7a1c36ee","category":"Environment"}
