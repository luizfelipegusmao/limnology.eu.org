{"title":"Role of MiR-204 in the Hallmarks of Breast Cancer: An Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1776/v1","date":1719353164000,"content":"MiR-204 is a small noncoding RNA with diverse regulatory roles in breast cancer (BC) development and progression. miR-204 is implicated in the instauration of fundamental traits acquired during the multistep development of BC known as hallmarks of cancer. It may act as a potent tumor suppressor by inhibiting key cellular processes like angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, invasion, migration, and metastasis. It achieves this by targeting multiple master genes involved in these processes, including HIF-1α, β-catenin, VEGFA, FAK, FOXA1, among others. Additionally, miR-204 modulates signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT and interacts with HOTAIR and DSCAM-AS1 lncRNAs, further influencing tumor progression. Beyond its direct effects on tumor cells, miR-204 shapes the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune cell infiltration, suppressing pro-tumorigenic cytokine production, and potentially influencing immunotherapy response. Moreover, miR-204 plays a crucial role in metabolic reprogramming by directly suppressing metabolic genes within tumor cells, indirectly affecting metabolism through exosome signaling, and remodeling metabolic flux within the tumor microenvironment. This review aims to present an update on the current knowledge regarding the role of miR-204 in the hallmarks of BC. In conclusion, miR-204 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in BC, emphasizing the need for further research to fully elucidate its complex roles in orchestrating aggressive BC behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7660c3d5e7b6d642ee3460d7a2f8b677a03766c1a5e1b1331216a2ed7c75d30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
