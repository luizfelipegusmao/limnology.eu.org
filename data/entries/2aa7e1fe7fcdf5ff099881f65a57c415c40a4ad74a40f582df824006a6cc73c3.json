{"title":"Impact of Alcalase Hydrolysis and Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion on the Release of Bioactive Peptides From Erythrina edulis (Chachafruto) Proteins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0657/v1","date":1720526599000,"content":"Amidst increasing awareness of diet-health relationships, plant-derived bioactive peptides are recognized for their dual nutritional and health benefits. This study investigates bioactive peptides released after Alcalase hydrolysis of protein from chachafruto (Erythrina edulis), a nutrient-rich South American leguminous plant, focusing on their behavior during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Evaluating their ability to scavenge radicals, mitigate oxidative stress, and influence immune response biomarkers, the study underscores the importance of understanding peptide interactions in digestion. Methods included previous enzymatic hydrolysis with Alcalase to obtain peptides, and results show significant radical scavenging and oxidative stress protection by chachafruto peptides. These findings highlight the potential of chachafruto bioactive peptides in functional foods and nutraceuticals, supporting human health through dietary interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2aa7e1fe7fcdf5ff099881f65a57c415c40a4ad74a40f582df824006a6cc73c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
