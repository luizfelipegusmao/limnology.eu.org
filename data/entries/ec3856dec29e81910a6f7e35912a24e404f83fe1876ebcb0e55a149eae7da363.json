{"title":"Copper Catalysts Anchored on Cysteine-Functionalized Polydopamine-Coated Magnetite Nanoparticles: A Versatile Platform for Enhanced Coupling Reactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0249/v1","date":1727961610000,"content":"Cysteine plays a crucial role in the development of an efficient copper-catalyst system, where its thiol group serves as a strong anchoring site for metal coordination. By immobilizing copper onto cysteine-modified, polydopamine-coated magnetite nanoparticles, this advanced catalytic platform exhibits exceptional stability and catalytic activity. Chemical modification of the polydopamine (PDA) surface with cysteine enhances copper salt immobilization, leading to the formation of the Fe₃O₄@PDA-Cys@Cu nanostructure. This system was evaluated in palladium-free, copper-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions, effectively catalyzing the coupling of terminal acetylenes with aryl halides. Additionally, the Fe₃O₄@PDA-Cys@Cu platform was employed in click reactions, confirming the enhanced catalytic efficiency due to increased copper content. The reusability of the platform was further investigated, demonstrating improved performance, especially in recyclability tests in click reaction, making it a promising candidate for sustainable heterogeneous catalysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec3856dec29e81910a6f7e35912a24e404f83fe1876ebcb0e55a149eae7da363","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
