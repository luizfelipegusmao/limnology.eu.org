{"title":"Optimization of Airfoils for the Design of Long Endurance Aircrafts Using Deep Learning Models and Metaheuristics Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1992/v1","date":1721905122000,"content":"This paper presents a methodology based on deep learning models and metaheuristic algorithms for the optimization of airfoils for the design of aircraft wings with large endurance. The use of AZTLI-NN (a neural network with an architecture composed of a multilayer perceptron and a variational autoencoder) is implemented for the prediction of graphs of the aerodynamic coefficients of the airfoil as a function of the angle of attack. This neural network presents good predictions of the aerodynamic coefficients, similar to the coefficients obtained with computational fluid dynamics simulations. AZTLI-NN in combination of metaheuristic algorithms and the CST profile parameterization method show excellent performance in single-objective and multi-objective profile optimization tasks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"523290b0f3cd0e1f65d82651a3956061ab045fc7228295ad8c8176fa83890142","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
