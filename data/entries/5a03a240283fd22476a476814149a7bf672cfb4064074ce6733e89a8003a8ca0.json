{"title":"Therapeutic Applications of Botulinum Neurotoxin: Insights from a Comprehensive Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2013/v1","date":1727258544000,"content":"Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is recognized as one of the most potent neurotoxins, with a lethal dose as low as 2 ng/kg, but it has also demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in controlled doses. Produced by the gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum, BoNT exists in eight distinct serotypes (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F, and G) that disrupt neuronal transmission by targeting the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex at the neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the release of acetylcholine and inducing flaccid paralysis. While BoNT is notorious for its toxicity, it has been repurposed for medical use across various clinical indications. Following their approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), these toxins have been associated with significant improvements in patient outcomes, particularly for individuals with specific neuromuscular disorders such as spasticity, dystonia, and cerebral palsy, as well as non-neuromuscular conditions like hyperhidrosis and cosmetic concerns. This broad spectrum of therapeutic applications that botulinum neurotoxins offer has made them an integral part of contemporary healthcare. Considering their growing importance, a detailed evaluation of their pharmacological properties, available formulations, and clinical uses is crucial. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of BoNT's molecular structure, mechanism of action, and therapeutic applications, with a particular emphasis on the most widely used BoNT-A formulations: OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), AbobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport), and IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin). We examine their clinical efficacy, safety profiles, and differences in pharmacological properties to guide healthcare providers in selecting the most appropriate treatment for various conditions. Additionally, the review explores the challenges of BoNT therapy, such as immunogenicity and dosing considerations, while highlighting its evolving role in neurorehabilitation and conservative treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a03a240283fd22476a476814149a7bf672cfb4064074ce6733e89a8003a8ca0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
