{"title":"Effects of Water Quality on Diversity of Freshwater Green Microalgae in Semiurban Areas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1623/v1","date":1713952386000,"content":"Recent climate change and water pollution has affected algal diversity resulting in emergence of more tolerant species.  They can be the indicators of water quality, pollution and seasonal changes. Present study revealed the green algal diversity and distribution pattern according to water parameters and season in the Lucknow City, India. The water sample were collected from seven sites within Lucknow and outskirts. The occurrence of a total of 36 taxa of green algae belonging to 11 genera are recorded. It has been observed that less polluted water is dominated by Spirogyra; where conductivity, TDS and salinity of water were low. Whereas the more polluted water was dominated by desmids. Dominance index was found highest in site 4 (0.61), where only three taxa were identified; whereas the lowest (0.13) was measured in site 1, where nine taxa were identified. This study also recorded several algal taxa for the first time from Lucknow.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00ba5ebfc5a4569783e22d2e6362a1341b23d084b6ab4aef6211d16aef47731a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
