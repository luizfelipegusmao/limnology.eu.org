{"title":"Beyond the financial balance sheet: Embracing the Triple Bottom Line for Sustainable Business Success","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1147/v1","date":1723717090000,"content":"Our decisions today are part of an economic thinking which aims to fix problems and increase the efficiency of capital markets. Our economy is still largely approached as a system which is unre-lated to our environment or social returns like community well-being, social cohesion, equitable distribution of resources, etc. To fully incorporate sustainability into cost-benefit analysis, busi-nesses need to change their financial approach, showcasing how long-term thinking impacts prof-its. Money's value is not static and evolves with time and technology. We propose to introduce a variation of cost/benefit and present value calculations. Precise calculations reveal the benefits of long-term strategies over short-term profit focus. As financial systems evolve and technology advances, the accurate calculation of money's time value will continue to play a crucial role in shaping economic landscapes and guiding financial choices. In this article, we demonstrate that updated calculations could be a key enabler to visualize the benefits of long-term thinking or “patient finance” as compared to a short-term focus on profit. We introduce the concept and calculation of a Present Future Value (PFV).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aba2c53cce4a62816def5b662c5a3806004d9580f7a0e8b3421daf55c84a20b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
