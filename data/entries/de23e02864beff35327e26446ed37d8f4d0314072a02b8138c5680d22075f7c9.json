In the fields of electrochemical catalysis and gas sensing, 2D materials can play vital roles by leveraging their superiorities to accelerate interfacial charge transport and surface catalytic reactions. This review summarizes the advantages of 2D materials, including stackability, tunable bandgap, intrinsic atomic structure, flexibility, and large specific surface area. Furthermore, the recent approaches utilizing 2D materials as active catalysts and sensing materials are explored. Finally, the key challenges and prospects of 2D materials in electrochemical catalysis and gas sensing are discussed.</p>","author":"Tae Hyung Lee, \nSang Eon Jun, \nSeungwon Choi, \nHo Won Jang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"de23e02864beff35327e26446ed37d8f4d0314072a02b8138c5680d22075f7c9","category":"Environment"}
