{"title":"Development of Artificial Rock through the Recycling of Construction Waste and Demolition in Polymeric Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0323/v1","date":1717721001000,"content":"Civil construction is one of the oldest known activities in humanity, reports indicate that builders of the Roman Empire already sought the reuse of materials. Currently, considering the depletion of the supply of natural resources, the recycling of solid waste from construction and demolition (CDW), not only provides new products, but also offers ecological and economic alternative. In this context, this research seeks new variables for the disposal of waste from construction and demolition having in the composition of artificial finishing stones an odd possibility to be analyzed. In this research was developed and analyzed a new composite from the construction and demolition waste using as a binder an orthophthalic polyester resin. The residue was sieved and separated by granulometry by the simplex centroid method, the best compacted mixture was determined statically by ANOVA and the Tukey test. The residue was characterized by X-ray fluorescence and the resin by infrared spectroscopy by Fourier transform. Artificial rock plates were produced with 85% residue and 15% resin, by mass, by vibro system, compression and vacuum, later were cut for mechanical, physical and chemical tests. Analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy of fractured compositions as well as grain sizes. The artificial stone with the best results presented density of 2,256 g/cm3, water absorption of 0.69%, apparent porosity of 1.55%; bending strength of 34.74 MPa and compression of 111.96 MPa; good results in the alterability and thermal tests. In this satisfactory scenario, the use of this waste in the composition of artificial rocks is promising because it directly meets the concept of sustainable development; replacing the concept of end-of-life of the linear economy, by new circular flows of reuse, restoration and renovation, in an integrated process the circular economy; as well as the quality of the final product with properties similar to the artificial rocks already marketed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27da2e134148545ac692bed85c5816f301d6df49188e2af094dc8e756f2bf026","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
