{"title":"Metabolic function and Therapeutic Potential of CD147 for Hematological Malignancies: an overview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2506/v1","date":1722416863000,"content":"Hematological malignancies refer to a heterogeneous group of neoplastic conditions of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues classified in leukemias, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma, according to their presumed cell of origin, genetic abnormalities, and clinical features. \nMetabolic adaptation and immune escape, which influence various cellular functions including proliferation and survival of hematological malignant tumor cells, are major aspects of these malignancies that lead to therapeutic drug resistance. Targeting specific metabolic pathways is emerging as novel therapeutic strategy in hematopoietic neoplasms, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma. In this context, CD147, also known as Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer (EMMPRIN) or Basigin, is one target-candidate involved in reprogramming metabolism in different cancer cells, including hematological malignant tumor cells. CD147 overexpression significantly contributes to the metabolic transformation of these cancer cells, by mediating signaling pathway, growth, metastasis and metabolic reprogramming, through its interaction, direct or not, with various membrane proteins related to metabolic, regulation including monocarboxylated transporters, integrins, P-glycoprotein and Glucose Transporter 1.\nThis review explores the metabolic functions of CD147 and its impact on the tumor microenvironment, influencing the progression and neoplastic transformation in leukemias, myeloma and lymphomas. Furthermore, we highlight new opportunities for the development of targeted therapies against CD147, potentially improving the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60b26aaf897f9af4bced4fb5cecdf34f37772d31dd78384f0dfca35986a7cd8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
