{"title":"Development and evaluation of a microcontrolled solar tracker based on chronological positioning","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14387?af=R","date":1710591231000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Currently, photovoltaic (PV) solar energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy. Solar trackers (ST) are devices that track and maintain the alignment of solar collectors with the sun's rays, thereby increasing energy generation. This article reports on the development of a microcontrolled dual-axis solar tracker. The system lacks feedback and relies on astronomical equations to calculate the position of the sun. The positioning of the solar panel is controlled by an on–off controller, while the energy generated by the tracker is compared to the output of a stationary panel. Unlike other studies, this work takes into account the energy consumed during the process, including powering the control system and moving the structure. The true tracking gain is estimated using this method. The tracker was analyzed over three days under different climatic conditions, including sunny, partly cloudy, and cloudy weather. After evaluation, the average error of the solar positioning algorithm was 1%. On a sunny day, the tracker produced 52.96% more energy than the fixed system. Considering the energy consumed by the tracking system, the net gain was 48.88%. The average gross gain for the three days analyzed was 45.64%, which is higher than the results of recent studies using the same tracker configuration. For the cloudy day, tracking was not very effective, resulting in a net gain of only 2.14%. In future work, an irradiation sensor could be included to reduce energy consumption on cloudy days. Additional studies are needed to more accurately evaluate the performance of the trigger, preferably with a one-year data collection period.</p>","author":"Anacreone da Silva Souza, \nJuliano da Rocha Queiroz, \nMurilo Silva Colombo, \nThiago Queiroz Costa, \nCid Marcos Gonçalves Andrade, \nGilson Junior Schiavon, \nOswaldo Curty da Motta Lima","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"dbd0d8714ebb10f40d4e4badfd68db2af00a4fc46141bf19ccc2fdc90d30647a","category":"Environment"}
