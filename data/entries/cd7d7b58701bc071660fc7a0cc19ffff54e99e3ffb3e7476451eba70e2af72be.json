In this historical narrative, Charles Darwin is known for his investigations into the “sleep movements” of plants. Nevertheless, the complete scope of Darwin's exploration of biological rhythms remains incompletely understood. Through a detailed examination of Darwin's writings, meticulous observations, experiments, and conceptualizations, we unveil a depth of engagement that surpasses his widely acknowledged work on plants, revealing a more extensive interest in and insight into biological rhythms than traditionally recognized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"cd7d7b58701bc071660fc7a0cc19ffff54e99e3ffb3e7476451eba70e2af72be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
