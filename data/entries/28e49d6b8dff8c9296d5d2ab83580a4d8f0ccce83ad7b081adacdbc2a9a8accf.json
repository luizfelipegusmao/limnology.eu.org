{"title":"Assessing the Impact of Multiple Common Factors on the Development of Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease: An Updated Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.2099/v2","date":1714457270000,"content":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the buildup of misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins. While its exact cause remains unknown, several factors may influence its development. This review examines how factors like chronic constipation, head injuries, cholesterol and uric acid levels, pesticide exposure, smoking, NSAIDs, and caffeine intake may affect PD risk. Chronic constipation appears to be linked to a higher risk of PD, potentially serving as an early warning sign. Head injuries, especially mild-to-moderate ones, may also play a role in increasing PD risk. Surprisingly, higher levels of cholesterol seem to protect against PD, while lower levels of uric acid might increase the risk in the presence of some differences according to gender type. Exposure to certain pesticides is associated with a higher PD risk. NSAIDs, on the other hand, may or may not have a protective effect, with conflicting evidence. Interestingly, caffeine and tobacco smoking appear to lower the PD risk. Further studies are needed to fully understand the complex interplay between these factors and PD. It's also important to remember that these are just general trends, and individual risk factors will vary depending on a person's unique genetic makeup, medical history, and overall health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28e49d6b8dff8c9296d5d2ab83580a4d8f0ccce83ad7b081adacdbc2a9a8accf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
