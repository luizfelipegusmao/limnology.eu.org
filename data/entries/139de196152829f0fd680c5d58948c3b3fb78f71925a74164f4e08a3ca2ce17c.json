{"title":"Novel Ultrasound-Guided Hydrodissection with 5% dextrose Techniques for the Treatment of Occipital Neuralgia Targeting the Greater Occipital Nerve","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1994/v1","date":1719569489000,"content":"Abstract\n\nBackground: Occipital neuralgia is a debilitating condition and traditional treatments often provide limited or temporary relief. Recently, ultrasound-guided hydrodissection of the greater occipital nerve (GON) has emerged as a promising minimally invasive approach.\n\nObjectives: To describe two novel ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with 5% dextrose for GON and discuss their advantages, disadvantages, and considerations.\n\nMethods: Two case reports are presented. Case 1 describes a lateral decubitus approach \nfor hydrodissecting the GON between the semispinalis capitis (SSC) and obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) muscles. Case 2 details a cranial-to-caudal approach for hydrodissecting the GON within the SSC and upper trapezius (UT) muscles when the GON pass through these two muscles.\n\nResults: Both patients experienced significant and sustained pain relief with improvements in function and quality of life.\n\nConclusions: Ultrasound-guided GON hydrodissection using 5% dextrose is a promising treatment for occipital neuralgia. The lateral decubitus and cranial to caudal approaches provide additional options to address patient-specific anatomical considerations and preferences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"139de196152829f0fd680c5d58948c3b3fb78f71925a74164f4e08a3ca2ce17c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
