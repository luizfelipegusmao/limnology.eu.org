{"title":"In vitro Effects of Postmetabolites from Limosilactobacillus fermentum 53 on the Survival and Proliferation of HT-29 Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0048/v1","date":1711967931000,"content":"Naturally fermented dairy products are an important component of the human diet. They are a valuable source of nutrients as well as vitamins and minerals. Their importance as a source of probiotic bacterial strains should not be overlooked. A number of studies highlights the positive effects of species of the Lactobacillacea on the intestinal microbiota, the overall homeostasis of the body, as well as a complementary treatment for some diseases. However, data on the effects on intestinal epithelial cells of postmetabolites released by bacteria are incomplete. This is likely due to the fact that these effects are species and strain specific. In the present study, we investigated the effects of postmetabolites produced by a pre-selected candidate probiotic strain LimosilactobacillusÂ fermentum on HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells. Our data showed a pronounced proliferative effect, evaluated by flow cytometry, quantification of cell population, and determination of mitotic index. This was accompanied by stabilization of the cell monolayer, measured by increase of TEER (trans epithelial electric resistance) and reorganization of actin filaments. The data obtained are a clear indication of the positive effects, that the products secreted by L. fermentum strain 53 have on the intestinal epithelial cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f921cf32ff364023ffeaa0c679b6f8808690dd229ed0029feea6d8d2a995877","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
