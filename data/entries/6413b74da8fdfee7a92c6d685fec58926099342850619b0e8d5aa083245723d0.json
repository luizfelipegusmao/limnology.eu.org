{"title":"An exploration of multi-level factors affecting routine linkage to HIV care in Zambia’s PEPFAR-supported treatment program in the treat all era","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003094","date":1716472800000,"content":"<p>by Jenala Chipungu, Helene Smith, Chanda Mwamba, Mwiza Haambokoma, Anjali Sharma, Theodora Savory, Maurice Musheke, Jake Pry, Carolyn Bolton, Izukanji Sikazwe, Michael E. Herce</p>\r\n\r\nMultiple steps from HIV diagnosis to treatment initiation and confirmed engagement with the health system are required for people living with HIV to establish full linkage to care in the modern treat all era. We undertook a qualitative study to gain an in-depth understanding of the impeding and enabling factors at each step of this linkage pathway. In-depth interviews were conducted with fifty-eight people living with HIV recruited from ten routine HIV care settings supported by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Lusaka, Zambia. Using a semi-structured interview guide informed by an established conceptual framework for linkage to care, questions explored the reasons behind late, missed, and early linkage into HIV treatment, as well as factors influencing the decision to silently transfer to a different clinic after an HIV diagnosis. We identified previously established and intersecting barriers of internal and external HIV-related stigma, concerns about ART side effects, substance use, uncertainties for the future, and a perceived lack of partner and social support that impeded linkage to care at every step of the linkage pathway. However, we also uncovered newer themes specific to the current test and treat era related to the rapidity of ART initiation and insufficient patient-centered post-test counseling that appeared to exacerbate these well-known barriers, including callous health workers and limited time to process a new HIV diagnosis before treatment. Long travel distance to the clinic where they were diagnosed was the most common reason for silently transferring to another clinic for treatment. On the other hand, individual resilience, quality counseling, patient-centered health workers, and a supportive and empathetic social network mitigated these barriers. These findings highlight potential areas for strengthening linkage to care and addressing early treatment interruption and silent transfer in the test and treat era in Zambia.","author":"Jenala Chipungu","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"6413b74da8fdfee7a92c6d685fec58926099342850619b0e8d5aa083245723d0","category":"Environment"}
