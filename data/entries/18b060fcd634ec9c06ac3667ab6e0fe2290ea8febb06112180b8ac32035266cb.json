{"title":"Intraluminal Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography Application in Dogs and Cats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1859/v1","date":1724676484000,"content":"Administering intraluminal fluid can improve the acoustic window for visualization of lumen and wall layers in the cavitary organs. Microbubbles in ultrasound contrast agents can also be used for intracavitary applications to enhance visualization of the lesion in human patients. However, there was no literature extending the clinical application of the intraluminal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) to patients with naturally occurring diseases in veterinary medicine. This case series aims to describe the detailed application and diagnostic value of intraluminal CEUS in six clinical cases with naturally occurring gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary tract diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18b060fcd634ec9c06ac3667ab6e0fe2290ea8febb06112180b8ac32035266cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
