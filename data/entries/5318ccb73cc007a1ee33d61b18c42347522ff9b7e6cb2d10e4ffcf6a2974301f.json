{"title":"Epigenetics of violence against women: a systematic review of the literature","link":"https://academic.oup.com/eep/article/doi/10.1093/eep/dvae012/7731189?rss=1","date":1723248000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Violence against women is a pervasive global issue with profound impacts on victimsâ€™ well-being, extending across cultural boundaries. Besides immediate physical harm, it triggers mental health consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, it is the trauma experienced during a violent event that can lead to epigenetic modifications, ultimately contributing to the onset of PTSD. While research on the epigenetic effects of trauma initially focused on war veterans and disaster survivors, there is a dearth of studies on violence against women. In this article, we performed a systematic review aimed to fill this gap, examining existing studies on the epigenetic impact of violence on women. The review assessed sample sizes, study validity, and gene-specific investigations. Currently, there is insufficient data for a comprehensive meta-analysis, highlighting a nascent stage in understanding this complex issue. Future research is crucial for deeper insights into the epigenetic mechanisms related to violence against women, contributing to improved interventions and support healthcare systems for affected individuals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Epigenetics Current Issue","siteHash":"5549213f473d96cee0cf7ca1db1da1a69239cc267977bfd813fd34781f2cddbb","entryHash":"5318ccb73cc007a1ee33d61b18c42347522ff9b7e6cb2d10e4ffcf6a2974301f","category":"Environment"}
