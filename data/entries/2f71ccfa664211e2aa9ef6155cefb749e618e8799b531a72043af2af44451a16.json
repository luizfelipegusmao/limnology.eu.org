Due to the emergence of drug resistance in these parasites, there is a need for alternative treatments. To understand host responses to <span>O. ostertagi</span> infection in the gastric mucosa, gene expression in fundic and pyloric mucosa was compared between infected and uninfected calves for 21 d post-infection. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased over time with more upregulated than downregulated DEGs at each time point. Fundic mucosa had more DEGs than pyloric mucosa across all time points. The largest changes occurred between d 7 to 9 and 10 post-infection. Most DEGs are associated with immunity, cellular reorganization, cell migration, and proliferation. Tuft/epithelial cell response to the infection was atypical, lacking key cytokines. Numerous genes associated with T cell exhaustion were upregulated. The data collectively indicate that <span>O. ostertagi</span> infection elicited host immune responses, yet also suggest parasite-induced immunosuppression is present. This may explain why cattle are slow in developing protective immunity to <span>O. ostertagi</span>. Understanding mechanisms of parasite evasion will facilitate the rational design of protective vaccines against complex nematode parasites.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2f71ccfa664211e2aa9ef6155cefb749e618e8799b531a72043af2af44451a16","category":"Environment"}
