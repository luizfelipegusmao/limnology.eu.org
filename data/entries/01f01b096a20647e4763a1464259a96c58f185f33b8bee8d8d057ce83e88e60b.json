Apple offers various trials – including a one-month free trial, but there are ways to get up to six months free with certain purchases. Apple also makes trials or discounts available to lapsed subscribers from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out what Apple Music trials are available and how to get Apple Music for free in this article, including how to get three months free Apple Music with Shazam, even if you have had a trial in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus if you are a student you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\">get Apple Music for half price</a>, a deal that includes <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/how-to-get-apple-tv-plus-free.html\">Apple TV+ for free</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Apple Music free?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.spotify.com&amp;xcust=1-1-675739-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/music/free?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Music</a>, there isn’t a free, ad-supported Apple Music tier – the closest option was Apple Music Voice, which was a cut-price, cut-down version of the music streaming service that didn’t allow you to download tracks or create your own playlists, but Apple ditched that option, two years after it was introduced, in November 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can get Apple Music for free for a limited time if you take advantage of the many trials on offer from Apple and its partners. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Music free trial</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers a one-month free Apple Music trial, but you can find trials that extend that period, including six months Apple Music for free if you buy AirPods, a HomePod or Beats headphones.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s partners, such as Shazam, also offer Apple Music trials of various lengths. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for details of the best Apple Music trials we’ve seen, including how to get Apple Music for free for longer than the standard one-month trial and how to get a free trial if you have previously subscribed to Apple Music. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to pay for Apple Music once your trial is over you must make sure to cancel your subscription before it automatically renews. It’s easy to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231231/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-ios.html\">cancel a subscription on iPhone, iPad or Mac</a>, just follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>On an iPhone just go to Settings and click on the section at the top with your Apple ID. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Subscriptions find the one you want to cancel and tap on it. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then tap on Cancel Subscription. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple Music for free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve never tried Apple Music before you’ll be able to get one month free of charge, with no catch and no questions asked. Prior to February 2022, the length of this trial was three months though, so this trial period is not quite as good as it once was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the one-month free Apple Music trial visit Apple’s website via the links below and choose ‘Try 1 one month free’ in the top right corner, or click ‘Try it free’ on the relevant plan (just about halfway down the page).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-675739-7-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for one month with Apple</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-675739-7-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for one month with Apple</a></p>\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple Music free for 6 months</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more than a month? You can get Apple Music free for six months if you buy a qualifying Apple product. Apple offers six months free to new Apple Music users who buy AirPods, a HomePod mini or Beats headphones. You do need to be a new subscriber to Apple Music though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following devices are eligible as per <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-675739-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/promo/pdf/EN_UK_Apple_Music_Promo_121321.pdf\">Apple’s ts&amp;cs</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AirPods Pro </li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods (2nd and 3rd generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HomePod</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HomePod mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Fit Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Studio Buds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Powerbeats</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Powerbeats Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Solo Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Studio Pro </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have bought one of these eligible devices you can qualify–as long as you haven’t previously subscribed to Apple Music and as long as the device has been paired with your iPhone or iPad for less than 90 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify for the free six-month trial you need to sign up within 90 days of first pairing your qualifying audio device with an iPhone or iPad that is running the latest iOS or iPadOS. So if you’ve been using your HomePod with your Apple ID for more than 90 days you won’t be able to take advantage–unless you switched your HomePod to a different Apple ID… </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://offers.applemusic.apple/six-month-offer&amp;xcust=1-1-675739-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for six months with Apple U.S.</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://offers.applemusic.apple/en-gb/six-month-offer&amp;xcust=1-1-675739-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for six months with Apple U.K.</a></p>\n\n\n<p>To get Apple’s six-month trial of Apple Music follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Update your iPhone or iPad to the latest version of iOS/iPadOS. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pair your AirPods, HomePods or Beats headphones with you iPhone or iPad. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open Apple Music on the iPhone or iPad. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in with your Apple ID. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You should see details of the offer, if you don’t click on Listen Now.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple Music free with Shazam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only Apple that is offering a trial of Apple Music.

What if you have used up all your trial time though?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time Apple offers lapsed subscribers the opportunity to get three months Apple Music for the price of one – so £10.99/$10.99 for three months.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Get-three-months-for-one-Apple-Music-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Three months apple music for One\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Get-three-months-for-one-Apple-Music-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1168w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Get-three-months-for-one-Apple-Music-.jpg?resize=300%2C159&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Get-three-months-for-one-Apple-Music-.jpg?resize=768%2C406&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"542\" /><figcaption>Apple sometimes offers lapsed subscribers three months for the price of one.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally though, once you’ve used your three (or more) months trial, you won’t be able to get any more months free using the same method, even if you wait a year or so. But there is a trick to getting an extra three months: start using Family Sharing via another user and switch to the Apple Music Family Sharing plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re happy to use Family Sharing, you could get another member of your family to sign up for the free trial of the Apple Music Family Sharing plan, and then share that with you. You’ll then be able to take advantage of an extra three months for free. In fact, it can be shared between up to six people so you could share the free trial with other family members too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a separate article with more information about \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671350/how-to-set-up-family-sharing-on-ipad-iphone-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Family Sharing and how to set it up.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Just want Apple Music for a short period of time?
