Twenty-nine ACLR patients who were at least four months from surgery were included in this analysis. Participants were brought into the laboratory on one occasion to complete functional testing. Quadriceps and hamstring isokinetic testing was completed bilaterally at 60, 180, and 300 degâˆ™s<sup>-1</sup>, using extension peak torque from each speed as the outcome measure. The 6mTH was completed bilaterally using a marker-based motion capture system, and reactive strength ratio (RSR) was calculated from the vertical velocity of the pelvis during the test. An adjustment in RSR was made using the velocity of the 6mTH test to account for different strategies employed across participants. Repeated measures correlations were used to determine associations among isokinetic and hop testing variables. A two-way mixed analysis of variance was used to determine differences in isokinetic and hop testing variables between operated and non-operated legs and across male and female participants. Moderate positive associations were found between RSR (and adjusted RSR) and isokinetic peak torque at all speeds (<i>r</i> = .527 to .577). Mean comparisons showed significant main effects for leg and sex. Patients showed significant deficits in their operated versus non-operated legs in all isokinetic and hop testing variables, yet only isokinetic peak torque and timed hop time showed significant differences across male and female groups. Preliminary results are promising but further development is needed to validate other accessible technologies available to calculate reactive strength during functional testing after ACLR. Pending these developments, the effects of movement strategies, demographics, and levels of participation on RSR can then be explored to translate this simple method to clinical environments.","author":"Zachary Ripic","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b361fb5e223687819405326abdbee1621c963f1b67c5631732c1985f9de9c4d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
