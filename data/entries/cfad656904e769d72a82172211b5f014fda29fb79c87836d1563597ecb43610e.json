{"title":"Procurement Innovation: An Inquiry into the Adoption of Emerging Technologies in Supply Chain Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0384/v1","date":1720065491000,"content":"This study investigates the adoption of emerging technologies in procurement within supply chain management, focusing on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Through a qualitative approach, involving semi-structured interviews with procurement professionals and technology experts, the study explores how these technologies enhance operational efficiency, optimize inventory management, and improve supply chain transparency and trust. AI-driven predictive analytics were found to significantly enhance demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier performance evaluation, fostering data-driven decision-making and proactive risk management. Blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent transactions, facilitating compliance with ethical sourcing standards and reducing risks associated with counterfeit goods. Despite these benefits, organizations face substantial challenges in adopting these technologies, including data security concerns, integration complexities with existing IT infrastructure, and skills shortages in AI and blockchain expertise. Leadership commitment and organizational readiness are identified as crucial enablers for overcoming these barriers and driving successful technology adoption. The study also highlights the strategic importance of supplier relationship management, emphasizing how emerging technologies enhance real-time collaboration, performance insights, and contractual transparency. By addressing these challenges and leveraging technological innovations strategically, organizations can achieve sustainable growth, resilience, and competitive advantage in an increasingly digital and interconnected global economy. The findings contribute to advancing knowledge on procurement innovation and offer valuable insights for organizations seeking to navigate the complexities of technology-driven procurement practices. Future research directions may explore the long-term impact of technology adoption on supply chain dynamics, sustainability initiatives, and organizational performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfad656904e769d72a82172211b5f014fda29fb79c87836d1563597ecb43610e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
