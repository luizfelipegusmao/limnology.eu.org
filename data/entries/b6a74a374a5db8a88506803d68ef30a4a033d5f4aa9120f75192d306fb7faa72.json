This study aimed to investigate the use of chlormequat (CQ) to regulate submerged <i>Vallisneria natans</i> growth as well as its impact on the microbial community of epiphytic biofilms. <i>V. natans</i> height under CQ dosages of 20, 100, and 200 mg/L decreased within 21 days by 12.57%, 30.07%, and 44.62%, respectively, while chlorophyll content increased by 1.94%, 20.39%, and 38.83%. At 100 mg/L, CQ reduced the diversity of bacteria in the biofilm attached to <i>V. natans</i> leaves but increased the diversity of the eukaryotic microbial community. CQ strongly inhibited Cyanobacteria; compared with the control group, the treatment group experienced a significant reduction from 36.54% to 2.61%. Treatment significantly inhibited Gastrotricha and Rotifera, two dominant phyla of eukaryotes in the leaf biofilm, reducing their relative abundances by 17.41% and 6.48%, respectively. CQ significantly changed the leaf biofilm microbial community correlation network. The treatment group exhibited lower modularity (2.012) compared with the control group (2.249); however, the central network of the treated group contained a higher number of microbial genera (13) than the control group (4), highlighting the significance of eukaryotic genera in the network. The results obtained from this study provide invaluable scientific context and technical understanding pertinent to the restoration of submerged macrophytes within aquatic ecosystems.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nChlormequat reduced the plant height but increased leaf chlorophyll content.\nChlormequat reduced biofilm bacterial diversity but increased eukaryotic diversity.\nChlormequat affected the bacterial-fungal association networks in biofilms.\n</p>","author":"Zihang Ma, \nDan Ai, \nZuhan Ge, \nTao Wu, \nJibiao Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"b6a74a374a5db8a88506803d68ef30a4a033d5f4aa9120f75192d306fb7faa72","category":"Environment"}
