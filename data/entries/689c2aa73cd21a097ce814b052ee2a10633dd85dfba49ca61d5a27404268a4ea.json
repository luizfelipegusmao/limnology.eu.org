The aim of the study was to assess the opinions of parents and physicians on the legitimacy and ne-cessity of screening for autism spectrum disorders, potential barriers to the implementation of the screening program, and the evaluation and presenting the process of the online ASD screen-ing, which was part of the validation program of the Polish version of one of the screening tools. The study involved 418 parents whose children were screened online and 95 primary care physi-cians who expressed their opinions in prepared surveys. The results indicate that both parents and doctors perceive the need to screen children for ASD in general population without a clear preference as to the screening method (online or in-person). Online screening may prove to be at least a partial method of solving numerous indicated systemic difficulties - including: time con-straints, lack of experienced specialists in the field of developmental disorders or related to the organizational difficulties of health care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"689c2aa73cd21a097ce814b052ee2a10633dd85dfba49ca61d5a27404268a4ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
