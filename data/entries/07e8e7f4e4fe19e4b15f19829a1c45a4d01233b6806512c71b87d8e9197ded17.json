{"title":"Quantum Dynamics under Gravitational Potential; Insights from Gravitational-Redshift","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0393/v4","date":1713184790000,"content":"This short paper briefly explores the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity, drawing from the principle of gravitational redshift and bringing it into quantum mechanical frameworks. The exploration looks through quantum mechanical relations and equations such as Planck-Einstein relation, De-Broglieâ€™s relation and the relativistic wave equations, and propagators, accounting for the presence of gravitational fields through gravitational redshift of its momentum.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07e8e7f4e4fe19e4b15f19829a1c45a4d01233b6806512c71b87d8e9197ded17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
