{"title":"Mapping mutational fitness effects across the coxsackievirus B3 proteome reveals distinct profiles of mutation tolerability","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002709","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Beatriz Álvarez-Rodríguez, Sebastian Velandia-Álvarez, Christina Toft, Ron Geller</p>\r\n\r\nRNA viruses have notoriously high mutation rates due to error-prone replication by their RNA polymerase. However, natural selection concentrates variability in a few key viral proteins. To test whether this stems from different mutation tolerance profiles among viral proteins, we measured the effect of &gt;40,000 non-synonymous mutations across the full proteome of coxsackievirus B3 as well as &gt;97% of all possible codon deletions in the nonstructural proteins. We find significant variation in mutational tolerance within and between individual viral proteins, which correlated with both general and protein-specific structural and functional attributes. Furthermore, mutational fitness effects remained stable across cell lines, suggesting selection pressures are mostly conserved across environments. In addition to providing a rich dataset for understanding virus biology and evolution, our results illustrate that incorporation of mutational tolerance data into druggable pocket discovery can aid in selecting targets with high barriers to drug resistance.","author":"Beatriz Álvarez-Rodríguez","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"f47af0ef9d4c89a1676a6395a1be12e0aa0a1e54b3b3b8e40f0ffdafd0324320","category":"Environment"}
