{"title":"Mourning Lost Parts: An Art-Based Response to Experiences in/of a Neurorehabilitation Day Service","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2437/v1","date":1722323454000,"content":"This paper honours the importance of creative practice as a way of staying in touch with the affective dimensions of human situations and experience. Drawing on observations, field notes, and documentation of artistic practice, the author explores the transfer of ‘felt’ experience through an emergent ‘body’ of artwork made in response to experiences and observations in/of a neurorehabilitation day service in the context of an art-based doctoral enquiry (Michaels 2022).[i] Broadening the scope of response art to the performative nature of ‘making’, the ‘work’ of art amplifies the resonance of emotional and sensory affect. This brings an ethics of care to the fore, giving voice to aspects of organisational culture that might easily be lost, as well as the need for time and space to mourn lost parts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b0abc3818a0120d3569e30157c0d47fc9026b28f678d7ff86c01e0954146d93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
