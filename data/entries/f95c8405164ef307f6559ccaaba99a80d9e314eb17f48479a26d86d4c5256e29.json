{"title":"Enhancing Romanian Naval Resilience to Climate Change: Advanced Functional Materials for Green Defence Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0086/v1","date":1725287414000,"content":"Climate change poses a significant threat to European security, implicitly to Romaniaâ€™s naval forces in the Black Sea. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and ocean acidification impact maritime operations, infrastructure, and personnel, with potential ramifications for regional stability. This paper explores the implications of climate change for the Romanian Navy and proposes \"Green Defence\" strategies to enhance resilience and sustainability. These strategies encompass energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, sustainable procurement, and the application of advanced functional materials in naval operations and infrastructure. By adopting a proactive and multifaceted approach, the Romanian Navy can adapt to the changing climate, ensuring operational effectiveness while minimizing environmental impact. This approach aligns with broader European security concerns and contributes to a more sustainable and resilient defence posture in the face of climate-related challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f95c8405164ef307f6559ccaaba99a80d9e314eb17f48479a26d86d4c5256e29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
