{"title":"Synthetic Endocrine Disruptors in Fragranced Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0371/v1","date":1720077178000,"content":"Endocrine disruptors are molecules that can interfere with the proper functioning of the endocrine system and lead to harmful effects in living organisms. This review focuses on the impact of synthetic fragrances, which are commonly found in personal care and household products, on the endocrine system. The article discusses the different types of hormones in the body and how they interact with receptors to produce signals. It also explores how endocrine disruptors can interfere with hormone signaling and transport, leading to adverse effects in the body. This work underscores the crucial need for further research into the impact of synthetic fragrances on the endocrine system and the importance of using safer alternatives in personal care and household products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"357acd8c10d10218a404afe332c92d45f4c73b55e8adf23d3e10a8652b3d5db3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
