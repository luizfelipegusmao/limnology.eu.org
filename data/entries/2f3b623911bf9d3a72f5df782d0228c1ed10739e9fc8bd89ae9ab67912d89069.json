{"title":"Production and Characterization of Hybrid Al6061 Nanocomposites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0304/v1","date":1728030947000,"content":"Aluminum-based hybrid nanocomposites, particularly Al6061 alloy, have gained prominence in the scientific community due to their unique properties, such as high strength, low density, and good corrosion resistance. The production of these nanocomposites involves incorporating reinforcing nanoparticles into the matrix to improve its mechanical and thermal properties. Al6061 hybrid nanocomposites were manufactured using powder metallurgy. Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used as reinforcements. Characterization of the Al6061 hybrid nanocomposites involved analysis of their mechanical properties, such as hardness and tensile strength, as well as their micro and nanometric structures. Techniques such as optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were used to study the distribution of nanoparticles, the grain size of the microstructure, and the presence of defects in the matrix. The results showed that adding reinforcing nanoparticles can significantly improve the properties of Al6061, depending on the amount and type of nanoparticles. However, the agglomeration of the nanoparticles and the difficulty of uniform dispersion remain challenges in manufacturing these nanocomposites. The microstructural evaluation revealed significant grain refinement and improved homogeneity in the hybrid composites, resulting in enhanced mechanical performance. Tensile tests demonstrated that the hybrid Al6061/CNTs/SiC composite exhibited the highest tensile strength of 104 MPa, compared to 63 MPa for the unreinforced Al6061 matrix.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f3b623911bf9d3a72f5df782d0228c1ed10739e9fc8bd89ae9ab67912d89069","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
