{"title":"Zero-Trust Cybersecurity: Procedures and Considerations in Context","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0628/v1","date":1723119273000,"content":"In response to the increasing complexity and sophistication of cyber threats, particularly those enhanced by advancements in artificial intelligence, traditional security methods are proving insufficient. This paper explores the zero-trust cybersecurity framework, which operates on the principle of \"never trust, always verify\" to mitigate vulnerabilities within organizations. Specifically, it examines the applicability of zero-trust principles in environments where large volumes of information are exchanged, such as schools and libraries, highlighting the importance of continuous authentication, least privilege access, and breach assumption. The findings highlight avenues for future research that may help preserve the security of vulnerable organizations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59149a4841d15e7f63d689477554d60ac399363d2b3ac3214e0d1237124757cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
