{"title":"Pectin and Pectin Oligosaccharides Obtained from Agro-Wastes as a Constituents of Soluble Dietary Fibre: Effect on the Stabili-Zation of Intestinal Microbiome and Immunity of Humans and Animals &ndash; a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1062/v1","date":1710772872000,"content":"Regulation of the diet in terms of the content of soluble and insoluble fibre is of great importance from the point of view of dietetics, microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract and immunology of the organism. Dietary fibre plays an important role in maintaining the balance between the con-tinuity of gut mucus production (intestinal mucosa), the stability of the intestinal microbiome composition, the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium and the immune status within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are played by pectin and their metabolic products in the form of pectin oligosaccharides. The main purpose of this review was to focus on pectin, their functions, their impact on the human's health and on some of the most promising prebiotics due to their solubility in the gastrointestinal tract in the form of pectin oligosaccharides. They have the properties of pectin, but have also additional features and postbiotics obtained in fermentation process can affect the intestinal microbiome and GALT-related immunity. They can be obtained from plant agro-wastes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a812402f5658aa05d15784ff12c2f0ab63dde22442276382fb755bcb9bef5768","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
