{"title":"Proteomic Characterization of a Lunasin-Enriched Soybean Extract Potentially Useful in the Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0165/v1","date":1717489892000,"content":"Helicobacter pylori infection affects over 50% of the world population and leads to chronic inflammation and gastric disorders, being the main pathogen correlated to gastric cancer development. The increasing on antibiotic resistance levels is a major global concern and alternative treatments are needed. Soybean peptides and other compounds might be an alternative in the treatment to avoid, eradicate and/or control symptoms of H. pylori infection. This study aimed to characterize a lunasin-enriched soybean extract (LSE) by proteomics tools and to evaluate its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties against H. pylori infection. By LC-MS/MS analysis, 124 proteins were identified, with the 2S albumin (lunasin and large chain subunits) being the fourth most abundant protein (8.9%). Lunasin consisted of 44 amino acid residues and an intramolecular disulfide bond. LSE at a low dose (0.0625 mg/mL) reduced ROS production in both H. pylori-infected and non-infected AGS gastric cells. This led to a significant reduction of 6.71% in the levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-8. LSE also showed antibacterial activity against H. pylori which can be attributed to other soybean proteins and phenolic compounds. Our findings suggest that LSE might be a promising alternative in the management of H. pylori infection and associated symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7486498880803082dce1ae89e86a2fa5a15eb00e87d6b6c1d4281a148b0cea01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
