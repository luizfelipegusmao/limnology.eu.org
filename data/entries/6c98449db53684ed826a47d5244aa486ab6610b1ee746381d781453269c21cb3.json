{"title":"EM algorithm for generalized Ridge regression with spatial covariates","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2871?af=R","date":1726120930000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The generalized Ridge penalty is a powerful tool for dealing with multicollinearity and high-dimensionality in regression problems. The generalized Ridge regression can be derived as the mean of a posterior distribution with a Normal prior and a given covariance matrix. The covariance matrix controls the structure of the coefficients, which depends on the particular application. For example, it is appropriate to assume that the coefficients have a spatial structure when the covariates are spatially correlated. This study proposes an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimating generalized Ridge parameters whose covariance structure depends on specific parameters. We focus on three cases: diagonal (when the covariance matrix is diagonal with constant elements), Matérn, and conditional autoregressive covariances. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and then the method is applied to predict ocean wave heights using wind conditions.</p>","author":"Said Obakrim, \nPierre Ailliot, \nValérie Monbet, \nNicolas Raillard","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmetrics: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4718a208dff669d8713b9a4772fb9e30bd4e6b10bc59ba738841df9ffc8f1e42","entryHash":"6c98449db53684ed826a47d5244aa486ab6610b1ee746381d781453269c21cb3","category":"Environment"}
