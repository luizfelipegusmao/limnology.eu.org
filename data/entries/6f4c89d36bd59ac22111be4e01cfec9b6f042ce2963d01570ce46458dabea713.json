In a second article we study the sum of the extended $(k, t)$--Fibonacci numbers as well as the sums of these odd and even numbers.\\\\ In this article we study the sum of the squares of these numbers with their properties as well as the generating function, the recurrence relation and the Binet formula.\\\\ Finally we particularize these results for the generalized $t$--Leonardo numbers","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f4c89d36bd59ac22111be4e01cfec9b6f042ce2963d01570ce46458dabea713","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
