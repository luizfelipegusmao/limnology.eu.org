In current study, UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS/MS liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis were conducted to characterize the compositional features of the repeated thermal-treated SGW. The total sugar content, total sugar content, total reducing sugar content, total non-reducing sugar content, DPPH, ABTS+, Fe3+ reducing capacity, and the hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities were employed to evaluate the gross contents variation connect with anti-oxidant activities during heat processes. The result revealed the SGW content and antioxidant activity were highly correlated, the 7th SGW sample showed the highest content and the strongest ability on anti-aging capacities. 38 significant common differential markers were screened, by the four compared SGW groups (1- and 3-, 1- and 5-, 1- and 7-, and 1- and 9) through OPLS-DA analysis. The current study showed that the thermal proceeding times could be a vital index value during the recycling operation quality control of SGW, which has a huge potential in anti-aging cosmetic raw materials, In the meanwhile, our results provided a green, sustainable, low-cost thinking of rational application on ginseng resource.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1a7353998b6dd67876b75ecbf4d19afcd448667f35a2dd9c336fe916f0b3803","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
