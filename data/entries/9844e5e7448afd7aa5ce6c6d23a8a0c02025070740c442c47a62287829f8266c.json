{"title":"Aberration Correction for Large-Angle Illumination Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy by Using Iterative Electron Ptychography Algorithms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/226/7641388?rss=1","date":1712275200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Modern aberration correctors in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have dramatically improved the attainable spatial resolution and enabled atomical structure and spectroscopic analysis even at low acceleration voltages (≤80 kV). For a large-angle illumination, achieving successful aberration correction to high angles is challenging with an aberration corrector, which limits further improvements in applications such as super-resolution, three-dimensional atomic depth resolution, or atomic surface morphology analyses. Electron ptychography based on four-dimensional STEM can provide a postprocessing strategy to overcome the current technological limitations. In this work, we have demonstrated that aberration correction for large-angle illumination is feasible by pushing the capabilities of regularized ptychographic iterative engine algorithms to reconstruct 4D data sets acquired using a relatively low-efficiency complementary metal oxide semiconductor camera. We report super resolution (0.71 Å) with large-angle illumination (50–60 mrad) and under 60 kV accelerating voltage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9844e5e7448afd7aa5ce6c6d23a8a0c02025070740c442c47a62287829f8266c","category":"Environment"}
