{"title":"The Evolutionary Framework for Human-Machine Alignment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1250/v1","date":1726546779000,"content":"The rapid development of advanced AI technologies poses serious existential threats and necessitates research on safe and responsible Human-AI alignment. We hypothesize that the evolution of AI may be viewed not as something accidental or artificial, but as a natural part of the evolution of intelligence in living species. This perspective suggests a different view of the Human-AI relationship, where AI is not seen as a threat or a mere enhancement of humans, but as a mean of revealing and establishing true human nature â€” achieving greater freedom and self-determination. While in previous evolutionary stages, more freedom was attained through inculturation, AI can serve as a tool in the next stage by providing a direct connection between individuals and culture, overcoming the limitations of traditional cultural acquisition processes and giving rise to post-human free beings. A specific step-by-step framework rooted in cognitive evolution theories is proposed, along with potential directions for empirical research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce64b1ad156dac2cb26e53a286c5cebaf0130d116a1aa814eb77dd267993f055","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
