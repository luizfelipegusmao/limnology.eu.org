{"title":"Third-Order Nonlinear Semi-Canonical Functional Differential Equations: Oscillation via New Canonical Transform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2187/v1","date":1724937643000,"content":"This paperfocusesontheoscillatorypropertiesofthesemi-canonicalnonlineardelaydifferential equation ofthird-order (δ2(t)(δ1(t)ζ′(t))′)′ + η(t)ζα(τ(t))= 0, t ≥ t0, under theconditions ∞t01δ2(t)dt = ∞ andZ ∞t01δ1(t)dt &lt; ∞. Using the new canonical transform method, we transformed the studied equation into a canonical type equation and then we find the conditions for the oscillation of the studied equation from the canonical equations. The obtained results are new and complement to the existing results mentioned in the literature. Examples are provided to illustrate the importance and novelty of the main results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a19f71c2b39b45f93bb5fc0d9a7eb5ffc186e91500934b05156b50101e1fc6f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
