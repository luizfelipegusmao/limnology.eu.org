{"title":"Parents&rsquo; Participation in Care during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Stay in COVID-19 Era: A Quantitative Observational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0507/v1","date":1709892261000,"content":"Background: During the stay in the neonatal intensive care unit, parents play a crucial role in the care of their infants. Recent studies reported a decrease in parental participation due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic that determined restricted access policies in hospitals. The aim of this study is to describe the barriers to a good parents’ participation during the stay in the neonatal intensive care unit in the COVID-19 era. Methods: A quantitative observational study was carried out. Results: 270 parents participated in this study. Mothers’ participation in care seems to be higher as compared to fathers (p = 0.017). Parents who lived the birth of their first child reported a better level of participation in care when compared to those who lived the birth of their second born (p = 0.005). Parents of extremely preterm neonates reported a lower interaction with their infant if compared to parents of term newborns (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Some more disadvantaged categories have reported lower scores: cultural and linguistic minorities, parents of multiple children and fathers. COVID-19 pandemic made several Family Centred Care activities not possible with a higher impact on those who benefited the most of these facilities. This study was prospectively registered by the IRB-CRRM of the University “G. d’Annunzio” Chieti-Pescara on the 23/01/2024 with registration number CRRM;2023_12_07_01.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"788dae747ff1156a73ef5eae789d06adaf8c61488311eebb959960b07909615e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
