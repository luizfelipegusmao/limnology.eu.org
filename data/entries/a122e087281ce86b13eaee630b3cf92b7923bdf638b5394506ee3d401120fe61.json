Hormonal and enzyme changes in these patients can influence the progression and prognosis of the disease. In this research, the levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melatonin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood of MS patients were studied. Methods: This study involved 50 MS patients and 50 healthy individuals. The levels of ACTH, melatonin, and cortisol in the blood were measured using specific ELISA kits. The data obtained were then analyzed statistically using SPSS software. Results: The findings revealed a significant increase in the levels of cortisol and LDH in MS patients (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a122e087281ce86b13eaee630b3cf92b7923bdf638b5394506ee3d401120fe61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
