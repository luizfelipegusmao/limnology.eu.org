However, their clinical benefits in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the long-term outcomes of image-guided PCI in patients with AMI using data from the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry. A total of 9,271 patients with AMI, who underwent PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stents between November 2011 and December 2015, were retrospectively examined, and target lesion failure (TLF) at 3 years (defined as the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) was evaluated. From the registry, 2,134 patients (23.0%) underwent image-guided PCI (IVUS-guided: n = 1,919 [20.6%]; OCT-guided: n = 215 patients [2.3%]). Based on propensity score matching, image-guided PCI was associated with a significant reduction in TLF (hazard ratio: 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.59â€“0.98, p = 0.035). In addition, the TLF incidence in the OCT-guided PCI group was comparable to that in the IVUS-guided PCI group (5.3% vs 4.7%, p = 0.903). Image-guided PCI, including IVUS and OCT, is associated with favorable clinical outcomes in patients with AMI at 3 years post-intervention. Additionally, OCT-guided PCI is not inferior to IVUS-guided PCI in patients with AMI.","author":"Youngjoon Kwon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3ea6eec833a2987b53e72da2a2a7d71d23930e320cc9f2ba94824444aa7bf8cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
