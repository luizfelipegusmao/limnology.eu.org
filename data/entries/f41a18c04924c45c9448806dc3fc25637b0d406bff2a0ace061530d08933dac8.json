{"title":"Type II metacaspase mediates light-dependent programmed cell death in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2648/7424677?rss=1","date":1700092800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Among the crucial processes that preside over the destiny of cells from any type of organism are those involving their self-destruction. This process is well characterized and conceptually logical to understand in multicellular organisms; however, the levels of knowledge and comprehension of its existence are still quite enigmatic in unicellular organisms. We use Chlamydomonas (<span>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span>) to lay the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) in a unicellular photosynthetic organism. In this paper, we show that while PCD induces the death of a proportion of cells, it allows the survival of the remaining population. A quantitative proteomic analysis aiming at unveiling the proteome of PCD in Chlamydomonas allowed us to identify key proteins that led to the discovery of essential mechanisms. We show that in Chlamydomonas, PCD relies on the light dependence of a photosynthetic organism to generate reactive oxygen species and induce cell death. Finally, we obtained and characterized mutants for the 2 metacaspase genes in Chlamydomonas and showed that a type II metacaspase is essential for PCD execution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f41a18c04924c45c9448806dc3fc25637b0d406bff2a0ace061530d08933dac8","category":"Environment"}
