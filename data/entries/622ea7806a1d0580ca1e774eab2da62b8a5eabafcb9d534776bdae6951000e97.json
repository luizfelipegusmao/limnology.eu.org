{"title":"Multifunctional Coatings Based on Sn, Ni and TiO2 Aggregates with Enhanced Anticorrosion and Antibacterial Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0328/v1","date":1725429289000,"content":"Multifunctional coatings based on Sn-Ni materials with and without titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) incorporation were prepared using the electrochemical deposition technique at 70Â°C. TiO2NPs were dispersed in the electrolyte bath, and their influence on both surface texture, crystalline phase, and properties was investigated. Various techniques such as X-ray phase analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) were used to characterize the prepared coatings. The anti-corrosion effectiveness of the coatings was assessed using potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in an artificial sweat medium, while the bactericidal activity of the composite coatings (the ability to induce cell death) was evaluated in accordance with ISO 27447:2009 test. The influence of the TiO2NPs on the composition, structure and properties of the deposited coatings was established. Particular attention was paid to the relationship between the anticorrosive and bactericidal properties of the coatings and their structure and composition. The synergistic effect of the various properties was investigated and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"622ea7806a1d0580ca1e774eab2da62b8a5eabafcb9d534776bdae6951000e97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
