{"title":"Lipopeptides Produced by Bacillus spp.: Detection of Genes and Meta-analysis of Their Activity Against Phytopathogenic Fungi","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1830/v1","date":1724664613000,"content":"Lipopeptides are bioactive compounds produced by Bacillus spp. This work provides insight into de antifungal activity of lipopeptides through a meta-analysis of published studies, in addition following PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technique, the presence of lipopeptides genes in 20 Bacillus strains were also analyzed. The meta-analysis of published studies showed that iturin, fengycin and surfactin significantly reduced the growth of phytopathogenic fungi. Similarly, when applied to plant tissues, the lipopeptides reduced the severity of damage in plant tissues caused by phytopathogenic fungi. As for the lipopeptides genes detection, we used 20 Bacillus strains reported to have antagonistic activity against various fungal plant pathogens. The PCR amplification study was carried out to detect the genes involved in the synthesis of lipopeptides: ituA for iturin A, fenD for fengycin and srfA for surfactin. Comparative sequence analysis showed a range of 98 to 100% identity with the corresponding genes in several Bacillus species. We observed at least one Bacillus gene in the strains: CBRF5, CBRF15, CBSN67, and CBRM9. In the strain CBRF6, we detected the presence of the fabD and srfAD genes. For the development of natural fungicides to control phytopathogenic fungi, lipopeptides produced by Bacillus spp. could be a useful tool.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c80dbe94f7eedc76a5d1a06a50f2a6fb72586db2deeb21ec2cd90d82ebb0e50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
