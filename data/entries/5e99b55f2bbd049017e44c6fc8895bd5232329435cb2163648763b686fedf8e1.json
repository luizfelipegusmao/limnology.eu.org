{"title":"Socioeconomic inequality and urban-rural disparity of antenatal care visits in Bangladesh: A trend and decomposition analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301106","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Biplab Biswas, Nishith Kumar, Md. Matiur Rahaman, Sukanta Das, Md. Aminul Hoque</p>\r\nBackground <p>Socioeconomic inequality in antenatal care visits is a great concern in developing countries including Bangladesh; however, there is a scarcity of investigation to assess the factors of inequality and these changes over time. In this study, we investigated the trend of socioeconomic inequalities (2004–2017) in 1<sup>+</sup>ANC and 4<sup>+</sup>ANC visits, and extracted determinants contributions to the observed inequalities and urban-rural disparities in Bangladesh over the period from 2011 to 2017.</p> Methods <p>The data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS) conducted in 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2017 were analyzed in this study. The analysis began with exploratory and bivariate analysis, followed by the application of logistic regression models. To measure the inequalities, the Erreygers concentration index was used, and regression-based decomposition analyses were utilized to unravel the determinant’s contribution to the observed inequalities. The Blinder-Oaxaca type decomposition is also used to decompose the urban-rural disparity into the factors.</p> Results <p>Our analysis results showed that the prevalence of 1<sup>+</sup>ANC and 4<sup>+</sup>ANC visits has increased across all the determinants, although the rate of 4+ANC visits remains notably low. The magnitudes of socioeconomic inequality in 4<sup>+</sup>ANC visits represented an irregular pattern at both the national and urban levels, whereas it increased gradually in rural Bangladesh. However, inequalities in 1<sup>+</sup>ANC visits declined substantially after 2011 across the national, rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. Decomposition analyses have suggested that wealth status, women’s education, place of residence (only for 4<sup>+</sup>ANC visits), caesarean delivery, husband education, and watching television (TV) are the main determinants to attribute and changes in the level of inequality and urban-rural disparity between the years 2011 and 2017.</p> Conclusions <p>According to the findings of our study, it is imperative for authorities to ensure antenatal care visits are more accessible for rural and underprivileged women. Additionally, should focus on delivering high-quality education, ensuring the completion of education, reducing income disparity as well as launching a program to enhance awareness about health facilities, and the impact of caesarean delivery.</p>","author":"Biplab Biswas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5e99b55f2bbd049017e44c6fc8895bd5232329435cb2163648763b686fedf8e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
