{"title":"Social facilitation of trotting: Can horses perceive and adapt to the movement of another horse?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309474","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Paulo Moreira Bogossian, Juliana Santos Pereira, Nathalia Felicio da Silva, Ayrton Rodrigo Hilgert, Sarah Raphaela Torquato Seidel, Joice Fülber, Carla Bargi Belli, Wilson Roberto Fernandes</p>\r\n\r\nExercise intensity is prone to be self-regulated in horses exercising freely. The main drivers include social, feeding and escape behaviors, as well as the operant conditioning. We hypothesized that self-regulated exercise intensity may increase due to the presence of another horse exercising ahead. Seven horses were assigned to a 2x2 crossover trial following treadmill familiarization. Video images of a trotting horse were displayed on the wall in front of the experimental unit (Visual), which was positioned in the treadmill. Physiological and behavioral markers were further compared with a control visual stimulus (Co), comprising a racetrack image without horses. Horses were sampled during a constant load exercise test (1) at rest (baseline), (2) after the warm-up (0 – 10<sup>th</sup> minute) and (3) after visual stimulation or control (10<sup>th</sup>– 12<sup>th</sup> minutes of the SET) to quantify plasma lactate and glucose concentration, heart rate, head angle, as well as behavioral markers. Following visual stimulation, heart rate (130.8 ± 27.8 b.p.m.) was higher than control (84.7 ± 15.1 b.p.m., P = .017), as was plasma lactate (Visual ‐ 5.28 ± 1.48 mg/dl; Co -3.27 ± 1.24 mg/dl, P = .042) and head angle (Visual ‐ 36.43 ± 3.69°; Co -25.14 ± 4.88°, P = .003). The prevalence of “ears forward” behavior was also higher following Visual (100% - 7/7) than Co (14% - 1/7, P = .004). These results suggest that visual stimulus (1) was safe and well tolerated and (2) prompted the anaerobic lactic pathways and shifted the behavior to a vigilant state. In conclusion, horses were able to perceive and adapt to a social environment. Our findings validate the use of social facilitation of trotting to encourage horses to move forward avoiding the use of the whip.","author":"Paulo Moreira Bogossian","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ffb3c5413b02f9879a7d143c4ae41902cb9d2c6967825202d7a1404a45d4cd8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
