{"title":"A Novel AI Approach for Assessing Stress Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Based on the Acquisition of Physiological Parameters Imbibed During Daily Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1785/v1","date":1714136277000,"content":"Stress is an inherent sensation of being unable to handle demands and occurrences. If not properly managed, stress can develop into a chronic condition, leading to the onset of additional chronic health issues like cardiovascular illnesses and diabetes. Various stress meters have been suggested in the past, along with diverse approaches for its estimate. However, in the case of more serious health issues such as hypertension and diabetes, the results can be significantly improved. This study presents the design and implementation of a distributed wearable sensor computing platform with multiple channels. The platform aims to estimate stress levels in diabetes patients by utilizing a fuzzy logic algorithm that is based on the assessment of several physiological indicators. Additionally, a mobile application was created to monitor users' stress levels and integrate data on their blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Validation experiments were performed on patients with chronic diabetes, and the initial findings are presented in the study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e9f3244b3c57ff9b22bae96cf7c87afc09419e0cc54419a39ffbabb399b78db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
