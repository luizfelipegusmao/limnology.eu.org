NSTEMI pattern is less frequent in case of myocarditis, but it remains unclear if presence of ST segment elevation in case of myocarditis is related to more severe condition and more damage in myocardium. \nMethods: This is a retrospective study, involving 38 patients, admitted with myocarditis. Patients were divided into two groups â€“ patients with ST segment elevation (STE) pattern in ECG (25) and patients without ST segment elevation (non-STE) pattern (13). The data compared were epidemiology, laboratory and instrumental tests results. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics v26.0.
