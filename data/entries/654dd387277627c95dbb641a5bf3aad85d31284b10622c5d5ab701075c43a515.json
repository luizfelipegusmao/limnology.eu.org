In this study, we report the longest (in duration and distance traveled) and most spatially extensive recorded migration for a silky shark. This shark, tagged with a fin-mount satellite transmitter at the Galapagos Islands, traveled &gt;27,666 km over 546 days, making two westerly migrations into international waters as far as 4755 km from the tagging location. These extensive movements in an area with high international fishing effort highlights the importance of understanding silky shark migrations to inform management practices.</p>","author":"Pelayo Salinas‐de‐León, \nJeremy Vaudo, \nRyan Logan, \nJenifer Suarez‐Moncada, \nMahmood Shivji","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"654dd387277627c95dbb641a5bf3aad85d31284b10622c5d5ab701075c43a515","category":"Environment"}
