{"title":"Strategies to Delay Ethylene-Mediated Ripening in Climacteric Fruits: Implications for Shelf-Life Extension and Postharvest Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2024/v1","date":1719631884000,"content":"Climacteric fruits undergo a characteristic ripening process regulated by ethylene, a key plant hormone. Extending the shelf life of these fruits while preserving their postharvest quality poses a significant challenge for the food industry. This review provides a comprehensive overview of physiological and molecular strategies to delay ethylene-mediated ripening in climacteric fruits and their impact on shelf life, postharvest quality, sensory attributes, and volatile compounds. Additionally, it examines the role of ethylene in fruit ripening analysing various ethylene managing strategies including ethylene inhibitors, ethylene adsorbents and ethylene scavengers by catalytic oxidation The review concludes with future research directions including integrated strategies, environmental considerations and commercial applications for improving postharvest handling and fruit quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8bf572616aef0475aa8d890a986c8793af57bc77ada7ab2eec39bc27ecd622e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
