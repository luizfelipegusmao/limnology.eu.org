In the development of Lithium-ion battery (LiB), the SEM is utilized for structural analyses of the key LiB materials: cathode, anode, and separator [<a href=\"#ozae044.1095-B1\">1</a>]. The Cathodes and the anodes of the LiB are composed of active materials, conductive agents, and binder. Evaluation of the amount/distribution of the binder is crucial because excessive binder reduces the conductivity of the electrodes, and deficient binder weakens the concentrating adhesion of the materials. In general, carbon-based materials are used for the active materials and the conductive agents in the LiB anodes. Although material contrast between these materials and the binder in backscattered electron (BSE) images is hard to obtain because they are both made of light elements, voltage contrast (VC) between them can be visible in secondary electron (SE) images. We reported that the VC between the binder and the active material changed drastically depending on the acceleration voltage under ultra-low-voltage condition [<a href=\"#ozae044.1095-B2\">2</a>]. The binder was observed darker than the carbon-based active material at 50 V. The contrast gradually became lower as the acceleration voltage decreased and almost disappeared at 30 V. When the acceleration voltage decreased further, the binder was observed as particle-like contrast at 20 V, and mirror phenomenon, in which the primary electrons bounced off the sample before they irradiated the sample surface, occurred at the binder at 10 V. Although this complicated behavior in the VC of the binder is presumed to be due to a change in the surface potential depending on the acceleration voltage, detailed principle of the VC formation is still unclear. In addition to the active materials and the conductive agents, a mixture of two components, styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) and carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), is commonly used as the binder for the cathode. Therefore, the cathode material is a complex experimental system in which multiple contrast factors coexist, such as the difference of materials, conductivities, and topography. In this study, we investigated to simplify the experimental system to narrow down the contrast formation factors and studied the principle of the VC formation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"51c223c86d1723aa2479358b1589ca397ec2b1b3b979b98ec915e217d28bbf75","category":"Environment"}
