{"title":"Use of kidney trajectory charts as an adjunct to chronic kidney disease guidelines- a qualitative study of general practitioners","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305605","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Michelle Guppy, Esther Joy Bowles, Paul Glasziou, Jenny Doust</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 11% of the population. General practice is at the forefront of the identification of patients with declining kidney function, and appropriate monitoring and management of patients with CKD. An individualized and patient-centred approach is currently recommended in guidelines, but would be enhanced by more detailed guidance on how this should be applied to different age groups, such as use of a kidney trajectory chart. We explored the opinion of general practitioners (GPs) about the potential utility of kidney trajectory charts.</p> Methods <p>Qualitative study interviewing 27 Australian GPs about their management of chronic kidney disease. GPs were presented with charts that plotted percentiles of kidney function (eGFR) with age and discussed how they would use the charts manage to patients with declining kidney function. GPs’ opinion was sought as to how useful these charts might be in clinical practice.</p> Results <p>Most GPs were positive about the use of kidney trajectory charts to assist them with recognition and management of declining kidney function in general practice: e.g, comments included a “<i>valuable tool</i>”, “<i>a bit of an eye opener”</i>,<i>” will help me explain to the patients”</i>, “<i>I’ll stick it on my wall</i>.<i>”</i>. GPs responded that the charts could help monitor patients, trigger early recognition of a younger patient at risk, and assist with older patients to determine when treatment may not be warranted. GPs also thought that charts could also be useful to motivate patients and help them monitor their own condition.</p> Conclusions <p>Use of percentile charts in conjunction with the current CKD guidelines help support a patient-centred model of care. Kidney trajectory charts can help patients to understand their risk of further kidney damage or decline. Research on the use of these charts in clinical practice should be undertaken to further develop their use.</p>","author":"Michelle Guppy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"04b885fd088ecc7fea2508926a5a30acb3dc9020e711863150e15dd77c8e40ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
