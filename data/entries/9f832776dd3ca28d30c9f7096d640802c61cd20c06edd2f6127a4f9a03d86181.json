For accurate microanalysis of geologic specimens via energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS) or electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), samples are required to be flat and polished to reduce scattering and preferential reabsorption of low-energy characteristic X-rays and to yield robust EBSD diffraction patterns. These samples are usually mechanically polished using progressively finer polishing media, which consequently introduces surficial mechanical defects. These defects range in severity from shallow scratches that may reduce image and microanalysis quality to lattice defects that preclude structural analysis. The most common preparation method for geologic specimens to remove these defects is chemo-mechanical polishing with colloidal silica. While this technique works well for most minerals, it can contaminate samples and is generally ineffective for soft or friable minerals such as phyllosilicates [<a href=\"#ozae044.326-B1\">1</a>]. Despite the broad importance of phyllosilicates in a variety of geologic processes, including hosting slip along faults and plate margins, difficult sample preparation most often requires researchers to study phases that are easier to prepare for EBSD, such as quartz, feldspar, calcite, or amphiboles. This greatly limits the types of samples and, therefore, geologic processes that can be investigated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9f832776dd3ca28d30c9f7096d640802c61cd20c06edd2f6127a4f9a03d86181","category":"Environment"}
