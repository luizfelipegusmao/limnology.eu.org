The high negative bias of the sample creates a strong electrostatic field just above the sample surface, which offers a tool to control the landing energy of electrons down to units or even fractions of electron volts. In addition, the field accelerates and collimates the signal electrons into grounded detectors above and below the sample, ensuring high collection efficiency and high image signal amplification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"674c72f8c831e8ad0a6e3af25b3e91a92ca5304244765b13d7712c91c79bfded","category":"Environment"}
