{"title":"PSIII-3 Evaluation of low-cost cow-side tests in developing a selective dry cow therapy program","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/504/7757558?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Blanket dry cow therapy accounts for approximately one third of antibiotic use on dairies. Selective dry cow therapy (SDCT) is a management strategy that selects quarters or cows to be treated with antibiotics based on herd and/or cow-level criteria. Options for implementing SDCT include both cow-side tests (low-cost, rapid tests and higher cost culture-based SDCT) and historical data (algorithm-based SDCT), or a combination. Considerations made when exploring SDCT options include differences in diagnostic efficacy, cost, etc. The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of common low-cost cow-side tests for diagnosing infection in the development of a SDCT program relative culture-based SCDT. In particular, the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and milk conductivity as measured by Mas-D-Tec were selected given their low input and per cow cost ($17 kit at &lt; $0.10/cow and $400 device with negligible per cow cost, respectively). Late-lactation dairy cows (n = 47) at the University of Georgia Teaching Dairy were enrolled 48 h prior to dry off. On enrollment day, quarter milk samples were aseptically collected, tested utilizing CMT and milk conductivity was recorded. Milk samples were then plated on blood agar, following which, plates were evaluated for microbial growth 48 h later. Quarters were identified as bacteriologically infected or uninfected based on microbial growth. Cow-based SDCT, rather than quarter-based SDCT, was evaluated in this study. Overall, 23.40% of cows were infected at collection. Relative to culture-based selection, the sensitivity and specificity of CMT was 90.9% and 13.9% whereas the sensitivity and specificity conductivity was 81.8% and 27.8%. However, analysis indicated effects seen were not significant (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). As a result of CMT and conductivity not yielding a significant effect, a third, yet more costly, cow-side test was evaluated. Selecting cows based on increased milk somatic cell count (SCC) is a central piece in algorithm-based SDCT. Relative to culture-based selection, SCC as a diagnostic indicator was significant (<span>P</span> = 0.01) with a sensitivity of 90.1% and specificity of 55.6%. The accuracy of SCC as a diagnostic tool was 63.8%. Additional data are needed to fully evaluate the applicability of CMT and conductivity as measured by the Mas-D-Tec, especially when considering the perceived economic benefits of implementing SCDT with rapid, low-cost cow-side tests. Utilization of SCC is a viable option given our findings however initial input costs (&gt;$3,000), per cow screening costs ($3 to $12), and labor are all examples of barriers to implementation. In conclusion, the low-cost, rapid cow-side tests assessed in the current study were not effective as diagnostic tools for SDCT. Considering another cow-side test (SCC) may be necessary for producers interested in reducing antibiotic usage and costs. Dairy producers would realize a 45% decrease in dry cow therapy costs and 42% reduction in antibiotic use.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4c9ac99d35990271a756b3336022a4449f4d2bcba30bc3e07540cf368685432c","category":"Environment"}
