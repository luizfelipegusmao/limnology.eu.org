{"title":"A Critical Analysis of Socioeconomic Determinants Explaining Health Inequalities in Hepatitis B and C Among Male Prisoners in Nigeria: A Narrative Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0910/v1","date":1723547670000,"content":"Viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) poses a significant global health challenge, with an increasing number of deaths and a substantial burden on healthcare systems. This literature review explores the impact of socioeconomic determinants of health (SDoH) on the prevalence and outcomes of HBV and HCV infections among male prison inmates in Nigeria. By examining factors such as risky behaviors, overcrowding, inadequate healthcare access, and food insecurity, this review highlights how these determinants contribute to the high rates of hepatitis infections in Nigerian prisons. The review underscores the urgent need for a multifaceted approach involving policy changes, improved healthcare access, and enhanced preventive measures to address these health disparities. The findings aim to inform public health strategies and interventions to reduce the transmission and impact of viral hepatitis in prison settings, aligning with global health goals and promoting health equity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab2f1fcf88cf9259771928676c474d93be7a4eb39d2d7e650262f856d4a97e93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
