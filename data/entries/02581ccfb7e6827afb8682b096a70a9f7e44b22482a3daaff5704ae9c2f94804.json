{"title":"Measuring the influence of key management decisions on the nitrogen nutritional status of annual ryegrass-based forage crops","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0101/v1","date":1719831331000,"content":"Increasing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by improving agricultural practices, soil knowledge and implementing precision agriculture, is essential to reduce the overuse of fertilisers and increase nutrient retention. This study aimed to optimise N management in agriculture by establishing a critical N dilution curve (CNDC) and analysing variations in NUE and N nutrition index (NNI) among different crops under various treatments. Using a Bayesian model, the CNDC was determined as %Nc = 3.63 * PDM-0.71. The results presented that plant dry matter (PDM) and plant N content (PNC) varied significantly with crop type and sampling moments. Strong positive correlations are presented by PDM with N uptake (NUp) (0.89) and NNI (0.88), along with an inverse correlation with critical N concentration (-0.95). The study found that crops under irrigation conditions had higher NUp and higher NNI. This study provides valuable insights into the influence of key management decisions on the N nutritional status of annual ryegrass-based forage crops. The results highlight the critical role of accurate and conscious decision-making in improving NUE and crop yields, emphasising the complex interactions between biomass production and N dynamics in crops. The conclusions allow significant benefits to be realised, contributing to the sustainability of agricultural systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02581ccfb7e6827afb8682b096a70a9f7e44b22482a3daaff5704ae9c2f94804","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
