{"title":"Analysing the Functional Behaviour of Gear Components Made from PA6 Polymer Using Additive Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1129/v1","date":1724120058000,"content":"This research will investigate how heat treatments affect the behaviour of 3D printed gears made from Polyamide 6 (PA6), a thermoplastic polymer with excellent mechanical properties. However, imperfect structures can result from the 3D printing process, which involves rapid cooling of the molten polymer. Gears were manufactured from PA6 by means of a dedicated 3D printer and their behaviour in gears was then analysed by means of various specific test protocols. Some of the gears were subjected to annealing heat treatments to determine material behaviour, which was a key aspect of this study. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to investigate the effect of heat treatments on the mechanical properties of PA6 thermoplastic material, specifically in the area of 3D printed gear mechanisms. The simulations included both static and transient conditions to determine the influence of different heat treatments on the mechanical properties of PA6. Through the use of comprehensive FEA, the research investigates the deformation, stress distribution and strain rates in 3D printed gears and elucidates the correlation between the mechanical properties and the contact pressure on the tooth flanks during gear operation. As conclusion the study mainly uses numerical simulations based on mechanical characteristics determined in our laboratory. The contribution of the study lies in the novelty of highlighting, through the results obtained, the influence of heat treatments on wear and mechanical stress related factors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c803dc16818cbd5dd1c3fc2ff3852a4a50c34febd6c5c754ed85e81d67fb3442","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
