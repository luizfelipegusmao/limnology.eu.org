A prompt assessment of individual and herd immunity against the infection can be accomplished by using rapid tests to determine antiviral antibody levels. The microneutralization assay (MN) is one of the most widely used diagnostic methods that has been proposed to assess the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of virus-specific humoral immunity in COVID-19 convalescents or vaccine recipients. However, some aspects of the assay, such as sensitivity and time cost, need improvement. Here, we developed an express test, which may be potentially used in clinical practice for the assessment of serum-caused SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in infected cell cultures. It implies the detection and counting of coronaviral fluorescent-forming units (FFU) and includes two sequentially used developing components: biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1) and the recombinant EGFP-streptavidin fusion protein. Due to the universal specificity of the antibodies, our analytical tool is suitable for the detection of various strains of SARS-CoV-2 when determining both the infectious titer of viruses and the titer of serum virus-neutralizing antibodies. The developed two-component test system is characterized by high sensitivity, a reduced number of analytic stages and low assay cost, as well as by flexibility, since it may be modified for detection of other pathogens using the appropriate antibodies.","author":"Alexandra Rak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9244df8ffebe45e2965ef25bfb379fde21f74b9d4317d4ebd5cdd2baf638e273","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
