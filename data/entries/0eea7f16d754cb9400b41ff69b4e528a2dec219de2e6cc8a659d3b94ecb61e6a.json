{"title":"MINOCA of Ischemic, Non-atherosclerotic Cause: Pathophysiological Approach of Diagnosis and Prognosis &ndash; a Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0674/v1","date":1723198470000,"content":"Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) is a clinical entity characterized by the absence of significant coronary artery obstruction in epicardial arteries (&amp;lt; 50%) on coronary angiography in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This article aims to provide a narrative review of the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic challenges, and prognosis associated with MINOCA focusing only on cases associated with myocardial ischemia but of non-atherosclerotic origin. Etiological factors, including thromboembolism, coronary artery spasm, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, coronary microvascular disease, and supply-demand mismatch are addressed. Imaging modalities such as echocardiography, advances in coronary angiography like intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) are also analyzed. MINOCA patients have a better short-term prognosis compared to those with obstructive coronary artery disease but face significant long-term risks, underscoring the need for precise diagnosis and management strategies. Elevated inflammatory markers and specific genetic predispositions are also associated with adverse outcomes in MINOCA. This review focused on MINOCA from the pathophysiological perspective on ischemic, non-atherosclerotic causes, the diverse underlying mechanisms, the challenges in achieving accurate diagnosis, the importance of a tailored therapeutic approach and the necessity for further investigation of clinical outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0eea7f16d754cb9400b41ff69b4e528a2dec219de2e6cc8a659d3b94ecb61e6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
