Its exceptional ability to carry high currents in magnetic fields, along with its mechanical resilience, positions it as a promising solution for advanced magnet applications. The REBCO conductors exhibit superconductivity at significantly higher temperatures than conventional low-temperature superconductors [<a href=\"#ozae044.217-B1\">1-3</a>]. In this present study, we characterize and explore the microscale defects layer thickness on a commercial REBCO-coated conductor and correlate it with the in-field transport critical current (I<sub>c</sub>) at a fixed orientation and critical current density (J<sub>c</sub>) calculated using the equation:</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2ccac5cbca6f29533c1363eb99238edccc619b336a84664873d6afb68ac30614","category":"Environment"}
