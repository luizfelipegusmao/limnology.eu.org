{"title":"Recent Advances in Molecular Diagnostic Methods for Foodborne Pathogens with a Focus on Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1662/v1","date":1724364714000,"content":"This article discusses advances in molecular technologies for detecting foodborne pathogens, specifically Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. Although traditional detection methods are reliable, they are time- and labor-intensive. On the other hand, molecular methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS), which enable rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of pathogens. The introduction of such procedures has significantly improved food safety testing and monitoring. Although challenges such as accessibility and cost remain, future developments in molecular diagnostics will lead to greater implementation in improving pathogen management throughout the food supply chain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09cbe8baac69ffddeb60200585e8ce62423e4da2aab7a0d4ecfcb9018c636312","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
