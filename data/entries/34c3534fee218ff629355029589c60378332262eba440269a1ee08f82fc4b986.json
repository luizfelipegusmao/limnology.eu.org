{"title":"Gynecological Laparoscopic Surgeries under Spinal Anesthesia: Benefits and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0269/v1","date":1714977685000,"content":"Objective: This prospective study investigated the feasibility performing laparoscopic pelvic surgery in spinal anesthesia and analyzed their intraoperative side effects like pain and nausea and vomitus of 915 patients. \nMethods: Implementation and performance of laparoscopic surgery under local anes-thesia of 915 patients out of a total of 3212, who underwent laparoscopic pelvic surgery in spinal anesthesia, were analyzed in relation to BMI (Body Mass Index), obesity, pain during surgery and amount of intraperitoneal mmHg CO2 gas pressure and surgical complications. \nResults: BMI &gt; 30, intraabdominal adhesions, increased duration of the operation, bleeding and increased intraperitoneal CO2 pressure were statistically significant as the main causes of pain during laparoscopic surgery in spinal anesthesia. Under-weight patients, on the other hand, had less pain when intra-abdominal pressure in-creased compared to those of normal weight. The appearance of pain, nausea and vomitus occurred in 10,3% and was easy to manage and treat. It did not affect the sur-geon's work and the course of the operation. \nConclusion: In view of these observations, we are proposing spinal anesthesia for lap-aroscopic surgery as the first choice in those patients, who have no contraindications. In our knowledge this clinical study constitutes the largest clinical observations and dataset that applies spinal anesthesia in laparoscopic pelvic surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34c3534fee218ff629355029589c60378332262eba440269a1ee08f82fc4b986","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
