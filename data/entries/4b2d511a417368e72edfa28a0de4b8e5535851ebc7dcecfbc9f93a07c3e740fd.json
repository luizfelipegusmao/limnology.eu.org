{"title":"Research on Biomass and Biochar of Reed (Phragmites australis) in U Minh Thuong National Park, Vietnam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1025/v1","date":1715839894000,"content":"Reed (Phragmites autralis) is a plant species with a seasonal reproductive cycle, it has a very high biomass in U Minh Thuong National Park. This characteristic that management of forest fire is dificult in Vietnam. To evaluate height, diameter, density, growth, biomass of fresh and dry, biochar on reed plants; it include plant, stem, leaves, flowers; analysis indicators of growth, biomass, biochar on reed. compare chemical indicators of peat and biochar in U Minh Thuong and Kien Luong of Mekong Delta. Relationship of peat chemical with growth and biomass. Study adsorption from reed biochar with pig urine and inorganic chemical of nitrogen and phosphorus. Study on types of peatland thickness, each one had 5 plots, investigated height (Ht), diameter of stem (D0.0); weigh part of plants, stems, leaves and flowers. the soil samples collected on investigated 20 plots, biochar is analyzed for its chemical composition, then the biochar is adsorbed with pig urine and phosphorus and nitrogen inorganic. The results evaluated fresh biomass on parts of reed plant, dry biomass and biochar on parts of them. Results height 3.39 – 4.74 m, diemeter 1.8 – 3.17 cm, biomass 0.04 – 0.1 m3 / m2, weight 15.46 – 20.54 kg / m2. The dry weight / plant 127.34 – 358.58 g, a dry plant trunk 79.55 – 217.78 g, a dry plant leaves 33.78 – 112.16 g, a dry plant flowers 4.4 – 19.64 g. A plant Biochar 26.16 – 73.57 g, a trunk biochar 14.41 – 39.44 g, a leaf biochar 8.16 – 22.59 g, a flower biochar 2.59 – 11.54 g, Peat analysis, indicators decrease P2O5, SO42-, NH4+ and increase are pH, humic acid, N%, K2O, Fe2+. Compare biochar indicators of U Minh Thuong and Kien Luong indicators higher are 9/11 as humic acid, OM%, Ash%, C%, N%, P%, K%, Ca%, Mg%. Indicators lower are as pH and SiO. Reed biochar can adsorption the pig urine as ammonium, nitrate, nitrogen, phosphorus and it also adsorption inorganic as nitrogen and phosphorus. This discovery it is possible to propose the use of data for environment treatment and application of biochar fertilizer for agriculture in region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b2d511a417368e72edfa28a0de4b8e5535851ebc7dcecfbc9f93a07c3e740fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
