{"title":"Scratch Resistance of a Plasma-Assisted Duplex Treated 17&ndash;4 Ph Stainless Steel Additively Manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1517/v1","date":1711432219000,"content":"Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing of metals is gaining popularity due to its flexibility in fabricating parts with highly complex designs, as well as simplifying manufacturing steps and optimizing process times. In this investigation, 17-4 PH stainless steel was additively manufactured using Laser-Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF), followed by functionalization through a DUPLEX treatment. This treatment involved a plasma-assisted nitriding process, followed by deposition of an arc-PVD c-Al0.7Cr0.3N hard coating. The microstructural modifications resulting from plasma nitriding (such as the formation of Fe2,3N and Fe4N, and the Î±N or expanded martensite phases), and the surface improvements with the c-Al0.7Cr0.3N coating on the 3D-printed 17-4 PH steel, are evaluated in comparison to conventionally manufactured 17-4 PH steel. These microstructural characteristics are correlated with the mechanical response of the treated surfaces. As a result of the plasma nitriding process, the hardness of the 3D-printed 17-4 PH SS increased by approximately 260%. The wear, measured through dynamic and static scratch-testing, was reduced by approximately 31%. This improvement was attributed to the modification of adhesive failure mechanisms, leading to a reduction in wear volume, improved coating adhesion, and enhanced scratch resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7dec6132722bc44efae0d4bba7b7ee35e7dcf859dde989a2ac0471076b820181","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
