This study employed a comprehensive methodology to analyze groundwater in the Western Banat Plain (Serbia). Using Piper and Gibbs plots, hydrogeochemistry was assessed, while the entropy-weighted water quality index (<i>EWQI</i>) was used to evaluate groundwater quality. Pollution sources were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF) accompanied by Pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis, while Monte Carlo simulation assessed health risks associated with groundwater consumption. Results showed that groundwater, mainly Ca–Mg–HCO<sub>3</sub> type, is mostly suitable for drinking. Geogenic pollution, agricultural activities, and sewage were major pollution sources. Consumption of contaminated groundwater poses serious non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks. Additionally, arsenic from geogenic source was found to be the main health risks contributor, considering its worryingly elevated concentration, ranging up to 364 μg/L. These findings will be valuable for decision-makers and researchers in managing groundwater vulnerability.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nGroundwater is severely contaminated with As in the northern part of the study area.\nThe predominant hydrochemical type of groundwater in the area is Ca–Mg–HCO<sub>3</sub>.\nThe PMF method apportioned three groundwater pollution sources.\nMonte Carlo identified rock dissolution as the primary health risk contributor.\nHealth risks and mortality in the study area are positively correlated.\n</p>","author":"Jelena Vesković, \nSandra Bulatović, \nSlavica Ražić, \nMilica Lučić, \nAndrijana Miletić, \nAleksandra Nastasović, \nAntonije Onjia","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"1e33fb7ac1869bfcfb5169e23db28ff0ef2661ae5f68827e8f5f2e67fdb94161","category":"Environment"}
