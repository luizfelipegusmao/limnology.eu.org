{"title":"Application of the Discrete Wavelet Transform to Damage Detection in a Guy Cable of Guyed Antenna Mast","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1259/v1","date":1711005612000,"content":"The paper delves into the critical issue of damage detection within the guy cable of a truss steel mast, a pivotal component in structural integrity. It introduces a model wherein damage manifests as a localized cross-section reduction in a single element of the cable. Employing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a pioneering methodology, the study scrutinizes the behavior of the affected elements through static structural analyses. Signal decomposition via the Mallat pyramid algorithm facilitates comprehensive examination. Static displacements at the connection point between the cable and the truss mast serve as the measured variables. Through systematic investigation, the paper evaluates the impact of damage size and location, external loading force, and cable tension force on the efficacy of the proposed approach. Utilizing data derived from Finite Element Method (FEM) computations for wavelet analysis the authors substantiate the findings with numerical examples, thus offering valuable insights into damage detection strategies for structural health monitoring and engineering applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6168d8c71746883cba4980c88155184e4899c161f6fbb49d318c62a61c1c0beb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
