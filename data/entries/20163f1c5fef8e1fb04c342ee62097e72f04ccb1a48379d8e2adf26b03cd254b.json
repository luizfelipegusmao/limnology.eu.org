{"title":"Factors influencing the implementation of integrated screening for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B for pregnant women in Nepal: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003006","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Lucie Sabin, Hassan Haghparast-Bidgoli, Bibhu Thapaliya, Obindra Chand, Sanju Bhattarai, Abriti Arjyal, Naomi Saville</p>\r\n\r\nIn Nepal, national guidelines recommend free HIV and syphilis screening for pregnant women at their first antenatal visit, using an opt-out approach. However, screening uptake is low and the guidelines do not include hepatitis B screening. It is essential to understand the factors influencing the implementation of integrated screening for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B, as recommended by WHO, to improve uptake and prevent vertical transmission. This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of pregnant women, their families, healthcare providers and policymakers on integrated prenatal screening. We conducted 12 in-depth interviews with pregnant women, 10 with their husbands and 4 with mothers-in-law in Kapilvastu and Kathmandu. In addition, we interviewed 7 health workers and 4 decision-makers. These interviews were sufficient to reach saturation. Data were analysed using a thematic content analysis. A combination of the social-ecological model and the WHO building blocks provided a theoretical framework for interpreting data. The analysis showed that antenatal screening in Nepal involved many stakeholders and was influenced by various factors. Implementation issues were found in the building blocks service delivery, health workforce and medical products. Husbands and in-laws play an important role in the acceptance of screening by pregnant women, especially in rural areas. High levels of stigma and discrimination against people with sexually transmitted diseases were reported, and knowledge of hepatitis B and syphilis was low. Access and uptake of screening could be improved through rapid testing, by strengthening the health system and by integrating hepatitis B screening through an opt-out approach like that for HIV and syphilis. Effective community involvement through awareness campaigns and investment in lower-level health facilities is essential to improve screening rates. This study provides information for decision-makers about challenges in implementing integrated screening to guide the design of targeted interventions to reduce vertical transmission.","author":"Lucie Sabin","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"20163f1c5fef8e1fb04c342ee62097e72f04ccb1a48379d8e2adf26b03cd254b","category":"Environment"}
