{"title":"Authentication and Access Control Mechanisms to Secure IoT Environments: A comprehensive SLR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0948/v1","date":1715673311000,"content":"Due to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), securing communications between a huge number of devices has become very difficult. Access controls and authentication secure the connection between IoT devices and protect sensitive data from unauthorized users or malicious attackers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review to emphasize the critical role of authentication and access control in securing IoT environments. This paper explores different types of access controls, like Attribute-Based Access Control and Role-Based Access Control. Furthermore, it demonstrates different authentication techniques, like passwords and biometrics. Based on the previous mechanisms, we discuss different IoT security challenges regarding authentication and access control mechanisms and highlight future directions. In addition, this paper investigates the integration between access control and authentication to safeguard IoT communications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2f6f26f018368f05187a3705d6ec3325a3440c03e8ecbffe6a76616e2c75073","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
