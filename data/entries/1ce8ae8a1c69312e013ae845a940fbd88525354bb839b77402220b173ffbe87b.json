At present, designing special hydraulic structures is an effective way to reduce the intensity of aeration. In this paper, three engineering structure schemes were designed, and the three-dimensional Realizable <i>k–ε</i> turbulence model was used. The volume of fluid method was introduced to capture the free water surface, and the unstructured grid was used to construct the two-phase turbulent flow field. The aeration concentration and pressure distribution, obtained by numerical simulation, were basically consistent with the physical model test results. The results showed that the flow field at the orifice plates of cases 1 and 2 changed drastically, and the turbulent kinetic energy downstream of the orifice plate decreased with the increase of the number of holes. As for case 3, it showed that the high-speed water flow fell into the water cushion pool, tumbling and sucking up a lot of air, and the turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stress were significantly greater than the other two cases. The hydraulic structure changed the cavitation characteristics of the downflow water, and the sequence of aeration concentration of the horizontal section was case 3 &gt; case 1 &gt; case 2. The aeration concentration was only 9.18%–17.86% in case 2. The aeration concentration at stable time is expressed as a function of the relative water depth <i>y/y</i>\n<sub>90</sub> and the turbulent diffusion coefficient <i>D</i>. The distribution formula of aeration concentration was established, and its validity was verified by literatures. The results of this study will provide a certain reference for in-depth analysis of water–air mixing motion characteristics, and simultaneously, it will have a guiding significance for the design of siphon well defoaming engineering.</p>","author":"Da Liu, \nHui Lin, \nBensheng Huang, \nXiangju Cheng, \nLubin Sun","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"1ce8ae8a1c69312e013ae845a940fbd88525354bb839b77402220b173ffbe87b","category":"Environment"}
