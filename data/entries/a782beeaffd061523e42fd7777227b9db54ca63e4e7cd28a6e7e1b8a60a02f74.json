However, there are no standardized, validated survey-based approaches to enable accurate assessment of child exposure to zoonotic enteropathogens. We developed and validated a survey-based measure of exposure, the fecal-oral child exposure to zoonotic enteropathogens Index (the FECEZ Enteropathogens Index). First, we identified critical attributes of child exposure through in-depth interviews (IDIs) in Ecuador among individuals who care for animals (<i>n</i> = 29) and mothers of children under two years old (<i>n</i> = 58), and through a systematic review of existing exposure measures. Second, based on these findings, we developed a 105-question survey and administered it to 297 mothers with children under age five. Third, we refined the survey, using principal component analysis to determine the optimal number of components. The final index consisted of 34 items across two sub-domains: the child <i>Environment</i> and child <i>Behavior</i>. Lastly, we compared index scores to two commonly used, unvalidated measures of child exposure–maternal reported household animal ownership and presence of animal feces. Using the FECEZ Enteropathogens Index revealed varying degrees of exposure in our study population, with only two children having no exposure. In contrast, if we had used animal ownership or the presence of animal feces as a measure of exposure, 44% and 33% of children would have been classified as having no exposure, respectively. These common binary exposure measures may be inadequate because they do not provide sufficient information to identify the relative risk of zoonotic pathogen exposure. The FECEZ Enteropathogens Index overcomes this limitation, advancing our ability to assess exposure by quantifying the multiple components of child exposure to zoonotic enteropathogens with higher resolution. Additional testing and evaluation of the index is needed to ensure its reliability, validity, and cross-cultural equivalence in other contexts.","author":"April M.
