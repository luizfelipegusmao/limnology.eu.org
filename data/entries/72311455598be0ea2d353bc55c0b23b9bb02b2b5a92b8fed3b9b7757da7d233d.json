{"title":"Nanostructured Solid/Liquid Acid Catalysts for Glycerol Esterification: The Key to Convert Liability into Assets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1495/v1","date":1711381188000,"content":"Owing to the growing concerns due to dwindling fossil fuel reserves, increasing energy demand and climate emergency, it is imperative to develop and deploy sustainable energy technologies to ensure future energy supply as well as transition to the net zero world. In this context, there is great potential in the biorefinery concept for supplying drop in biofuels in the form of biodiesel. Biodiesel as a fuel can certainly bridge the gap where electrification or the use of hydrogen is not feasible, for instance heavy vehicles, farm and marine transportation sector. However, biodiesel industry also leads to formation of large amount of crude glycerol as the byproduct. Crude glycerol due to presence of several impurities may not be a suitable feedstock for all high value products derived from glycerol but fits well with glycerol esterification for producing glycerol acetins, which have numerous applications. This review critically looks at the processes using nanostructured solid/liquid acid catalysts for glycerol esterification including the economic viability of the scale up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72311455598be0ea2d353bc55c0b23b9bb02b2b5a92b8fed3b9b7757da7d233d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
