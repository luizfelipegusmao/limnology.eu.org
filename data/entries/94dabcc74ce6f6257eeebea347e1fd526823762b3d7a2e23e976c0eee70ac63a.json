{"title":"Impact of milling on the nutrients and anti‐nutrients in browntop millet (Urochloa ramosa) and its milled fractions: evaluation of their flour functionality","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13382?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Browntop millet has gained popularity in recent years owing to its nutritional superiority and health benefits. However, the usage of browntop millet flours as ingredients in composite flours and functional foods is constrained due to a lack of information regarding the grain composition and its flour functionality. Therefore, the distribution of nutrients, anti-nutrients in browntop millet milled fractions and their flour functionality was evaluated in comparison to whole grain flour.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Bran fraction comprised the highest protein (13.7%) and fat contents (27%) among other fractions. Pearling of dehulled grains considerably reduced phytic acid, saponins and flatulence-causing oligosaccharides in pearled grain flours. Besides, this led to the enrichment of soluble fibre, minerals, phenolics and trypsin inhibitors in bran fraction. Milling also impacted flour functionality. Despite its lower water holding ability, dehulled grain flour exhibited significantly higher oil absorption capacity than whole grain flour due to the removal of fibre-rich hull fraction. Although emulsion (45.2%) and foaming capacities (12.5%) were superior in bran flour, foam stability was greater in pearled grain flours.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings suggest the potential utilisation of browntop millet milled flours as ingredients in the development of distinct food formulations and as partial substitutes to wheat flour in confectionary and bakery products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Raghavakumari R.
