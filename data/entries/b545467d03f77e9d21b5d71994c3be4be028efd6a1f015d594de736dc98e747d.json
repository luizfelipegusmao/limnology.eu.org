{"title":"One-Pot Synthesis of Pd Nanoparticles Supported on Carbide-Derived Carbon for Oxygen Reduction Reaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0355/v1","date":1715072715000,"content":"Two methods for Pd nanoparticle synthesis were explored with three different carbide-derived carbon (CDC) support materials of which one was nitrogen-doped. These materials were studied for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The prepared CDC/Pd catalysts were characterized using TEM, XRD and XPS. Using these methods, we can observe the influence of support materials for one-pot synthesis methods as we use the standard citrate method and polyol method with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent. Comparing the two methods N-doping of carbon material resulted in smaller nanoparticles only in the case of citrate synthesis, suggesting that the influence of support is weaker using polyol method. Citrate method on CDC1, which was predominantly microporous led to a higher degree of agglomeration and larger particle formation in comparison to CDC2 and CDC3 supports, which possessed higher degree of mesoporosity. Smaller Pd particle sizes were achieved using citrate and NaBH4 in comparison to the ethylene glycol-PVP method. CDC2 and CDC3 did not show significant difference suggesting that the N-doping did not have much of an influence on the ORR. Highest SA value was observed on CDC1/Pd_Cit, which could be attributed to formation of larger particles and agglomerates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b545467d03f77e9d21b5d71994c3be4be028efd6a1f015d594de736dc98e747d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
