{"title":"65 Effect of two different implant programs on growth performance and carcass characteristics in beef steers fed to three differing harvest endpoints","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/49/7665002?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two implant programs (Merck Animal Health, DeSoto, KS and Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) and 3 d on feed (DOF) endpoints were used to evaluate growth performance and carcass characteristics of finishing beef steers. Beef steers [n = 480; initial body weight (BW) = 402; SEM = 2.4 kg] were assigned to treatment pens (10 steers/pen) with pen (n = 48 pens total) as the experimental unit. Treatments were arranged as a 2 x 3 factorial including implant program: 1) a single Revalor-XS (200 mg trenbolone acetate and 40 mg estradiol-17β total) on d 0 (XS) compared with 2) Synovex-Choice (100 mg trenbolone acetate and 14 mg estradiol benzoate) on d 0 and re-implanted with a Synovex-ONE Feedlot (200 mg trenbolone acetate and 28 mg estradiol benzoate) 70 d later (CHSOF) and harvest endpoint: 1) 162 DOF, 2) 183 DOF, or 3) 204 DOF. Both implant groups were removed from their pens on the day of reimplantation. Data were analyzed as a RCBD. Final BW was calculated as HCW/0.625. An implant × DOF (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04) interaction was noted for gain to feed ratio (G:F), REA, final BW adjusted to 28% estimated empty body fatness (AFBW), and USDA quality grade distribution, a tendency for an interaction was observed for final BW, average daily gain (ADG), HCW, and dressing percentage (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.09), no other interactions were noted for any traits evaluated (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.17). Steers from CHSOF/162 had increased G:F by 4.1 to 6.5% compared with others (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05). Steers from XS/204 had greater REA by 3% to 10% (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) compared with all other treatments and greater AFBW by 3% to 7% (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05), compared with all other treatments except CHSOF/204. Steers from XS had a greater proportion of carcasses grading USDA Prime at 162 and 183 DOF compared with CHSOF. As a result of increased DOF, the XS/204 and CHSOF/204 steers had greater final BW and HCW compared with all other treatments (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05), steers from XS/183 had greater HCW than XS/162 and CHSOF/162; however, CHSOF/183 did not differ from CHSOF/162 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05). Steers from CHSOF/162 had greater ADG by 5.8% compared with CHSOF/183 (<span>P</span> = 0.05), while all others were intermediate. Dressing percentage was the greatest for XS/204 and least for CHSOF/183 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05). Cattle from XS had increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) DMI by 2.6%. As DOF increased, carcass-adjusted final BW increased while ADG decreased (linear; <span>P</span> = 0.05). As DOF increased, REA and AFBW increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Increasing DOF, increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) USDA yield grade 4 and 5 carcasses and decreased yield grade 2 and 3 carcasses. Implant strategy had a marginal influence on growth performance and carcass characteristics; however, as DOF increased carcass weights, rib fat, and ribeye area increased.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"68adb0100fd6a4eab8b578215bd1ce67c3b64a22c040387925a35760ab9b68b7","category":"Environment"}
