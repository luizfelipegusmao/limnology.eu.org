{"title":"Systematic review of translational insights: Neuromodulation in animal models for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308556","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Rahul Mittal, Keelin McKenna, Grant Keith, Evan McKenna, Rahul Sinha, Joana R. N. Lemos, Khemraj Hirani</p>\r\n\r\nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is a prevalent and debilitating complication of diabetes, affecting a significant proportion of the diabetic population. Neuromodulation, an emerging therapeutic approach, has shown promise in the management of DPN symptoms. This systematic review aims to synthesize and analyze the current advancements in neuromodulation techniques for the treatment of DPN utilizing studies with preclinical animal models. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were focused on studies utilizing preclinical animal models for DPN that investigated the efficacy of various neuromodulation techniques, such as spinal cord stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and peripheral nerve stimulation. The findings suggest that neuromodulation significantly alleviated pain symptoms associated with DPN. Moreover, some studies reported improvements in nerve conduction velocity and reduction in nerve damage. The mechanisms underlying these effects appeared to involve modulation of pain pathways and enhancement of neurotrophic factors. However, the review also highlights the variability in methodology and stimulation parameters across studies, highlighting the need for standardization in future research. Additionally, while the results are promising, the translation of these findings from animal models to human clinical practice requires careful consideration. This review concludes that neuromodulation presents a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for DPN, but further research is necessary to optimize protocols and understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. It also emphasizes the importance of bridging the gap between preclinical findings and clinical applications to improve the management of DPN in diabetic patients.","author":"Rahul Mittal","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"11793207e5040c8bc54a0dc9189e9ef00653adde1dd25fc4b0f49146d7cf21d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
