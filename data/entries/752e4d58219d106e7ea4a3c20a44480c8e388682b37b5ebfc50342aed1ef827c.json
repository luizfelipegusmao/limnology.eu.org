{"title":"Development Of Technology For Providing An-timicrobial Properties To Medical Disposable Masks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0056/v1","date":1727780553000,"content":"Wearing masks to protect against communicable diseases is an effective tool used in many coun-tries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibacterial activity, antibacterial efficiency, micro-bial purity and breathability properties of medical disposable masks are very important. Ag is most commonly applied to antimicrobial textiles, but several studies are known about Ag nano-particles. In this work three antimicrobial additives were used. One of them Rudolf GmBH's RUCO-BAC AGP with silver chloride (AgCl) active ingredient also has antimicrobial activity. Four compositions of the binders with antimicrobial additives were prepared and applied to one-layer nonwoven PP material using screen printing, knife over roll coating and laminating machine methods. The influence of the binder antimicrobial polymer coating on the breathabil-ity and antibacterial activity of the nonwoven PP material was evaluated. Results had showed that the composition of the polyacrylic acid binder Tubicoat Thickener LP had the least effect on their breathability and samples with the RUCO-BAC AGP formulation had showed the best an-timicrobial response. Therefore, further studies of the antimicrobial coating composition were performed using the binder Tubicoat Thickener LP and antimicrobial additives of different chemical nature and concentration - RUCO-BAC AGP, BI-OME AM10 and Nano Ag aqueous dis-persion. Based on the microbiological and air permeability results of the samples of the one-layer nonwoven material with coating, the samples of two-layers and three-layers of medical mask model were prepared. Microbiological studies have shown that three-layered medical mask model with RUCO-BAC AGP composition in the middle layer, in both sides of the model has antibacterial efficiency against three pathogens (E. Coli, K. Pneumoniae, an S. Aureus). The performance of this medical mask model has been found to meet requirements for type I medi-cal masks according to the EN 14863 standard. Study have shown that the microbial purity of the mask model is CFU/g","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"752e4d58219d106e7ea4a3c20a44480c8e388682b37b5ebfc50342aed1ef827c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
