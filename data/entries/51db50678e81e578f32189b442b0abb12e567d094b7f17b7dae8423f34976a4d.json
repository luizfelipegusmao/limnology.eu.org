{"title":"Quantum Correlation Enhanced Optical Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0460/v1","date":1712577234000,"content":"Quantum correlations, especially time correlations, are crucial in ghost imaging in order to significantly reduce the background noise on the one hand while increasing the imaging resolution. Moreover, the time correlations serve as a critical reference, distinguishing between signal and noise, which in turn enable clear visualization of biological samples. Quantum imaging also addresses the challenge involved in imaging delicate biological structures with minimal photon exposure and sample damage. Here we explore the recent progress in quantum correlation-based imaging, notably its impact on secure imaging and remote sensing protocols as well as on biological imaging. We also exploit the quantum characteristics of heralded single-photon sources (HSPS) combined with decoy-state methods for secure imaging. This method uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) principles to reduce measurement uncertainties and protect data integrity. It is highly effective in low-photon-number regimes for producing high-quality, noise-reduced images. The versatility of decoy-state methods with WCSs (WCS) is also discussed, highlighting their suitability for scenarios requiring higher photon numbers. We emphasize the dual advantages of these techniques: improving image quality through noise reduction and enhancing data security with quantum encryption, suggesting significant potential for quantum imaging in various applications, from delicate biological imaging to secure quantum communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51db50678e81e578f32189b442b0abb12e567d094b7f17b7dae8423f34976a4d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
