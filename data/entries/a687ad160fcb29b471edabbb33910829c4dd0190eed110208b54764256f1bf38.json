{"title":"Cosmic Dynamics Unveiled: A Relativistic Approach to Structure Formation and Evolution in a Friedmann Universe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0780/v1","date":1725953691000,"content":"The advent of modern satellite technology has transformed observational astronomy and astrophysics, offering unprecedented insights into the large-scale behavior of gravitation and challenging established cosmological models. This technological progress has reinvigorated the study of relativistic cosmology, leading to a critical reassessment of foundational assumptions, particularly the cosmological principle, which posits that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. While this principle underpins the Standard Cosmological Model and the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, emerging data has increasingly been challenging its validity. Central to this investigation are the redshift-distance and light intensity-distance relations, essential for testing cosmological models. The integration of both parametric and nonparametric redshift models provides a more comprehensive analysis, addressing discrepancies in our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution. However, unresolved mysteries, particularly concerning dark matter and dark energy, complicate these models. This research critically examines the cosmological principle using the latest observational data and scrutinizes the Friedmann model's assumptions. The study shows that galaxy formation was most rapid in the early universe, especially within the redshift range of , with notable peaks around at  and  These two characteristic redshift values, predicted by our standard Friedmann redshift model used in this work, are confirmed by the observational data utilized in this research. The research also highlights that dark matter plays a significantly more critical role than dark energy in the process of galaxy formation. While dark energy primarily affects the large-scale expansion of the universe, dark matter seems to go beyond the domination of local galaxy formation and evolution of cosmic structures. These findings underscore the limitations of current models and contribute to the ongoing refinement of cosmological theories, offering a clearer understanding of the universeâ€™s evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a687ad160fcb29b471edabbb33910829c4dd0190eed110208b54764256f1bf38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
