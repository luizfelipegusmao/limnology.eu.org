{"title":"Investigating the Molecular Basis of Antiviral Resistance in the Perspective of Influenza A Virus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1773/v1","date":1729732490000,"content":"Evolving or \"re-emerging\" viral deviation remains to pretense substantial worldwide public health threats. Influenza A virus (IAV), the main contributor to respiratory infections and related death in humans, is a prime example. Universally well-known as ‘flu’, it has disturbed our daily breathing, leaving a breakthrough till now. This virus can transmit from animals to humans and familiarize human hosts, resulting in ongoing transmission and the rise of novel viral strains. The processes through which viruses evolve within one host, cause animal-to-human transmission, and acclimatize to different host species are not yet fully understood. This review scans influenza antiviral resistance, highlighting the fundamental concepts behind its development and clinical impact. Influenza A represents a significant burden on healthcare systems and communities. While antiviral drugs are crucial for managing influenza effectively, healthcare providers and policymakers may need to be cautious due to the potential for antiviral-resistant strains to develop.  Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors targeting the viral components of the M2 ion channel and NA have been approved to treat IAV. However, the ongoing dissemination of drug-resistant virus variants due to mutation of these viral components poses a challenge and could undermine the effectiveness of primary antiviral therapies. Therefore, this review provides the susceptibility status of IAV subtypes to currently available antiviral drugs, factors to anti-IAV resistance, and soon-to-be-available control measures to emerging drug resistance IAV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1701fa03af4b1fff02f78ecb709fd9826c3a8494de8a9dfba53a5c4faa46c173","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
