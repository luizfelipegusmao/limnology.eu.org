{"title":"Early ontogenesis from embryo to juvenile in Senegalese sole Solea senegalensis under laboratory conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15717?af=R","date":1710313551000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Senegalese sole, <i>Solea senegalensis</i>, is a flatfish of high commercial value in the world. It has been identified as an interesting and promising species for marine commercial aquaculture diversification in Europe for at least four decades and was introduced to China in 2003. Early ontogenesis from embryo to juvenile stages in <i>S. senegalensis</i> was analysed under controlled laboratory conditions to provide morphological information for aquaculture. From 0 to 59 days post hatching (dph), 10–20 larvae were sampled and measured each day (0–17 dph) or every 2–6 days (17–59 dph). Morphological characteristics from the egg to the juvenile stage were described. The eggs were separate and spherical with multiple oil globules. After 3 dph, the yolk sac was completely absorbed, mouth and anus were open, a swim bladder appeared, and larvae began feeding on rotifers (<i>Brachionus plicatilis</i>). The larvae began metamorphosis as the notochord flexed upward and the left eye migrated upward after 10 dph. The left eye migrated to the dorsal midline at 15 dph. At 19 dph, the left eye was translocated to the right-ocular side, and the juveniles adopted a benthic lifestyle. The swim bladder degenerated, and the juveniles completed metamorphosis at 23 dph. The growth patterns of some parameters (TL, SL, BH, BW) during larval and juvenile development stages were identified. The inflection points, which are slopes of growth changes, were calculated in growth curves. Three inflection points occurring in the growth curves of larvae and juveniles were found to be associated with metamorphosis, weaning, and transitions in feeding habits. The basic information of embryo development and ontogenesis in this study represents a valuable contribution to the <i>S. senegalensis</i> industry, especially in artificial breeding and rearing techniques.</p>","author":"Liming Liu, \nJun Zeng, \nJiulong Wang, \nYan Liu, \nWeiping Mei, \nYanqin Wu, \nChengwu Wang, \nWengang Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"4ee8551c7234ac939ed25d627d2b4fdb1a768a8b9e3f162f7ff3caed43b19462","category":"Environment"}
