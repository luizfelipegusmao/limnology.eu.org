{"title":"Zero Trust in Cloud Security: Panacea or Fool's Errand?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1478/v1","date":1729254230000,"content":"The proliferation of cloud computing has given rise to challenges in security that established perimeter-based models cannot easily adapt to. The new buzzword Zero Trust, which is based on the principle of \"never trust, always verify,\" has been looked up as one of the promising solutions. Is Zero Trust a certainty or pie in the sky for security in the cloud? This is discussed further in this paper. This philosophical approach leads us through the earlier work and scientific literature available on the subject, presenting Zero Trust's capabilities, advantages when introduced into cloud security architecture, and obstacles about its incorporation. The study finds that Zero Trust holds the potential to enhance cloud security significantly, but it is no silver bullet and demands careful implementation and further studies to understand its intricacies as well as pitfalls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34d2d6d9d7d092bdf175e85950290252fdd0bef86d53b610617d19db22978aa8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
