{"title":"A Scoping Review of the Trends and Opportunities of Tangible Creativity Support Tools (T‐CSTs)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2615/v1","date":1722489288000,"content":"The research of tangible creativity support tools (T-CSTs) has been increasing in recent years. However, there is a lack of review that interprets what T-CSTs trends must be considered and how challenging opinions should be broken. Hence, a focused and critical review of existing studies is necessary. This paper analyzed 86 studies related to T-CSTs following the PRISMA protocol. First, the research tendencies were extracted and provided a basic knowledge construction. Then, we extracted primary research questions, categorized the adopted design and technological solutions, and identified the researchers’ hypotheses-validation. Last, we proposed research gap, challenge and potential opportunities for future researchers and designers. This review will benefit people in the fields of tangible interaction, design studies and education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6041122eb1dd4e1078e041d413be0cce389e6fffdcbcac104257be76489925d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
