{"title":"Evaluation of the Root Rupture Method for Controlling Belowground Spread of the Oak Wilt Pathogen (Bretziella fagacearum) in Northeast Wisconsin, USA","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/3/302/7634619?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Oak wilt, caused by the pathogen <span>Bretziella fagacearum</span>, is a destructive disease on oak (<span>Quercus)</span> species in the United States. Established methods to control the belowground spread of oak wilt are not appropriate in all circumstances; thus, forest health managers have a strong need for alternative methods for disease control. We evaluated the effectiveness of operational stump excavation treatments (i.e., “root rupture” method) applied between 2004 and 2014 to control belowground spread of oak wilt on two forests in northeast Wisconsin, USA. The root rupture method achieved a high level of disease control (≥85% of evaluated disease infection centers) for 5 years by harvesting red oak trees within infection centers and uprooting the stumps and associated root mass. The likelihood of disease control success depended on the initial size of the infection center that was treated, with larger infection centers being less likely to be contained with a single treatment than small infection centers. This study highlights the importance of early detection and prompt management in oak wilt suppression programs.<strong>Study Implications:</strong> Forest management agencies and organizations in the North Central United States continue to face oak wilt epidemics. No single tool or treatment method ensures complete containment of oak wilt; thus, most managers carefully consider all the tools and techniques available to them and determine what best suits their budget and land use priorities. Stump excavation (i.e., “root rupture” method) is a cost-effective treatment for halting belowground spread of the oak wilt fungus, <span>Bretziella fagacearum</span>, that can achieve a high level of disease control. In northern red oak (<span>Quercus rubra</span>) stands with high economic value, this treatment can be applied as a group selection, with the value of the timber potentially offsetting the cost of treatment. The opportunity for complete disease control decreases as oak wilt infection centers increase in size; thus, monitoring and early control actions are critical.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"d8a25a4e2fa14fe6421c4a2d05356a41f181c7f6e32f00eb1780d4991823559a","category":"Environment"}
