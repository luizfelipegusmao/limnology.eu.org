{"title":"Cytotoxic Potential of the Monoterpene Isoespintanol against Human Tumor Cell Lines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1162/v1","date":1710934345000,"content":"Cancer is a disease that encompasses multiple and different malignant conditions and is among the leading causes of death in the world. Therefore, the search for new pharmacotherapeutic options and potential candidates that can be used as treatments or adjuvants to control this disease is urgent. Natural products, especially those obtained from plants, have played an important role as a source of specialized metabolites with recognized pharmacological properties against cancer, therefore, they are an excellent alternative to be used. The objective of this research was to evaluate the action of the monoterpene isoespintanol (ISO) against the human tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231, A549, DU145, A2780, A2780-cis and the non-tumor line MRC-5. Experiments with MTT and fluorescence with propidium iodide (PI), DAPI and green plasma revealed the cytotoxicity of ISO against these cells; furthermore, morphological and chromogenic studies revealed the action of ISO on cell morphology and the inhibitory capacity on reproductive viability to form colonies in MDA-MB-231 cells. Likewise, 3D experiments validated the damage in these cells caused by this monoterpene. These results serve as a basis for progress in studies of the mechanisms of action of these compounds and the development of derivatives or synthetic analogues with a better antitumor profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22a5daedd5d92f92bb9c661a767243b01e41ea6a32ed0b225fc89ea111cdfbdf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
