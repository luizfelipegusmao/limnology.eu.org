{"title":"Recent Advances of Conductive Hydrogels for Flexible Electronics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0106/v1","date":1712020086000,"content":"Conductive hydrogels combine the properties of both hydrogels and electrical conductivity, making them soft, flexible, and biocompatible. These properties enable them to conform to irregular surfaces, stretch and bend without losing their electrical conductivity, and interface with biological systems. Conductive hydrogels can be utilized as conductive traces, electrodes, or as a matrix for flexible electronics. Exciting applications in sensors, tissue engineering and human-machine interaction have been demonstrated worldwide. This review comprehensively covers the progress in this field, focusing on several main aspects: functional materials, performance improvement strategies, and wearable applications in human-related areas. Furthermore, the major approaches and challenges for improving their mechanical properties, conductivity, and long-term stability are systematically summarized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02dcb1689d5b75b97138674a22616aed0dc04b2cbee4da81a90a011a9b4dc3a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
