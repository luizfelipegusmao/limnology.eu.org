{"title":"Observational and Numerical Modeling Constraints on the Global Ocean Biological Carbon Pump","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GB008156?af=R","date":1720076400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study characterized ocean biological carbon pump metrics in the second iteration of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP2) project. The analysis here focused on comparisons of global and biome-scale regional patterns in particulate organic carbon (POC) production and sinking flux from the RECCAP2 ocean biogeochemical model ensemble against observational products derived from satellite remote sensing, sediment traps, and geochemical methods. There was generally good model-data agreement in mean large-scale spatial patterns, but with substantial spread across the model ensemble and observational products. The global-integrated, model ensemble-mean export production, taken as the sinking POC flux at 100 m (6.08 ± 1.17 Pg C yr<sup>−1</sup>), and export ratio defined as sinking flux divided by net primary production (0.154 ± 0.026) both fell at the lower end of observational estimates. Comparison with observational constraints also suggested that the model ensemble may have underestimated regional biological CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown and air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux in high productivity regions. Reasonable model-data agreement was found for global-integrated, ensemble-mean sinking POC flux into the deep ocean at 1,000 m (0.65 ± 0.24 Pg C yr<sup>−1</sup>) and the transfer efficiency defined as flux at 1,000 m divided by flux at 100 m (0.122 ± 0.041), with both variables exhibiting considerable regional variability. The RECCAP2 analysis presents standard ocean biological carbon pump metrics for assessing biogeochemical model skill, metrics that are crucial for further modeling efforts to resolve remaining uncertainties involving system-level interactions between ocean physics and biogeochemistry.</p>","author":"Scott C.
