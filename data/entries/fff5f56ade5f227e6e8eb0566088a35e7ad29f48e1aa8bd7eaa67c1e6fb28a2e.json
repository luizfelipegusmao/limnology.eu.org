{"title":"No geographical differences in male mate choice in a widespread fish, Limia perugiae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae008/7601963?rss=1","date":1707177600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Behavior, like most other traits, can have a spatial component, and variability of behavior at the population level is predicted. In this article, we explore male mate choice at this level. Male mate choice, while maybe not as common as female choice, is expected to evolve when males respond to significant variation in female quality and, for example, prefer females with higher fecundity. In fishes, higher fecundity is associated with larger body size, an easily measured trait. In this study, we investigated the presence of male mate choice for larger females in a widespread species of livebearing fish, <span>Limia perugiae</span>, while comparing preferences between populations. We hypothesized that environmental variation, for example, in the form of salinity, might result in population differences. Using dichotomous choice tests, we analyzed behavioral data for 80 individuals from 7 distinct populations from Hispaniola. We found that <span>L. perugiae</span> males significantly preferred large females, but there was no significant statistical variation between populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"fff5f56ade5f227e6e8eb0566088a35e7ad29f48e1aa8bd7eaa67c1e6fb28a2e","category":"Environment"}
