{"title":"Stereoscopic Microscopy of Snow Crystals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/4/38/7718050?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Snow crystals (snowflakes) are composed of an enormous diversity of shapes that have attracted significant scientific attention over the past decades. Under the microscope, these natural structures are frequently characterized by high complexity, the detailed exploration of which requires the use of enhanced magnifications. In the work presented here, an insight into the microcosm of snow crystals is presented by application of specific light microscopy techniques. Micrographs were produced by means of a low-temperature (LT) device that prevented premature melting of the structures. Additionally, single crystals were imaged as to a stereoscopic visualization allowing the detailed spatial investigation of specific structural elements.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"89c8b5ea3c1c8a86581a9d15a56107694f965f8cab85d7b013453c35acc784f4","category":"Environment"}
