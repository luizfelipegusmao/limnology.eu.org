{"title":"Establishing human microbial observatory programs in low‐ and middle‐income countries","link":"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.15224?af=R","date":1728816929000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Studies of the human microbiome are progressing rapidly but have largely focused on populations living in high-income countries. With increasing evidence that the microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases that affect infants, children, and adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and with profound and rapid ongoing changes occurring in our lifestyles and biosphere, understanding the origins of and developing microbiome-directed therapeutics for treating a number of global health challenges requires the development of programs for studying human microbial ecology in LMICs. Here, we discuss how the establishment of long-term human microbial observatory programs in selected LMICs could provide one timely approach.</p>","author":"Jeffrey I. Gordon, \nMichael J.
