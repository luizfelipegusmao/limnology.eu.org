{"title":"Effect of Oriented External Electric Fields on the Electronic Properties of Linear Acenes: A TAO-DFT Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1345/v1","date":1724063065000,"content":"Recently, oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) have earned much attention due to the possibility of tuning the properties of electronic systems. From a theoretical perspective, one can resort to electronic structure calculations to understand how the direction and strength of OEEFs affect the properties of electronic systems. However, for multi-reference (MR) systems, calculations employing the popular Kohn-Sham density functional theory with the traditional semilocal and hybrid exchange-correlation energy functionals can yield erroneous results. Owing to its decent compromise between accuracy and efficiency for MR systems at the nanoscale (i.e., MR nanosystems), in this study, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) is adopted to explore the electronic properties of n-acenes (n = 2--10), containing n linearly fused benzene rings, in OEEFs, where the OEEFs of various electric field strengths are applied along the long axes of n-acenes. According to our TAO-DFT calculations, the ground states of n-acenes in OEEFs are singlets for all the cases examined. The effect of OEEFs is shown to be significant on the vertical ionization potentials and vertical electron affinities of ground-state n-acenes with odd-number fused benzene rings. Moreover, the MR character of ground-state n-acenes in OEEFs increases with the increase of the acene length and/or the electric field strength.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fda5b14b0abb6ff1b5ccf4ba0180712f20eb0138da0946dcf09cddb12c105126","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
