{"title":"Pseudostellaria heterophylla improves intestinal microecology through modulating gut microbiota and metabolites in mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13453?af=R","date":1709990580000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p><i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i> is a Chinese medicine and healthy edible that is widely used to for its immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antitussive properties. However, the potential function of <i>P. heterophylla</i> in intestinal microecology remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of <i>P. heterophylla</i> on immune functions and evaluated its potential to regulate the gut microbiota and metabolome.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results showed that <i>P. heterophylla</i> significantly increased the content of red blood cells, total antioxidant capacity, and expression of immune factors, and decreased platelet counts when compared to the control under cyclophosphamide injury. In addition, <i>P. heterophylla</i> altered the diversity and composition of the gut bacterial community; increased the abundance of potentially beneficial <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, unclassified <i>Clostridiaceae</i>, <i>Mucispirillum</i>, <i>Anaeroplasma</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i>; and decreased the relative abundance of pathogenic <i>Cupriavidus</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i> in healthy mice. Metabolomic analyses showed that <i>P. heterophylla</i> significantly increased the content of functional oligosaccharides, common oligosaccharides, vitamins, and functional substances. Probiotics and pathogens were regulated by metabolites across 11 pathways in the bacterial–host co-metabolism network.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We demonstrated that <i>P. heterophylla</i> increased the abundance of probiotics and decreased pathogens, and further stimulated host microbes to produce beneficial secondary metabolites for host health. Our studies highlight the role of <i>P. heterophylla</i> on gut health, and provided the new insights for the development of traditional Chinese medicine in the diet.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
