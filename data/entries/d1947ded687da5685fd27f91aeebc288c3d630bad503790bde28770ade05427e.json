{"title":"Sustainability of Briquettes Production Based on Biomass from Vineyard Winter Pruning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2047/v1","date":1717067922000,"content":"Worldwide, different strategies are elaborated in order to ensure optimum conditions for the development and growth of the economic competitiveness, but also for increasing the quality of life and environment protection. All these strategies are closely linked with the development and modernization of the systems for producing energy from clean and renewable sources. In this context, the present paper presents the results of the researches regarding the evaluation of the sustainability of the briquettes production, using the biomass resulted from vine winter pruning as raw material. An analysis of the scientific references indicates that nearly 8 Mt of biomass result from over 7.4 million hectares of vine plantations existent worldwide, biomass that could be valorized through densification in order to produce solid biofuels with a lower calorific value of more than 17 MJÂ·kg-1.\nWhen designing the scientific endeavor, the following aspects were considered: defining the aim and objectives of the research; design of the research algorithm; collection, preparation and conditioning of the biomass; chemical analysis of the briquettes; evaluation of the technological characteristics of the briquettes; evaluation of the energy consumption and energy efficiency for producing the briquettes, taking into account two drying methods (natural and artificial drying). In the meantime, some specific laboratory equipment was design and built for the artificial drying of biomass, evaluation of the mechanical durability, measurement of the energy consumption etc.\nThe analysis of the experimental data has led to the conclusion that the agricultural waste from vine pruning can constitute an important and sustainable source of energy in the form of bri-quettes, which fulfill most of the requirements imposed by the international standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1947ded687da5685fd27f91aeebc288c3d630bad503790bde28770ade05427e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
