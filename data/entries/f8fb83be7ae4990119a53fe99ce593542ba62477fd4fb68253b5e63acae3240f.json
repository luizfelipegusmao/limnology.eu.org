The researcher used the experimental approach and determined the community, namely the players of Maysan governorate teams in fencing and for the three weapons (fencing sword, shish, Arab sword) the category of applicants over the age of (20) years, and by (4) players for each weapon, which reached the number of society (12) players, and some procedures were adopted to achieve the objectives of the study. The study came out the results of the study recorded a significant impact on the high level of measurement of blood biochemical variables (EPOs, FERSs, Hb, Hct) and improved by high-intensity compound exercises using the training hypoxic mask among members of the research community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8fb83be7ae4990119a53fe99ce593542ba62477fd4fb68253b5e63acae3240f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
