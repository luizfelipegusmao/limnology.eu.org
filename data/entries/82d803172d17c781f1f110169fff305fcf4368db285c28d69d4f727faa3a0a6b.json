{"title":"Dimensional Accuracy and Mechanical Characterization of Inconel 625 components in Atomic Diffusion Additive Manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0736/v1","date":1715492681000,"content":"Additive manufacturing processes offer various options to fabricate metal parts, which show numerous ecological and technological advantages compared to formative and subtractive manufacturing methods. Due to quick availability and high accuracy, they are particularly suitable to produce complex prototypes. Metal fused deposition modeling is a relatively new material extrusion additive manufacturing technique based on the widely used fused filament deposition process. This study focuses on the Inconel 625 metal filament from Markforged Inc., it consists of a mixture of metal powder and a binder system, the latter being removed during washing and sintering. In this article, the mechanical properties of printed and sintered Inconel were investigated using tensile testing specimens with three different infill patterns, solid, triangular, and gyroid, printed in flatwise and upright direction. In addition, investigations into the dimensional accuracy of the printed specimens and the sintering shrinkage were carried out. The results showed that neither the dimensional accuracy nor the sintering shrinkage was significantly influenced by the printing orientation. In the context of lightweight engineering, the structures proofed beneficial especially within the elastic region. Generally, triangular infill patterns resulted in higher stiffness, while gyroids led to more ductile specimens. A mass-related evaluation of tensile testing elucidates that with aid of the infill structures weight savings of 40 % resulted in mechanical performance decreased by only 20 % on average.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82d803172d17c781f1f110169fff305fcf4368db285c28d69d4f727faa3a0a6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
