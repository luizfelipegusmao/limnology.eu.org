{"title":"Our Growing Volume Electron Microscopy Community","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/4/24/7718048?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Volume electron microscopy (vEM) represents a powerful group of electron microscopy workflows that enable collection of large three-dimensional volumes at ultrastructural resolution to interrogate cells and tissues across length scales. Due to the breadth of approaches, users are challenged with numerous specialized and nuanced workflows and the requirements for handling, segmenting, visualizing, and quantifying large and complex datasets. As such, a vEM community of core facilities, early adopters, and commercial vendors of vEM solutions have come together to reduce the barriers for successful adoption of vEM. Supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the rapidly expanding community has built a broad coalition sharing knowledge and working together to accelerate improvements in results, speed, and automation in vEM workflows. Here we provide an overview of the vEM concept, our growing resources, and an open invitation to join our community and upcoming vEM Technology Forum with technical talks, discussions, hands-on demonstrations, and networking.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"a8c57c0ffa8813aec0dc916c30f1c4b480fecb2541aa914e0b705801d3901cb6","category":"Environment"}
