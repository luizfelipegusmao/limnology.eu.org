{"title":"Optimisation of the Encapsulation of Grape Pomace Extract by Spray Drying Using Goat Whey Protein as Coating Material","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0533/v1","date":1720174223000,"content":"This study investigated how the type and homogenisation parameters of the feed mixture affect the efficiency of the encapsulation process and the microcapsule properties of phenol-rich grape pomace extract (GPE) during the spray drying process with goat whey protein (GW) as wall material. GPE was obtained by solid-liquid extraction of grapes with 50% ethanol. Effects of ultrasonic homogenisation parameters (UB): temperature: 30-50 °C; time: 5-30 min; stabilisation time after homogenisation: 15-45 min, and homogenisation parameters on a magnetic stirrer (MS): temperature (25-50 °C), time (10-60 min) and homogenisation speed (600-1200 rpm) were tested using response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-Behnken design. After selecting the optimal homogenisation conditions, the spray drying process parameters were optimised in the same way, namely: inlet air temperature (160-190 °C), GW fraction (0.5-3.5) and feed flow (6-10 mL/ min). The results showed that GW has a high potential as a wall material in the spray drying process, especially for the purpose of protecting polyphenolic compounds from GPE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"143bff3f8df519baf22ef9325d9ec9b3a8d296d4d5aab0889521a89e978d929a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
