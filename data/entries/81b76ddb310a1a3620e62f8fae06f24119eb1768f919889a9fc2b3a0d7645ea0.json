{"title":"How a Thermodynamic Version of the Friedmann Equation Appears to Solve the Early Galaxy Formation Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0159/v1","date":1712065440000,"content":"Based on our recent thermodynamic formulation of the Friedmann equation, we demon- strate how the age of the universe must be approximately 14.6 billion years. This is about 800 million years older than predicted by the Î›-CDM model and therefore greatly alleviates the early galaxy formation problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81b76ddb310a1a3620e62f8fae06f24119eb1768f919889a9fc2b3a0d7645ea0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
