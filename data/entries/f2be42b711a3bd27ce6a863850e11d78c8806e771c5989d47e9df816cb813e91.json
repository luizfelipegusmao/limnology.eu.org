Less information is available about the large branchiopods of tropical Asia compared to other parts of the world such as the Americas. To reduce this disparity, we surveyed large branchiopods from the semi-arid region of Maharashtra state, India. Sampling at 29 sites over four years revealed nine species representing four orders. This is the highest diversity ever reported from a single regional study in India. Anostracans were the most commonly occurring group, whereas the spinicaudatans <span>Leptestheria</span> cf. <span>nobilis</span><a href=\"#CIT0067\">Sars, 1900</a><span>, L. jaisalmerensis</span><a href=\"#CIT0077\">Tiwari, 1962</a>, and <span>Eulimnadia michaeli</span><a href=\"#CIT0038\">Nayar &amp; Nair, 1968</a> were very rare. <span>Leptestheria jaisalmerensis</span> had been known previously only from its type locality nearly 1,200 km north of our study region.

Temporary aquatic habitats are threatened due to adverse anthropogenic activities, especially in developing countries like India. The endemic species of large branchiopods in the Indian subcontinent should be red-listed, as is done elsewhere.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"f2be42b711a3bd27ce6a863850e11d78c8806e771c5989d47e9df816cb813e91","category":"Environment"}
