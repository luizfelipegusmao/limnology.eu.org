{"title":"Foam Dyeing: A Review of Its Potential to Revolutionize Sustainable Textile Processing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2011/v1","date":1721885282000,"content":"The textile processing sector is accountable for the extensive utilisation and pollution of freshwater resources. Due to heightened consumer awareness of environmental legislation regarding freshwater contamination, the textile sector is compelled to review and improve their current water consumption practices. Foan dyeing technique is a highly promising alternative that has the ability to contribute to a more sustainable future. This review paper discussed the current state of foam dyeing technology, highlighting its advantages in terms of re-duced consumption of water and energy, as well as minimal usage of dyes and chemicals compared to conventional methods. The foam configuration allows for more effective application of dyes. As a result, there is a decrease in dye consumption and a reduction in processing time. The process is environmen-tally sustainable since it significantly reduces water pollution. Furthermore, foam dyeing method consumes less energy due to its lower dying temperature need compared to conventional processing technology. Additionally, this paper highlights the continued investigation of foam dyeing on many types of textile substrates (such as fibres, yarns, and fabric) and compositions including cotton, polyester, and their mixtures. In addition, the techno-economic comparison of foam dyeing and conventional dyeing is also given. This review paper addi-tionally endorses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6, clean water and sanitation) by examining the preservation of usable water and the decrease in wastewater discharge through foam dyeing technology. Lastly, the potential advantages of foam dyeing in terms of significantly reducing water consump-tion and the generation of waste in the textile industry were also addressed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad2c0f2800ff4754a31cee6a104ea75b85f3c6eb986ef506e6d1011323a49de3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
