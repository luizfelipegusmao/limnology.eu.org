{"title":"The efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302228","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Jiawei Wang, Yajun Zhang, Qiqi Wu, Zhiyuan Bian, Ning Luo, Jing Sun, Binyan Yu, Jianqiao Fang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus, which is the most common neuropathy worldwide. Owing to the inadequacies of existing treatment methods, managing DPN remains a significant challenge. Studies suggest that electroacupuncture (EA) could potentially serve as a beneficial alternative treatment for this condition. Nevertheless, there is still inadequate proof of its therapeutic effectiveness and safety. As a result, the goal of this protocol is to methodically compile the data pertaining to the effectiveness and security of EA in the management of DPN.</p> Methods <p>To find appropriate randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nine reliable databases in the English and Chinese languages will be examined. RevMan5.3 will be used to combine the retrieved data and perform meta-analyses. The methodological quality of the included RCTs will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment 2.0 tool. The Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system will be utilized to evaluate the degree of strength and certainty of the evidence. We will also perform publication bias, sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p> Discussion <p>This protocol describes the intended scope and approach for a forthcoming systematic review and meta-analysis that will inform therapeutic decision-making by offering current information on the efficacy and safety of EA in the treatment of DPN. The results of the study will help standardize strategies for EA in the treatment of DPN.</p>","author":"Jiawei Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ba36ae92e05c37b7dc782265a4dfccc237507c6e0f822c7676e3fc47384f35d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
