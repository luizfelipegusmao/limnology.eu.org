{"title":"Precision Fermentation as an Alternative to Animal Protein, a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0005/v1","date":1714541993000,"content":"The global food production system faces several challenges, including significant environmental impacts due to traditional agricultural practices. The rising demands of consumers for food products that are safe, healthy, and have animal welfare standards have led to an increased interest in alternative proteins and the development of the cellular agriculture field. Within this innovative field, precision fermentation emerges as a promising technological solution to produce proteins with reduced ecological footprints. This review provides a summary of the environmental impacts related to the current global food production, and explore how precision fermentation can contribute to address these issues. Additionally, we will report on the main animal-derived proteins produced by precision fermentation, with a particular focus on those used in the food and nutraceutical industries. The general principles of precision fermentation will be explained, including strain and bioprocess optimization. Examples of efficient recombinant protein production by bacteria and yeasts, such as milk proteins, egg-white proteins, structural and flavoring proteins, will also be addressed, along with case examples of companies producing these recombinant proteins in a commercial scale. Through these examples, we will explore how precision fermentation supports sustainable food production and holds the potential for significant innovations in the sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b723ea385308fad052e44a4d393d2e9b605444645f258aee453e38a0fc00e81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
