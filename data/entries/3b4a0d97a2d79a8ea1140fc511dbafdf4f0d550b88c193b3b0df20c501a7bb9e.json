At the specimen sintered at 1200 [℃], the excellent values of piezoelectric properties appeared, respectively: the dielectric constant (εr) of 202, piezoelectric constant (d33) of 56[pC/N], first and third overtone electromechanical coupling factor kt of 0.548, kt3 of 0.219, and then first and third overtone mechanical quality factor Qmt1 of 345, Qmt3 of 292 were suitable for the device application such as ultrasonic transducer, respectively. When the length of one side was 7.7 mm, first and third overtone electromechanical coupling factor kt1 of 0.555, kt3 of, 0.196, and then  first ,third overtone mechanical quality factor Qmt1 of 381, Qmt3 of 393  , and the first dynamic ratio(D.R) and third  overtone dynamic ratio(D.R) of 63.7(dB),and 37.7(dB) were suitable for the device application  such as ultrasonic transducer ,respectively  .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b4a0d97a2d79a8ea1140fc511dbafdf4f0d550b88c193b3b0df20c501a7bb9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
