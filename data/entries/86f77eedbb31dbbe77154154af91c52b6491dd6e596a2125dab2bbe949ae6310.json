{"title":"Solution of Orifice Hollow Cathode Plasma Model Equations by Means of Particle Swarm Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1487/v2","date":1719506608000,"content":"Orificed Hollow Cathodes are electric devices necessary for the functioning of common plasma thrusters for space applications. From their reliability mainly depends the success of a spacecraft’s mission equipped by electric propulsion. The development of plasma models is crucial in the evaluation of plasma properties within the cathodes that are difficult to measure due to the small dimensions. Many models, based on non-linear system of plasma equations, have been proposed in the open literature. These are solved commonly by means of iterative procedures. This paper investigates the possibility to solve them by means of Particle Swarm Optimization method. The results of the validation tests confirm the expected trends for all the unknowns; the confidence bound of the discharge current as function of mass flow rate is very narrow (2÷5V), moreover the results match very well the experimental data except at the lowest mass flow rate (0.08mg/s) and discharge current (1A), where the computations underpredict the discharge current to the utmost by 40%; the highest data dispersion regards the plasma density in the emitter region (± 20 % of the average value) and the wall temperatures (± 50K respect to the average values) of orifice and insert; those of the others variables are very tiny.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86f77eedbb31dbbe77154154af91c52b6491dd6e596a2125dab2bbe949ae6310","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
