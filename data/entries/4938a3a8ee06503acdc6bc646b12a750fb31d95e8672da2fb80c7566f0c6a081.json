{"title":"Distributed Digital Lending (LoanChain): Global Matching of Lenders and Borrowers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2093/v1","date":1727346369000,"content":"The dynamics of society is enabled, in large part, through an efficient matching between people who have money to lend and people who have a need to borrow. Fair loans serve both the lender and the borrower. This task is handled today mostly via traditional banks. They offer various plans to depositors from whence they serve borrowers. Proposing to replace such rigidity with cyberspace-rooted dynamic ad-hoc global matching of lenders and borrowers. Uniquely here we build a chain of lenders to support a single borrower.  Lenders will post a proposition to lend a given amount of money for a stated duration for a set interest rate. Borrowers will post a request to borrow a desired amount of money, for a specified duration, and for which they are ready to pay a stated interest. A virtual digital bank (VDB) will match all the posts, negotiate terms as necessary, and move the money -- everyone benefits. Distributed Digital Lending, DDL, applies to macro, long terms loans, as well as to micro. very short terms loans. DDL efficiency will ensure that all money at rest will be money in growth, and the full global lending capacity will be put to good service through the exact loans borrowers want. DDL is hinged in digital transactions which are immediate, irrevocable, and private, per regulatory allowance. The matching is optimized with AI tools. BitMint*LeVeL is the design standard coin for DDL, but other digital money options will do too.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4938a3a8ee06503acdc6bc646b12a750fb31d95e8672da2fb80c7566f0c6a081","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
