{"title":"Transcriptome Analysis of Rice Root Tips Reveals Auxin, Gibberellin and Ethylene Signaling Underlying Nutritropism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/671/7558230?rss=1","date":1705363200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nutritropism is a positive tropism toward nutrients in plant roots. An NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> gradient is a nutritropic stimulus in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span> L.). When rice roots are exposed to an NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> gradient generated around nutrient sources, root tips bend toward and coil around the sources. The molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of the inside and outside of bending root tips exhibiting nutritropism to reveal nutritropic signal transduction. Tissues facing the nutrient sources (inside) and away (outside) were separately collected by laser microdissection. Principal component analysis revealed distinct transcriptome patterns between the two tissues. Annotations of 153 differentially expressed genes implied that auxin, gibberellin and ethylene signaling were activated differentially between the sides of the root tips under nutritropism. Exogenous application of transport and/or biosynthesis inhibitors of these phytohormones largely inhibited the nutritropism. Thus, signaling and <span>de novo</span> biosynthesis of the three phytohormones are necessary for nutritropism. Expression patterns of <span>IAA</span> genes implied that auxins accumulated more in the inside tissues, meaning that ammonium stimulus is transduced to auxin signaling in nutritropism similar to gravity stimulus in gravitropism. <span>SAUR</span> and <span>expansin</span> genes, which are known to control cell wall modification and to promote cell elongation in shoot gravitropism, were highly expressed in the inside tissues rather than the outside tissues, and our transcriptome data are unexplainable for differential elongation in root nutritropism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"a3bd10c974b73e003ae8e12e5812059804f4beb50f5a27a1d6b9e672a4246d6f","category":"Environment"}
