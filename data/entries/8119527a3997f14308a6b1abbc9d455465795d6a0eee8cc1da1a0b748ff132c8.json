Hence, we assessed the association between US nativity and length of time in the US on modifiable cancer risk factors. Utilizing the 2010 and 2015 National Health Interview Survey datasets, we analyzed 8,861 US-born and non-US-born adults. Key variables included age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, income, diet, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics and regression. Most respondents were US-born (n = 7,370), followed by long-term (≥15 years, n = 928), and recent (&lt;15 years, n = 563) immigrants. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was higher among US-born individuals (342.45 minutes/week), compared to recent (249.74 minutes/week) and long-term immigrants (255.19 minutes/week). Recent immigrants consumed more fruits (1.37 cups/day) and long-term immigrants more vegetables (1.78 cups/day) than US-born individuals. Multivariate analyses found recent immigrants had lower odds of consuming alcohol (AOR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.21–0.50) and smoking (AOR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46), and higher odds of meeting fruit consumption guidelines (AOR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.76–4.45) compared to US-born individuals. Long-term immigrants had lower odds of alcohol consumption (AOR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37–0.84) and smoking (AOR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.30–0.59), and higher odds for meeting fruit (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.22–2.86) and fiber (AOR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.02–4.05) consumption guidelines. Our findings illustrate the importance of considering the impact nativity and length of US residency has on health. Our findings underscore the need for culturally tailored public health strategies.","author":"LaShae D.
