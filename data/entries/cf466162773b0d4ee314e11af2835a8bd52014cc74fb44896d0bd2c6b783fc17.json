{"title":"Martian Dust Storms: Reviews and Perspective for Tianwen-3 Mars Sampling Returning Mission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2105/v1","date":1717136050000,"content":"Dust storms play a crucial role in the climate system and the space environment of Mars and have a great impact on humanâ€™s Mars exploration activities. The Martian dust storms exhibit significant regional, seasonal and interannual variations due to various controlling factors such as the large-scale atmospheric circulation, varying solar radiation forcing, and Martial orbital and rotational motions and their coupling to the atmospheric dynamics. This paper focuses on the review of cur-rent understandings on Martian dust storms. This paper begins by elucidating the basic properties of dust storms, and their driving mechanisms and impacts on atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric electric property, space environment, topography, and Mars explorations. Then it introduces the observation methods on different platforms including orbiters and landers/rovers, and the da-tasets constructed based on these historical observations for Martian dust storms. Finally, we pro-posed the dust storm monitoring and forecasting for the upcoming Chinese Tianwen-3 Mars sam-pling returning mission. It concludes by depicting the future research topics to systematically un-derstand the Martian dust storms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf466162773b0d4ee314e11af2835a8bd52014cc74fb44896d0bd2c6b783fc17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
