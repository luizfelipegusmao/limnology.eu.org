It consists mainly of magnesium and iron silicate minerals and does not contain any harmful chemical elements. But its extremely fine morphology, known as asbestiform, allows it to easily become airborne and be inhaled into the human body. Then, inhaling asbestos fibers has a negative impact on the human body, potentially causing diseases such as lung cancer and mesothelioma.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"376e59f6c65784d2bd843f8e3cf07a0c64fe2c04a416aa3e1331a58cc7251909","category":"Environment"}
