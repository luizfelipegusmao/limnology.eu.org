{"title":"Evaluation of Different Commercial Sensors for the Development of Their Automatic Irrigation System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2158/v1","date":1727429523000,"content":"Reliable soil moisture information is essential for accurate irrigation scheduling. A wide range of soil moisture sensors are currently available on the market, but their performance needs to be evaluated as most sensors are calibrated under limited laboratory conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of six commercially available moisture sensors (HydraProbe, Teros 10, Teros 11, EnviroPro, CS616 and Drill&amp;Drop) and three tensiometers (Irrometer RSU-C-34, Teros 32 and Teros 21) and to establish calibration equations for a typical sandy soil of the Do√±ana National Park (Huelva, Spain). The calibration process for soil moisture sensors indicated dif-ferences between factory and corrected equations. All tested sensors improved with adjustments made to the factory calibration, except for the HydraProbe sensor which had a more accurate factory equation for a sandy soil. Among the various sensors tested, the Teros 10, Teros 11, and HydraProbe were found to be the easiest to install, typically positioned with an auger to prevent preferential pathways and ensure adequate sensor-soil contact. For tensiometers, the Teros 32 sensor requires specialized labor for its correct installation, as it must be positioned at a specific angle and maintained with distilled water. All tensiometers need a stabilization period after in-stallation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13cfb743bcddb5fc5901d8f9cfe71b6024485f9eee64898061d8614523b7c197","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
