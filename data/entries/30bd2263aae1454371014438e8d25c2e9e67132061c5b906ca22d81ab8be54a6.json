{"title":"Bloodmeal, and Selected Indigenous Raw Materials as Cost-Effective Feeds for Milkfish Aquaculture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0150/v1","date":1725352345000,"content":"This study is based on the clamor of fish farmers for a cheaper fish feed alternative to current commercial feeds. At present, 70-80% of aquaculture costs come from feed cost, keeping farmers' income below their expectation. This study aimed to find alternative feeds or supplementary feeds that can perform similarly to the existing commercial feeds thereby reducing farmer expense and cutting down their cost of production and increasing their profitability. To do that, various indigenous raw materials were selected based on an earlier study which could result in a better feed alternative. The formulations for the study included four grow-out treatments mainly: control (commercial feed), taro+control (powdered Colocasia esculenta+commercial fish feed), bloodmeal (formulated fish feed based on bloodmeal), banana stem+control (chopped banana stem+commercial fish feed). A total of 12,000 fingerlings initially weighing 16 g (TL=10 cm) individually were assigned randomly to the four treatments (3000 in each cage measuring 6 x 6 m). Week zero was used for acclimation period, and fingerlings were fed with commercial fish feed. Then the first week used the treatment diets which were adjusted based on average body weight and sampled weekly (ABW=23g; TL=11 cm). The result of the study first showed significant differences between treatments on their fourth week in terms of the diet treatments (MS=0.103, df=3, F=4.12, P=0.0076) with the control and the taro+control showing no difference in terms of weight and length (TC vs CF; P=0.4524). But during the fifth week, the bloodmeal treatment showed increased weight and length for fish sampled (MS=0.109, df=3, F=4.10, P=0.0076) and provided similar weight and length as those from the taro+control and the control (TC vs CF; P=0.3721 and BM vs CF; P=0.0587). During the succeeding weeks, there were no significant differences between feed treatments from 6th weeks onwards, whether with weight [MS=0.130, df=3, F=1.14, P=0.333] or total length of the treatments [MS=0.008, df=3, F=0.40, P=0.75]. The FCR ratio showed taro (1.81) as lowest, followed by blood meal (2.09), and control (2.24) and then banana stem (2.84). In terms of weight gain, fish from the bloodmeal treatment gained the highest (236.97 g), followed by control (223.33 g), then taro (217.67 g) and banana stem (196.99 g). As a result, we find that the tested treatments such as bloodmeal formulated feed, taro+commercial feed, and banana stem+commercial feed can serve as an alternative to purely commercial fish feeds. Cost-benefit analysis showed that a better gross profit margin of 42% and cost-benefit ratio of 1.37 was observed in taro+commercial feed diet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30bd2263aae1454371014438e8d25c2e9e67132061c5b906ca22d81ab8be54a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
