{"title":"Incidence of straight and angulated screw channel following immediate implant placement in esthetic zone: A simulated cone-beam computed tomography study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308158","date":1725544800000,"content":"<p>by Watcharapon Radomsutthisarn, Kornkamol Kretapirom, Pranai Nakaparksin</p>\r\nStatement of problem <p>The demand for immediate implant placement (IIP) in the esthetic zone is rapidly increasing. Despite the treatment’s benefits, the sagittal root position often dictates implant angulation, commonly necessitating the use of cement-retained restorations. This study investigates the impact of angulated screw channel on IIP in the esthetic zone.</p> Purpose <p>The purpose of this cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) study was to determine the probability of IIP in the esthetic zone, using four different implant angulations.</p> Materials and methods <p>A retrospective review of CBCT images was conducted and accessed on 9 June 2021. The midsagittal images of maxillary anterior teeth were input into an implant planning software (Implant Studio®). Bone Level X Straumann® implant (BLX 3.5, 3.75, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 mm) and Bone Level Tapered implant (BLT 2.9, 3.3 mm) were selected for 3D implant planning of IIP in the esthetic zone. The frequency distribution and probability of IIP were recorded and compared among all maxillary anterior teeth.</p> Results <p>CBCT images from 720 teeth (120 patient) were evaluated, revealing an overall probability of IIP in the esthetic zone is 76.11% (548/720). Different implant restoration type was evaluated in this study, with the following results; straight screw-retained prosthesis at 3.47% (19/548), cement-retained prosthesis at 14.59% (80/548) and angle screw-retained prosthesis at 85.40% (468/548).</p> Conclusion <p>IIP with traditional straight screw-retained prosthesis demonstrated the lowest probability. Nevertheless, the use of angulated screw channels enhances the probability of achieving straight screw-retained prostheses.</p> Clinical implications <p>The angulated screw channel is essential for increasing the probability of screw-retained prosthesis in IIP in the esthetic zone. However, limitation in screw angle correction still necessitate the use of cement-retained prostheses for numbers of patients undergoing IIP.</p>","author":"Watcharapon Radomsutthisarn","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4ed2d3e175368d0e52cc12efddf5fc5db7aa75e514bfc7b2a2f67071dff2c2e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
