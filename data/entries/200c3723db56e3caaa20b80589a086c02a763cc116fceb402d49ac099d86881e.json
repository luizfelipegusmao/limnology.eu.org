{"title":"Engineering the Rhizosphere for Stress Resilience: PGPB-Mediated Alterations in Plant Metabolite Profiles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0800/v1","date":1718175507000,"content":"This study assessed the impact of inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) on stress-resistance and growth-promoting metabolites in Salicornia europaea L. across controlled and field conditions. Salicornia europaea seeds, inoculated with Brevibacterium casei EB3 and Pseudomonas oryzihabitans RL18, were grown in controlled laboratory experiments and in a nat-ural field setting. Metabolite composition was analyzed using GC-MS and UHPLC-MS. Under controlled conditions, PGPB inoculation significantly increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids, sugars, citric acid, acetic acid, chlorogenic acids, and quercetin. Inoculation under field condi-tions increased glucose, fructose, quercetin, and apigenin, alongside decreased unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, indicating a stress response shift in plant metabolism. Under controlled condi-tions, enhanced metabolite profiles induced by inoculation likely contributed to augmented bio-mass production and environmental stress resistance. Field plants revealed distinct phytochemi-cal profiles, suggesting higher stress levels. However, the accumulated metabolites from inocula-tion could enhance the plant's ability to cope with adverse conditions and improving stress tol-erance. This study unveils the intricate metabolic adaptations of Salicornia europaea under con-trolled and field stress conditions, highlighting PGPB's potential to enhance plant stress tolerance. Elevated stress-related metabolites may fortify plant defense mechanisms, laying the ground-work for stress-resistant crop development through PGPB-based inoculants, especially in saline agriculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"200c3723db56e3caaa20b80589a086c02a763cc116fceb402d49ac099d86881e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
