{"title":"Easy Laundry on Mobile Phone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0122/v1","date":1719908095000,"content":"In this digital era, laundry applications come as an innovative solution to meet the laundry needs of modern people who often have busy schedules and limited time. This research aims to make a significant contribution to our broader understanding of how digital innovations can revolutionize mundane tasks. This research uses the Waterfall model, which is one of the methods in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The development process begins with the Requirement Analysis stage, where application requirements and specifications are collected and thoroughly analyzed to ensure that the developed application will meet user expectations. After that, the System Design stage is conducted, where the application architecture, user interface design, and database structure are designed in detail to ensure conformity with the previously identified needs.The next stage is Implementation, where program code is written and application features are developed according to the design that has been made. The final stage is Integration and Testing, where all application components are combined and tested thoroughly to detect and fix any errors or bugs that may exist. The results of this study produced a web-based shuttle laundry service application using the Laravel framework called \"All Fresh Laundry\".  This application can order clothes washing services according to its membership, where there are 3 types of membership based on price and of course have different benefits. In addition, the testing phase of this application using black box testing shows that all menu features function properly according to their functions. Each component of the \"All Fresh Laundry\" app was thoroughly tested to ensure that no errors or malfunctions occurred. The results of this testing make it clear that every feature, from online ordering to laundry status tracking, works well and meets the specifications that have been set, so that this application can provide an optimal and reliable user experience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6eb76560e4a2ce872253cfad94215f0e512c277de986a2cb0e14aba413c1119","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
