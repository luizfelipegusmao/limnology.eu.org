{"title":"Spatial Patterns and Influencing Factors of the Leaf Trait Network of Populus euphratica Along the Main Stream of the Tarim River","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1680/v1","date":1729585259000,"content":"The complex network relationship between leaf traits and their multiple traits is closely related to the environment, and is the result of interactions between various environmental factors such as climate and soil. Based on previous work, we selected 20 P. euphratica trees along the desert riparian forest of the main stream of the Tarim River for leaf sample collection and habitat survey. We used 27 leaf traits of P. euphratica to visualize the leaf trait network (LTN). Through network structure parameters, such as edge density, diameter, average path length, and average clustering coefficient, the spatial pattern of the LTN and its relationships with 11 soil factors and 19 climatic factors were discussed using principal component analysis and correlation analysis. The results showed that: (1) there were significant differences in the parameters of the leaf trait network of P. euphratica along the main stream of the Tarim River. The variation coefficients of the diameter and average path length were the largest, respectively, whereas that of the average clustering coefficient was the smallest. (2) There were both positive and negative correlations between each parameter and soil factors, such as soil water content, total potassium, and organic matter, and climatic factors, such as isothermality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and precipitation of the wettest month. (3) The explanatory power of climate alone on the leaf traits of P. euphratica was generally higher than that of soil factors, indicating that climatic conditions play a more decisive role in shaping the network structure of leaf traits of P. euphratica. However, regarding the influence of network modularity, the contribution of soil factors was significant, indicating that the influence of soil conditions on some LTN parameters cannot be ignored.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ce5ea1f67d71330630163c8bb1152cf9d38a12bfc48d0148e401053c02f6339","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
