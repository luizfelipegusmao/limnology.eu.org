{"title":"Influence of Selected Processing Variables on Quality Attributes of Cocoa Pod-Husk Pellets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1577/v1","date":1726801220000,"content":"Biomass fuel pellets exhibit variations in quality due to differences in feedstock sources. Moni-toring processing parameters is crucial for converting biomass into high-quality energetic pellets. This study examined the effects of selected parameters on the properties of cocoa pod husk pellets produced using a modified pelleting machine. The pellets were produced by varying the com-pression ratio (0.8, 1.0, 1.2), moisture content (10, 15, 20%) and binder quantity (0, 2.5, 5 wt%). A Box-Behnken design was employed to structure the experiment. The pellets were analyzed for density, proximate composition (moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash contents), and higher heating value to assess their quality. The results were subjected to ANOVA at a 95% con-fidence level. The cocoa pod husk pellets had a bulk density of 0.28-0.41 g/cm³, moisture content of 13.22-19.30% (db), volatile matter of 48.61-57.83%, fixed carbon of 21.25-23.10%, ash content of 3.49-12.99%, and higher heating values of 18.28-19.30 MJ/kg. Significant differences were observed at the 95% confidence level (p≤0.05). Compression ratio, binder quantity and moisture content were found to affect the physicochemical properties of the pellets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff08470ae5d5292484d15329eeb0024bca738c818852b80e5e9cf8b69d8d73fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
