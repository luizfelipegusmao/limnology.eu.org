{"title":"Germanium Single Crystals for Photonics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0478/v1","date":1723006965000,"content":"Germanium (Ge) is a system-forming material of IR photonics for the atmospheric transparency window of 8 – 14 µm. For optics of the 3 – 5 µm range, more widespread silicon (Si), which has phonon absorption bands in the long-wave region, is predominantly used. A technology for growing Ge single crystals has been developed, allowing the production of precision optical parts up to 500 mm in diameter. Ge is used primarily for the production of transparent optical parts for thermal imaging devices in the 8 – 14 µm range. In addition, germanium components are widely used in a large number of optical devices where such properties as mechanical strength, good thermal properties and climatic resistance are required. A very important area of application of germanium is nonlinear optics, primarily acousto-optics. The influence of doping impurities and temperature on the absorption of IR radiation in germanium is considered in detail. The properties of germanium photodetectors are reported, primarily on the effect of photon drag of holes. Optical properties in the THz range are considered. The features of optical properties for all five stable isotopes of germanium are studied. The isotopic shift of absorption bands in the IR region, caused by phonon phenomena, which was discovered by the authors for the first time, is considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22f0a64e4f4161a696ff03fe0de4d9dfd8ea41d07e188625e06fdd06baf85659","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
