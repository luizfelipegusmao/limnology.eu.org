{"title":"Photonic and phononic modes in acoustoplasmonic toroidal nanopropellers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1463/v1","date":1718968382000,"content":"Non-conventional resonances, both acoustic and photonic, are found in metallic particles with a toroidal nanopropeller geometry that is generated by sweeping a three-lobed 2D-shape along a spiral with twisting angle, α. For both optical and acoustic cases, the spectral location of resonances experiences a red-shift as a function of α. We demonstrate that the optical case can be understood as a natural evolution of resonances as the spiral length of the toroidal nanopropeller increases with α, implying a huge helicity dependent absorption cross section. In the case of acoustic response, two red-shifting breathing modes are identified. Additionally, even a small α allows the appearance of new low-frequency resonances, whose spectral dispersion depends on a competition between length of the generative spiral and the pitch of the toroidal nanopropeller.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68160cd4c2b9417ed03200dba699b974ac9f64ae53a5b8385397b09caf826d32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
