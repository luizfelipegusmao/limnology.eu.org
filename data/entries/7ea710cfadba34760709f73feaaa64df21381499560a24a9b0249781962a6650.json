{"title":"Altering cold-regulated gene expression decouples the salicylic acid–growth trade-off in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4293/7721303?rss=1","date":1721952000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), overproduction of salicylic acid (SA) increases disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance but penalizes growth. This growth–defense trade-off has hindered the adoption of SA-based disease management strategies in agriculture. However, investigation of how SA inhibits plant growth has been challenging because many SA-hyperaccumulating Arabidopsis mutants have developmental defects due to the pleiotropic effects of the underlying genes. Here, we heterologously expressed a bacterial SA synthase gene in Arabidopsis and observed that elevated SA levels decreased plant growth and reduced the expression of cold-regulated (<span>COR</span>) genes in a dose-dependent manner. Growth suppression was exacerbated at below-ambient temperatures. Severing the SA-responsiveness of individual <span>COR</span> genes was sufficient to overcome the growth inhibition caused by elevated SA at ambient and below-ambient temperatures while preserving disease- and abiotic-stress-related benefits. Our results show the potential of decoupling SA-mediated growth and defense trade-offs for improving crop productivity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"7ea710cfadba34760709f73feaaa64df21381499560a24a9b0249781962a6650","category":"Environment"}
