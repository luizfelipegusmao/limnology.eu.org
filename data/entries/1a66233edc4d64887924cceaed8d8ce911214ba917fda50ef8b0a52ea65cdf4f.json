Especially visualization of symbiotic interface can benefit from volume electron microscopy for understanding the interaction. Previously, the endosymbiosis between hard ticks and alphaproteobacterial endosymbionts came to light using two-dimensional microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.478-B1\">1</a>].

The endosymbiont is maternally transmitted, the dynamics were not known until the three-dimensional (3D) imaging [<a href=\"#ozae044.478-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1a66233edc4d64887924cceaed8d8ce911214ba917fda50ef8b0a52ea65cdf4f","category":"Environment"}
