{"title":"Can developmental plasticity shape sexual competition and promote reproductive isolation?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae047/7688271?rss=1","date":1717545600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Environmental factors, such as dietary nutrients, can shape the expression of developmentally plastic sexual traits in many species. However, while there has been extensive research into the developmental plasticity of sexual traits at the individual level, the broader consequences of this variation at the population scale remain poorly understood. Here, we asked whether plastic responses to the developmental environment can shape sexual competition and initiate reproductive isolation between populations. We reared neriid flies, <span>Telostylinus angusticollis</span>, on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor larval diets, generating adult flies that differed in body size and secondary sexual trait expression. We then investigated sexual competition in experimental populations from each developmental environment and tested for reproductive isolation between flies from mismatched environments. We found that, compared with poor-diet populations, rich-diet populations exhibited more frequent and escalated male–male combat and more frequent mating and mate-guarding. However, we found no evidence that sexual selection was affected by the developmental environment. Mismatched female–male pairs tended to take longer to mate and rich-diet females often rejected poor-diet males, but mismatched pairs were not less likely to mate within 1 h or produce viable offspring. Our findings suggest that developmental plasticity could generate dramatic differences in sexual competition between populations and could contribute to reproductive isolation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"2882fe555c4a0d5cac1d9a73f13a54688b2310f33f48b5f970ba4e2b6dffd0cd","category":"Environment"}
