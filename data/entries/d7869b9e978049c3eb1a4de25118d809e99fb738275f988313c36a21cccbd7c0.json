{"title":"A Longitudinal Study on Fingerprint Recognition in Infants, Toddlers, and Children","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0224/v1","date":1714966094000,"content":"Millions of children in developing countries face preventable deaths due to inadequate vaccination and malnutrition, in part due to insufficient monitoring and the absence of official identification. A reliable fingerprint recognition system can be a practical solution to address this issue. However, the scarcity of longitudinal fingerprint datasets for young children leads to unresolved questions regarding the earliest age for fingerprint biometric use, the frequency of enrollment required for reliable recognition, and the methods to accommodate agerelated changes. A few recent studies introduced high-resolution fingerprint scanners and showed promising recognition performance for young children. However, these studies were conducted on a small dataset over a shorter period with limited diversity; further evaluation of their finding is essential. This study assessed the effectiveness of a high-resolution contactless scanner in a controlled, diverse longitudinal dataset of children (0-15 years). Our results indicate that infants can be enrolled at five days old and reliably recognized after two months with a TAR= 100% @ FAR = 0.1%, and children aged 4-15 years can be recognized after one year with a TAR= 98.72% @ FAR = 0.1%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7869b9e978049c3eb1a4de25118d809e99fb738275f988313c36a21cccbd7c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
