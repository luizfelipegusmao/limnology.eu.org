Seven out of nine livelihood asset ownerships were found to have significantly improved after farmers’ being engaged in tree farming. A paired sample ttest was conducted to evaluate the possession of assets by respondents and it was found that household assets before tree farming was (M= 1.80, SD= 0.752) and after engaging in tree farming was (M=2.00, SD= 0.199), t (269) = 8.706, p&lt;0.0005(two-tailed). The mean increase score in houses ownership for instance was 0.2 at 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.433 to 0.033.
