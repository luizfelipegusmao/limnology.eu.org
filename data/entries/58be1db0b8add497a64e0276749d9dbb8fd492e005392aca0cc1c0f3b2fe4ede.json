{"title":"138 Regulation of post protein translational modification in adipogenesis and fat accumulation in pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/229/7757368?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In this study, we explored the role of protein transcriptional modification (PTM) in the adipogenesis and fat accumulation of intramuscular adipocytes. Intramuscular fat (IMF) is mainly stored in adipocytes interspersed in the perimysial space or within fascicles, and its content is a key factor attributing to meat quality in farm animals, especially in terms of tenderness, flavor and juiciness. The early stage from the fetus to the neonate is crucial for skeletal muscle development involving myogenesis, adipogenesis, and fibrogenesis, and is susceptible to environmental factors. Previous studies have been subjected to explore the molecular mechanism involved in IMF development. However, it was obscured by muscular background of IMF adipocytes. Therefore, we investigated PTM dynamics from three aspects: 1) first analyzed PTM levels of lysine acetylation (Kac), 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib), crotonylation (Kcr) and succinylation (Ksu) in three distinct differentiation potenctial primary stem cells, including myogenic precursor cells (MPCs), fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and MSCs isolated from neonatal longissimus dorsi muscle of pigs within 3-d of age; 2) Comparing the Khib levels of proliferative and differentiated FAPs; and 3) Exploring the role of Khib modification in the adipose tissue of obese- and lean-types of pigs. We found that only Khib level in FAPs was significantly greater than MSCs. During adipogenic differentiation of FAPs, the modification level of Khib was significantly increased quadratically in parallel with protein levels of acylation regulatory enzymes KAT5 (writer) and HDAC2 (Eraser). In comparison of Khib levels in FAPs in proliferation and in differentiation and Khib levels in backfat tissues from obese pigs (Laiwu pigs) and lean pigs (Duroc pigs), we also demonstrated that Khib modification level was positive correlated with adipogenic differentiation and fat accumulation. Accordingly, the expression patterns of KAT5 and HDAC2 were parallel to the degree of lipid accumulation in the backfat adipose tissue of finishing pigs. Furthermore, we showed that KAT5 knockdown in FAPs inhibited adipogenic differentiation, while HDAC2 knockdown enhanced adipogenic differentiation of FAPs. By employing C3H10T1/2 cells, we identified EON1 involved in Khib modification in regulation of adipo gesis and fat accumulation with analysis of Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using the Tandem Mass Tag (TMT Through conditional loss- and gain-of-function mutations, we further demonstrated that khib modification of ENO1 is necessary for preadipocyte differentiation and subsequent fat accumulation by mediating cellular glycolysis. In conclusion, we are the first to reveal the role of Khib modification in adipogenesis and fat deposition in pigs, and provided new clues for the improvement of fat accumulation and distribution via genetic selection and nutritional strategy in pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"58be1db0b8add497a64e0276749d9dbb8fd492e005392aca0cc1c0f3b2fe4ede","category":"Environment"}
