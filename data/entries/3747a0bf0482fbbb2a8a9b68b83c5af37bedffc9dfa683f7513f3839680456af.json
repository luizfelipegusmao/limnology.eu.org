{"title":"Towards sensory substitution and augmentation: Mapping visual distance to audio and tactile frequency","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299213","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Pingping Jiang, Christopher Kent, Jonathan Rossiter</p>\r\n\r\nMultimodal perception is the predominant means by which individuals experience and interact with the world. However, sensory dysfunction or loss can significantly impede this process. In such cases, cross-modality research offers valuable insight into how we can compensate for these sensory deficits through sensory substitution. Although sight and hearing are both used to estimate the distance to an object (e.g., by visual size and sound volume) and the perception of distance is an important element in navigation and guidance, it is not widely studied in cross-modal research. We investigate the relationship between audio and vibrotactile frequencies (in the ranges 47–2,764 Hz and 10–99 Hz, respectively) and distances uniformly distributed in the range 1–12 m. In our experiments participants mapped the distance (represented by an image of a model at that distance) to a frequency via adjusting a virtual tuning knob. The results revealed that the majority (more than 76%) of participants demonstrated a strong negative monotonic relationship between frequency and distance, across both vibrotactile (represented by a natural log function) and auditory domains (represented by an exponential function). However, a subgroup of participants showed the opposite positive linear relationship between frequency and distance. The strong cross-modal sensory correlation could contribute to the development of assistive robotic technologies and devices to augment human perception. This work provides the fundamental foundation for future assisted HRI applications where a mapping between distance and frequency is needed, for example for people with vision or hearing loss, drivers with loss of focus or response delay, doctors undertaking teleoperation surgery, and users in augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) environments.","author":"Pingping Jiang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3747a0bf0482fbbb2a8a9b68b83c5af37bedffc9dfa683f7513f3839680456af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
