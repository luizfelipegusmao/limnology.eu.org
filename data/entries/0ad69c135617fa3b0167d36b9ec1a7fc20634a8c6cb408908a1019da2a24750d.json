Different types of meteorological devices provide different accuracy of air velocity (va) measurements, which under limited air flow conditions, may result in a discrepancy in actual thermal stress level. Simultaneous measurements on warm summer days, performed with a cup anemometer and hot-wire probe, prove that too high starting threshold of the first of these sensors can lead to a discrepancy of actual wind speed, and as a consequence can distort MRT (estimated with globe thermometers) and PET values on average up to 10 °C and 1 °C, respectively.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"0ad69c135617fa3b0167d36b9ec1a7fc20634a8c6cb408908a1019da2a24750d","category":"Environment"}
