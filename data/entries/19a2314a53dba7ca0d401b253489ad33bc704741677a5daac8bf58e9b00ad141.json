In this study, we characterized <i>Okeanomitos corallinicola</i> gen. and sp. nov., a newly discovered toxic marine heterocyte-forming cyanobacterium isolated from a coral reef ecosystem of the South China Sea. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the 16S rRNA gene and the secondary structure of the 16S–23S rRNA intergenic region, placed this species in a clade distinct from closely related genera, that is, <i>Sphaerospermopsis</i> stricto sensu, <i>Raphidiopsis</i>, and <i>Amphiheterocytum</i>. The <i>O. corallinicola</i> is a marine benthic species lacking gas vesicles, distinguishing it from other members of the Aphanizomenonaceae family. The genome of <i>O. corallinicola</i> is large and exhibits diverse functional capabilities, potentially contributing to the resilience and adaptability of coral reef ecosystems. In vitro assays revealed that <i>O. corallinicola</i> demonstrates notable cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines, suggesting its potential as a source of novel anticancer compounds. Furthermore, the identification of residual saxitoxin biosynthesis function in the genome of <i>O. corallinicola</i>, a marine cyanobacteria, supports the theory that saxitoxin genes in cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates may have been horizontally transferred between them or may have originated from a shared ancestor. Overall, the identification and characterization of <i>O. corallinicola</i> provides valuable contributions to cyanobacterial taxonomy, offering novel perspectives on complex interactions within coral reef ecosystems.</p>","author":"Haiyan Li, \nRenhui Li, \nJianhua Kang, \nKieng Soon Hii, \nHala F.
