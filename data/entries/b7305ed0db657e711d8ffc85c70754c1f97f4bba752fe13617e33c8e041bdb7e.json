This talk presents two examples where MEMS-based holders are used primarily to control material processing and chemical reaction progress, enabling unique experiments assessing (1) solid-phase crystallization of a mixed ion-electron conducting (MIEC) amorphous complex oxide—a promising low-temperature solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell electrode, and (2) CaCO<sub>3</sub> calcination—a model solid-vapor decomposition reaction and the critical step in calcium looping for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and thermochemical energy storage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b7305ed0db657e711d8ffc85c70754c1f97f4bba752fe13617e33c8e041bdb7e","category":"Environment"}
