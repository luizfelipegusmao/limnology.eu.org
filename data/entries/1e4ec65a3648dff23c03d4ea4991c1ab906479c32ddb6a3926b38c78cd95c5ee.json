{"title":"Biochemical profiling and antioxidant activity analysis of commercially relevant seaweeds from northwest Europe","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13501?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The drive towards ensuring the sustainability of bioresources has been linked with better valorising primary materials and developing biorefinery pipelines. Seaweeds constitute valuable coastal resources with applications in the bioenergy, biofertiliser, nutrition, pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors. Owing to the various sought-after metabolites they possess, several seaweed species are commercially exploited throughout Western Europe, including Ireland. Here, four commercially relevant brown (<i>Fucus serratus</i> and <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>) and red (<i>Chondrus crispus</i> and <i>Mastocarpus stellatus</i>) seaweed species were sampled during a spring tide in July 2021 on moderately exposed shores across three coastal regions in the west of Ireland.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Significant regional differences were identified when specimens were analysed for carbohydrates (max. 80.3 μg glucose eq mg<sup>−1</sup> DW), proteins (max. 431.3 μg BSA eq. mg<sup>−1</sup> DW), lipids (max. 158.6 mg g<sup>−1</sup> DW), pigment signature and antioxidant potential. Protein content for <i>F. serratus</i> recorded a twofold difference between northern and southern specimens. The antioxidant potential of <i>F. vesiculosus</i> and <i>M. stellatus</i> returned greater activity compared to <i>F. serratus</i> and <i>C. crispus</i>, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a clear latitudinal pattern across the three western coastal regions (north, west and south) for both <i>F. vesiculosus</i> and <i>F. serratus</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>F. vesiculosus</i> thalli from the northwest were richer in pigment content while the <i>F. serratus</i> thalli from the northwest were richer in antioxidants. Such biogeographic patterns in the biochemical make-up of seaweeds need consideration for the development of regional integrated aquaculture systems and the optimisation of the biomass content for targeted downstream applications. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Adam McDonnell, \nTobias Luck, \nRóisín Nash, \nNicolas Touzet","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1e4ec65a3648dff23c03d4ea4991c1ab906479c32ddb6a3926b38c78cd95c5ee","category":"Environment"}
