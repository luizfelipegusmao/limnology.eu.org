{"title":"Long COVID: A Chronic Shortage of Blood. A Treatment Proposal Based on Reasoned Speculation from Pathophysiological Principles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.2109/v3","date":1716216430000,"content":"The signs and symptoms of Long COVID can be explained by a shortage of blood in the body and a resulting deficient blood flow through nearly all organs. This shortage arose during the acute phase of COVID19 by an increased breakdown of haematocytes, to which the liver responds by reducing the production of albumin, in order to prevent a too large decrease in haematocrit.In order to ensure the perfusion of organs that are directly necessary for survival, the body takes the emergency measure of diverting blood from other organs and tissues.  The perfusion of the blood-producing organs is also affected by this distribution measure, which hinders the smooth recovery of the total blood volume. The body is stuck in this vicious circle: a shortage of circulating blood hinders the recovery of blood production. This explains the long duration of Long COVID.   My proposed treatment of Long COVID focuses on the recovery of the correct volume of blood in the body of the right composition by the intravenous administration of donor blood products, starting with albumin concentrate. A trial treatment can be performed in any hospital without much additional preparations, and has a lower associated risk for the patient than analysing the total blood. A diagnosis ex juvantibus, by therapeutic response, is therefore preferable. I suspect that most Long COVID patients will exhibit a high serum ferritin level as a result of internal haemolysis, and haematocrit and albumin values at the high and low extremes of the reference range because the liver can not keep up with the recovery of the red bone marrow.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"befe8b3485e102544b761c07b36cfc4f755c9e486213dc0bd953bb7203c1750b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
