{"title":"‘Out of Africa’ origin of the pantropical staghorn fern genus Platycerium (Polypodiaceae) supported by plastid phylogenomics and biogeographical analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/5-6/697/7564620?rss=1","date":1705449600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>The staghorn fern genus <span>Platycerium</span> is one of the most commonly grown ornamental ferns, and it evolved to occupy a typical pantropical intercontinental disjunction. However, species-level relationships in the genus have not been well resolved, and the spatiotemporal evolutionary history of the genus also needs to be explored.<div>Methods</div>Plastomes of all the 18 <span>Platycerium</span> species were newly sequenced. Using plastome data, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among Polypodiaceae members with a focus on <span>Platycerium</span> species, and further conducted molecular dating and biogeographical analyses of the genus.<div>Key Results</div>The present analyses yielded a robustly supported phylogenetic hypothesis of <span>Platycerium</span>. Molecular dating results showed that <span>Platycerium</span> split from its sister genus <span>Hovenkampia</span> ~35.2 million years ago (Ma) near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary and began to diverge ~26.3 Ma during the late Oligocene, while multiple speciation events within <span>Platycerium</span> occurred during the middle to late Miocene. Biogeographical analysis suggested that <span>Platycerium</span> originated in tropical Africa and then dispersed eastward to southeast Asia–Australasia and westward to neotropical areas.<div>Conclusions</div>Our analyses using a plastid phylogenomic approach improved our understanding of the species-level relationships within <span>Platycerium</span>. The global climate changes of both the Late Oligocene Warming and the cooling following the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum may have promoted the speciation of <span>Platycerium</span>, and transoceanic long-distance dispersal is the most plausible explanation for the pantropical distribution of the genus today. Our study investigating the biogeographical history of <span>Platycerium</span> provides a case study not only for the formation of the pantropical intercontinental disjunction of this fern genus but also the ‘out of Africa’ origin of plant lineages.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"5c2d7f0584f62bdb71f896b52dcc8495b8b77755a89a11c20e923936a67f2651","category":"Environment"}
