{"title":"The calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK16 regulates hypoxia-induced ROS production by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase RBOHD in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3451/7687705?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is a key event in modulating plant responses to hypoxia and post-hypoxia reoxygenation. However, the molecular mechanism by which hypoxia-associated ROS homeostasis is controlled remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that the calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK16 regulates plant hypoxia tolerance by phosphorylating the plasma membrane-anchored NADPH oxidase respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD) to regulate ROS production in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). In response to hypoxia or reoxygenation, CPK16 was activated through phosphorylation of its Ser274 residue. The <span>cpk16</span> knockout mutant displayed enhanced hypoxia tolerance, whereas <span>CPK16-</span>overexpressing (<span>CPK16-</span>OE) lines showed increased sensitivity to hypoxic stress. In agreement with these observations, hypoxia and reoxygenation both induced ROS accumulation in the rosettes of <span>CPK16-</span>OEs more strongly than in the rosettes of the <span>cpk16-1</span> mutant or the wild type. Moreover, CPK16 interacted with and phosphorylated the N-terminus of RBOHD at 4 serine residues (Ser133, Ser148, Ser163, and Ser347) that were necessary for hypoxia- and reoxygenation-induced ROS accumulation. Furthermore, the hypoxia-tolerant phenotype of <span>cpk16-1</span> was fully abolished in the <span>cpk16 rbohd</span> double mutant. Thus, we have uncovered a regulatory mechanism by which the CPK16â€“RBOHD module shapes the ROS production during hypoxia and reoxygenation in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"c2a0ee391aa343aca29c1aca722d342c16d2a3d475de356734a942f54e3a3c92","category":"Environment"}
