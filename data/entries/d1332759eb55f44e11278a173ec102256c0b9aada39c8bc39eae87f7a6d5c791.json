{"title":"Slow-wave sleep drives sleep-dependent renormalization of synaptic AMPA receptor levels in the hypothalamus","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002768","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Jianfeng Liu, Niels Niethard, Yu Lun, Stoyan Dimitrov, Ingrid Ehrlich, Jan Born, Manfred Hallschmid</p>\r\n\r\nAccording to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), sleep serves to renormalize synaptic connections that have been potentiated during the prior wake phase due to ongoing encoding of information. SHY focuses on glutamatergic synaptic strength and has been supported by numerous studies examining synaptic structure and function in neocortical and hippocampal networks. However, it is unknown whether synaptic down-regulation during sleep occurs in the hypothalamus, i.e., a pivotal center of homeostatic regulation of bodily functions including sleep itself. We show that sleep, in parallel with the synaptic down-regulation in neocortical networks, down-regulates the levels of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the hypothalamus of rats. Most robust decreases after sleep were observed at both sites for AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit. Comparing the effects of selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep deprivation, we moreover provide experimental evidence that slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the driving force of the down-regulation of AMPARs in hypothalamus and neocortex, with no additional contributions of REM sleep or the circadian rhythm. SWS-dependent synaptic down-regulation was not linked to EEG slow-wave activity. However, spindle density during SWS predicted relatively increased GluA1 subunit levels in hypothalamic synapses, which is consistent with the role of spindles in the consolidation of memory. Our findings identify SWS as the main driver of the renormalization of synaptic strength during sleep and suggest that SWS-dependent synaptic renormalization is also implicated in homeostatic control processes in the hypothalamus.","author":"Jianfeng Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"d1332759eb55f44e11278a173ec102256c0b9aada39c8bc39eae87f7a6d5c791","category":"Environment"}
