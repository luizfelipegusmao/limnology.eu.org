{"title":"Novel embelin‐loaded transniosomes for topical delivery: comprehensive exploration of in vitro, ex vivo and dermatokinetic assessment for anti‐cancer activity","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13831?af=R","date":1724915102000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study systematically designed and optimised a transniosomal formulation containing embelin for skin cancer management. The transniosomes were developed using a rotary evaporation method and then optimised using a Box–Behnken design.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The optimized embelin-loaded transniosomes (Opt-EMB-TNs) exhibited a vesicle size of 149.01 nm, polydispersity index of 0.184, a zeta potential of −21.14 mV, an entrapment efficiency of 75.6 ± 0.65%, drug loading of 3.36 ± 0.03% and drug release of 80.88 ± 2.55%. The antioxidant potential of Opt-EMB-TNs was found to be 88.54% when compared to standard ascorbic acid. Dermatokinetic studies showed a greater drug deposition in targeted skin areas with Opt-EMB-TN gel compared to the embelin conventional gel (EMB-CF gel). In addition, the penetration depth study of the skin sample revealed that the transniosomal gel containing rhodamine B dye exhibited higher penetration than that of the rhodamine B dye containing hydroalcoholic solution. The efficacy of Opt-EMB-TNs for skin cancer was confirmed by cytotoxicity assay against the B16F10 melanoma cell line.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study concluded that the Opt-EMB-TN gel formulation is a promising and effective topical treatment for skin cancer, demonstrating significant potential for further development and clinical application. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Abdullah S Alshetaili, \nSalman Almohizea, \nMd.
