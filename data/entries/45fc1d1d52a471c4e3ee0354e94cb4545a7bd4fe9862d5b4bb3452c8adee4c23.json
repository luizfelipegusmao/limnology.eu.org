{"title":"Analysis of the impact of RCEP on the industrial and innovation chains of China’s textile and clothing industry","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309708","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Li Yang, Pivithuru Kumarasinghe</p>\r\n\r\nThis research examines the impact of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) on the textile and apparel industry within its member nations. The study seeks to understand the implications of RCEP on trade dynamics, innovation chains, and industrial integration in the textile sector. The study uses both quantitative analysis of trade data and qualitative assessment of policy frameworks to analyze changes in textile trade and patterns among RCEP members through UN Comtrade data. Qualitative analysis is conducted to examine RCEP policies related to intellectual property protection, investment regulations, and innovation cooperation. The findings reveal a significant increase in textile trade volume among RCEP member countries following the agreement’s implementation. China emerges as a key player, experiencing substantial growth in textile exports to RCEP nations, particularly driven by tariff reduction initiatives. RCEP provisions stimulate demand for innovation within the textile industry, fostering collaborative efforts in scientific research and development.","author":"Li Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"45fc1d1d52a471c4e3ee0354e94cb4545a7bd4fe9862d5b4bb3452c8adee4c23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
