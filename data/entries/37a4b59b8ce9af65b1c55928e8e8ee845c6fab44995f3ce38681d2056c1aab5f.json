{"title":"Synthesis of 2-Azetidinones via Cycloaddition Approaches: An Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1800/v1","date":1719381984000,"content":"The present review is a comprehensive update of the synthesis of monocyclic Î²-lactams via cycloaddition reactions. According to the IUPAC definition of cycloaddition, both elementary and stepwise processes (formal cycloadditions) have been considered. The years 2019-2022 are covered by the cited literature. The focus of the review is on synthetic aspects with emphasis on the structural scope, reaction conditions, mechanistic aspects, and selectivity results. Selected significant data related to biological activities and synthetic applications are also highlighted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37a4b59b8ce9af65b1c55928e8e8ee845c6fab44995f3ce38681d2056c1aab5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
