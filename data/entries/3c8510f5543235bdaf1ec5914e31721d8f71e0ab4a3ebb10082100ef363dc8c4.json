Data are derived from the results of a project carried out 20 years ago, aimed at inventorying the coleopteran of the park. This information provides a framework for comparison with current or future states since the time elapsed is long enough to detect variations. As the classification of <span>Tentyria</span> species is complex and controversial, the first aspect to be addressed was the taxonomical verification of the species. Indeed, they were <span>T. platyceps</span> Steven., <span>T. subcostata</span> Solier., <span>T. bifida</span> Bujalance, Cárdenas, Ferrer and Gallardo, and <span>T. donanensis</span> Bujalance, Cárdenas, Ferrer and Gallardo. Sampling consisted of 2 years of monthly pitfall trapping, encompassing the surface of the park and adjacent areas. Data on adult seasonal activity and spatial distribution of the species were obtained from the specific abundance in each sampling plot. Phenologically, the 4 species were mainly summer species, with unimodal or bimodal curves depending on the species. The distribution of the species was quite uneven: while <span>T. donanensis</span> was ubiquitous, <span>T. subcostata</span> was restricted to the southern coastal area of the park, and <span>T. platyceps</span> and <span>T. bifida</span> were recorded in the northern half, in marshes or inland forests, respectively. Our results also suggest that extreme temperatures may impose major constraints on the spatial distribution of <span>Tentyria</span> species, which could affect Doñana’s biodiversity in the future scenery of thermal rise linked to climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"3c8510f5543235bdaf1ec5914e31721d8f71e0ab4a3ebb10082100ef363dc8c4","category":"Environment"}
