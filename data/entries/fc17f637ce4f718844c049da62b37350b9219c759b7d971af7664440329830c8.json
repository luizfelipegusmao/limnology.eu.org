{"title":"Statistical Law between Areas and Perimeters Created by a Moving Trajectory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0564/v1","date":1725874942000,"content":"Based on our interest in properties of human movement, we investigated Japanese GPS data, and arrived at the following three observations: 1) there is a strong correlation between the area of polygons created by human movement trajectories and their perimeters; 2) short-distance movement trajectories less than 5 km tend to enclose a large area like a circle; 3) long-distance movement trajectories over 5 km tend to be straight.\nWe also clarified the following four observations on individual attributes and external factors related to long-distance movements: 1) women tend to travel more linearly than men; 2) linearity is stronger on weekends and national holidays in areas with a large theme park; 3) linearity is weaker on weekends and holidays in areas with many historical tourist attractions; 4) these variations are created by people visiting such areas. \nThese properties should be incorporated when modeling the movement trajectories of humans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc17f637ce4f718844c049da62b37350b9219c759b7d971af7664440329830c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
