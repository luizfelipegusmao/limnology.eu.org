{"title":"247 Evaluating the use of soybean hulls on growth performance, carcass composition, and digestibility when fed to grow-finish pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/148/7664809?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The addition of fiber to grow-finish diets is commonly utilized in swine production formulation as energy costs increase. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding soybean hulls (SBH) at increasing levels to grow-finish pigs on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients. Utilizing 192 grower pigs [PIC 337×1050, initial body weight (BW) = 21.99 ± 2.75 kg] that were randomly assigned to split sexed pens (n = 12 pens/treatment), pens were assigned to one of four dietary treatments and fed over three feeding phases for the estimated BW ranges of 22 to 50 kg, 50 to 86 kg, and 86 to 127 kg. Diets were formulated to represent conventional corn and soybean meal diets, containing increasing levels of SBH at: 1) 0% SBH (0%); 2) 7.5% SBH (7.5%); 3) 15% SBH (15%); and 4) 22.5% SBH (22.5%). Within phase, diets had equal SID Lys:ME and energy was allowed to float. Individual BW and pen feed disappearance were collected for each phase to calculate pen average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency gain to feed ratio (G:F). On d 56 of study and during phase 2, 32 gilts (n = 8) were placed into individual metabolism crates, where total urine and feces were collected for 72 h to measure ATTD of gross energy (GE), nitrogen (N), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF), then returned to original pens. At the completion of study, carcass weight, backfat depth, and loin depth were collected. Data were analyzed with the fixed effects of dietary treatment by ANOVA, linear, and quadratic contrasts. Pen served as the experimental unit for performance and carcass characteristics and pig as the experimental unit for ATTD analyses. Overall, as SBH increased from 0% to 22.5%, ADG tended to decrease (linear <span>P</span> = 0.060) with no difference in ADFI (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05), resulting in an overall decrease in G:F (0.38, 0.37, 0.36, 0.35; linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001; 0, 7.5, 15 and 22.5% SBH, respectively). Final BW tended to decrease (linear <span>P</span> = 0.069) and carcass weight decreased (102.9, 102.7, 99.7, and 96.5 kg, linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) as SBH increased in diet. Carcass fat depth (<span>P</span> = 0.014) and loin depth (<span>P</span> = 0.006) linearly decreased with increasing levels of SBH in the diet. Increasing levels of SBH from 0% to 22.5% decreased ATTD of GE and N (linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) and tended to increase ATTD NDF and ADF (linear <span>P</span> = 0.056 and <span>P</span> = 0.073, respectively). Altogether, these data suggest increasing dietary SBH in grow-finish pig diets decreases growth efficiency and the digestibility of GE and N. Further, feeding high inclusion rates of SBH negatively impacts carcass yield, backfat and loin depth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"215c60433854619dd41e469389662f094e494053cce315ab24c10350a5d79d4a","category":"Environment"}
