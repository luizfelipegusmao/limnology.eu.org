{"title":"Novel framework for dialogue summarization based on factual-statement fusion and dialogue segmentation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302104","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Mingkai Zhang, Dan You, Shouguang Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThe explosive growth of dialogue data has aroused significant interest among scholars in abstractive dialogue summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence framework called DS-SS (Dialogue Summarization with Factual-Statement Fusion and Dialogue Segmentation) for summarizing dialogues. The novelty of the DS-SS framework mainly lies in two aspects: 1) Factual statements are extracted from the source dialogue and combined with the source dialogue to perform the further dialogue encoding; and 2) A dialogue segmenter is trained and used to separate a dialogue to be encoded into several topic-coherent segments. Thanks to these two aspects, the proposed framework may better encode dialogues, thereby generating summaries exhibiting higher factual consistency and informativeness. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets SAMSum and DialogSum demonstrate the superiority of our framework over strong baselines, as evidenced by both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation.","author":"Mingkai Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"94bfedab91091364e03f08d4f9e48d399e8499e396b80b92d83c6558b60bbe22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
