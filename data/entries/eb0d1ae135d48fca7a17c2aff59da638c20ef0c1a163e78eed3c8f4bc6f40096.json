{"title":"The effects of salinity on the distribution and survival of two exotic ostracods in the Iberian Peninsula","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05472-y","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Recent research highlighted the need to include experimental estimates of tolerance limits to varying environmental conditions when investigating what factors limit species distributions. However, most niche approaches are only based on the statistical dependence between environmental and occurrence data. Here, we combined field data with survival experiments to assess the role of salinity as a limiting factor in the distribution of two species of exotic ostracods from the Iberian Peninsula. <em>Vizcainocypria viator</em> is a free-living species associated with rice fields and <em>Ankylocythere sinuosa</em> is a commensal of the red swamp crayfish (<em>Procambarus clarkii</em>). Experiments and field data indicate that the distribution of <em>V. viator</em> is limited by adult survival at low and high salinities (below electrical conductivity of 0.6 mS/cm and above 10 mS/cm). In the case of <em>A. sinuosa</em>, the analysis of field data shows that its prevalence is negatively affected by high salinity, whereas experiments indicate an optimal survival at high salinities (conductivity above 10.2 mS/cm), thus suggesting that high salinity may impact <em>A. sinuosa</em> distribution indirectly through affecting host traits (e.g. reduced activity). The habitat of close ancestors (marine versus non-marine respectively for <em>A. sinuosa</em> and <em>V. viator</em>) most likely explains the contrasting differences in salinity tolerance between both ostracod species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"eb0d1ae135d48fca7a17c2aff59da638c20ef0c1a163e78eed3c8f4bc6f40096","category":"Environment"}
