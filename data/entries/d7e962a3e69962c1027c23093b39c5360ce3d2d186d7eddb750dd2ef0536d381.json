{"title":"Location Problem in Relativistic Positioning: Relative Formulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0351/v1","date":1717666148000,"content":"A relativistic positioning system is a set of four emitters broadcasting their proper times by means of light signals. The four emitter times received at an event constitute the emission coordinates of the event. Covariant quantities associated with relativistic positioning systems are analysed relatively to an observer in Minkowski space-time by splitting them in their relative space-like and time-like components. The location of a user in inertial coordinates from a standard set of emission data (emitted times and satellite trajectories) is solved in the underlying 3+1 formalism. The analytical location solution obtained by Kleusberg for the GPS system is recovered and interpreted in a Minkowskian context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7e962a3e69962c1027c23093b39c5360ce3d2d186d7eddb750dd2ef0536d381","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
