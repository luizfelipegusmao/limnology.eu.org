By leveraging data from Oreda 6, the study proposes a methodology to establish baseline intervals for corrective, preventive, predictive, and proactive maintenance in the absence of comprehensive historical data. The analysis reveals key Weibull parameters, including shape and scale factors, and calculates reliability metrics such as the mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean remaining life (MRL). The results suggest effective maintenance intervals and highlight the utility of Weibull analysis in enhancing maintenance strategies. This approach offers a robust framework for optimizing maintenance practices, even with limited historical data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4acadb7927c5f9008e7823c46fc35a915aa0294234f3adb2d0156e3bd5b18217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
