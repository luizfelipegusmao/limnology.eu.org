{"title":"The Influence of Economic Uncertainty and Social Media Use on Religious Belief: Evidence from China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0031/v1","date":1720610239000,"content":"Although economic uncertainty and social media use are recognized as having a significant impact on religiosity, their role in religiosity has yet to be extensively examined in developing countries. This study explored the effects of economic uncertainty and social media use on religiosity in the Chinese context. By analyzing the publicly available data from the Chinese General Social Survey and World Values Survey, the findings showed that economic uncertainty significantly increased people's religious beliefs, while social media use had no significant impact on religious beliefs. Furthermore, social media use did not significantly moderate the relationship between economic uncertainty and religious belief. In contrast, educational level positively moderated the relationship between economic uncertainty and religious belief. These findings differ in part from the results of previous studies, presenting new evidence for theoretical integration in the field and revealing potential group differences in the strength of the relationship between economic uncertainty and religious belief.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7ee7d379206511949ee2b23f496366a0e3e4eef509c4fc259540786b60e0d74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
