{"title":"Evaluation of Expanded Clay and Tuff as Lightweight Agents in Concrete Stabilized with Nopal Mucilage and Aloe vera","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1587/v1","date":1729514246000,"content":"Lightweight concrete is a promising alternative in modern construction due to its reduced weight and potential to improve thermal and structural efficiency. Incorporating sustainable materials, such as nopal mucilage and aloe vera, can optimize its properties, promoting more eco-friendly practices in the industry. This study evaluates six concrete mixtures using different dosages of tuff, expanded clay, nopal mucilage, and aloe vera. Physical and mechanical tests were conducted, and the results revealed varied behaviors: mixtures with aloe vera showed extremes in water absorption and consistency, with tuff being very fluid and expanded clay having good workability. Mixtures with nopal mucilage were drier and less workable. In contrast, mixtures with expanded clay showed higher bulk density and variations in consistency and water absorption. Compressive strength varied depending on the lightweight agents used: mixtures with nopal mucilage-expanded clay and aloe vera-expanded clay showed moderate strengths, suggesting that these combinations can improve the strength of lightweight concrete. The different lightweight agents also affected the thermal and physical properties and the fractal dimension of the mixtures, indicating a greater structural complexity and better heat retention in combinations of expanded clay with nopal mucilage or aloe vera.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6cdde587bfb64ab8532ac7d64c89fa2c1201e7da508325bbd2d833ba589c8147","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
