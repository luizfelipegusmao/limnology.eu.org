{"title":"The Utilization of PRAME in the Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment of Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1316/v1","date":1726565940000,"content":"Melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, has seen improved survival rates due to advances in diagnosis and treatment, yet the need for further improvement remains critical. Tumor-associated antigens, such as PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma), offer promising avenues for enhanced diagnostic precision, prognostic assessment, and targeted immunotherapy. PRAME, a cancer-testis antigen, is selectively expressed in various cancers, including melanoma, and plays a key role in promoting tumorigenesis through inhibition of retinoic acid signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and immune evasion. This review explores the diagnostic utility of PRAME in distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi, its prognostic value in aggressive melanoma subtypes, and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies. While PRAME-targeted therapies face challenges such as tumor heterogeneity and immune suppression, ongoing research aims to overcome these barriers, offering hope for more effective melanoma treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39062389a60379c23f61349fa045516b0e2f969ffaf9590dde803f268e945fe9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
