Here, we evaluated the APT treatment as a tool to manage subclinical mastitis and its economic consequences in commercial farms. Recovery of the infected glands following APT treatment was compared to the customary no-treatment (NT) for cows with subclinical mastitis. Over 2 years, 467 cows with subclinical mastitis were identified. Subclinical mastitis was defined by elevated somatic cell count (SCC; &gt;1 Ã— 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) in the monthly test-day milk sample; 222 cows were treated with APT and 245 cows were not treated and served as control. Differences between treatment groups in culling, milk quality, milk yield and bacterial elimination were analyzed. After treatment, cure from bacteria was calculated only for cows with pre-isolated bacteria. The percentage of sampled cows determined as cured (no bacterial finding) in the NT group was 32.7% (35/107) (30.9% Gram negative; 32.4% Gram positive) and in the APT-treated group, 83.9% (42/55) (89.4% Gram negative; 80.6% Gram positive). Culling rate due to mastitis was significantly lower (&gt;90%) in the APT-treated vs. NT group. Recovery was 66.0% in the APT group compared to 11.5% in the NT group at 90 d post-treatment. Average milk volume per cow in the APT-treated group was 16.1% higher compared to NT cows. Based on the study, savings incurred by using APT to treat only subclinical cows per 100-cow herd can total $15,106/y, or $309 per treated subclinically infected cow.","author":"Uzi Merin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fc02f91dc6800d428373d692a938b2dae2ff0ed94552890fed499498037624ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
