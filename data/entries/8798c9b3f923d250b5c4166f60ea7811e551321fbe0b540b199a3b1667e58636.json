{"title":"Electrical-Quantum Modelling of the Neutron and Proton as a Three-Phase Alternating Current Electrical Generator. Determination of the Number of Quarks-Antiquarks-Gluons and Gravitons, Inside a Neutron","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.2076/v2","date":1711970933000,"content":"Here we will electrically-quantum model the neutron and proton as a three-phase alternating current electric generator, for this, we will use the theory of three-phase electric generators and vector or phasor diagrams. We will use this model to hypothesize how the quarks that form neutrons and protons with a combined mass of 10 MeV/c², can generate, through quarks-antiquarks-gluon interactions, a mass of 939.56 MeV/c² for the neutron and a mass of 938.27 MeV/c² for the proton. Using quantum mechanics and the theory of the generalization of the Boltzmann constant in curved space-time we will calculate the number of quarks-antiquarks-gluons and gravitons inside a neutron. We will also analyse βˉ decay using vector diagrams, we will calculate the tension of the string T₀ and the length of the string ℓs between quarks-antiquark and finally, we will model a black hole using a neutron equivalent model.  In version 2 of this article, we will update the vector diagrams of the βˉ decay and theoretically calculate the energy of the W⁻ boson, the Z⁰ boson, and the Θ angle, Θ = arc cos (W⁻/Z⁰). We will demonstrate, through vector diagrams, that quarks-antiquarks-gluon interactions are the cause of the origin of the W⁻ boson and the Z⁰ boson. We will also demonstrate how the fine structure constant α originates. It is important to make clear, in future updates, we will describe the relationship that exists between the theory described in this paper and the Isospin theory, flavour and colour theory","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8798c9b3f923d250b5c4166f60ea7811e551321fbe0b540b199a3b1667e58636","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
