Using state-of-the-art epidemiological and climatological datasets, we examined the association between multiple heat stress indicators (HSIs) and daily human mortality in 739 cities worldwide. Notable differences were observed in the long-term trends and timing of heat events detected by HSIs. Air temperature (T<sub>air</sub>) predicts heat-related mortality well in cities with a robust negative T<sub>air</sub>-relative humidity correlation (C<sub>T-RH</sub>). However, in cities with near-zero or weak positive C<sub>T-RH</sub>, HSIs considering humidity provide enhanced predictive power compared to T<sub>air</sub>. Furthermore, the magnitude and timing of heat-related mortality measured by HSIs could differ largely from those associated with T<sub>air</sub> in many cities. Our findings provide important insights into specific regions where humans are vulnerable to humid heat and can facilitate the further enhancement of heat-health alert systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"cb767dc40c254faefcec1f97bd2704ae3bbfbb55d4eaf6ea3b753103503abdac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
