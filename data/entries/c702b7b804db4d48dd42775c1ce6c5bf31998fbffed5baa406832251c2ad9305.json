All the larvae were of similar size and at a similar state of digestion, indicating they were all consumed together. The likely explanation for this observation is that greater eelpout lay their eggs in a nest, with the larvae remaining in the nest for a short period after hatching. The larvae were then predated upon by the spotted wolffish while still in the nest. This study sheds new light on greater eelpout in Icelandic waters, with recently hatched larvae being present in March, breeding at a depth of ~200–250 m, and likely exhibiting nesting behavior, which has not previously been documented.</p>","author":"James Kennedy, \nÁsgeir Gunnarsson, \nChristophe Pampoulie, \nRupert Wienerroither","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"c702b7b804db4d48dd42775c1ce6c5bf31998fbffed5baa406832251c2ad9305","category":"Environment"}
