{"title":"Berkeley‐RWAWC: A New CYGNSS‐Based Watermask Unveils Unique Observations of Seasonal Dynamics in the Tropics","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037060?af=R","date":1720580732000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The UC Berkeley Random Walk Algorithm WaterMask from CYGNSS (Berkeley-RWAWC) is a new data product designed to address the challenges of monitoring inundation in regions hindered by dense vegetation and cloud cover as is the case in most of the Tropics. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation provides data with a higher temporal repeat frequency compared to single-satellite systems, offering the potential for generating moderate spatial resolution inundation maps with improved temporal resolution while having the capability to penetrate clouds and vegetation. This paper details the development of a computer vision algorithm for inundation mapping over the entire CYGNSS domain (37.4°N–37.4°S). The sole reliance on CYGNSS data sets our method apart in the field, highlighting CYGNSS's indication of water existence. Berkeley-RWAWC provides monthly, low-latency inundation maps starting in August 2018 and across the CYGNSS latitude range, with a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01°. Here we present our workflow and parameterization strategy, alongside a comparative analysis with established surface water data sets (SWAMPS, WAD2M) in four regions: the Amazon Basin, the Pantanal, the Sudd, and the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The comparisons reveal Berkeley-RWAWC's enhanced capability to detect seasonal variations, demonstrating its usefulness in studying tropical wetland hydrology. We also discuss potential sources of uncertainty and reasons for variations in inundation retrievals. Berkeley-RWAWC represents a valuable addition to environmental science, offering new insights into tropical wetland dynamics.</p>","author":"Tianjiao Pu, \nCynthia Gerlein‐Safdi, \nYing Xiong, \nMengze Li, \nEric A.
