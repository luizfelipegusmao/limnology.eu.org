{"title":"Perceptions of Supply Chain Sustainability and Its Influence on Consumer Buying Decisions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1483/v1","date":1718950260000,"content":"This qualitative study explores consumer perceptions of supply chain sustainability and its impact on buying decisions. Through in-depth interviews and focus groups, the research investigates the multifaceted factors influencing consumer behaviors towards sustainable products. Findings reveal that environmental impact, social responsibility, transparency, economic considerations, and cultural influences are pivotal in shaping consumer attitudes. While consumers express strong motivations to support sustainability, practical barriers such as higher costs and limited availability often hinder consistent adoption of sustainable practices. Effective communication strategies, including transparency reports and sustainability certifications, emerge as crucial in bridging the gap between consumer intentions and actions. The study underscores the importance of aligning corporate sustainability initiatives with consumer expectations to build trust and foster sustainable consumption patterns. Insights suggest a need for targeted interventions and policy measures to address barriers and promote broader adoption of sustainable behaviors. By understanding and responding to consumer concerns, businesses can enhance their sustainability strategies and contribute to a more environmentally and socially responsible marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71603df01be16d675a615df452da44bdeee8d9eb1207afe43651775a410e1d7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
