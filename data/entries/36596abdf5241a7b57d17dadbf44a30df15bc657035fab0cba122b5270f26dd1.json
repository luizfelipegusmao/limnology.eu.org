{"title":"The Interactions between Smoking and Sleep","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1402/v1","date":1718874715000,"content":"Smoking a cigarette before bed or first thing in the morning is a common habit. In this review the relationship between smoking and sleep is investigated, based on the existing literature. Tobacco smoking disrupts sleep architecture by reducing slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and undermining sleep quality. Furthermore, smoking affects sleep-related co-morbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), insomnia, parasomnias, arousals, bruxism, restless legs but also non-sleep-related conditions such as cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, neurologic, psychiatric, inflammatory, gynecologic and pediatric. This review aims to consolidate all the existing knowledge about the relationship between smoking and sleep.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36596abdf5241a7b57d17dadbf44a30df15bc657035fab0cba122b5270f26dd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
