{"title":"Outlook of Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) for the Substitution of Fossil Fuels in the Industrial Utilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0155/v1","date":1719881858000,"content":"This paper reviews the requirements for the production, quality, and quality assurance of solid recovered fuels (SRF) that are increasingly used for the substitution of fossil fuels in the indus-trial utilities.  The economical, technological and environmental aspects should be considered before using SRF as an alternative fuel.  In general, the most important factors determining the commercial production of SRF referred to the calorific values and their available amounts adopted in the starting materials.  Furthermore, the low-melting impurities and undesired constituents/elements, including chlorine, sulfur, potassium and sodium, may pose negative impacts on air pollutant emission and slagging &amp; fouling in the process utilities.  In this regard, the vent emitted from the industrial utilities must comply with the effluent standards of station-ary sources like particulate, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals (e.g., lead, cadmium, and mercury) and dioxins.  For these reasons, this work will summarize the legal or regulatory requirements under development in Asian countries (i.e., Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan) and European Union (EU).  Finally, the outlook of solid recovered fuel (SRF) in the waste manage-ment and industrial sectors will be addressed to echo the sustainable development goals (SDGs).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f55d6874db88c9474dfd7a961cab154ff7907bbcff16c20fe9053c76f6fae550","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
