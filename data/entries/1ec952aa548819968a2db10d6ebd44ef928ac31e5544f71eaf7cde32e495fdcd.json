{"title":"Assessing the Societal Risks of AI&rsquo;s Rapid Advancement: Innovation or Threat to Safety?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1217/v1","date":1726534557000,"content":"The rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked extensive debate about its impact on the safety and security of society. While AI has shown trans- formative potential, particularly in areas such as healthcare and independent structures where it complements productivity and minimizes human error, accu- racy and protection. However, the misuse of artificial intelligence poses real risks, along with threats such as deep counterfeiting, computer cyber-attacks and the manipulation of social behavior through disinformation. These risks vary from privacy and cyber security breaches to moral dilemmas around liability. The unchecked improvement of AI is expected to threaten the social order, so the relationship between innovation and governance is essential so that AI-related threats do not overshadow its benefits. This article offers a detailed assessment and review of the literature that studies the potential dangers that AI poses to society. The cumulative effects underscore the urgent need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks to mitigate these threats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ec952aa548819968a2db10d6ebd44ef928ac31e5544f71eaf7cde32e495fdcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
