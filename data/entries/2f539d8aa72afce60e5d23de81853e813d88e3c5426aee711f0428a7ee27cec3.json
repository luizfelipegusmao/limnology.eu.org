{"title":"SaBi3d - A LiDAR Point Cloud Data Set of Car-to-Bicyle Overtaking Maneuvers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0255/v1","date":1717568729000,"content":"While cycling presents environmental benefits and promotes a healthy lifestyle, the risks associated with overtaking maneuvers by motorized vehicles pose significant hindrances for many potential cyclists. Large-scale analysis of overtaking maneuvers could inform traffic researches and city planners on how to reduce these risks by better understanding these maneuvers. Drawing from the fields of sensor-based cycling research and of LiDAR-based traffic data sets, this paper provides a step towards addressing these safety concerns by introducing the Salzburg Bicycle 3d (SaBi3d) data set, consisting of LiDAR point clouds capturing car-to-bicycle overtaking maneuvers. The data set, collected using a LiDAR-equipped bicycle, facilitates detailed analysis of a large quantity of overtaking maneuvers without the need for manual annotation through enabling automatic labeling by a neural network. Additionally, a benchmark result for 3d object detection using a competitive neural network is provided as a baseline for future research. The SaBi3d data set is structured identically to the nuScenes data set, and therefore offers compatibility with numerous existing object detection systems. This work provides valuable resources for future researchers to better understand cycling infrastructure and mitigate risks, thus promoting cycling as a viable mode of transportation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f539d8aa72afce60e5d23de81853e813d88e3c5426aee711f0428a7ee27cec3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
