{"title":"Preliminary Source Rock Evaluation and Hydrocarbon Generation Potential of the Tithonian&ndash;Berriasian Interval in the Zagros Basin, Iraq: Organic Geochemical Evaluation and 1D Basin Modeling Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0558/v1","date":1720420322000,"content":"The hydrocarbon generation potential of Chia Gara strata and their genetic link with produced oils from the Zagros basin are still not comprehensively investigated. Forty-seven rock samples from the Tithonian–Berriasian interval were subjected to geochemical analyses to infer organic matter enrichment, hydrocarbon potential, thermal maturity, and timing for hydrocarbon generation/expulsion and their implications regarding upcoming petroleum explorations in the Zagros basin. The results showed that the Chia Gara rock samples have fair to very-good generation potential, as confirmed by higher total organic carbon (TOC=0.68–3.95 wt%) and Rock-Eval (S1+S2=3.37–8.52 mg HC/g rock). The hydrogen index (HI=171–462) and Rock-Eval Tmax over 430 °C support the presence of Types II and mixed Types II/III kerogen. These results confirm the high generation potential of the Chia Gara Formation in the study region. 1D basin models of the KK–109 well show that over 55% of kerogens were converted into oil in the Cretaceous (77–67 Ma). Expulsion started from the Miocene until now (22–0 Ma), consistent with 0.71–0.80 of modeled Easy%Ro and 55–80 %TR. Consequently, this project confirms the potential oil expulsion from the Chia Gara Formation, which can be a resource for upcoming hydrocarbon investigation in the Zagros basin, Iraq.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af155034ff3e3ff15656c39c3bed6ecd506eac01d88fd69d806cdddfbba47f4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
