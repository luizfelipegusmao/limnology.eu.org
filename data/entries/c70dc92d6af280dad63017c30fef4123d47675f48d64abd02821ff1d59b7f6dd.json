{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Technologies Applied to Smart Grids and Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1248/v2","date":1722432071000,"content":"Smart grids represent the evolution of traditional electrical grids through the integration of digital and communication technologies. These grids are capable of monitoring and managing the distribution of electricity efficiently and resiliently. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in this context, offering advanced solutions for optimization, forecasting, and energy management. This paper explores the main AI technologies applied to smart grids, highlighting their advantages, challenges, and impacts on energy efficiency and sustainability. The methodology employed includes a comprehensive literature review, analysis of current AI applications in smart grids, and examination of case studies to illustrate the practical implementation and benefits of AI technologies in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c70dc92d6af280dad63017c30fef4123d47675f48d64abd02821ff1d59b7f6dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
