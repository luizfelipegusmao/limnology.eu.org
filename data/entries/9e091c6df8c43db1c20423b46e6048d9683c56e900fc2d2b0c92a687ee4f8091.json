{"title":"Understanding the Impact of Climate and Seismic Hazard Conditions on Multi-criteria Based Retrofitting of Existing Buildings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0748/v1","date":1712832933000,"content":"A large share of the reinforced-concrete (RC) building stock in Mediterranean countries faces a dual challenge of seismic vulnerability and energy inefficiency, calling for urgent renovation ef-forts. While energy upgrades have been the focus of previous renovation policies, recent research highlights the critical need for integrated retrofitting solutions that address both structural integ-rity and energy performance. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches are a promis-ing tool for optimizing the combined choice of these integrated interventions, considering various decision variables (DVs), of economic, social, environmental, and technical nature. To understand the impact of climate and seismic hazard conditions on multi-criteria based retrofitting assess-ment, a case-study RC school building is selected and assumed to be located in three distinct cli-mate conditions - cold, mild, and warm - and three seismic hazard levels â€“ low, medium and high. Moreover, given the complexity and challenges of quantifying seismic performance metrics for practitioners, an available simplified (practice-oriented) approach is compared herein with a more thorough research-based one for quantifying the seismic performance of RC buildings with-in the MCDM framework. Both approaches are applied to the case-study building, considering twelve possible combinations of energy and seismic interventions. The accuracy of the practice-oriented approach and its impact on the retrofitting rankings is evaluated, emphasizing the im-portance of accessible and efficient evaluation methods in facilitating informed decision-making for building renovation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e091c6df8c43db1c20423b46e6048d9683c56e900fc2d2b0c92a687ee4f8091","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
