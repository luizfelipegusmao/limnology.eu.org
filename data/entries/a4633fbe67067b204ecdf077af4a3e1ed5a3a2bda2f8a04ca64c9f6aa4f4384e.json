{"title":"Internet use and its association with physical activity among adolescents in Beni Municipality, Myagdi, Nepal","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302456","date":1714744800000,"content":"<p>by Shristi K. C., Hari Prasad Kaphle, Nirmala Neupane, Samjhana Baral</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Adolescence is a critical phase marked by distinct health and developmental needs and rights. It represents a pivotal time for the acquisition of knowledge, skills, emotional regulations, and relationship management. However, a recent surge in internet usage among adolescents has been observed, leading to a concerning decline in physical activity. This study aims to evaluate the level of physical activity and its correlation with internet use among adolescents.</p> Materials and methods <p>A cross-sectional study, conducted within educational institutions in Beni, Nepal, utilized a self-structured questionnaire to collect data on physical activity levels and associated factors. The relationship between physical activity and independent variables was assessed through the chi-square test, and regression analysis was employed to quantify the strength of this association.</p> Results <p>The study revealed that 75.3% of adolescents (out of 385) exhibited inadequate physical activity levels. Notably, late adolescents were more susceptible to insufficient physical activity than their middle adolescent counterparts were. Adolescents from nuclear families (UOR = 2.689, C.I = 4.074–22.822), those with higher monthly family income (UOR = 3.318, C.I = 1.209–9.105), and individuals using Wi-Fi (UOR = 1.801, C.I = 1.117–2.904) demonstrated a higher likelihood of internet addiction. Moreover, these groups were more prone to engage in inadequate physical activity (UOR = 1.1740, C.I = 0.938–3.226) compared to their counterparts not addicted to the internet.</p> Conclusion <p>The study concludes that over two-thirds of adolescents were addicted to the Internet, and three-fourths were inadequately physically active, with late adolescents being more affected than middle adolescents. Inadequate physical activity was associated with various factors, including family type, monthly family income, monthly pocket money, father’s occupation, type of school, type of internet access, and Internet Addiction Test (IAT) score. Internet-addicted adolescents were found to be more likely to be physically inactive.</p>","author":"Shristi K.
