{"title":"Integrated Approach to Reservoir Simulations for Evaluating Pilot CO2 Injection in a Depleted Naturally Fractured Oil Field On-Shore Europe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0022/v1","date":1714574838000,"content":"Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a necessary requirement for high-emitting CO2 industries to significantly reduce volumes of greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere and mitigate the climate change. Geological CO2 storage into depleted oil and gas fields is the fastest and most accessible option for CCS deployment allowing for re-purposing of existing infrastructure and utilizing the significant knowledge about the subsurface acquired during the field production operations. Location of such depleted fields in neighbourhood of high-emitting CO2 industries is additional advantage available for matured on-shore Europe fields. Considering these advantages, the oil and gas operators are now evaluating different possibilities for CO2 sequestration projects for the fields approaching end of production. \nThis article describes an integrated approach to reservoir simulations focused on evaluating CO2 injection pilot at one of such matured fields operated by MND and located in the Czech Republic. The potential CO2 injection site in focus is a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir. This oil-bearing formation has a gas cap at the top and a limited aquifer at the bottom of the reservoir and was produced mainly by pressure depletion with quite limited pressure support from water injection. The article summarizes results of efforts taken by the multi-disciplinary team to develop and apply an integrated approach to reservoir simulation started from geological modelling of the naturally fractured reservoir  and integrating results of laboratory studies and their interpretation (geomechanical and geochemistry laboratory experiments) and dynamic field data analysis (pressure transient analysis including time-lapse) into the history matching of the reservoir model and simulations of pilot CO2 injection. Attention is given to evaluating and modelling stress-sensitive fracture properties and safe injection envelope preventing induced fracturing as well as impact of potential salt precipitation in the near wellbore area. These effects are considered in the context of pilot CO2 injection and addressed in reservoir simulations of the injection scenarios. Single porosity and permeability reservoir simulations with dominating fracture flow and black-oil formulation with CO2 simulated as a solvent were used in this study and arguments for such choice of the simulation approach for the site in focus are shortly discussed. The reservoir simulations have indicated larger site injection capacity than required for the pilot injection and allowed to evaluate CO2 migration pathway within the reservoir. The application of the approach to the site in focus has also revealed large uncertainties, related to fracture description and geomechanical evaluations, resulted in an uncertain safe injection envelope. These uncertainties should be addressed in further studies in preparation to the pilot. The article concludes with an overview of the outcomes of the integrated approach and its application to the field in focus including discussion of issues and uncertainties revealed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92d81b29da55e6b97dd4216fe6b1111cd2049c500124f2c1b6d2ea31958b55a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
