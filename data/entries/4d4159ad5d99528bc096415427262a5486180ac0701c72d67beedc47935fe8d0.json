{"title":"Novel Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Interfering Migraine Therapies and Stroke &ndash; a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1111/v1","date":1728975544000,"content":"Migraine and stroke are neurological disorders with significant global prevalence and impact. Recent advances in migraine therapy have focused on calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway. This review examines the shared pathomechanisms between migraine and stroke, with emphasis on the role of CGRP. We analyze current literature on CGRP's functions in cerebrovascular regulation, edema formation, neuroinflammation, and neuroprotection. CGRP acts as a potent vasodilator and plays a crucial role in trigeminovascular activation during migraine attacks. In stroke, CGRP has demonstrated neuroprotective effects by improving collateral circulation and reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of CGRP inhibsitors on stroke risk and outcomes. Studies in animals suggest that CGRP receptor antagonists may worsen cerebral ischemia by impairing collateral flow. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of CGRP-targeting therapies in migraine patients, especially those at increased risk of stroke. Additionally, we explore the complex interplay between CGRP, endothelial function, and platelet activity in both conditions. This review highlights the need for further research to elucidate the long-term cerebrovascular safety of CGRP pathway inhibitors and to identify potential subgroups of migraine patients who may be at higher risk of adverse cerebrovascular events with these novel therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d4159ad5d99528bc096415427262a5486180ac0701c72d67beedc47935fe8d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
