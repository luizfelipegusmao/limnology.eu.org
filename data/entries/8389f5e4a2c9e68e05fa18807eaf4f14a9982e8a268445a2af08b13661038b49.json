{"title":"On the Natural Intelligence and Consciousness of the Immune System and Its Relationship with the Brain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.1335/v4","date":1712585281000,"content":"In this article, we consider the relationship between the brain and the immune system in the context of the Orch OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) theory of consciousness. Orch OR is a theory that postulates that consciousness arises from quantum computations occurring inside microtubules. The immune system is capable of acquiring, learning, and remembering information, thus showing all the attributes of natural intelligence. We argue that the immune system also has the attribute of consciousness and can gain access to an amount of information greater than what is accessible to the brain since it is not constrained by brain's reducing valve that is responsible for cognitive bottlenecks. We also describe the role of meditation and religious chanting in affecting the brain and immune system. We speculate that some effects of religious chanting on the immune system may not be mediated by the brain. Finally, we examine the role of the immune system in connecting with the consciousness embedded in the universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8389f5e4a2c9e68e05fa18807eaf4f14a9982e8a268445a2af08b13661038b49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
