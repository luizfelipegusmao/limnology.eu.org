{"title":"Bait Biomass and Caloric Contribution From the Dungeness Crab (Cancer magister) Fishery in Oregon, USA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12743?af=R","date":1727766126000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Fishery discards worldwide increase the availability of organic materials on the benthos, altering trophic relationships and potentially increasing the abundance of benthic consumers. Expert knowledge from fishers is a valuable yet often underutilized source of information to understand these dynamics. We interviewed Dungeness crab fishers (<i>n</i> = 24) to determine the most-used bait types and to characterize regional and seasonal bait use strategies that drive inputs of organic matter into Oregon coastal waters during the commercial Dungeness crab fishery each year. Based on bomb calorimetry measurements of caloric densities of 12 commonly reported bait species, total energetic input was 12.99 × 10<sup>9</sup> kJ (3.10 B kcal) from bait in the 2019–2020 commercial ocean Dungeness season in Oregon, USA. Fishing effort and bait inputs were strongly seasonal, with 88% of effort concentrated in the first 60 days of the 9-month-long season but did not vary regionally. This large, temporally concentrated caloric input suggested that bait could contribute substantially to Dungeness crab productivity. Fisher respondents indicated that bait effectiveness was the most important motivating factor in choosing a bait type, more than availability or cost.</p>","author":"Toby Harbison, \nSarah K.
