Fish were sampled between May 2017 to July 2021 in irregular intervals, using gill nets (mesh sizes 6, 10, and 16 cm) and cage nets (mesh size 1 cm). Total length (to nearest 0.1 cm, L) and total weight (to nearest 0.001 g, W) were determined. Length-weight relationships (LWRs) were estimated through the linear regression of W = <i>a</i>L<sup>\n   <i>b</i>\n</sup>. The <i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> values for all LWRs estimates were all above .96, indicating that no serious outlier values were included in the samples.</p>","author":"Songhao Ji, \nLiuyong Ding, \nJuan Tao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"87aedfa794d664eb61d71d6d1fedfcb27bc667fb96739c2b10d60068ea344eb7","category":"Environment"}
