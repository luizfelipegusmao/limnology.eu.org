However, what regulates the consequence of precipitation extremes on productivity remains unclear. Based on a 9-year field manipulation experiment on the Qinghaiâ€“Tibetan Plateau, we found that the responses of gross primary productivity (GPP) to extreme drought and wetness were differentially regulated by nitrogen (N) deposition. Over increasing N deposition, extreme dry events reduced GPP more. Among the 12 biotic and abiotic factors examined, this was mostly explained by the increased plant canopy height and proportion of drought-sensitive species under N deposition, making photosynthesis more sensitive to hydraulic stress. While extreme wet events increased GPP, their effect did not shift over N deposition. These site observations were complemented by a global synthesis derived from the GOSIF GPP dataset, which showed that GPP sensitivity to extreme drought was larger in ecosystems with higher N deposition, but GPP sensitivity to extreme wetness did not change with N deposition. Our findings indicate that intensified hydroclimatic variability would lead to a greater loss of land carbon sinks in the context of increasing N deposition, due to that GPP losses during extreme dry years are more pronounced, yet without a synchronous increase in GPP gains during extreme wet years. The study implies that the conservation and management against climate extremes merit particular attention in ecosystems subject to N deposition.</p>","author":"Jinlong Peng, \nFangfang Ma, \nQuan Quan, \nJiaqiang Liao, \nChen Chen, \nYiheng Wang, \nJiwang Tang, \nChuanlian Sun, \nQingping Zhou, \nShuli Niu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"0eceec52c6915f03f5f8c0d263f69be683f8b064f1117de41601f8f816abb935","category":"Environment"}
