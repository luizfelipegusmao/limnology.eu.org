{"title":"Using network science to examine audio-visual speech perception with a multi-layer graph","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300926","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Michael S. Vitevitch, Lorin Lachs</p>\r\n\r\nTo examine visual speech perception (i.e., lip-reading), we created a multi-layer network (the AV-net) that contained: (1) an auditory layer with nodes representing phonological word-forms and edges connecting words that were phonologically related, and (2) a visual layer with nodes representing the viseme representations of words and edges connecting viseme representations that differed by a single viseme (and additional edges to connect related nodes in the two layers). The results of several computer simulations (in which activation diffused across the network to simulate word identification) are reported and compared to the performance of human participants who identified the same words in a condition in which audio and visual information were both presented (Simulation 1), in an audio-only presentation condition (Simulation 2), and a visual-only presentation condition (Simulation 3). Another simulation (Simulation 4) examined the influence of phonological information on visual speech perception by comparing performance in the multi-layer AV-net to a single-layer network that contained only a visual layer with nodes representing the viseme representations of words and edges connecting viseme representations that differed by a single viseme. We also report the results of several analyses of the errors made by human participants in the visual-only presentation condition. The results of our analyses have implications for future research and training of lip-reading, and for the development of automatic lip-reading devices and software for individuals with certain developmental or acquired disorders or for listeners with normal hearing in noisy conditions.","author":"Michael S.
