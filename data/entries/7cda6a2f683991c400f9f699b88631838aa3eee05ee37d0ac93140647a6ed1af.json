{"title":"Predator metamorphosis and its consequence for prey risk assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae014/7623295?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Living with a diverse array of predators provides a significant challenge for prey to learn and retain information about each predator they encounter. Consequently, some prey respond to novel predators because they have previous experience with a perceptually similar predator species, a phenomenon known as generalization of predator recognition. However, it remains unknown whether prey can generalize learned responses across ontogenetic stages of predators. Using wood frog tadpole (<span>Lithobates sylvaticus</span>) prey, we conducted two experiments to explore the extent of predator generalization of different life stages of two different predators: (1) predacious diving beetles (<span>Dytiscus</span> sp.) and (2) tiger salamanders (<span>Ambystoma mavortium</span>). In both experiments, we used chemical alarm cues (i.e., injured conspecific cues) to condition tadpoles to recognize the odor of either the larval or adult stage of the predator as risky. One day later, we tested tadpoles with either the larval or adult predator odor to determine whether they generalized their learned responses to the other life stages of the predator. Tadpoles generalized between larval and adult beetle odors but failed to generalize between larval and adult salamander odors. These results suggest that the odor of some predator species changes during metamorphosis to an extent that reduces their recognisability by prey. This “predator identity reset” increases the number of threats to which prey need to attend.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"7cda6a2f683991c400f9f699b88631838aa3eee05ee37d0ac93140647a6ed1af","category":"Environment"}
