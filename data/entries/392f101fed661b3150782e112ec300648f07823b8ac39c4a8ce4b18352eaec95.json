{"title":"Diabetes Awareness Campaigns to Prevent Ketoacidosis at the Diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes: Efficacy on Multiple Outcomes and Predictors of Success: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1959/v1","date":1729785967000,"content":"In our country, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is still very high (35.7-39.6%), especially in youths. We aimed to determine the efficacy of awareness campaigns to prevent DKA on multiple outcomes and identify success predictors. The review included studies that focused on children under 18 years old, and outcomes were measured by comparing before and after implementing the campaigns in the same area and between areas where interventions took place or not. Of 177 records identified, 15 were eligible for analysis. The pooled difference in DKA frequency after a campaign implementation was between 1% and 65.5%. A decrease in the rate of acute complications, such as cerebral edema, was reported. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at onset showed a mean reduction of 0.7%- 5.1%; C-peptide increased in patients without DKA at diagnosis, and length of hospitalization decreased. Campaign costs were lower than costs of treating subjects with DKA. This review demonstrated that DKA awareness campaigns effectively reduce DKA incidence and improve other parameters, such as acute complications, HbA1c and C-peptide levels, length of hospitalization, and costs, among youths with T1D. To be effective, campaigns must follow specific principles of target population, modality, and minimal duration, reported in this review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"392f101fed661b3150782e112ec300648f07823b8ac39c4a8ce4b18352eaec95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
