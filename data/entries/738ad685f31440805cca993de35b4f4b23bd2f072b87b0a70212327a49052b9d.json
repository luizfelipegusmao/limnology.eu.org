{"title":"Spatiotemporal Variability of Channel Roughness and its Substantial Impacts on Flood Modeling Errors","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004257?af=R","date":1721026800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Manning's roughness coefficient, <i>n</i>, is used to describe channel roughness, and is a widely sought-after key parameter for estimating and predicting flood propagation. Due to its control of flow velocity and shear stress, <i>n</i> is critical for modeling timing of floods and pollutants, aquatic ecosystem health, infrastructural safety, and so on. While alternative formulations exist, open-channel <i>n</i> is typically regarded as temporally constant, determined from lookup tables or calibration, and its spatiotemporal variability was never examined holistically at large scales. Here, we developed and analyzed a continental-scale <i>n</i> dataset (along with alternative formulations) calculated from observed velocity, slope, and hydraulic radius in 200,000 surveys conducted over 5,000 U.S. sites. These large, diverse observations allowed training of a Random Forest (RF) model capable of predicting <i>n</i> (or alternative parameters) at high accuracy (Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency &gt;0.7) in space and time. We show that predictable time variability explains a large fraction (âˆ¼35%) of <i>n</i> variance compared to spatial variability (50%). While exceptions abound, <i>n</i> is generally lower and more stable under higher streamflow conditions. Other factorial influences on <i>n</i> including land cover, sinuosity, and particle sizes largely agree with conventional intuition. Accounting for temporal variability in <i>n</i> could lead to substantially larger (45% at the median site) estimated flow velocities under high-flow conditions or lower (44%) velocities under low-flow conditions. Habitual exclusion of <i>n</i> temporal dynamics means flood peaks could arrive days before model-predicted flood waves, and peak magnitude estimation might also be erroneous. We therefore offer a model of great practical utility.</p>","author":"Md Abdullah Al Mehedi, \nShah Saki, \nKrutikkumar Patel, \nChaopeng Shen, \nSagy Cohen, \nVirginia Smith, \nAdnan Rajib, \nEmmanouil Anagnostou, \nTadd Bindas, \nKathryn Lawson","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"738ad685f31440805cca993de35b4f4b23bd2f072b87b0a70212327a49052b9d","category":"Environment"}
