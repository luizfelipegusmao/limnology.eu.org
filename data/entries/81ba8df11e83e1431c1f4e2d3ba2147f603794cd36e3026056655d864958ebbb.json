{"title":"Recombinant Fowlpox Virus fpIBD1 in Chicken&rsquo;s Skin: Persistence and the Local Immune Response at the Site of Inoculation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1589/v1","date":1711449915000,"content":"Fowlpox virus (FPV) has been used as a vector for many years. To date, surprisingly, very little data exist on the persistence of fowlpox vaccines in chicken tissues, or what kind of immune cells respond to the vaccination at the site of inoculation. Although both humoral and cellular mediated immunity (CMI) play a part in overall immunity against FPV, little is known regarding the cell-mediated immune responses to FPV infection. The main aim of this paper was to measure persistence of the recombinant fowlpox vaccine in the skin tissues following vaccination. The results showed that the recombinant FPVs do not persist for long, and are cleared by 6 days post-vaccination (dpv). The response of immune cells (macrophages, B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) that infiltrating the site of vaccination was estimated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81ba8df11e83e1431c1f4e2d3ba2147f603794cd36e3026056655d864958ebbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
