{"title":"Predication of Low-Grade Placental Inflammation in Obesity and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0675/v1","date":1725883466000,"content":"Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are the most common metabolic conditions with have unfavourable impact on maternal and fetal health. Key biosubtrats such as apelin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leptin, and DNA methylation play crucial roles in these pathologic conditions.\nApelin is a peptide involved in regulating glucose metabolism and cardiovascular functions. This molecule also interacts with the apelin receptor to enhance glucose uptake, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for managing GDM and obesity.\nLeptin, a hormone predominantly produced by adipose tissue, regulates appetite and energy balance. In obesity, leptin levels are often high, but a resistance to its effects develops, disrupting normal metabolic processes. Similarly, in GDM, elevated leptin may impair glucose metabolism and contribute to insulin resistance.\nVEGF is critical for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and is often found in increased concentrations in obese individuals and those with GDM. This elevation may contribute to abnormal placental function and vascular complications, exacerbating both conditions.\nDNA methylation, an epigenetic modification, plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation. In both GDM and obesity, altered DNA methylation patterns have been observed, affecting genes involved in metabolism, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity. These epigenetic changes may predispose individuals to metabolic disorders.\nIn our study we investigated  placental apelin, leptin, VEGF,  and DNA methylation  interconnection in the pathophysiology of GDM and obesity during gestation. They have similar or different  influencing on metabolic regulation, vascular function, and gene expression in GDM and obesity? Sonogpahic examinatios supported the metabolic analyses for that understanding their roles may lead to better management and therapeutic strategies for these conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"148149603bfe386de5b90d56c7c978af1d1425cfecaeb94ce44c9bf460604574","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
