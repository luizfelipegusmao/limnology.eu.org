{"title":"Optimization of Parametric Equalizer Filters in In-Vehicle Audio Systems with Genetic Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0447/v1","date":1717741487000,"content":"This study aims to automate the optimization of a Full-Range speaker in an SUV's audio system according to the equal loudness contours principle. The input signal, and frequency responses of the amplifier and speaker were transferred to Matlab. Using ideal filter parameters, ten parametric equalizer models were created, and the speaker output was obtained using the convolution technique. The same filter settings were applied to the vehicle multimedia system, and experimental results were obtained. The simulation and experimental results were compared, showing high similarity with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9295 and an RMSE of 2.29. Results were compared with the ideal contour. The Pearson correlation coefficients for simulation and experimental results were 0.6341 and 0.6715, with RMSE values of 4.88 and 2.57, showing low similarity. Consequently, each parametric equalizer filter's parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The optimized parameters were applied to the vehicle multimedia system, and results were compared with the ideal contour. The Pearson correlation coefficients for simulation and experimental results were 0.965 and 0.9661, with RMSE values of 2.12 and 1.48. These results indicate that optimization aligns the speaker output closer to the ideal contour, enhancing in-vehicle audio system performance and increasing user satisfaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e711634fc94084c6eb303299405ed8f10a84272b80b0289ee6602afbb7b25915","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
