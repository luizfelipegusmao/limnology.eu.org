{"title":"Cross Sections for Electron Stripping, Electron Capture, and System Breakdown of C5+ and Li2+ Ions with Atomic Hydrogen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0513/v1","date":1715182624000,"content":"For many disciplines of science, all conceivable collisional cross sections and reactions must be precisely known. Although the recent decades were a trial of large-scale research to give these data, many essential atomic and molecular cross section data still missing, and the reliability of the existing cross sections has to be validated. In this paper, we present electron stripping, electron capture, and system breakdown cross sections in carbon (C5+) ions and lithium (Li2+) ions collisions with atomic hydrogen based on the Monte Carlo models of classical and quasi-classical trajectories. According to our expectation, the QCTMC results show higher results in comparison to standard CTMC data, emphasizing the role of Heisenberg correction constraint, especially in the low energy regime. On the Other hand, at high energy, the Heisenberg correction term has less influence as a projectile momentum increase. We present the total cross sections of electron stripping, electron capture, and system breakdown in C5+ ions and Li2+ ions collisions with atomic hydrogen in the impact energy range from 10 keV to 160 keV, which is of interest in astrophysical plasmas, atmospheric sciences, plasma laboratories, and fusion research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af1f62af4fa1d71812c6d15215072a26b98f62b1ce163e5f79d3cb3c9fbc40b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
