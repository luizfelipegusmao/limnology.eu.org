{"title":"Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Laser Direct Energy Deposited Martensitic Stainless Steel 410","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2128/v1","date":1717145763000,"content":"The aim of this work is to study the phase transformations, microstructures and mechanical properties of the martensitic stainless steel (MSS) 410 deposits produced by laser powder-directed energy deposition (LP-DED) additive manufacturing. The LP-DED MSS 410 deposits underwent the post heat treatment in austenitizing at 980℃ for 3hrs and followed by different tempering treatment at the temperatures of 250, 600, and 750℃ for 5hrs, respectively. The analyses of phase transformations and microstructural evolutions of LP-DED MSS 410 were carried out using X-ray diffraction, SEM-EDS, and EBSD. Vickers hardness and tensile strength properties were also measured to analyze the effects of the different tempering heat treatments. It reveals that as-built MSS 410 has very fine lath martensite and high hardness of about 480HV1.0 and tensile strength of about 1280 MPa, but elongation was very lower than the post heat treated ones. Precipitations of chromium carbide (Cr23C6) were most commonly observed at the grain boundaries and the entire matrix at the tempering temperatures of 600℃ and 750℃. In general, the tensile strengths de-creased from 1381MPa to 688MPa as tempering temperatures increased up to 750℃ from 250℃. Additionally, as the tempering temperature increased, the chromium carbide and tempered mar-tensite structures became coarser.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4040a54210acce73b4b7ce8ff669c11e998edafe9d50639c112ba746d380627","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
