{"title":"Population size and movement ecology of intertidal gastropods on rocky shores and seawalls in Singapore","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyae016/7693221?rss=1","date":1718323200000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>Increasing coastal development and global warming have resulted in large-scale habitat changes, with artificial coastal structures replacing extensive tracts of natural shores. In Singapore, for example, more than 63% of the natural coastline has been replaced by seawalls. Multiple studies from both temperate and tropical regions have compared species diversity supported by these artificial structures with natural rocky shores. Few, however, have estimated and compared the population size and movement of common intertidal species between these two habitat types. Using mark–recapture techniques, this study investigated: (1) the population size of three common gastropod genera (<span>Nerita</span> spp., <span>Trochus</span> spp. and <span>Turbo</span> spp.) and (2) differences in displacement of <span>Nerita</span> spp. and <span>Trochus</span> spp., two common species found on natural rocky shores and seawalls in Singapore. The results of our mark–recapture surveys indicated that seawalls supported large densities of <span>Nerita</span> spp.—more than 50 times greater than that on adjacent rocky shores. The mark–recapture data also revealed that movement of the gastropod species differed between the two habitats, with individuals on seawalls generally travelling longer distances.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"85c7abfebf014a521e8c660c0f6f9dc71bcb1d226e029f5e89f00adab073610c","category":"Environment"}
