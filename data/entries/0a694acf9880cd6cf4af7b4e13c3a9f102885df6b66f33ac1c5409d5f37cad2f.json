{"title":"Diversity, Distribution, and Resistance Profiles of Bacterial Bloodstream Infections in Three Tertiary Referral Hospitals in Rwanda between 2020 and 2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1643/v1","date":1721634069000,"content":"The burden of bacterial bloodstream infections (BSIs) is rapidly increasing in Africa including Rwanda. This is a retrospective study investigates the diversity, distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of BSIs bacteria in three tertiary referral hospitals in Rwanda between 2020 and 2022. A total of 1,532 blood culture tests were performed for visiting patients. Overall, the proportions of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were 48.2% and 51.8, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant species accounting for 25% of all Gram-positive BSIs species and Klebsiella species representing 41% of all Gram-negative BSIs species. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that Amikacin exhibited the highest activity against Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp. and Escherichia coli in &amp;gt;92% of cases and Klebsiella spp. in 75.7%. Meropenem and Imipenem were highly efficacious to Salmonella spp. (100% susceptibility), Enterobacter spp. (96.2% and 91.7%, respectively), and Escherichia coli (94.7% and 95.5%, respectively). The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp., S. aureus, and Streptococcus spp. to Vancomycin was 100%, 99.5% and 97.1%, respectively. Klebsiella spp. was highly sensitive to Colistin (98.7%), Polymyxin B (85.6%), Imipenem (84.9%), and Meropenem (78.5%). We recommend strengthening the implementation of integrated transdisciplinary and multisectoral One Health including AMR-stewardship for the surveillance, prevention, and control of AMR in Rwanda.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a694acf9880cd6cf4af7b4e13c3a9f102885df6b66f33ac1c5409d5f37cad2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
