{"title":"Acrylamide Exposure Impairs Ovarian Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle and Reduces Oocyte Quality in Mouse","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24390?af=R","date":1722419360000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Acrylamide (AAM), a compound extensively utilized in various industrial applications, has been reported to induce toxic effects across multiple tissues in living organisms. Despite its widespread use, the impact of AAM on ovarian function and the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Here, we established an AAM-exposed mouse toxicological model using 21 days of intragastric AAM administration. AAM exposure decreased ovarian coefficient and impaired follicle development. Further investigations revealed AAM would trigger apoptosis and disturb tricarboxylic acid cycle in ovarian tissue, thus affecting mitochondrial electron transport function. Moreover, AAM exposure decreased oocyte and embryo development potential, mechanically associated with pericentrin and phosphorylated Aurora A cluster failure, leading to meiotic spindle assembly defects. Collectively, these results suggest that AAM exposure may lead to apoptosis, glucose metabolic disorders, and mitochondrial dysfunction in ovary tissue, ultimately compromising oocyte quality.</p>","author":"Yue‐Cen Liu, \nRui‐Cheng Li, \nWen‐Ke Wang, \nYan‐Zhu Chen, \nQuan‐Kuo He, \nZhi‐Ran Xu, \nYi‐Fan Yang, \nSi‐Yao Cheng, \nHai‐Long Wang, \nZhong‐Quan Qi, \nChang‐Long Xu, \nYu Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"95fef04b0002dcbe252c4122f12d32893e79c46c03777edc5d78bff949023f48","category":"Environment"}
