{"title":"The Role of Feather Pre-Treatment and Alkaline Hydrolysis Conditions in Enhancing the Antioxidant Activity of Keratin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1509/v1","date":1726769542000,"content":"Keratin extraction from chicken feathers provides a sustainable way to valorise poultry by-products. This study aimed to optimize keratin yield and antioxidant properties by compar-ing two pre-treatment methods: the typical (T-method), involving washing, drying, cutting, grinding, and defatting, and the simplified (S-method), involving only washing, drying, and cut-ting, under various alkaline hydrolysis conditions. These included different feather mass to NaOH ratios (1:3, 1:6, or 1:9), hydrolysis times (16, 24, or 32 h), and shaking speeds (150, 175, or 200 rpm). Under the most intensive hydrolysis conditions (1:9 ratio, 32 hours, 200 rpm), the T-method achieved the highest keratin yield (72%), DH of 2 mmol NH2/g protein, and an average molecular weight of 5.0-5.9 kDa. The S-method had a lower yield (57%) and a higher molecular weight (7.4 kDa). The highest antioxidant activity was observed under 1:3 feather mass to NaOH ratio, 32 h of hydrolysis time, and 175 rpm of shaking speeds. The T-method is optimal for maximum yield, while the S-method is suitable for large-scale applications due to its simplicity and high antioxidant activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d9a54323bbd78f7e98832af73b0509fd8b5eabcf9c4a39471ab9e05d51e9961","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
