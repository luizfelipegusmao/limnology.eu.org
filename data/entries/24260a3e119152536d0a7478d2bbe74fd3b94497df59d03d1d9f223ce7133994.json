Conventionally, phonon transport is tuned through the engineering of defects, interfaces, and nanostructures [<a href=\"#ozae044.764-B1\">1</a>]. However, these modifications also affect other desirable properties of materials and degrade their performance. Thus, tuning phonon transport of materials at the nanoscale remains a crucial issue for multifunctional materials and devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.764-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.764-B3\">3</a>]. A precise and predictable method for addressing the needs of technological innovation in thermal transport is highly desirable.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"24260a3e119152536d0a7478d2bbe74fd3b94497df59d03d1d9f223ce7133994","category":"Environment"}
