Noteworthy examples of the increased attention being paid to vEM include: large-scale funding investment initiatives (such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiativeâ€™s Imaging program [<a href=\"#ozae044.492-B1\">1</a>]), influential opinion pieces in scientific journals [<a href=\"#ozae044.492-B2\">2</a>], and the growing user base of informative community-run websites and discussion channels (such as the Volume EM community website [<a href=\"#ozae044.492-B3\">3</a>], the Array Tomography community website [<a href=\"#ozae044.492-B4\">4</a>], or the EMofCellsTissuesOrganisms Slack channel [<a href=\"#ozae044.492-B5\">5</a>]. One of the main advantages of the increased interest in vEM is the abundance of information to allow prospective vEM users to choose the workflow and methodology that best suits their needs, optimise their experimental approaches and interact with a rapidly expanding user base.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fdc173e2e310ca769140c4f8a20ee02136c9acdbd1618eaab73d26aa184d7963","category":"Environment"}
