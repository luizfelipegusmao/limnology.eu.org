{"title":"Ramsey Theory of the Phase Transitions of the Second Order","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1710/v1","date":1716796456000,"content":"The Ramsey theory based approach to the phase transitions of the second order is suggested. The phase transitions of the second order are seen as switching of physical interactions/chemical bonds between the entities forming the primitive cell of the material. Such a switching is typical for a phase change materials. If the energy of the primitive cell is kept constant under the change in the spatial order of the chemical bonds, the phase transition of the second order takes place. The switching of interactions between the entities forming the primitive cell is accompanied by the breaking of the initial symmetry of the cell. The order parameter/the degree of ordering characterizing the ordering within the primitive cell is re-defined. The introduced degree of ordering quantifies ordering of links/interactions/chemical bonds between entities constituting the 2D lattice; whereas, the classical “Landau degree of order” quantifies the symmetry breaking under variation in spatial locations of these entities. The suggested approach is generalized easily for 3D primitive cells. Thermal capacity of the non-symmetrical phase is larger than that of the symmetrical phase. For the primitive cells built of six interacting entities, the Ramsey Theory predicts inevitable appearance of the unstable monochromatic triangles, when the links correspond to attraction or repulsion interactions. The situation becomes different for the primitive cells built of five interacting entities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa233e3b44468ceef02069aed99110abe11c89ce33c22aafc2b9983d3573d917","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
