{"title":"Stretch-Induced Spin-Cast Membranes Based on Semi-Crystalline Polymers for Efficient Microfiltration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0515/v1","date":1715174953000,"content":"Microfiltration membranes derived from semi-crystalline polymers face various challenges when synthesized through the extrusion–casting technique, including  the use of large quantities of polymer, long casting times, and the generation of substantial waste. This study focuses on synthesizing these membranes using spin-casting followed by stretch-induced pore formation. Recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and virgin polyethylene powder, combined with a calcium carbonate filler, were used as the source materials for the membranes. The influence of the polymer-filler ratio with and without stretching on the morphology, tensile strength, and water flow rate was investigated. Optimal conditions were determined, emphasizing a balance between pore structure and mechanical integrity. The permeable membrane possessed a mean pore diameter of 500 nm, exhibited a tensile strength measuring 32 MPa, allowed water to flow at a rate of 19 ml/min, and had a water contact angle of 126°. These membranes effectively eliminated suspended particles from water, with their performance evaluated against that of commercially available membranes. This research outlines a synthesis route for microfiltration membranes tailored to semi-crystalline polymers and their plastic forms, utilizing the spin-casting technique.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a5d89913d6a4501919d53765e059ba82df1d4cf06fb5a705b7c5b9330ed94e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
