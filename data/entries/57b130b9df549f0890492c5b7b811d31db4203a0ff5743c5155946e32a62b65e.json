{"title":"The Effective Potential of Reduced Models in (21)D+","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1706/v1","date":1714110914000,"content":"The description of the electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional materials has a dimensional mismatch, where electrons live in (2+1)D while photons propagate in (3+1)D. In order to define an action in (2+1)D, one may perform a dimensional reduction of quantum electrodynamics in (3+1)D (QED4) into Pseudo quantum electrodynamics (PQED). The main difference between this model and QED4 is the presence of a pseudo-differential operator in the Maxwell term. However, besides the Coulomb repulsion, electrons in a material are subjected to several microscopic interactions, which are inherent in a many-body system. These are expected to reduce the range of the Coulomb potential, leading to a short-range interaction. Here, we consider the coupling to a scalar field in PQED for explaining such mechanism, which resembles the spontanoues symmetry breaking (SSB) in Abelian gauge theories. In order to do so, we consider two cases: (i) By coupling the gauge field to a Higgs field in scalar quantum electrodynamics in (3+1)D and, thereafter, performing the dimensional reduction and; (ii) By coupling a Higgs field to the gauge field in PQED and subsequently calculating its effective potential. In case (i), we obtain a model describing electrons interacting through the Yukawa potential and, in case (ii), we show that SSB does not occur at one-loop approximation. The relevance of the model for describing electronic interactions in two-dimensional materials is also adressed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57b130b9df549f0890492c5b7b811d31db4203a0ff5743c5155946e32a62b65e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
