With the growing demand for efficient lubrication systems in various industrial applications, including automotive engines, the development of novel nanofluid-based lubricants presents a promising avenue for improving engine performance and longevity. However, the synergistic effects of hybrid nanoparticles in engine oil remain relatively unexplored. This research addresses this gap by examining the thermal conductivity, viscosity, and wear resistance of the hybrid nanofluid, shedding light on its potential as an advanced lubrication solution. By analyzing the dispersion stability and interaction mechanisms between nanoparticles and base oil, valuable insights are gained into the fundamental aspects governing the entertainment of hybrid nano lubricants. Overall, the objectives of studying hybrid nano lubricant MoS2+ZnO with engine oil aim to advance the development of more efficient and durable lubrication solutions for automotive engines, contributing to improved reliability, fuel efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Governing non-linear partial differential equations are simplified as ordinary differential equations by utilizing similarity variables. MATLAB Bvp4c technique is used to solve the obtained linear ODE equations. The outputs are presented through graphs and tables for various state variables. The comparative survey in all the graphs is presented for the nanofluid (MoS2/Engine oil) with the hybrid nanofluid (MoS2+ZnO/Engine oil). These graphs show the effect of various parameters M, Q, β, Pr, Ec, Sc, Sr, Kp, Kr and   (hybrid nano lubricant parameter). The velocity profile diminished against the values of M, Kp, and β. Temperature profile rising with Ec and Q. reciprocally goes down to Pr. The concentration profile incremented with the value of Sr and decremented with the value of Sc, and Kr. With the increasing value of   both f′ (η) and θ(η) increases.
