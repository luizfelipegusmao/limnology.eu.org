{"title":"Unlocking the Therapeutic Potential of Oral Cancer Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1602/v1","date":1721379898000,"content":"Oral cancer (OC) presents a significant global health burden with rising incidence rates. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatments, the survival rate for OC patients, particularly those with advanced or recurrent disease, remains low at approximately 20%. This poor prognosis is often due to a small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are capable of self-renewal and immune evasion, thus playing pivotal roles in proliferation, tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs), have emerged as crucial mediators of cell-to-cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). These vesicles carry diverse molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and metabolites, influencing various cellular processes. Emerging evidence suggests that CSC-derived EVs are significant in promoting tumor progression and metastasis and maintaining the balance between CSCs and non-CSCs, which is vital for intracellular communication within the TME of oral cancer. Recent reports indicate that oral cancer stem cell-derived EVs (OCSC-EVs) influence stemness, immune evasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, tumor reoccurrence, and drug resistance. Understanding OCSC-EVs could significantly improve oral cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. In this mini-review, we explore OCSC-derived exosomes in oral cancer, examining their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that reflect CSC characteristics, and delve into their therapeutic implications, emphasizing their roles in tumor progression and therapy resistance. However, despite their promising potential, several challenges remain, including the need to standardize isolation and characterization methods and to elucidate exosome-mediated mechanisms. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of OCSC-EVs could pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies that have the potential to improve clinical outcomes for OC patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ba582ae9e8f7b2e8a6a207d05d3e54100f4e0fbdbdcbccd64f0349c6247f7c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
