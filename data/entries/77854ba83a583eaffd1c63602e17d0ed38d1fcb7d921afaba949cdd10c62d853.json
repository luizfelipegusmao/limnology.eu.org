{"title":"IgA Nephropathy with Hepatitis B Infection: A Rare Case of Infection and Autoimmunity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0868/v1","date":1713164738000,"content":"Presenting a case report on the occurrence of IgA nephropathy with hepatitis B infection in a 32-year-old male patient with main complaints of generalized weakness, easy fatigue, and bilateral swelling of the lower extremities. IgA nephropathy (IgAN), or Bergerâ€™s disease, is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. It is characterized by the formation of IgA1-containing circulating immune complexes and their deposition in the glomerular mesangium. Its etiology remains multifactorial and often idiopathic. IgA nephropathy alone does not have an infectious etiology; instead, it usually develops in conjunction with an infectious condition that triggers a dysregulated immune response. There is no proof that any particular infectious agent is the secondary cause of IgA nephropathy. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an infectious agent associated with renal complications, including IgA nephropathy. Symptoms include gross haematuria and mild proteinuria indicative of renal involvement. Laboratory investigations and serological tests are followed by imaging studies such as ultrasound and renal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The challenges encountered during the diagnostic process included overlapping symptoms and limitations of available diagnostic tests, highlighting the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and multidisciplinary management approaches in similar cases. This case underscores the importance of recognizing and managing both conditions simultaneously to prevent long-term complications such as end-stage renal disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77854ba83a583eaffd1c63602e17d0ed38d1fcb7d921afaba949cdd10c62d853","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
