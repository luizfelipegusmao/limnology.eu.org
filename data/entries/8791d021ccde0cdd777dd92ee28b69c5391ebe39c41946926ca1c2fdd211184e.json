{"title":"Effect of Mis-Sorting on the Mechanical Properties of Recycled Polypropylene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0420/v1","date":1720081224000,"content":"The effect of contamination of polypropylene (PP) with selected polymers is studied to simulate the effect of mis-sorting in recycling streams. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) were compounded with PP at different concentrations varying between 3 and 10%. Infrared spectroscopy proved the absence of chemical bonds between the constituents. The samples for mechanical testing were injection moulded and further tested for their tensile and impact properties. Critical behaviour was induced by the introduction of a weld line as a result of the application of multiple gating points during injection moulding. Results generally show the applicability of PP mixtures within the investigated range of inclusions, without much sacrifice in mechanical performance. However, in the case of ABS and PLA, more care should be taken when designing complex parts with weld lines, due to reduced toughness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8791d021ccde0cdd777dd92ee28b69c5391ebe39c41946926ca1c2fdd211184e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
