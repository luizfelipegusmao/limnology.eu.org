Nevertheless, the development of migration routines in early life remains underexplored. While age-related changes in migration routes and timing have been described in obligate migrants, most investigations into the ontogeny of partial migrants only focused on age-dependency of migration as a binary tactic (migrant or resident), and variations in routes and timing among individuals classified as ‘migrants’ is rarely considered.\n\nTo fill this gap, we study the ontogeny of migration destination, route and timing in a partially migratory red kite (<i>Milvus milvus</i>) population. Using an extensive GPS-tracking dataset (292 fledglings and 38 adults, with 1–5 migrations tracked per individual), we studied how nine different migration characteristics changed with age and breeding status in migrant individuals, many of which become resident later in life.\n\nIndividuals departed later from and arrived earlier at the breeding areas as they aged, resulting in a gradual prolongation of stay in the breeding area by 2 months from the first to the fifth migration. Individuals delayed southward migration in the year prior to territory acquirement, and they further delayed it after occupying a territory. Migration routes became more direct with age. Individuals were highly faithful to their wintering site. Migration distance shortened only slightly with age and was more similar among siblings than among unrelated individuals.\n\nThe large gradual changes in northward and southward migrations suggest a high degree of plasticity in temporal characteristics during the developmental window. However, the high wintering site fidelity points towards large benefits of site familiarity, prompting spatial migratory plasticity to be expressed through a switch to residency.\n\nThe contrasting patterns of trajectories of age-related changes between spatial and temporal migration characteristics might reflect different mechanisms underlying the expression of plasticity. Investigating such patterns among species along the entire spectrum of migration tactics would enable further understanding of the plastic responses exhibited by migratory species to rapid environmental changes.\n</p>","author":"Ying‐Chi Chan, \nUrs G.
