{"title":"Post-synthetically treated ERI and SSZ-13 zeolites modified with copper as catalysts for NH3-SCR-DeNOx","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1268/v1","date":1718881003000,"content":"ERI and SSZ-13 were subjected to post-synthetic treatments (depending on the zeolite topology) to create micro-/mesoporous materials. The results of NH3-SCR-DeNOx show that the applied treatments improved the catalytic activity of the Cu-containing ERI-based materials; however, the NO conversion does not vary for the different materials treated with NaOH or NaOH/HNO3. For the micro-/mesoporous Cu-containing SSZ-13, a lower NO conversion in NH3-SCR-DeNOx is observed. Thus, our findings challenge the current paradigm of enhanced activity of micro-/mesoporous catalysts in NH3-SCR-DeNOx. The modification of the supports results in the presence of different amounts and kinds of copper species (especially isolated Cu2+ and aggregated Cu species) in the case of ERI- and SSZ-13-based samples. The present copper species further differentiate the formation of reactive reaction intermediates. Our studies approved that besides the -2,2-peroxo dicopper(II) complexes (verified by in situ DR UV-Vis spectroscopy), also copper nitrates (evidenced by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy) act as reactive intermediates in these catalytic systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f358cf14eaa868fa330d1a6ee031190c7ebd7d5ab4d8e577b7ffeee4b6ea3042","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
