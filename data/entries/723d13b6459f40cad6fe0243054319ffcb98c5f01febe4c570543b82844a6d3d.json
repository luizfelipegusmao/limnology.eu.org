{"title":"Integrating High-Performance Flexible Wires with Strain Sensors for Wearable Human Motion Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1299/v1","date":1718794831000,"content":"Flexible electronics have revolutionized the field by overcoming the rigid limitations of traditional devices, offering superior flexibility and adaptability. Conductive ink performance is crucial, directly impacting the stability of flexible electronics. While metal filler-based inks exhibit excellent conductivity, they often lack mechanical stability. To address this challenge, we present a novel conductive ink utilizing a ternary composite filler system: liquid metal and two micron-sized silver morphologies (particles and flakes). We systematically investigated the influence of filler type, mass ratio, and sintering process parameters on the composite ink's conductivity and mechanical stability. Our results demonstrate that flexible wires fabricated with the liquid metal/micron silver particle/micron silver flake composite filler exhibit remarkable conductivity and exceptional bending stability. Interestingly, increasing the liquid metal content results in a trade-off, compromising conductivity while enhancing mechanical performance. After enduring 5000 bending cycles, the resistance change in wires formulated with a 4:1 mass ratio of micron silver particles to flakes is only half that of wires with a 1:1 ratio. This study further investigates the mechanism governing resistance variation during flexible wire bending. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between sintering temperature and pressure with the conductivity of flexible wires. The significance of sintering parameters on conductivity follows a descending order: sintering temperature, sintering pressure, and sintering time. Finally, we demonstrate the practical application of this technology by integrating the composite ink-based flexible wires with conductive polymer-based strain sensors. This combination successfully achieved the detection of human movements, including finger and wrist bending.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"723d13b6459f40cad6fe0243054319ffcb98c5f01febe4c570543b82844a6d3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
