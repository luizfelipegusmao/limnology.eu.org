{"title":"199 Awardee Talk: Insights into translational regulation through tRNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and ribosome profiling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/34/7757230?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Translation acts as an additional layer of regulation that has an important role in gene expression and function. Due to a phenomenon called codon usage bias, highly expressed genes are thought to be codon-biased to support efficient translation. As more than one codon can code for the same amino acid (synonymous codons), organisms may exhibit preferences for specific codons that facilitate increased expression of important genes due to variations in the availability of corresponding tRNAs. Advances in sequencing technologies have recently permitted the study of the translatome, which refers to the entire population of mRNA associated with ribosomes for protein synthesis and can be investigated through ribosome profiling. This cutting-edge technique allows the identification of actively translated regions, but can also reveal translational pausing events that stem from the presence of SNPs. Our previous research has demonstrated variation in tRNA expression across tissues and different states of health, leading us to consider the connection between tRNA abundance and translational stalling due to SNPs. By coupling ribosome profiling with tRNA sequencing and RNA sequencing, we have investigated all elements of translational machinery to predict translational efficiency, estimate proteome composition, and evaluate tRNA abundance as a source of genetic variation. In this work, we utilized ribosome profiling, tRNAseq, and RNAseq and performed an integrative analysis in bovine tissues (kidney, liver and muscle) as well as murine myoblast cell lines (C2C12). By applying these methods to different bovine tissues, we were able to explore the interplay between tRNA availability and translational stalling events. Moreover, we have identified translationally regulated genes underlying tissue-specific biological processes and found that many upregulated and downregulated genes coincided with high and low translational efficiency respectively. We have also successfully defined stalling sites that depict the regulatory information encoded within the coding sequence of transcripts, which could control translation rate and facilitate proper protein folding. Through the implementation of these next generation sequencing (NGS) methods to cell culture, we were able to evaluate the translatome at various time points (0-min, 30-min, 60-min, and 4-h) post-induction of differentiation. Where most studies have focused on molecular changes between differentiating myoblasts and multinucleated myotubes that are present 7 d after differentiation, we focus on the earliest stages of muscle differentiation that initiate muscle development and therefore kickstart the process of meat production. This work offers an atlas of distinctive stalling sites across bovine tissues and various stages of muscle differentiation, which provides an opportunity to predict codon optimality and understand tissue-specific or time-specific mechanisms of regulating protein synthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bc3b54b071a32cbad96d62a3e6f717de1de99232af536ca441d6c11e386b204f","category":"Environment"}
