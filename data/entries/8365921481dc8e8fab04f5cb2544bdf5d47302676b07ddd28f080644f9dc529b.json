{"title":"Prediction of Syngas Composition During Gasification of Lignocellulosic Waste Mixtures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0065/v1","date":1727780120000,"content":"Avoiding global dependence on fossil oils, as well as improving the environmental impact during energy production, are factors that drive research into renewable energies. Considering lignocellulosic biomass residues as a raw material for gasification, a thermochemical process that converts lignocellulosic resources into synthesis gas (H2, CO, CH4 and CO2) is an alternative under study, due to its relatively low costs, high efficiency and the wide variety of applications of synthesis gas. Fortunately, there are still fields for its improvement and technological development. Gasification, for example: Different types of lignocellulosic biomass, such as sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, pine sawdust or corn cob, differ in their physical, chemical and morphological properties, which can affect the characteristics of the gasification process. This work uses the methodology of generalized stoichiometry and mass and atomic balances in the gasification reactor, to predict the composition of syngas produced by gasification of both individual substrates and mixtures. The results provide useful information for the design and operation of gasification reactors, with their operating region between 2.0 bar and 4.5 bar, and 1024 K and 1224 K, understanding the effects of different types of biomasses, its humidity and molecular weight on the operation and performance of the process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8365921481dc8e8fab04f5cb2544bdf5d47302676b07ddd28f080644f9dc529b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
