{"title":"Colonoscopy Research Collaboration: A Comprehensive Network Analysis of the Structure and Impact of Research Partnerships","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0589/v1","date":1725863372000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to analyze the structure and impact of research collaborations in colonoscopy from 2000 to 2023 by examining co-authorship networks. The goal is to understand the evolution of these networks, identify key contributors, and assess how collaborative relationships influence the field. Method: I conducted a comprehensive network analysis of co-authorship patterns using data from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database. The analysis included 41,213 articles related to colonoscopy published between 2000 and 2023. Using Python (Version 3.10.5) and PyCharm (Software Version 2022.1.3), we evaluated the networks through macro-level indicators (network density, clustering coefficient, number of components, average distance) and micro-level indicators (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality).Result: The analysis revealed a network with increasing but still fragmented collaboration over the years. The network density showed low proportions of realized connections relative to potential ones, with a high clustering coefficient indicating tight-knit groups when collaborations occurred. The number of components remained high, reflecting a fragmented structure. Prominent researchers such as Hassan, Cesare (Italy) and Dekker, Evelien (Netherlands) consistently emerged as central figures across different periods, demonstrating significant roles in facilitating connections between various research clusters.Conclusion: The study highlights a growing but fragmented collaborative landscape in colonoscopy research. Key researchers have played central roles in connecting different parts of the network, yet there remains substantial room for further integration. Strengthening collaborations across isolated groups could enhance the cohesiveness and impact of research in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdb3f602938f7a966f84900425e5e3e036a701c4b256c8a296e62e04c065bb69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
