Underground network of tunnels constructed using tunnel boring machines (TBMs) has been an efficient solution. Urban tunnels have an essential requirement of minimizing the ground disturbances as it adversely impacts the existing infrastructure. Current study presents potential correlations for parametric geotechnical assessment for mechanized soft ground tunnelling data considering statistical numerical regression. The established correlations essentially enable us to determine and validate the geotechnical parameters in real time and subsequently enables optimization and even potential automation of TBM operations during soft ground mechanized tunnelling.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"f92e7faa3c79f1c02300f747f676fdc3bf29c331b876bd4a913d7a667ed86217","category":"Environment"}
