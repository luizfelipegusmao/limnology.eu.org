{"title":"Integrating Contemporary Technologies in Education: Empowering Youth for Sustainable Future through New Literacies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0672/v1","date":1710235522000,"content":"The quasi-experimental study examines the role of contemporary technologies, such as artificial intelligence and humanoid robots, in enhancing sustainability education for future teachers, emphasizing their impact on shaping sustainable beliefs in future generations. Involving 112 pre-service teachers, the research compares various contemporary and traditional learning methods. Pre- and post-test evaluations were conducted to assess changes in participantsâ€™ understanding of sustainability concepts and the variability of their responses. Results reveal significant improvements in sustainability awareness, with methods involving humanoid robots showing higher response variability. The study also identifies the development of new literacies crucial for effectively utilizing advanced technologies in promoting environmental sustainability. While artificial intelligence and humanoid robots match the efficacy of traditional methods, they notably engage young educators more effectively in sustainability topics. These findings highlight the need to integrate such technologies into educational framework to deepen the understanding of environmental issues and prepare youth for future challenges. However, further research is required to explore long-term effects and broader demographics. The research contributes significantly to educational technology and sustainability in education, showcasing the transformative potential of incorporating contemporary technologies in educational settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdc31336bbbc13702f2d2c4447592413dc00afa25d2aa21164502bc480971322","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
