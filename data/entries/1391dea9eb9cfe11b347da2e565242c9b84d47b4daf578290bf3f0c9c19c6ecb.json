{"title":"Seedling Emergence of Spring Maize Under Various Width of Plastic Film Mulch in the Cool-Spring Northwest China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0710/v1","date":1720507165000,"content":"Seedling emergence is crucial for the establishment and growth of crops and is influenced by topsoil temperature and moisture. Mulching has been widely used to promote seedling emergence in areas with a cold spring. This study was conducted to determine and simulate the effects of transparent plastic film mulch on surface soil moisture, temperature, and seedling emergence of spring maize in Northwest China. Four treatments were used: no mulching (CK), full plastic film mulch (PMF), and partial plastic film mulch, 60 cm in width (PM60, 40 cm uncovered between rows of mulch) or 30 cm in width (PM30, 20 cm uncovered between rows of mulch). The effects of soil water conservation and temperature enhancement gradually decreased as the plastic film width decreased, but there was little difference between PMF and PM60 treatments. Soil-water-modified growing degree days (WGDD) described the beneficial effects of soil moisture and temperature with respect to seedling emergence under mulching conditions. Plastic film mulching markedly accelerated seedling emergence and increased final seedling emergence rate because mulching can shorten the autotrophy duration and maintain surface soil moisture, which leads to increased germination. The effects of seedling emergence improvement decreased as the plastic film width decreased. The relationship between WGDD and cumulative relative seedling emergence (CRE) was adequately described by a Gompertz function.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1391dea9eb9cfe11b347da2e565242c9b84d47b4daf578290bf3f0c9c19c6ecb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
