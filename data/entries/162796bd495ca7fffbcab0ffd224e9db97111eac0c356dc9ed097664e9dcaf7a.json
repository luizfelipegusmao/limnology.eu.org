{"title":"GIS-Based Platform for Disease Mapping and Hotspot Detection in Southern Malawi","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0111/v1","date":1719834866000,"content":"Geographic information systems (GIS) are critical for mapping the geographical distribution of illness prevalence, disease transmission patterns, and spatially modeling environmental elements of disease occurrence. This study was purposively to map and cluster five diseases such as cholera, diabetes, malaria, asthma and hypertension using GIS techniques in Southern Malawi. Getis-Ord Gi* statistic was used to determine spatial distribution of diseases. Data were acquired from Malawi Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and assessed geographically using spa-tial-statistical analytical techniques, including the kernel and hotspot models. These models were developed to investigate and exhibit the dissimilar patterns of the selected diseases, as well as to depict places of high concentration, and they may be useful in understanding local patterns of diseases and their geographical correlations. The study found that asthma is high in Mangochi, Balaka, Blantyre, Thyolo, Mulanje, Chikwawa and Nsanje districts. It was also revealed that hypertension patients were highly concentrated in Blantyre, Thyolo, Chikwawa, Zomba, Mangochi and Nsanje Districts. Mangochi, Phalombe, Nsanje and Chikwawa are high risk areas of Malaria and diabetes is highest in Blantyre. Cholera is high in Mangochi, Balaka, Blantyre, Thyolo, Mu-lanje, Chikwawa and Nsanje districts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"162796bd495ca7fffbcab0ffd224e9db97111eac0c356dc9ed097664e9dcaf7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
