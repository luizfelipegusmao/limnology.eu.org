{"title":"Febrile Rash: An Early Diagnostic Clue in Ill-Returning Travelers from the Tropical Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1731/v1","date":1716797877000,"content":"Eruption of rash along with spiking fever in travelers returning from tropics may be suspicious of arboviral diseases, and isolation can mitigate to prevent further transmission in non-endemic countries. The case presented was seen at the Fever Clinic at Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok, Thailand. The presenting complaints were fever, headache, myalgia, and a distinctive erythematous blanching rash. Despite a negative dengue NS1 test on the initial day, anti-dengue IgM and IgG were detectable on day five of illness. Dengue, a major cause of traveler’s fever with rash is of particular concern due to outbreak such as Thailand’s, exceeding to over one hundred thousand cases over nine months. The influx of 28 million travelers in 2023, many with naive immunity to many arboviruses, raises fear of transmission to temperature regions. We casually observe this impact in France, where Aedes albopictus presence led to 1099 imported dengue cases from Thailand, resulting in six autochthonous clusters. Heightened vigilance is crucial, urging consideration of dengue as a potential diagnosis in travelers with febrile rash, even prior to lab confirmation. Immediate isolation of patients is essential to prevent autochthonous transmission, reducing outbreak risk and averting public health crises.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db623f866d6d10fbf674f053ddf893b1875386687c2a24dea87e350133ce6816","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
