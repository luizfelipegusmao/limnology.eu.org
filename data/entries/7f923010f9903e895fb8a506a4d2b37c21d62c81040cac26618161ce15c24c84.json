{"title":"Vestibular Neurostimulation for Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease: A Novel Device Aided Noninvasive Therapeutic Option.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1762/v1","date":1721727542000,"content":"Dopaminergic replacement therapy remains the mainstay of symptomatic treatment for Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), but many unmet needs and gaps remain. Device based treatments or device-aided non-oral therapies are typically used in the advanced stages of PD, ranging from stereotactic deep brain stimulation to levodopa or apomorphine infusion therapies but there are concerns due to a number of procedural, hardware, or long-term treatment-related side effects of these treatments, and limited nonmotor benefit in PD. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for low risk adjuvants or standalone therapies which can address the range of burdensome motor and nonmotor symptoms that occur in PD. Recent studies suggest that non-invasive neurostimulation of the vestibular system may be able to address these gaps with stimulation of the vestibular brainstem sensory network which extensively innervates brain regions regulating both motor and a range of nonmotor functions. Therapeutic non-invasive vestibular stimulation is a relatively modern concept that may potentially improve a broad range of motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD, even at early stages of the disease. Here we review previous studies supporting the therapeutic potential of vestibular stimulation for the treatment of PD and discuss ongoing clinical trials and potential areas for future investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f923010f9903e895fb8a506a4d2b37c21d62c81040cac26618161ce15c24c84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
