{"title":"Relationship between Salmonella enterica attachment and leaf hydrophobicity, roughness, and epicuticular waxes: a focus on 30 baby‐leaf salads","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13751?af=R","date":1721377468000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The first step in the contamination of leafy vegetables by human pathogens is their attachment to the leaf surface. The success of this is influenced strongly by the physical and chemical characteristics of the surface itself (number and size of stomata, presence of trichomes and veins, epicuticular waxes, hydrophobicity, etc.). This study evaluated the attachment of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to 30 baby-leaf salads and tested whether the differences found among them were related to the following leaf traits: hydrophobicity, roughness, and epicuticular waxes.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Differences in susceptibility to contamination by <i>S. enterica</i> were found between the 30 baby-leaf salads investigated. The lowest attachment was found in wild lettuce (<i>Lactuca serriola</i> L.) and lamb's lettuce ‘Trophy F1’ (<i>Valerianella locusta</i> [L.] Laterr.), with values of 1.63 ± 0.39 Log(CFU/cm<sup>2</sup>) and 1.79 ± 0.54 Log(CFU/cm<sup>2</sup>), respectively. Attachment was correlated with hydrophobicity (measured as contact angle) (<i>r</i> = −0.39) and epicuticular waxes (<i>r</i> = −0.81) but not with roughness (<i>r</i> = 0.24). The most important wax components for attachment were alcohols and, in particular, the three-dimensional (3D) wax crystals of C26 alcohol, but fatty acids probably also had a role. Both these compounds increased hydrophobicity. The presence of thymol, whose antimicrobial properties are well known, was found in lamb's lettuce.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The findings of this study can help to predict and control the attachment and contamination of leafy salads by enterobacteria. They also provide useful information for breeding programs aiming to develop cultivars that are less susceptible to human pathogens, enhancing the food safety of vegetables. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Stefania Truschi, \nLorenzo Marini, \nIlaria Cacciari, \nAda Baldi, \nPiero Bruschi, \nAnna Lenzi, \nJohanna Baales, \nViktoria V.
