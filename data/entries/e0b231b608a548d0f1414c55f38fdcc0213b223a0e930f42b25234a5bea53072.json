{"title":"Influence of the internet celebrity’ attributes of the host on the loyalty of users on live platforms","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310308","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Tingyu Cui, Panqian Dai, Jing Xu, Yixuan Lu, Wenxuan Wang</p>\r\n\r\nSince 2019, live e-commerce has experienced significant growth, effectively driving consumption, with various e-commerce platforms, video platforms, enterprises, and businesses venturing into the live e-commerce sector. However, this development has brought forth several issues, one of which prominently pertains to the lack of customer loyalty. Hosts play a crucial role in live e-commerce. To investigate the impact of internet celebrity attributes on platform user loyalty, this study employed a survey questionnaire distributed on internet websites, collecting 200 valid samples. A research model based on the ABC attitude model was constructed, with customer satisfaction and customer trust as mediating variables. The findings indicate that the internet celebrity attributes of network popularity and interactivity positively influence customer loyalty through the mediation of customer satisfaction and customer trust. On the other hand, the host’s purpose as an internet celebrity attribute does not directly or indirectly affect customer loyalty. The primary reason for this discrepancy is that the host failed to establish trust and employ suitable methods to attain the goal of selling and promoting products. Consequently, platforms and businesses can enhance the network popularity of hosts through communication media, while fostering their literacy and professional skills. Moreover, strengthening communication and interaction between hosts and customers serves as a foundation for nurturing enduring and positive relationships.","author":"Tingyu Cui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e0b231b608a548d0f1414c55f38fdcc0213b223a0e930f42b25234a5bea53072","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
