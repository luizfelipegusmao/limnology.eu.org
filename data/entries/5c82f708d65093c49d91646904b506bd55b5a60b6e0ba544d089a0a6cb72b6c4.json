This article reviews the effectiveness of herbal medicine as a potential therapeutic approach for hypertension, offering an alternative or complementary solution to conventional pharmacological treatments. It highlights several natural agents that have demonstrated efficacy in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in clinical and meta-analytical studies. The methodology involved a systematic review of articles that discuss herbal therapeutics for hypertension, focusing on their efficacy compared to placebo and standard treatments. The findings suggest that certain nutraceuticals, such as garlic, hawthorn, and CoQ10, can significantly reduce SBP, presenting a viable option for managing hypertension. This review underscores the need for further research to validate these findings and optimize herbal treatment strategies, potentially expanding the use of these natural products in clinical practice. The article aims to increase awareness among medical professionals and patients about the benefits and applications of herbal medicines in treating hypertension.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c82f708d65093c49d91646904b506bd55b5a60b6e0ba544d089a0a6cb72b6c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
