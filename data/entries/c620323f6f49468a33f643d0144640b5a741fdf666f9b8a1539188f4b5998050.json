{"title":"Historical Overview of the Evolution of Studies and Classifications of Renal Tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1529/v1","date":1713888617000,"content":"The classification of kidney tumors has undergone a remarkable evolution since the early 19th century, reflecting advances in medical science and technology. This historical overview traces the development of renal tumor classification, beginning with early clinical observations and macroscopic descriptions to the integration of molecular diagnostics in contemporary classifications. The establishment of international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) facilitated collaboration and standardization in tumor classification, leading to refined classifications and standardized nomenclature. Advancements in histological and molecular studies, particularly genetic analyses, revolutionized the understanding of renal cell carcinomas, enabling precise categorization based on molecular characteristics. The journey from rudimentary classifications to sophisticated systems based on detailed histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular criteria underscores the continuous evolution of kidney tumor classification. This article provides a comprehensive overview of this evolution, highlighting the contributions of scholars and the impact of technological advancements on our understanding and management of kidney tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c620323f6f49468a33f643d0144640b5a741fdf666f9b8a1539188f4b5998050","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
