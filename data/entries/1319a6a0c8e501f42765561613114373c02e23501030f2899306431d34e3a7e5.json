{"title":"Milk levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 identify mothers with low milk supply","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305421","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Rhea Sullivan, Alexandra Confair, Steven D. Hicks</p>\r\n\r\nHuman milk is optimal for infant nutrition. However, many mothers cease breastfeeding because of low milk supply (LMS). It is difficult to identify mothers at risk for LMS because its biologic underpinnings are not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that milk micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may be related to LMS. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) also plays an important role in mammary involution and may contribute to LMS. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 139 breastfeeding mothers to test the hypothesis that milk levels of TGFβ would identify mothers with LMS. We explored whether TGFβ impacts the expression of LMS-related miRNAs in cultured human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). LMS was defined by maternal report of inadequate milk production, and confirmed by age of formula introduction and infant weight trajectory. Levels of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were measured one month after delivery. There was a significant relationship between levels of TGF-β1 and LMS (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> = 8.92, p = 0.003) on logistic regression analysis, while controlling for lactation stage (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> = 1.28, p = 0.25), maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.038, p = 0.84), and previous breastfeeding experience (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> = 7.43, p = 0.006). The model accounted for 16.8% of variance in the data (p = 0.005) and correctly predicted LMS for 84.6% of mothers (22/26; AUC = 0.72). Interactions between TGF-β1 and miR-22-3p displayed significant effect on LMS status (Z = 2.67, p = 0.008). Further, incubation of HMECs with TGF-β1 significantly reduced mammary cell number (t = -4.23, p = 0.003) and increased levels of miR-22-3p (t = 3.861, p = 0.008). Interactions between TGF-β1 and miR-22-3p may impact mammary function and milk levels of TGF-β1 could have clinical utility for identifying mothers with LMS. Such information could be used to provide early, targeted lactation support.","author":"Rhea Sullivan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1319a6a0c8e501f42765561613114373c02e23501030f2899306431d34e3a7e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
