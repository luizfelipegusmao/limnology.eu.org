{"title":"Malaria reporting timeliness analysis and factors associated with delayed notification, 2018–2022, Nepal","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003589","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Shashi Kandel, Gokarna Dahal, Rudra Prasad Marasini, Krishna Prasad Paudel, Ashna Parajuli, Susmita Thapa, Rizu Aryal, Kanlaya Jongcherdchootrakul, Phanthanee Thitichai</p>\r\n\r\nIn order to monitor public health trends and identify disease outbreaks early, efficient and reliable notification and surveillance systems are essential. Nepal uses a 1-3-7 malaria surveillance approach. The Short Message System (SMS) -based system for timely notification has been established. However, knowledge gaps exist regarding the timeliness of notification, treatment initiation, and case-based investigations. Hence, this study identifies the timeliness of notification and factors associated with delayed notification. This study used a cross-sectional approach and used secondary malaria surveillance data from Nepal’s national malaria elimination program for the period of 2018 to 2022. The study revealed that the majority (79.9%) of malaria cases were male, with a male-to-female ratio of 3.96:1. Occupation was found to be significantly associated with delayed notification. Repatriate workers had 0.60 times lower odds of experiencing delayed notification compared to the reference occupation. Similarly, individuals diagnosed in the Sudurpaschim and Lumbini provinces had significantly lower odds (0.48 and 0.38, respectively) of encountering delayed notification compared to the reference province. Furthermore, relying on a single laboratory tool for malaria diagnosis (either RDT or microscopy only) was significantly associated with delayed notification. Individuals diagnosed solely with RDT or microscopy had 2.04 and 1.79 times higher odds of experiencing delayed notification, respectively, compared to those diagnosed using both laboratory tools. This study provides insight into the timeliness of surveillance system approach by assessing delayed notification and the factors associated with it. No delays are identified in median notification, treatment time and in case investigation. Improvement in the timeliness of malaria reporting over the years was observed. Provinces with high burden of malaria and repatriate workers showed lower delayed notification and conversely, cases diagnosed with single laboratory tool showed delayed notification time.","author":"Shashi Kandel","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"8f32d577f3299620cb766a6169ea7bc95387cd68db56fbf7e9003e6ccc7f763f","category":"Environment"}
