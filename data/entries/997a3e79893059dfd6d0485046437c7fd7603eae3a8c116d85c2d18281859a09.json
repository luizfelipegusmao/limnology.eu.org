{"title":"Association between Opioid-Benzodiazepine Trajectories and Injurious Fall Risk among US Medicare Beneficiaries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1235/v1","date":1713428070000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Concurrent opioid (OPI) and benzodiazepine (BZD) use may exacerbate falls/fractures risk compared to no use or use alone. Yet, patients may need concurrent OPI-BZD use for co-occurring conditions (e.g., pain and anxiety). Therefore, we examined the association between longitudinal OPI-BZD dosing patterns and subsequent injurious falls risk. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including non-cancer fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries initiating OPI and/or BZD in 2016-2018. We identified OPI-BZD use patterns during the 3 months following OPI and/or BZD initiation (i.e., trajectory period) using group-based multi-trajectory models. We estimated time to first injurious fall within 3 months post-trajectory period using inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Among 622,588 beneficiaries (ageâ‰¥65=84.6%, female=58.1%, White=82.7%; having injurious falls=0.45%), we identified 13 distinct OPI-BZD trajectories: Group(A):Very-low OPI-only (early discontinuation)(44.9% of the cohort); (B):Low OPI-only (rapid decline)(15.1%); (C):Very-low OPI-only (late discontinuation)(7.7%); (D):Low OPI-only (gradual decline)(4.0%); (E):Moderate OPI-only (rapid decline)(2.3%); (F):Very-low BZD-only (late discontinuation)(11.5%); (G):Low BZD-only (rapid decline)(4.5%); (H):Low BZD-only (stable) (3.1%); (I):Moderate BZD-only (gradual decline)(2.1%); (J):Very-low OPI (rapid decline)/Very-low BZD (late discontinuation)(2.9%); (K):Very-low OPI (rapid decline)/Very-low BZD (increasing)(0.9%); (L):Very-low OPI (stable)/Low BZD (stable)(0.6%); and (M):Low OPI (gradual decline)/Low BZD (gradual decline)(0.6%). Compared with Group(A), 6 trajectories had increased 3-month injurious fall risks: (C): HR, 95%CI=1.78, 1.58-2.01; (D): 2.24, 1.93-2.59; (E): 2.60, 2.18-3.09; (H): 2.02, 1.70-2.40; (L): 2.73, 1.98-3.76; and (M): 1.96, 1.32-2.91. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that 3-month injurious fall risk varied across OPI-BZD trajectories, highlighting the importance of considering both dose and duration when assessing fall risks of OPI-BZD use among older adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"997a3e79893059dfd6d0485046437c7fd7603eae3a8c116d85c2d18281859a09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
