{"title":"Digital Documentation of Raya Gopura Using Geospatial Techniques Along with Supplementary Conjectural Reconstruction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0085/v1","date":1719838908000,"content":"This study explores the potential of digital technologies for preserving cultural heritage through the case study of the Raya Gopura, an incomplete monument in Melukote, India. Employing a combination of terrestrial photogrammetry, drone-based photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning, the research team captured highly detailed 3D models of the structure. This non-destructive approach offers a comprehensive digital record for future research and preservation. Furthermore, for the conjecture for the Raya Gopura two possible purposes: an entrance to a planned fort or a gateway to the temple are perceived through the collective intelligence (CI) approach. These insights inform a conjectural architectural drawing of the potentially completed monument. The 3D models hold significant potential for various applications, including tourism, education, and architectural research, with the potential for immersive experiences through VR and AR technologies.  The study demonstrated the effectiveness of digital tools in heritage preservation, not only safeguarding the Raya Gopura but also offering valuable in-sights for future research and public engagements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10e3de397407357d4d1a0f231aabb6f30e3b6df34d921b30b3059cb0b867b33e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
