{"title":"Laboratory evaluation of the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet Dual (a deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net) against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298513","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Thomas Syme, Boris N’dombidjé, Damien Todjinou, Victoria Ariori, Corine Ngufor</p>\r\n\r\nPyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets have been recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organisation (WHO) after an alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr net showed improved impact in epidemiological trials. PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual is a new deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net developed by Vestergaard Sàrl to expand options to control programmes. A series of laboratory studies were performed according to WHO guidelines to assess the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual. Regeneration time was determined by subjecting net pieces to cone bioassays and tunnel tests before and 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after washing. The wash-resistance of PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual was evaluated compared to WHO-prequalified pyrethroid-only (PermaNet<sup>®</sup> 2.0) and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr (Interceptor<sup>®</sup> G2) nets by testing net pieces washed 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 times in cone bioassays and tunnel tests. Tests were performed with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> to assess the pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr components separately. Net pieces were also analysed to determine insecticide content. In regeneration time studies, the biological activity of the deltamethrin and chlorfenapyr components of PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual regenerated within one day after washing and a 1-day washing interval was adopted for wash-resistance studies. PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual induced high mortality (98%) and blood-feeding inhibition (98%) of the susceptible strain after 20 washes fulfilling WHO efficacy criteria in tunnel tests (≥80% mortality, ≥90% blood-feeding inhibition). Similar results were obtained with PermaNet<sup>®</sup> 2.0 (99% mortality, 99% blood-feeding inhibition) and Interceptor<sup>®</sup> G2 (99% mortality, 98% blood-feeding inhibition) washed 20 times. In wash-resistance tunnel tests against the pyrethroid-resistant strain, PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual washed 20 times induced high mortality (91%) and blood-feeding inhibition (73%), which was similar to Interceptor<sup>®</sup> G2 (87% mortality, 79% blood-feeding inhibition) and superior to PermaNet<sup>®</sup> 2.0 (47% mortality, 68% blood-feeding inhibition). PermaNet<sup>®</sup> Dual fulfilled WHO efficacy criteria in laboratory bioassays and showed potential to improve control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors.","author":"Thomas Syme","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86ca9ed529beaa682cf9dc80ba4f294062e3eca21e4ea9f2aeeb281bb64097fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
