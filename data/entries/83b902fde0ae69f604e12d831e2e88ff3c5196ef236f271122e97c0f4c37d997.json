{"title":"Quality Characterization of Honeys from Iraqi Kurdistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0457/v1","date":1717739660000,"content":"The aim of this study was to research the quality parameters of honeys directly from Iraqi Kurdistan beekeepers and to compare with European Union law and Central European honeys. In total 30 honey samples directly from Kurdish, Czech and Slovak beekeepers were collected from the year of production 2018. The analyzed physicochemical parameters and bioactive compounds (moisture content, electrical conductivity, diastase activity, hydroxymethylfurfural content, pH, free acidity, total phenolic content, color, color intensity) varied depending on the botanical and geographical origin of honeys. Comparing Kurdistan honeys with a directive relating to honey, only two honey samples had diastase activity lower than limit and one sample had free acidity value at the legislative limit. Based on the results, it was found that the properties of Kurdistan honeys were very similar to the properties of Czech and Slovak honeys, as indicated by the detected statistically non-significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) between the moisture content, electrical conductivity, diastase activity and color. On the contrary, the most significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) were detected in hydroxymethylfurfural content, total phenolic content, and color intensity. Our results indicated the specific properties and the uniqueness of honeys from Iraqi Kurdistan and pointed to the possibility of trading this honey in Europe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83b902fde0ae69f604e12d831e2e88ff3c5196ef236f271122e97c0f4c37d997","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
