{"title":"Metabolism of quercitrin in the colon and its beneficial regulatory effects on gut microbiota","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13747?af=R","date":1721772805000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Quercitrin is a dietary flavonoid widely found in plants with various physiological activities. However, whether quercitrin alters gut microbiota <i>in vivo</i> is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolism of quercitrin in the colon and its regulation on gut microbiota in mice.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Herein, 22 flavonoids related to quercitrin metabolism were identified based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Gas chromatography and 16S rDNA gene sequencing were used to investigate short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content and diversity of composition of gut microbiota, respectively. The results showed that quercitrin significantly alters the beta-diversity of the gut microbiota, probiotics such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Lactococcus</i> were significantly increased, and the production of propanoate, isovalerate and hexanoate of the quercitrin group were enhanced significantly. The Spearman's association analysis provided evidence that <i>Gardnerella</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> have obvious correlations with most of quercitrin metabolites and SCFAs.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Quercitrin and its metabolites in the colon altered the structure of the mice gut microbiota and increased the content of SCFAs. Our experiments provide valuable insights into quercitrin research and application.
