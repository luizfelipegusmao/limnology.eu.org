{"title":"Deciphering the Plastome and Molecular Identity of Six Medicinal Amomum Species","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0250/v1","date":1717568713000,"content":"The genus Amomum encompasses six medicinal species that are extensively utilized and have a significant historical background. Due to their morphological similarities, however, the presence of counterfeit and substandard products remains a challenge. Accurate plant identification is therefore essential to address these issues. This study utilized 11 newly sequenced samples along with extensive data from NCBI to perform molecular identification of these six species. The plastomes of Amomum displayed a typical quadripartite structure with conserved gene content, yet showed independent variations in the SC/IR boundary shifts at both inter- and intra-specific levels. Our approach incorporated ITS, ITS1, ITS2, complete plastomes, matK, rbcL, and psbA-trnH sequences for molecular identification, which effectively differentiated the six medicinal species within the genus Amomum, as confirmed by distance-based and phylogenetic tree analyses. Among these, the ITS, ITS1, and complete plastomes sequences demonstrated the highest identification success rate (3/6), followed by ITS2, matK, and psbA-trnH (1/6). In contrast, rbcL failed to identify any species. This research successfully established a reliable molecular identification method for Amomum plants, to protect wild plant resources and promote the sustainable use of medicinal plants and restrict the exploitation of these resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d315fc85e062b44c35a1471635ce5b636ea385003ece92d65d85c771ddb9565","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
