{"title":"Challenges of the QWERTY Keyboard for Quechua Speakers in the Puno Region in Per&uacute;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0648/v1","date":1728444932000,"content":"The widespread adoption of the QWERTY keyboard layout, designed primarily for English, presents significant challenges for speakers of indigenous languages such as Quechua, particularly in the Puno region of Peru. This research examines the extent to which the QWERTY layout affects the writing and digital communication of Quechua speakers. Through an analysis of the Quechua languageâ€™s unique alphabet and character frequency, combined with insights from local speakers, we identify the limitations imposed by the QWERTY system on the efficient digital transcription of Quechua. The study further proposes alternative keyboard layouts, including optimizations of QWERTY and DVORAK, designed to enhance typing efficiency and reduce the digital divide for Quechua speakers. Our findings underscore the need for localized technological solutions to preserve linguistic diversity while improving digital literacy for indigenous communities. The proposed modifications offer a pathway toward more inclusive digital tools that respect and accommodate linguistic diversity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b0de9b4e0ed32d26c2d666fc720ee10732f98b7a4c003cd90d5c7c4b42c07d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
