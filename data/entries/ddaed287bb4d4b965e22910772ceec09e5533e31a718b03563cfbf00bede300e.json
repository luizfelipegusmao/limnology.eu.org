{"title":"The Role of Climate, Mineralogy and Stable Aggregates for Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics Along a Geoclimatic Gradient","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GB007934?af=R","date":1719730800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Organic matter accumulation in soil is understood as the result of the dynamics between mineral-associated (more decomposed, microbial derived) organic matter and free particulate (less decomposed, plant derived) organic matter. However, from regional to global scales, patterns and drivers behind main soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions are not well understood and remain poorly linked to the pedogenetic variation across soil types. Here, we separated SOC associated with silt- and clay-sized particles (S + C), stable aggregates (&gt;63 μm, SA) and particulate organic matter (POM) from a diverse range of grassland topsoils sampled along a geoclimatic gradient. The relative contribution of the two mineral-associated fractions (S + C &amp; SA) to SOC differed significantly across the gradient, while POM was never the dominant SOC fraction. Stable aggregates (&gt;63 μm) emerged as the major SOC fraction in carbon-rich soils. The degree of decomposition of carbon in stable aggregates (&gt;63 μm) was consistently between that of the S + C and POM fractions and did not change along the investigated gradient. In contrast, carbon associated with the S + C fraction was less microbially decomposed in carbon-rich soils than in carbon-poor soils. The amount of SOC in the S + C fraction was positively correlated to pedogenic oxide contents and texture, whereas the amount of SOC associated with stable aggregates (&gt;63 μm) was positively correlated to pedogenic oxide contents and negatively to temperature. We present a conceptual summary of our findings, which integrates the role of stable aggregates (&gt;63 μm) with other major SOC fractions and illustrates their changing importance across (soil-)environmental gradients.</p>","author":"Daniel Wasner, \nRose Abramoff, \nMarco Griepentrog, \nErick Zagal Venegas, \nPascal Boeckx, \nSebastian Doetterl","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Biogeochemical Cycles: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2d4e750daa5e386ca7dda0c54cc50454a723cbd123b964bfed1d56a4712b632","entryHash":"ddaed287bb4d4b965e22910772ceec09e5533e31a718b03563cfbf00bede300e","category":"Environment"}
