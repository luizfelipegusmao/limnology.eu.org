To better conservation of freshwater ecosystems by controlling this mussel, it is essential to study its distribution, potential for invasion, environmental tolerance and biological traits.\nThis paper outlines the distribution of <i>L. fortunei</i> in Asia and South America, as well as its potential for future invasion in freshwater habitats, along with the research methods employed.\nWe find that the mussel had a temperature tolerance range of 8–35 °C and a pH range was 5–10, with some individuals surviving in extreme conditions for extended periods.\nWe find that temperature was a decisive factor for success at reproductive stages, larval development and adult growth.\nThe biological traits of <i>L. fortunei</i> are discussed, focusing on feeding habits, attachment characteristics and locomotion, with an emphasis on byssus structure, foot proteins and adhesion mechanisms. The study elucidates the impact of flow velocity, light exposure and substrate material on their attachment, with the optimal attachment being identified at a flow velocity of 0.3–0.9 m/s. Additionally, the mussel exhibits strong light avoidance performances and a preference for rough surfaces.\nExtensively-researched control strategies are classified and summarized, primarily categorized into physical, chemical and biological control, with an outline of their respective strengths and limitations.\n</p>","author":"Yuhan Liu, \nXiaoyan He, \nYing Yang, \nXiuqin Bai, \nChengqing Yuan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"a33f407e862518354dba6f4603d45e95d0376555a332412e17a81833e67cfae5","category":"Environment"}
