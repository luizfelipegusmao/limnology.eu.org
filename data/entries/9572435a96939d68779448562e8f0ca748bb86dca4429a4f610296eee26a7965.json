{"title":"Exploring Demand: Challenges and Opportunities for Free-from and Organic Foods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1407/v1","date":1726724439000,"content":"The rising prevalence of food intolerances and increased health and environmental consciousness has driven demand for free-from (FF) and organic products. This study aims to analyze consumer needs, motivations, and challenges related to these products in Portugal through an online survey with 2268 eligible responses, with a participants’ median age of 41 years, predominantly women (76.9%). Results show that 97.4% of respondents are aware of FF products, with 60.0% being regular consumers, particularly of lactose-free milk and gluten-free bread and biscuits. Significant market gaps were identified in the variety of FF bread (62.8%), pastries (49.0%), and cookies (38.4%). Consumers identified high prices (84.9%) and excessive sugar/fat content (52.1%) as the main drawbacks of FF products currently on the market. Women showed greater knowledge and purchase levels compared to men. Trust in organic certification was low (21.4%), with skepticism higher among lower-income and male participants. Despite this, 78.1% believed in the health benefits of organic products, and 72.2% agreed that increased demand could lower prices. Overall, the study highlights the need for greater products’ variety, improved transparency, and consumer education to enhance market trust and accessibility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9572435a96939d68779448562e8f0ca748bb86dca4429a4f610296eee26a7965","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
