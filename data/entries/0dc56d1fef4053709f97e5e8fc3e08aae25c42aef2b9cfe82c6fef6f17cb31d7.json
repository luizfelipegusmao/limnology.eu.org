{"title":"Bangana devdevi, a Native Carp of the Himalayan Biodiversity Hotspot: Reproductive Biology and Hormonal Breeding Efforts for Conservation and Aquaculture Promotion","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5556553?af=R","date":1721059489000,"content":"<p>Efficient conservation efforts for valued fish species such as <i>Bangana devdevi</i>, a medium-sized minor carp prevalent in Southeast Asian countries, can be facilitated through well-established artificial breeding techniques. This study aimed to investigate the reproductive biology of <i>B. devdevi</i> and focused on optimizing hormone dosages for breeding purposes for the first time. The research findings indicated that the highest gonadosomatic index (GSI) for males (1.17) was observed in August, while for females, it peaked in July (2.24). Female fish exhibited absolute fecundity ranging from 2089 to 26287 eggs, corresponding to body weights ranging between 10.46 and 153.73 g. The relative fecundity ranged from 170 to 298 eggs g<sup>−1</sup> of body weight. To induce breeding, female brooders were administered Gonopro-FH hormone through three experimental groups: G-FH_0.4, G-FH_0.5, and G-FH_0.6, with doses of 0.4 mL, 0.5 mL, and 0.6 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup> of body weight, respectively. Spawning occurred within 6–10 h after hormone administration. Among these groups, G-FH_0.5 exhibited the highest fertilization rate (94.25%) and hatching rate (89.03%), significantly surpassing the rates observed in G-FH_0.4 and G-FH_0.6 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). This study provided valuable insights into the reproductive biology of <i>B. devdevi</i> and emphasized its potential application in developing management and conservation strategies for this species in rivers and tributaries. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from induced breeding holds promise for future large-scale seed production initiatives.</p>","author":"Yumnam Bedajit, \nSurajkumar Irungbam, \nSoibam Ngasotter, \nDavid Waikhom, \nMaibam Malemngamba Meitei, \nSanjenbam Bidyasagar Singh, \nWangkheimayum Malemnganbi Devi, \nSoibam Khogen Singh, \nPronob Das, \nSoibam Basanta Singh, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"0dc56d1fef4053709f97e5e8fc3e08aae25c42aef2b9cfe82c6fef6f17cb31d7","category":"Environment"}
