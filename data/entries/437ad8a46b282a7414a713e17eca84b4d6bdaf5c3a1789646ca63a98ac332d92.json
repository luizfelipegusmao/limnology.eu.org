{"title":"Frequent Pain Assessment May Interfere with Chronic Pain\nRecovery: 5 Pilot Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1636/v1","date":1727078671000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Catastrophization and other comorbid psychological factors that increase awareness of pain are known to hinder chronic pain recovery. Five pilot studies, reported here, indicate that increased pain awareness from frequent pain assessment may impede chronic pain recovery through similar mechanisms. Methods: All study participants were asked to use a biofeedback device at least twice daily. Studies 1 and 2 required pain assessment before and after each biofeedback session, while Studies 3-5 did not. Pain levels were measured by the McGill Pain Inventory (McGill PI) at the start and end of each study. Results: Studies 3-5  replicated our prior work, demonstrating changes in pain, anxiety, and satisfaction and recovery following a home-use biofeedback program. Participants in the studies without frequent pain assessment experienced greater overall reductions in pain compared to participants in studies that did not require pain assessment. The results are, however, statistically inconclusive due to high variability, so further research is necessary. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that frequent pain assessment may hinder pain reduction, likely by facilitating negative thought patterns and neural circuits involved in chronic pain. These findings can be applied to developing better research designs and more effective chronic pain recovery programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"437ad8a46b282a7414a713e17eca84b4d6bdaf5c3a1789646ca63a98ac332d92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
