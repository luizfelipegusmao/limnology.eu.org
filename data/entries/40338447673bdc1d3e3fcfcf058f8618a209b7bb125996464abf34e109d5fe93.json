{"title":"Altered Expression of IL-15, IFNG and HPRT1 Genes in the Thin Endometrium of Patients with Reproductive Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1021/v1","date":1723616476000,"content":"Reproductive disorders are a common event in modern reproductive medicine, occurring both in spontaneous and assisted pregnancies. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of implantation disorders in thin endometrium, including the study of gene transcriptional activity, have shed light on the identification of potential biological markers of endometrial receptivity. Background/Objectives: to reveal significantly dysregulated selected genes expression between RIF and RPL patients with thin endometrium. Methods: Endometrial samples were collected in the implantation window days (LH+7 â€“ LH+10) of the natural menstrual cycle from RIF patients (n=20) and RPL patients (n=19). Ten genes were chosen as target genes regarding their possible relations with the implantation process. Total RNA was purified, reverse-transcribed; gene expression was quantified by RT-PCR. Results: The expression of the IL-15, INFG and HPRT1 genes were significantly decreased in RIF with thin endometrium patients compared to the RPL patients (log2 fold change=0.92, p=0.023 for IL-15, log2 fold change=1.24, p=0.046 for INFG, and log2 fold change=0.579, p=0.046 for HPRT1). There were not significant differences in expression of CXCL8, CXCL1, MMP10, C4BPA, TNC, VEGFB and HAND2 genes between groups. Conclusions: decreased expression of IL-15, INFG and HPRT1 genes was found in patients with RIF with thin endometrium compared to the endometrium of women with RPL. This has practical significance for clinicians for differentiated prescription of immunomodulatory therapy in patients undergoing ART programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40338447673bdc1d3e3fcfcf058f8618a209b7bb125996464abf34e109d5fe93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
