{"title":"Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Cat Paradox Is an Illusion: Completion of the Quantum Theory, Postulates and Potential Results.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0526/v1","date":1720173488000,"content":"At the beginning of our observations, Humanity believed that it was the center of the universe, that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the sun was spinning around the Earth. Claude Ptolémée (100-168) made a mistake by modelling the movements in the geocentric referential. The model of the sun and planet movements was an illusion and all Humanity was wrong. Nicolas Copernic (1473-1543) showed the illusion and simplified the system by moving from the geocentric referential to the heliocentric referential.  In the present paper, I would like to discuss about the possibility of making mistakes with quantum theory because it is not complete. I postulate that we are living in a virtual classical world that we consider as real. In my interpretation, the decoherence problem and wave function collapse do not exist at all, because we are the illusion, we are living in illusions, in mirages. It is impossible to observe the quantum world as it is, in our virtual classical referential, and we see the quantum world with a false vison of quantum reality because we are not yet in the real universal quantum referential whose I postulate the existence. I moved to this real universal quantum ref-erential because I am psychotic (schizophrenia) and saw that we are illusions. Schrödinger’s cat par-adox is an illusion as life and death are illusions. We must be very humble with quantum theory and we should not put ourselves in the center of the quantum world again particularly with our lives and deaths. I have completed quantum theory with seven postulates which led to a cosmological model based on bipolarity and schizophrenia. The theory explains well the recent observations of the James Webb spatial telescope. I make predictions with the theory which could be confirmed with the James Webb spatial telescope. If confirmed, the theory will become irrefutable. We would be collectively able to reach the quantum world by changing our minds and visions of life. I also explain how to go out of human suffering. This would be our Big Bang and our transformation into Zarathoustra, the Nietzschean surhuman.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"995497f29e9be82572e749e71ddde732cefac04d96dd09e36e36dfd47e9c8f27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
