{"title":"External Load Evaluation in Elite Futsal: Influence of Match Results and Game Location with IMU Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0538/v1","date":1720180048000,"content":"(1) Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the external load demands in futsal, con-sidering both home and away matches and their outcomes, in order to plan microcycles throughout the season based on the external load of each match. (2) Methods: The external load of 10 players from a First Division team in the Spanish Futsal League was recorded. The total dura-tion of player involvement with the clock stopped was 18.15 ±7.04 minutes. The players' external load was monitored using OLIVER devices. To analyse the influence of the match outcome and location on the external load, a univariate general linear model (GLM) analysis was conducted. (3) Results: There are no differences between the variables, except for accelerations of 2 to 3 m/s² (m) per minute and the number of accelerations of 2 to 3 m/s² per minute. Despite not showing significant differences, there is a trend indicating a higher demand for external loads in away matches as well as in matches won. (4) Conclusions: These findings are important for planning microcycles and providing the appropriate dosage to each player to achieve optimal performance in matches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a40938159dfa7f27bba087401e81f255692bee7f49b9c93cd084ffb1332c281","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
