{"title":"Effects of maternal methylparaben exposure on the offspring population dynamics varied between amictic and mictic mothers of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/4/431/7689382?rss=1","date":1717718400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Maternal effect plays important role in adaptive evolution and population dynamics. Methylparaben (Mep) is a common organic pollutant exerting diverse impacts on aquatic organisms. However, the impact of maternal Mep exposure on offspring remains poorly understood. This study was designed to explore whether maternal Mep exposure can affect the offspring’s population performance, either by amictic mothers in parthenogenesis phase, or by mictic mothers in sexual reproduction phase of the rotifer <span>Brachionus calyciflorus</span>. Here, we exposed either amictic or mictic mothers from one clonal laboratory population to 20 mg/L Mep (T environment) until the offspring or resting eggs were collected. A parallel control group without Mep (C environment) was also set. Thereafter, offspring from amictic mothers or stem female from resting eggs of mictic mothers were treated similarly in T or C environment. Population growth, life history traits and antioxidant indices of the offspring were examined. The results demonstrated that maternal Mep exposure inhibited population performance of offspring in both life history phases, while the negative effects were markedly buffered in sexual reproduction phase. This study clarifies toxicity of Mep on rotifers and highlights the different response patterns of maternal Mep exposure in different life history phase.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"4110494dd255a8e4b4098cd75ee6caf74d024cc712ad2e670d0fb498c09c687c","category":"Environment"}
