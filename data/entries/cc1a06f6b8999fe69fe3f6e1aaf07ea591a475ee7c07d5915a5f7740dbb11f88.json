{"title":"First Account of Epibiotic Diatoms Taxa from the Shells of Green Swimming Crabs Callinectes bellicosus (Stimpson 1859) (Decapoda, Portunidae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1578/v1","date":1713940308000,"content":"Diatoms are among the most common epibionts and have been recorded on the surfaces of various living substrates, either plants or animals. However, said studies are still scarce in view of the many substrata available. In this study, epibiotic diatoms living on Callinectes bellicosus were identified for the first time from a subtropical coastal lagoon in northwest Mexico. We tested the null hypothesis that the diatom flora living on the shells of C. bellicosus would not be similar to that recorded for mangrove sediments, its typical habitat. The epibiotic diatoms were brushed off from the carapaces of two specimens, acid-cleaned, mounted in synthetic resin, and identified based on frustule morphology. In this way, 106 taxa from 45 genera were recorded, including 24 singletons, and six new records for the Mexican northwest region. The best-represented genera were Nitzschia (10 taxa), Mastogloia (9), Diploneis (7), Navicula (7), Amphora (5), Cocconeis (5), Tryblionella (4), and Gyrosigma (4). Species composition included 93% of local taxa, thus refuting the proposed hypothesis and supporting the alternate one. Although the estimated species richness was lower than in sediments, it deems the green crab carapace a favorable substrate for the growth of benthic diatoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc1a06f6b8999fe69fe3f6e1aaf07ea591a475ee7c07d5915a5f7740dbb11f88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
