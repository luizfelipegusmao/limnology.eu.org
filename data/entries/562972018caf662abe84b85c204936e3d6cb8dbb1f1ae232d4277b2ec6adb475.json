{"title":"Evaluating the determinants of load capacity factor in Japan: The impact of economic complexity and trade globalization","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12334?af=R","date":1722998683000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Sustainable growth and the reduction of environmental pressures are important priorities that are issues of concern for both developed and developing countries. However, while carbon emissions and ecological footprint are commonly used by researchers in the context of environmental deterioration, a broader and more extensive metric for ecological quality is considered necessary. From this perspective, the load capacity factor provides a more detailed sustainable environment appraisal by simultaneously considering biocapacity and ecological footprint. Limited studies have examined the determinants of load capacity factor (LCAP). This survey attempts to fill the gap, using the case of Japan. Employing the dynamic ARDL approaches, the present research investigates the effect of renewable energy usage, economic growth, economic complexity, financial development, and trade globalization on load capacity factor in Japan for the period between 1980 and 2017. The empirical evidence indicates that economic complexity, economic growth, and financial development adversely impact LCAP, whereas renewable energy usage and trade globalization positively affect LCAP. Hence, we recommend that it is essential for Japan to attain self-sufficiency in essential goods and minimize its reliance on the rest of the world. Furthermore, policymakers should capitalize on the benefits of trade globalization by adopting additional measures aimed at facilitating trade liberalization.</p>","author":"Abraham Ayobamiji Awosusi, \nTomiwa Sunday Adebayo, \nDervis Kirikkaleli, \nHusam Rjoub, \nMehmet Altunta≈ü","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"562972018caf662abe84b85c204936e3d6cb8dbb1f1ae232d4277b2ec6adb475","category":"Environment"}
