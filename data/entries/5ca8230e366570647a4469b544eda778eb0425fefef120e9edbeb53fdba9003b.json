{"title":"Genome-wide characterization of single-stranded DNA in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1268/7698908?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is essential for various DNA-templated processes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, comprehensive characterizations of ssDNA still lag in plants compared to nonplant systems. Here, we conducted in situ S1-sequencing, with starting gDNA ranging from 5 <span>Âµ</span>g to 250 ng, followed by comprehensive characterizations of ssDNA in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span> L.). We found that ssDNA loci were substantially associated with a subset of non-B DNA structures and functional genomic loci. Subtypes of ssDNA loci had distinct epigenetic features. Importantly, ssDNA may act alone or partly coordinate with non-B DNA structures, functional genomic loci, or epigenetic marks to actively or repressively modulate gene transcription, which is genomic region dependent and associated with the distinct accumulation of RNA Pol II. Moreover, distinct types of ssDNA had differential impacts on the activities and evolution of transposable elements (TEs) (especially common or conserved TEs) in the rice genome. Our study showcases an antibody-independent technique for characterizing non-B DNA structures or functional genomic loci in plants. It lays the groundwork and fills a crucial gap for further exploration of ssDNA, non-B DNA structures, or functional genomic loci, thereby advancing our understanding of their biology in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5ca8230e366570647a4469b544eda778eb0425fefef120e9edbeb53fdba9003b","category":"Environment"}
