{"title":"Assessment of Energy Poverty and Alleviation Strategies in the Global South","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1639/v1","date":1719205082000,"content":"Energy poverty in the Global South generally focuses on the lack of basic access to modern fuels and energy carriers. Impoverished people rely primarily on traditional biomass as a source of energy. This situation of basic resource deprivation, in which almost one third of the world's population lives, masks other relevant features of the problem. Current assessments of energy poverty in impoverished areas and the mitigation strategies being implemented derive from the development agenda and, with variations in detail and scope, highlight electricity connections and access to clean cooking fuels as guarantors of progress. However, a comprehensive understanding of energy poverty requires going beyond basic access, building on the interactions between the supply of energy sources and carriers, the provision of energy services and its impact on decent living conditions. Several studies in the last decade have attempted to construct an assessment framework centered on energy services to deal with these interactions. This work discusses the relevant dimensions in the framework (supply, services and impact in wellbeing), reviews the multidisciplinary work available in each aspect, presents a range of proposed taxonomies, and discusses the different issues. A detailed framework is proposed for the integrated assessment of the supply of energy carriers and energy equipment, the provision of relevant energy services, and the improvements obtained in living conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa5900e6b818a61d86ccc4c7b4fcc7a90363133e2576504d51b73da16d73dc7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
