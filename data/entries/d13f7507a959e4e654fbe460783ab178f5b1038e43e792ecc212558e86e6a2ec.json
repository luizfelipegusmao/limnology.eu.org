{"title":"Evaluating Sexual Health in Women with Multiple Sclerosis: A Study on the Interplay of Disability and Quality of Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1450/v1","date":1716425907000,"content":"In the context of evolving perceptions of sexuality, particularly within the realm of health and disability, this study investigates the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) on female sexual function and quality of life. A quantitative study involving 130 female MS patients aged 35 to 50 was conducted, employing measures such as The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), The Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19), and The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Results indicate a significant association between greater sexual dysfunction and poorer quality of sex life, alongside the correlation of increased fatigue with diminished sexual satisfaction. Factors such as education level, time of diagnosis, and treatment regimen also influenced outcomes. Findings underscore the importance of supportive interventions, including counseling, to enhance the quality of sex life for women with disabilities, particularly those with MS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d13f7507a959e4e654fbe460783ab178f5b1038e43e792ecc212558e86e6a2ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
