{"title":"CRISPR RNA-Guided Gene Editing and its Clinical Research Applications in Hematology with Focus on Inherited Germline Predisposition to Hematologic Malignancies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0537/v1","date":1718001544000,"content":"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) based gene-editing has begun to transform the treatment landscape of genetic diseases. The history of the discovery of CRISPR/CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins/single guide RNA (sgRNA)-based gene-editing since the first report of repetitive sequences of unknown significance in 1987 is fascinating, instructive, and inspiring for future advances. The recent approval of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene therapy to treat patients with severe sickle cell anemia and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia has renewed hope for treating other hematologic diseases, including patients with germline predisposition to hematologic malignancies, who would benefit greatly from the development of CRISPR-based gene therapies. The purpose of this manuscript is three-fold: first, a chronological description of the history of CRISPR-Cas9-sgRNA-based gene editing; second, a brief description of the current state of clinical research in hematologic diseases, including selected applications in treating hematologic diseases with CRISPR-based gene therapy; and third, the current progress in gene therapies in inherited hematologic diseases and bone marrow failure syndromes, to hopefully stimulate efforts towards developing these therapies for patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and other inherited conditions with germline predisposition to hematologic malignancies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d881caf4004f594b1beeacaf790ccb3456f0089983d561c8b4304d6846f03a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
