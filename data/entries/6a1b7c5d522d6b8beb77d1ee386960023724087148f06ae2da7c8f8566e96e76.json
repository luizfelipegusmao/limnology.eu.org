{"title":"Effect of Organic-Inorganic Mixed Intumescent Flame Retardants on Intumescent Fire-Retardant Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1827/v1","date":1721797274000,"content":"Expandable graphite (EG) was modified with a charring agent and organic-inorganic hybridised intumescent flame retardants (MEG) were synthesized. This study uses a cone calorimeter (CCT) and a DaqPRO 5300 radiation heat flow meter to evaluate the fire-resistant properties influenced by MEG on intumescent fire-retardant coatings. The impact of MEG on the thermal degradation of these coatings was investigated through the use of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results obtained by CCT demonstrated that the incorporation of MEG markedly diminished the heat release rate and total heat release rate of the coating, in addition to enhancing the char residue compared to coatings with only expandable graphite (EG). Furthermore, TGA results demonstrate that adding MEG increases the weight of the char residue at elevated temperatures, suggesting improved thermal stability. Based on these findings, MEG exhibits a synergistic flame retardant effect when combined with intumescent fire retardant (IFR) systems. This synergy not only improves the flame-retardant properties of the coatings but also enhances their overall thermal stability, making MEG a promising additive for developing more efficient fire-retardant materials. Thus, MEG-modified coatings offer superior protection against fire hazards, highlighting their potential for practical applications in fire safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a1b7c5d522d6b8beb77d1ee386960023724087148f06ae2da7c8f8566e96e76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
