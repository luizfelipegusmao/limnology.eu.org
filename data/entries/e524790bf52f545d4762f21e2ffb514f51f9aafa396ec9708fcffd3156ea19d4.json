{"title":"Predictors of Speech-in-Noise Understanding in a Population of Occupationally Noise-Exposed Individuals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0201/v1","date":1714977984000,"content":"Understanding speech in noise is particularly difficult for individuals occupationally exposed to noise due to a to a mix between noise-induced auditory lesions and energetic masking of speech signal. For years, the monitoring of conventional audiometric thresholds has been the usual way to check and preserve the auditory function. But the highlighting of supra-threshold deficits, notably speech in noise understanding difficulties, has pointed out the need for new monitoring tools. The present study aims to identify the most important variables that predict speech in noise under-standing in order to suggest a new way of regular monitoring. Physiological (distortion products of otoacoustic emissions, electrocochleography) and behavioral (amplitude and frequency modula-tion detection thresholds, conventional and extended high frequency audiometric thresholds)  variables were collected in a population of individuals presenting a relative homogeneous occu-pational noise exposure. Those variables were used as predictors in a statistical model (random forest) to predict scores of three different speech in noise tests and a self-report of speech in noise ability. The extended high frequency threshold appears to be the best predictor and therefore an interesting candidate for a new way of monitoring noise exposed professionals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e524790bf52f545d4762f21e2ffb514f51f9aafa396ec9708fcffd3156ea19d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
