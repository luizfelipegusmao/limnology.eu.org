{"title":"Relationship between Swallowing Function and Serum Albumin Levels in Japanese Older People Aged &ge; 75 Years","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2242/v1","date":1727570641000,"content":"Background/Objectives: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between swallowing function and serum albumin levels in Japanese older people (age ≥ 75 years). Methods: A total of 3258 participants (1325 males, 1933 females; mean age, 80.8 years) who had a dental checkup in Gifu City, Japan, between April 2020 and March 2021 were recruited. Swallowing function was assessed using the repetitive saliva swallow test, with poor swallowing function defined as swallowing fewer than three times in 30 seconds. A serum albumin level &amp;lt; 3.6 G/dL was considered low. Results: In total, 78 participants (2%) had a low serum albumin level. These participants were significantly more likely to be older (p &amp;lt; 0.001), male (p = 0.030), to have circulatory disease (p &amp;lt; 0.001), support/care-need certification (p &amp;lt; 0.001), poor tongue and lip function (p &amp;lt; 0.001), poor swallowing function (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and number of present teeth ≥ 20 teeth (p = 0.001). Furthermore, after adjusting for age, gender, circulatory disease, support/care-need certification, number of present teeth, tongue and lip function, and swallowing function, a low serum albumin level was positively associated with older (odds ratio [OR]: 1.115; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.064–1.169), male (OR: 2.208; 95% CI: 1.360–3.584), circulatory disease (OR: 1.829; 95% CI: 1.079–3.099), support/care-need certification (OR: 2.087; 95% CI: 1.208–3.606), and poor swallowing function (OR: 2.379; CI: 1.377–4.112). Conclusions: These results suggest a positive relationship between poor swallowing function and low serum albumin levels in Japanese older people.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0666ae91073e426fbd8c13f0e744372d0a863b79140ea477749195eed7b4de89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
