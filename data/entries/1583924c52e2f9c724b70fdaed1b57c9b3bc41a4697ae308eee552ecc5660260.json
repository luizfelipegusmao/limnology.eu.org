{"title":"Navigating a broken river: Understanding the ecological consequences of fragmentation on benthic life","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2575?af=R","date":1721273930000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Habitat fragmentation is emerging as a leading cause of biodiversity decline in riverine ecosystems. Several natural and human factors contribute to the fragmentation of rivers. River fragmentation is a growing problem that is widely spread and poses a significant challenge to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity, but its impact is not fully documented and acknowledged. Fragmentation impedes the movement of aquatic organisms and alters natural flow regimes, disrupting habitats and trophic supplies for aquatic biodiversity. It can also affect the adaptive ability of organisms to natural environmental changes, leading to a change in the structure and function of biotic communities. To understand the effects of fragmentation on river ecology, it is crucial to link its spatial and structural implications. This article examines the occurrence and frequency of fragmentation and its effects on the ecological community of benthic biota. This review aims to elucidate the overall effects of fragmentation on river ecology and recommends the possible measures to mitigate its impact. Urgent action is required to establish a comprehensive global network of free-flowing river systems and revive previously exploited rivers in different regions to enhance the protection and sustainable utilization of river ecosystems.</p>","author":"Mohd Sharjeel Sofi, \nSami Ullah Bhat, \nMohd Muslim","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"1583924c52e2f9c724b70fdaed1b57c9b3bc41a4697ae308eee552ecc5660260","category":"Environment"}
