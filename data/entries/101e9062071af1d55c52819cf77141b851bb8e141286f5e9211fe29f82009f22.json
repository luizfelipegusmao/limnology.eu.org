{"title":"Level of Agreement between Plaque Detection with Clinical Assessment and Assessment on Intraoral Scanner","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0214/v1","date":1722843171000,"content":"The aim was to evaluate the agreement between plaque detection with intraoral scanner system (IOS) and a conventional clinical method and to evaluate the inter-rater reliability for scoring 3D models with and without a disclosing agent. 14 participants were recruited from the Department of Operative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University name blinded to reviewers, it is completed after the reviewing process. Participants eligible for inclusion were adults with good general health and a minimum of 20 teeth.  Participants were clinically examined with plaque assessment according to the modified Quigley-Hein plaque index before and after using a disclosing agent (GC-Tri Plaque ID-Gel, GC). Before and after the application of the disclosing agent, all study participants were scanned using the IOS (TRIOS5, 3Shape TRIOS A/S). The clinical examiner and additional three examiners blinded to the clinical examination assessed plaque status on the acquired 3D models with and without disclosing agent using the same index to evaluate the inter-rater agreement. Intraclass coefficient correlation, one sample t-test and Cronbach’s α for inter-rater reliability were calculated. All methods showed moderate to strong correlations (Spearman’s rho ranging from 0.527 to 0.618) and Cronbach’s α ranged from 0.551 to 0.766. Level of agreement between con-ventional clinical registration and registration from 3D models was acceptable overall.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"101e9062071af1d55c52819cf77141b851bb8e141286f5e9211fe29f82009f22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
