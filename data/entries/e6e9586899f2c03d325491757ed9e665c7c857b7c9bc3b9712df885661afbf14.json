{"title":"Biological Parameters and Spermatogenesis in Razorfish (Pelecus cultratus) Population Inhabiting the Largest Shallow Lake of Central Europe (Lake Balaton): Studies for In Vitro Conservation Purposes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/6695280?af=R","date":1711177200000,"content":"<p>The study aimed to investigate body parameters and the process of spermatogenesis from April to September. In addition, it sought to test the applicability of sperm cryopreservation for conservation purposes in a razorfish (<i>Pelecus cultratus</i>) population of Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Central Europe. During the aforementioned period, measurements were taken for the standard length (SL, cm) and body weight (BW, g), and the sex of specimens was determined. Cells at different stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia-SG, spermatocytes-SC, spermatids-ST, and spermatozoa-SZ) were quantified monthly for each male sample. Sperm samples collected at the end of May were cryopreserved using a method designed for common carp. No significant differences were found between males (SL: 25 ± 2 cm and BW: 146 ± 38 g) and females (SL: 26 ± 3 cm and BW: 168 ± 53 g) in terms of measured body parameters. No significant correlations were found between the sex, SL, and BW. High standard deviations were observed for all mean values in all sampling periods, possibly due to the low number of individual samples per month. A significantly higher proportion of SC compared to SZ was found in April. In May, no differences were observed between the four groups. Significantly more SG and SZ than SC and ST were observed in June. In August and September, a slight dominance in the number of SG was recorded, with no differences measured among the cells in different developmental stages. The males studied exhibited a low gonadosomatic index (0.92% ± 0.27%). A significant reduction was recorded in motility (MOT), progressive motility (pMOT), and in most of the kinetic parameters (distance curved line-DCL, curvilinear velocity-VCL, straight line velocity-VSL, and beat cross frequency-BCF). The spermiation of males could have started in May and conceivably lasted until the end of June. It is recommended to increase sperm quality and quantity before cryopreservation.</p>","author":"Zoltán Bokor, \nFerenc Fodor, \nLevente Várkonyi, \nBorbála Nagy, \nZete Levente Láng, \nÁrpád Ferincz, \nÁdám Staszny, \nJózsef Molnár, \nKinga Katalin Lefler, \nBalázs Csorbai, \nZoltán Vancsura, \nZsolt Szári, \nBéla Urbányi, \nGergely Bernáth, \nCălin Lațiu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"e6e9586899f2c03d325491757ed9e665c7c857b7c9bc3b9712df885661afbf14","category":"Environment"}
