{"title":"A how-to guide for code sharing in biology","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002815","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Richard J. Abdill, Emma Talarico, Laura Grieneisen</p>\r\n\r\nIn 2024, all biology is computational biology. Computer-aided analysis continues to spread into new fields, becoming more accessible to researchers trained in the wet lab who are eager to take advantage of growing datasets, falling costs, and novel assays that present new opportunities for discovery. It is currently much easier to find guidance for implementing these techniques than for reporting their use, leaving biologists to guess which details and files are relevant. In this essay, we review existing literature on the topic, summarize common tips, and link to additional resources for training. Following this overview, we then provide a set of recommendations for sharing code, with an eye toward guiding those who are comparatively new to applying open science principles to their computational work. Taken together, we provide a guide for biologists who seek to follow code sharing best practices but are unsure where to start.","author":"Richard J.
