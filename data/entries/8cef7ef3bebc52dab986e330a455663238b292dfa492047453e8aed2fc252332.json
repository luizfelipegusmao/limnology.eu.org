{"title":"Comparing a Gauge-Invariant Formulation and a &ldquo;Conventional Complete Gauge-Fixing Approach&rdquo; for l = 0, 1 Mode Perturbations on the Schwarzschild Background Spacetime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2444/v1","date":1727702784000,"content":"Comparison of the gauge-invariant formulation for l=0,1-mode perturbations on the Schwarzschild background spacetime proposed in [K. Nakamura, Class. Quantum Grav. 38 (2021), 145010.] and a “conventional complete gauge-fixing approach” in which we use the spherical harmonic functions Ylm as the scalar harmonics from the starting point is discussed. Although it is often said that “gauge-invariant formulations in general-relativistic perturbations are equivalent to complete gauge-fixing approaches,” as the result of this comparison, we conclude that the derived solutions through the proposed gauge-invariant formulation and those through a “conventional complete gauge-fixing approach” are different. It is pointed out that there is a case where the boundary conditions and initial conditions are restricted in a conventional complete gauge-fixing approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cef7ef3bebc52dab986e330a455663238b292dfa492047453e8aed2fc252332","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
