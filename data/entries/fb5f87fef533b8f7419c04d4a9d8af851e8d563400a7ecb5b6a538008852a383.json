{"title":"Enabling Microscopy for the Visually Impaired: Tactile 3D Printed Representations of Electron Micrographs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1078/7720363?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Microscopy, by nature, requires some form of “seeing,” but much like the inspiration for Braile, there are more ways to see than just eyes. This work set out to expand the limited view of microscopy by 3D printing TEM images to allow anyone to see materials with more than their eyes. With this way of being able to feel an image, it expands material science to a new audience for visually-impaired people to experience electron microscopy. Previous work has explored the impact of tactile STEM education for visually-impaired students, including 3D representations of Hubble Telescope images and atomic emission lines [<a href=\"#ozae044.1078-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1078-B2\">2</a>]. However, materials science remains relatively unexplored for engaging visually-impaired students. Electron micrographs represent a 2D projection of a material, inherently limiting the ability for visually impaired students and researchers to grain understanding of micrographs. This work set out and accomplished an iterative scheme of printing electron micrographs to a 3D platform, expanding science to minds that have not yet been able to explore it.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fb5f87fef533b8f7419c04d4a9d8af851e8d563400a7ecb5b6a538008852a383","category":"Environment"}
