{"title":"Molecular Biomarkers in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1161/v1","date":1715939165000,"content":"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a cystic pulmonary disorder that has been known to primarily affect women of childbearing age. The disorder can develop with mutations in the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) genes TSC1 &amp; TSC2 but may arise by other irregular cases in the lack of these mutations. LAM can manifest in a wide variety of ways and generally compounded in symptoms of other lung disorders such as bronchitis, emphysema, &amp; asthma.  However, due to lack of effective diagnostic methods, biomarkers of LAM leading to a treatment for the disorder are currently unmet. Using integrative dating analytics and bioinformatics approaches; this study used publicly available microarray data to identify biomarkers in LAM. The results showed important differential expressed genes (DEGs) including: CDH2, CXCL6, ANXA10, MFAP5, RPS4Y1, DCBLD2, PAPPA, TFPI2, SERPINE1, LOX, MYH11, RGS1, SEPP1, TMOD1, ID1, SFTPB, CDH1, HTR2B, OGN, and IGLC1. Furthermore, gene â€“ network and gene ontology (GO) analysis were conducted to show the importance of these genes from a molecular understanding. Taken together, the results revealed could serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers with LAM patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d59204f909cb98fb059ed0ff355b189d09e57f0f409faa475705925f04538e9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
