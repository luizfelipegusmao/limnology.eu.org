{"title":"Integration of CBL-PBL Teaching Method with Scenario Simulation for Enhanced Midwifery Training in Postpartum Hemorrhage: A Quasi-experimental Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2345/v1","date":1722263436000,"content":"Background \nPostpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains the leading cause of maternal mortality globally, necessitating focused attention from midwifery professionals. To mitigate severe complications and improve maternal outcomes, regular and effective training in PPH rescue techniques is essential.\nAim \nTo assess the efficacy of the combination of case-based learning (CBL) and problem-based learning (PBL) with simulation teaching methods to enhance the technical proficiency of midwifery trainees in managing PPH\nMethods \nThis quasi-experimental study included 76 trainees who received PPH training at Peking University Third Hospital from March to July 2023; they were divided into two groups: the control group (n = 50), which followed traditional simulation training methods, and the research group (n = 26), which used a combination of CBL-PBL and scenario simulation. After training, all participants completed a questionnaire to evaluate their satisfaction with the training program and to measure improvements in clinical thinking, practical skills, relevant knowledge, team cooperation, and management abilities. Statistical analysis was conducted using unpaired t-tests and chi-square tests to compare the groups.\nFindings \nThe combination of CBL-PBL with scenario simulation was found to be highly satisfactory compared with the traditional simulation training. This approach significantly enhanced self-assessed skills among midwifery trainees in the research group. Additionally, a majority of trainees expressed a preference for the inclusion of regular simulation exercises and detailed discussions on PPH cases in future training sessions.\nConclusion \nCombining CBL-PBL with simulation practice is a more effective teaching method for PPH management training than traditional methods. Future studies should explore the implementation of regular PPH rescue skill training and its effectiveness in real clinical settings to substantiate these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5244fa44268cbd24208ce01d308050c6f31357dd13af587daa7d4c442b14fd13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
