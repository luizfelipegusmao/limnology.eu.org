{"title":"The Impact of a 6-Week Nordic Walking Training Cycle and a 14-Hour Intermittent Fasting on Disease Activity Markers and Serum Levels of Wnt Pathway-Associated Proteins in Patients with Multiple Myeloma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0304/v1","date":1712147223000,"content":"Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for about 10 to 15% of all diagnosed hematologic malignancies and about 1-2% of all cancer cases. Approximately 80-90% of MM patients develop bone disease and the changes rarely regress. It is only possible to stop or slow their progression. A major role in bone destruction in MM is attributed to the Wnt signaling pathway, and its action can be modified by various types of interventions including training and diet. Therefore, the aim of this project was to evaluate the effects of a Nordic Walking (NW) training cycle and intermittent fasting (IF) on the levels of selected bone turnover markers associated with the Wnt pathway in patients with MM.\nResults from 35 patients divided into training (NW and IF NW) and non-training (IF and control) groups were included in the analysis. A 6-week training cycle involving 60-minute workouts 3 times a week was conducted. Body mass and composition and the levels of: vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus, beta2-microglobulin and albumin were examined before and after completion of training cycle. Markers of bone turnover were also determined: sclerostin (SOST), Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1), osteoprotegrin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN) and Tartrate-resistant acid phos-phatase 5b (TRACP 5b).\nThere was no negative effect of IF or combined training and fasting on the nutritional status of the patients (the level of albumines was unchanged). Both training groups showed an increase in serum concentrations of the active metabolite of vitamin D (IF NW and NW: p=0.001 and p=0.022, re-spectively). The change in the concentration of this vitamin negatively correlated with the con-centration of TRACP 5b (r=-0.413, p=0.014). Evaluating the concentrations of markers related to bone turnover, a reduction in the concentrations of SOST (time: p=0.026, time vs. group: p=0.033) and TRACP 5b (time: p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5071308d76ac32e606dd0c5244681a428e707f8c36d243daea683d7fdb43835e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
