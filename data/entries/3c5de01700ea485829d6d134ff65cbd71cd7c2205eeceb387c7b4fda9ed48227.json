{"title":"Chasing Down Leads: Imaging Conductivity Networks in a FinFET Processor","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.072/7719383?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is the standard tool for high-resolution imaging of semiconductor devices, including modern silicon-based transistors. Contrast in standard TEM primarily shows the physical and compositional structure of devices. Scanning TEM electron beam-induced current (STEM EBIC) imaging, on the other hand, shows electronic structure. EBIC imaging can visualize electric fields [<a href=\"#ozae044.072-B1\">1</a>] and, via recent advances [<a href=\"#ozae044.072-B2\">2</a>], electrical conductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.072-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.072-B4\">4</a>] at high resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.072-B5\">5</a>]. However, sample preparation can be a major challenge as these EBIC contrast modes require two or more electrical connections to the device. For an electron-transparent sample extracted from a modern CPU, for instance, directly contacting the individual terminals of a single transistor is difficult. Here we demonstrate EBIC collection from regions on a device that are nominally isolated. We see a surprisingly intricate conductivity network extending down from the metal layers and up from the substrate/device layer. Connecting to such a network enables STEM EBIC imaging of many transistors in a lamella simultaneously. Thus, it is not necessary to contact the transistors individually.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3c5de01700ea485829d6d134ff65cbd71cd7c2205eeceb387c7b4fda9ed48227","category":"Environment"}
