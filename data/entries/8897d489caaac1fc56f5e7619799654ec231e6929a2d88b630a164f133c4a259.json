{"title":"Biomimetic Elastomeric Conductive Coatings for the iCub Robotic Skin and the Hannes Prosthetic Hand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1027/v1","date":1726148510000,"content":"A biobased and conductive ink composed of elastomeric vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymer (PVAc-VL) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) has been developed to create stretchable and flexible tactile devices (taxels) for robotics and prosthetics applications. The ink can be sprayed onto elastomeric surfaces (Ecoflex) to produce an electronic skin for applications such as the iCub robot and the Hannes prosthetic hand. Electron microscopy analysis confirms good dispersion of the CNF within the ink, and the ink remains conductive even after 150 mechanical cycles of stretching up to 25% and unloading. Compression tests up to 50% deformation show a small influence on the coating, and stretching cycles allow for rearrangement of the CNF, improving the electrical behaviour due to mechanical energy dissipation. The measured electrical performance exhibits a twofold increase in the R/R0 ratio, succeeded by a rapid decline (recovery), and eventually stabilizes near the initial value, indicating enhanced electronic performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8897d489caaac1fc56f5e7619799654ec231e6929a2d88b630a164f133c4a259","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
