{"title":"Simultaneous knockout of cytosolic and plastidial disproportionating enzymes disrupts grain setting and filling in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1391/7721313?rss=1","date":1721952000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) plants contain plastidial and cytosolic disproportionating enzymes (DPE1 and DPE2). Our previous studies showed that DPE2 acts on maltose, the major product of starch degradation in pollens, releasing one glucose to fuel pollen tube growth and fertilization, whereas DPE1 participates in endosperm starch synthesis by transferring maltooligosyl groups from amylose to amylopectin, and removing excess short maltooligosaccharides. However, little is known about their integrated function. Here, we report that the coordinated actions of DPE1 and DPE2 contribute to grain setting and filling in rice. The <span>dpe1dpe2</span> mutants could not be isolated from the progeny of heterozygous parental plants but were obtained via anther culture. Unlike that reported in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) and potato (<span>Solanum tuberosum</span>), the <span>dpe1dpe2</span> rice plants grew normally but only yielded a small number of empty, unfilled seeds. In the <span>dpe1dpe2</span> seeds, nutrient accumulation was substantially reduced, and dorsal vascular bundles were also severely malnourished. Zymogram analyses showed that changes in the activities of the major starch-synthesizing enzymes matched well with various endosperm phenotypes of mutant seeds. Mechanistically, DPE1 deficiency allowed normal starch mobilization in leaves and pollens but affected starch synthesis in endosperm, while DPE2 deficiency blocked starch degradation, resulting in substantially decreased levels of the sugars available for pollen tube growth and grain filling. Overall, our results demonstrate the great potential of DPE1-DPE2 as an important regulatory module to realize higher crop yields and present a promising target for regulating nutrient accumulation in cereal crop endosperm.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"2d1d637a4af24c78974ded915e1db8cfcd4b96d6876f14e20cb2c4f62f7458f7","category":"Environment"}
