{"title":"Mentoring practices that predict doctoral student outcomes in a biological sciences cohort","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305367","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Reena Debray, Emily A. Dewald-Wang, Katherine K. Ennis</p>\r\n\r\nDespite the importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint advising from faculty as a critical component of graduate student experiences and productivity. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention–not just recruitment–to best prepare students for success in scientific careers.","author":"Reena Debray","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c84fbbfca789b5d1a4065fec54fec73cce3b0c44f4edd0f44747c7560daac3de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
