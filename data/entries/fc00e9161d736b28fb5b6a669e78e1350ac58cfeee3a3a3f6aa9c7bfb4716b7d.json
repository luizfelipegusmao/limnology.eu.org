{"title":"A small landslide induced a large disaster prior to the heavy rainy season in Jinkouhe, Sichuan, China: characteristics, mechanism, and lessons","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10346-024-02213-z","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Small-scale landslides that occur at unexpected locations and seasons can cause severe losses of life and property. Unusually, the Shidang landslide occurred prior to the rainy season in Jinkouhe County, Sichuan Province, China, resulting in 19 deaths and missing persons. In this paper, landslide characteristics and causes are revealed through a field investigation, laboratory experiments, and numerical calculations. The results show that the Shidang landslide was a small-scale landslide with a total volume of approximately 19500 m<sup>3</sup>, originating from hollow colluvial deposits. The geomorphological hollow above the landslide provided topographic conditions for the collection of subsurface runoff. Groundwater flow was transported downward along dolomite and accumulated in the area above shale, with a low conductivity. Groundwater table rise combined with the decrease in the soil strength led to landslide occurrence. Improper siting of residential areas and insufficient vigilance against post-rainfall landslides caused this tragedy. Considering the post-disaster lessons, it is strongly recommended that in the future, more attention should be given to the investigation of landslides triggered by groundwater, especially in determining landslide hydrological system boundaries. In mountainous areas where the developable space is limited, areas with hollow landforms are potentially at risk of geohazards. This paper could provide a reference for the prevention and management of similar landslides and new insights for updating landslide investigation systems and residential housing plans.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"fc00e9161d736b28fb5b6a669e78e1350ac58cfeee3a3a3f6aa9c7bfb4716b7d","category":"Environment"}
