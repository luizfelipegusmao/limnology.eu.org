{"title":"And Justice for All. Organizational Justice &ndash; a Coherent Path to Organizational Sustainability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1186/v1","date":1710919500000,"content":"Job characteristics shape organizational sustainability, conferring tangible benefits to employees. Job characteristics shape attitudes toward work, such as satisfaction and engagement, and are related to the well-being and health of employees. The aim of the study was to determine and describe the role of work engagement and support at work in the relation between selected job characteristics (organizational justice, job control, and role clarity) and self-rated health. The study was conducted on a sample of 368 employees representing various industries. The study used: Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), Organizational Justice Survey, Coworker Support Scale, Supervisor Support Scale, Role Clarity Scale, Job Control Scale. Cantril ladder was used to measure self-rated health. The presented study established the importance of lower scores on the UWES subscale: dedication as a significant moderator of the examined correlations. In relation to the correlation: justice and its dimensions, and self-rated health, support from supervisors showed a greater effect than that from coworkers. The conducted study expands knowledge on the formation of employees' self-rated health through the sense of justice experienced within the organization. The results obtained are applicable to organizational practice. This finding highlights the importance of supporting organizational justice, which contributes to employee well-being (particularly when combined with high levels of work engagement and supervisor support) and ultimately increases organizational sustainability. Further research can be continued taking into account the limitations of the previous procedure of selecting people for the study and the measurement tools used.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"816cbf42214f8d5a98e6827840325b3ab086c08b66d0c03c816bd3b518573765","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
