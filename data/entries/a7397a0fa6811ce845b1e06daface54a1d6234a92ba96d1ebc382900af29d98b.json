However, their future fodder production is highly uncertain under climate change: While an extended growing season may be beneficial, more frequent and intense summer droughts could also reduce fodder quantity and quality. Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are another major driver of grassland biomass production, but combined effects of future land use transitions and climate change are rarely quantified.\n\nWe modelled combined climate and LULC scenarios for grassland production of the Maurienne Valley (French Alps) by 2085. We built a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) from long-term grassland production monitoring data complemented with expert knowledge. We assessed the potential of two candidate adaptations, intensification as an incremental solution and silvopastoralism as a transformative solution to compensate combined impacts of two climate scenarios and three land use change scenarios.\n\nTotal biomass production was far more sensitive to LULC than to climate scenarios. Production losses were largest under the conservation LULC scenario (−28% on average between 2020 and 2085), followed by the tourism development scenario (−7%) and the business-as-usual scenario (+3%). Climate change under representative concentration pathways (RCP) 8.5 altered the seasonality of production by increasing potential production from May to July while decreasing summer regrowth.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: Changes in LULC are more decisive for global biomass production than climate change. However, under the most extreme climate change scenario (RCP8.5), the seasonal shift in production and increased interannual variability threaten the current grass-based protected designation of origin (PDO) production system. Only the intensification adaptation solution showed significant gains in total biomass production. Still, the silvopastoralism would require less investment compared to the intensification and have a similar efficiency when assessing the gains of biomass by the surface concerned with adaptation solutions. Along with decreased total annual production due to decreasing grassland area compounded by more extreme climate change, the seasonal shift in production and increased interannual variability threaten the current grass-based PDO production system. Further Bayesian modelling co-developed with local stakeholders and experts could greatly contribute to adaptation planning of the regional production system.\n</p>","author":"Nicolas Elleaume, \nBruno Locatelli, \nJohan Oszwald, \nEmilie Crouzat, \nSandra Lavorel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"a7397a0fa6811ce845b1e06daface54a1d6234a92ba96d1ebc382900af29d98b","category":"Environment"}
