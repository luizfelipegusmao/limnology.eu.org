ATPSs have attracted significant interest in applications for formulating carriers (microparticles, nanoparticles, hydrogels, and polymersomes) which can be prepared using the spontaneous phase separation of ATPSs as a driving force, and loaded with a wide range of bioactive materials, including small molecule drugs, proteins, and cells, for delivery applications. This review provides a detailed analysis of various ATPSs, including strategies employed for particle formation, polymerization of droplets in ATPSs, phase-guided block copolymer assemblies, and stimulus-responsive carriers. Processes for loading various bioactive payloads are discussed, and applications of these systems for drug delivery are summarized and discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"332176be29232fa5073aeeca2aea1d7c6a95e0d5f09f4ab7fa38dc60c5806194","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
