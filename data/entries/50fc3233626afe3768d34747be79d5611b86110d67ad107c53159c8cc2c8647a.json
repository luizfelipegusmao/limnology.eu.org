{"title":"BIM-Based Strategies for the Revitalization and Automated Management of Buildings: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1874/v1","date":1719398635000,"content":"This study explores the transformative potential of integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Generative Design methodologies in heritage conservation and building management. By utilizing BIM, detailed architectural, structural, and MEP models were created, facilitating precise design and effective stakeholder collaboration. Generative Design enabled the exploration of multiple design solutions, optimizing spatial layouts and structural integrity. The project also integrated automated management systems and IoT sensors to enhance real-time monitoring, energy efficiency, and user comfort through the development of a digital twin. Despite encountering challenges such as technical complexities and budget constraints, the project successfully preserved the cinema's historical essence while incorporating modern functionalities. The findings highlight the contributions of BIM and Generative Design to the AEC industry, emphasizing their role in improving design accuracy, operational efficiency, and sustainability. This research provides valuable insights for future projects in heritage conservation, offering a blueprint for balancing historical preservation with contemporary needs. The revitalization of the \"Ex Cinema Santa Barbara\" in Patern√≤ exemplifies these advancements, demonstrating how these technologies can restore and modernize culturally significant historical buildings effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50fc3233626afe3768d34747be79d5611b86110d67ad107c53159c8cc2c8647a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
