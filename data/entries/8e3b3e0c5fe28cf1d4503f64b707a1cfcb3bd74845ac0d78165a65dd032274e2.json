{"title":"Oxidative and Excitatory Neurotoxic Stresses in CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Kynurenine Aminotransferase Knock-Out Mice: A Novel Model for Experience-Based Depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disordertabolism: Insights From Novel Kynurenine Aminotransferase","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.0094/v5","date":1715066870000,"content":"Memory and emotion are highly vulnerable to psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been linked to serotonin (5-HT) metabolism disruptions. In fact, over 90% of the 5-HT precursor tryptophan (Trp) is metabolized via the Trp-kynurenine (KYN) meta-bolic pathway, producing a variety of bioactive molecules. The aadat (kat2) gene encodes mito-chondrial kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) isotype 2, responsible for kynurenic acid (KYNA) production. Little is known about its role in behavior. In CRISPR/Cas9-induced aadat knockout (kat2−/−) mice, we examined the effects on emotion, memory, motor function, Trp and its metabolite levels, enzyme activities in the plasma and the urine of 8-week-old males compared to wild-type mice. Transgenic mice showed more depressive-like behaviors in the forced swim test, but not in the tail suspension, anxiety, or memory tests. They also had fewer center field and corner entries, shorter walking distances, and fewer jumping counts in the open field test. Plasma metabolite levels are generally consistent with those of urine: KYN, antioxidant KYNs, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, and indole-3-acetic acid levels are lower; enzyme activities in KATs, kynureninase, and monoamine oxidase/aldehyde dehydrogenase are lower, but kynurenine 3-monooxygenase is higher; and ox-idative stress and excitotoxicity indices are higher. Transgenic mice show depression-like behavior in a learned helplessness model, emotional indifference, and motor deficits, coupled with a decrease in KYNA, a shift of Trp metabolism toward the KYN-3-HK pathway, and a partial decrease in the gut microbial Trp-indole pathway metabolite. This is the first evidence that deleting the aadat gene causes depression-like behaviors that are unique to despair experience, which appears to be linked to excitatory neurotoxic and oxidative stresses. This may lead to the development of a double-hit preclinical model in experience-based depression, better understanding of these complex condi-tions, and more effective therapeutic strategies by elucidating the relationship between Trp me-tabolism and PTSD pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e3b3e0c5fe28cf1d4503f64b707a1cfcb3bd74845ac0d78165a65dd032274e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
