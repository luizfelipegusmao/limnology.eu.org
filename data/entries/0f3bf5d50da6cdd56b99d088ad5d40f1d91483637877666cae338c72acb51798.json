In recent years, the study of these materials has expanded to include 2D magnets, a class of materials whose magnetic order is intrinsically correlated to its atomic structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.813-B2\">2</a>]. This correlation can be exploited by making controlled changes to the atomic structure of the 2D magnet, thereby patterning different magnetic ordering in the material [<a href=\"#ozae044.813-B3\">3</a>]. A 2D magnet that is particularly well suited for study into the effects of defects and artificial phase changes on spin structure is CrSBr. CrSBr is an air stable, van der Waals semiconductor (see Figure 1a) that has ferromagnetic single layers stacked with anti-ferromagnetic ordering with the magnetic moment of the system situated at the Cr atoms [<a href=\"#ozae044.813-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0f3bf5d50da6cdd56b99d088ad5d40f1d91483637877666cae338c72acb51798","category":"Environment"}
