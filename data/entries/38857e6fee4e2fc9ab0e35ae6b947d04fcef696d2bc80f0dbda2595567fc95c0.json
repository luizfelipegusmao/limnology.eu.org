{"title":"A natural language processing model for the development of an Italian-language chatbot for Public Administration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1859/v1","date":1719393594000,"content":"Natural language processing model (NLP) are used in chatbots to understand user input, interpret its meaning, and generate conversational responses to provide immediate and consistent assistance. This reduces problem-solving time and staff workload and increases user satisfaction. There are both rule-based chatbots, which use decision trees and are programmed to answer specific questions, and self-learning chatbots, which can handle more complex conversations through continuous learning about data and user interactions. However, only a few chatbots have been developed specifically for the Italian language. This work proposes an NLP model to develop a powerful and efficient Italian QA (Question Answering) chatbot that is easy to use for Italian Public Administration (PA). The proposed model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) architecture, where an Encoder/Decoder module and a Highway Network module have been added to perform more efficient filtering of input text. The Italian version of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD-IT) is used to test the proposed model. The proposed model is one of the first models developed for Italian language-specific chatbots.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38857e6fee4e2fc9ab0e35ae6b947d04fcef696d2bc80f0dbda2595567fc95c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
