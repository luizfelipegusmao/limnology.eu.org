{"title":"Abnormal expression of natural mating behaviour of captive adult giant pandas is related to physiological stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae061/7749845?rss=1","date":1725494400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During <span>ex situ</span> conservation, the adaptability of giant pandas to environmental changes is greatly challenged. The issue of natural reproduction in captive giant pandas remains unresolved both domestically and internationally. It hypothesized that the restricted natural reproductive capacity may be linked to abnormal mating behavior expression due to physiological stress resulting from incompatible pairings in confined environments. To test this hypothesis, we utilized ultra-high performance liquid chromatographytandem quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) to analyse urine metabolites in captive adult giant pandas during their breeding period. Simultaneously, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to measure the levels of cortisol and epinephrine in urine, providing insight into the psychological state of captive giant pandas during mate selection by examining all metabolites and related biochemical pathways. This comprehensive approach aims to fully elucidate the physiological mechanisms underlying the decline in natural reproductive capacity. The metabolomics findings indicate that the aberrant expression of natural mating behaviour in captive adult male and female giant pandas may be associated with dysfunction in amino acid metabolic pathways. The activation of these metabolic pathways is linked to psychological stress, such as the tryptophan metabolic pathway and GABAergic synapse pathway. The results of physiological indicators indicate a significant correlation between the expression of natural mating behaviour in captive adult pandas and the hormone urine cortisol, which is associated with physiological stress. These findings indicate that the atypical manifestation of natural mating behaviour in captive adult giant pandas may be associated with physiological stress induced by incompatible pairings within confined environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"f40b6d06d9c2e00040d8efd307d8098b5fbbcd150177c4281f6ab58d2927177d","category":"Environment"}
