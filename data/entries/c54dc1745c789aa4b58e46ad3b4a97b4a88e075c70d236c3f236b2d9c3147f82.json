{"title":"Circulating RKIP and pRKIP Might Be Novel Potential Biomarkers of Early-Stage Lung Cancer: Results from a Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0765/v1","date":1712837593000,"content":"Lung cancer remains the main cause of global cancer-related deaths. Currently low-dose computed tomography (LD-CT) shows a 20% reduction of mortality. However, its clinical suitability is hindered by cost, radiation, and some false positives. Thus, the discovery non-invasive and less-expensive biomarker is urgent needed. In this scenario, proteins released in biological fluids could be considered interesting biomarkers for their role in cancer development. We conducted a pioneering case-control pilot study aimed at assessing the usefulness of Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP) and its phosphorylated form (pRKIP) as potential early-stage lung cancer biomarkers. Urine and Blood samples of two consecutive and independent cohorts of lung cancer patients and healthy controls were screened by means of a novel experimental ELISA assay designed to evaluate both forms of the biomarker. Although urinary levels of RKIP were not statistically different between the lung cancer group and high-risk healthy group, serum ones instead increased significantly in early stage LC patients and permitted to discriminate LC patients from both low-risk (HS) and high-risk healthy subjects (HR-HS) with an overall 93% accuracy (AUC 0.93) when LC was compared to HS and 74% (AUC 0.73) when it was compared to high-risk group. Of note, the analysis of RKIP/pRKIP ratio also showed a high accuracy (90% - AUC 0.95) in discriminating LC patients from HS and more importantly, it allowed to identify LC patients compared to HR-HS, with a higher accuracy (79% - AUC 0.79) than RKIP alone. We hypothesize that serum RKIP levels may be correlated to the activation of the immune systems against the tumor during the first phases of its development. Our study identified a preliminary, non-invasive, RKIP and pRKIP profile able to discriminate with high specificity and sensitivity the early-stage lung cancer patients from high-risk Healthy Subjects. These results, although preliminary, suggest the utility of measuring RKIP/pRKIP as potential new screening test for lung cancer and provide the basis for future validation studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c54dc1745c789aa4b58e46ad3b4a97b4a88e075c70d236c3f236b2d9c3147f82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
