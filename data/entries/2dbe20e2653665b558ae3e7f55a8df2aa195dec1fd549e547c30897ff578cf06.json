{"title":"Vertebral and femoral Bone Mineral Density (BMD) assessment with Dual-Energy CT versus DXA scan in post-menopausal females","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0893/v1","date":1710484825000,"content":"This study aimed to demonstrate the potential role of Dual Energy CT in assessing Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. A retrospective study was conducted on 51 postmenopausal female patients who underwent DXA and DECT examinations for other clinical reasons. DECT images were acquired with spectral imaging using a 256-slice system. These images were processed and visualized using an HAP(fat) map. Statistical analysis was performed using the Bland-Altman method to assess agreement between DXA and DECT HAP(fat) measurements. Mean BMD, vertebral and femoral T-scores were obtained. For vertebral analysis, the Bland-Altman plot showed an inverse correlation (R2: -0.042; RMSE: 0.690) between T-scores and DECT HAP(fat) values for measurements from L1 to L4, while a good linear correlation (R2: 0.341; RMSE: 0.589) it was found for measurements at the femoral neck. In conclusion, we demonstrated the enhanced accuracy of BMD calculation through DECT, finding a statistically significant correlation only at the femoral neck where BMD results do not seem to be influenced by the overlap of the measurements on cortical and trabecular bone. This outcome could be beneficial in the future by reducing radiation exposure for patients already undergoing follow-up for chronic conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dbe20e2653665b558ae3e7f55a8df2aa195dec1fd549e547c30897ff578cf06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
