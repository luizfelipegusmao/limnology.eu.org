{"title":"Do maternal BMI and gestational weight gain equally affect the risk of infant hypoxic and traumatic events?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308441","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Giuseppe Chiossi, Riccardo Cuoghi Costantini, Daniela Menichini, Anna Luna Tramontano, Marialaura Diamanti, Fabio Facchinetti, Roberto D’Amico</p>\r\nBackground <p>Small (SGA) and large (LGA) for gestational age infants have higher risks of infant morbidity when compared to those who are appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Increasing pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with higher risks of LGA and lower risks of SGA infants; however, their direct effects on infant morbidity are unknown. Therefore, we intended to 1) assess how maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG, and birthweight (categorized as SGA, AGA or LGA) affect infant morbidity and 2) estimate at entry of care the risk of infant morbidity according to pre-pregnancy BMI and possible GWG.</p> Methods <p>we used Consortium on Safe Labor data, a retrospective observational cohort study collecting pregnancy and birth data from 2002 to 2008 in 12 US centers. The association between maternal BMI, GWG and infant morbidity was estimated in singleton gestations delivering ≥ 37 weeks using binomial logistic regression. Hypoxic composite neonatal morbidity was defined as any the following: stillbirth, neonatal death, resuscitation at birth, NICU admission, intracranial hemorrhage, PVH grade III and IV, neonatal seizures, NEC, meconium aspiration, CPAP or mechanical ventilation, RDS, and sepsis. Traumatic composite neonatal morbidity included shoulder dystocia or birth injuries.</p> Results <p>In this study of 110,594 mother-infant dyads, a total of 8,369 (7.6%) infants experienced hypoxic, while 2,134 (1.9%) developed traumatic morbidity. The risk of hypoxic morbidity among SGA, AGA and LGA infants increased when mothers were overweight (aOR 1.26 [95%CI 1.18–1.34]) or obese (class 1: aOR 1.3 [1.2–1.4]; class 2: aOR 1.7 [1.5–1.9]; class 3: aOR 1.8 [1.6–2]) as opposed to normal weight, and when GWG exceeded (aOR 1.08 [1.02–1.014]) rather than remained within recommendations. The risk of traumatic morbidity increased with maternal obesity (class 1: aOR 1.3 [1.1–1.5]), whilst it dropped with GWG below recommendations (aOR 0.7 [0.6–0.8]). The risk of hypoxic events estimated at entry of care increased with maternal overweight (aOR 1.27 [1.19–1.35]) or obesity (class 1: aOR 1.4 [1.2–1.5]; class 2: aOR 1.7 [1.5–1.9]; class 3: aOR 1.8 [1.6–2.1]), and with possible GWG above (aOR 1.09 [1.03–1.015]) recommendations. The risk of traumatic morbidity increased with overweight (aOR 1.1 [1–1.3]) or obesity (class 1: aOR 1.4 [1.2–1.6]; class 2: aOR 1.3 [1–1.6]), with possible GWG above (aOR 1.2 [1–1.3]), as opposed to below recommendations (aOR 0.7 [0.6–0.8]).</p> Conclusions <p>While maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG equally affected traumatic morbidity, the former had a greater impact on hypoxic complications. Therefore, weight control prior to pregnancy is at least as effective as avoiding excessive gestational weight gain to prevent neonatal morbidity.</p>","author":"Giuseppe Chiossi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3ab61c2b441cd14cf5fda29cf7f04388d30106251b75b2b6915fda13e1b40cd6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
