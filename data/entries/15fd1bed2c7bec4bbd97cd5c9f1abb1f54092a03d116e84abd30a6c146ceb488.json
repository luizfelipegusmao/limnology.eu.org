{"title":"A Novel Approach for Reducing Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections in Intermittent Catheter Users","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0673/v1","date":1723198436000,"content":"Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are a recurring problem for individuals with neurogenic bladder who rely on frequent intermittent catheterization. Dysbiosis of the urine microbiome, characterized by the presence of pathogenic organisms and insufficient levels of Lactobacilli, is common in this population. We propose that introducing beneficial Lactobacilli via a catheter lubricant could act as a prophylactic \"live barrier\" to enhance beneficial bacteria in the urethra. The IC TF1 Catheter Lubricant gel discussed in this study is a freshly prepared viscous gel composed of sterile gelling components and a dry Lactobacillus Rhamnosus spp. powder. The gel prepared on- site by simple mixing, is usable for 24 hours with predictable and precise viability counts. Our investigation focuses on the design, physical attributes, manufacturability with quality control criteria, stability of probiotic viability, antimicrobial properties, cellular toxicity, and tissue compatibility of the IC TF1 gel. The gel demonstrates promising physical properties and biocompatibility, leading to the need for further pre-clinical and human trials to assess its safety and effectiveness in reducing pathogenic urethral colonization.The localized delivery of probiotic supplementation through catheter lubrication has the potential to enhance the well-being of individuals with neurogenic bladder and aid in the management of CAUTI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15fd1bed2c7bec4bbd97cd5c9f1abb1f54092a03d116e84abd30a6c146ceb488","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
