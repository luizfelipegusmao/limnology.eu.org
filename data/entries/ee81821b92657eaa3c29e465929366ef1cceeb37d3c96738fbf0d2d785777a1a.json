{"title":"Additively Manufactured Flexible EGaIn Sensor for Dynamic Detection and Sensing on Ultracurved Surfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0414/v1","date":1720079162000,"content":"Electronic skin is widely employed in multiple applications such as health monitoring, robot tactile perception, and bionic prosthetics. In this study, we fabricated millimeter-scale electronic skin featuring compact sensing units using Boston Micro Fabrication S130 (a high-precision additive manufacturing device) and the template removal method. We used a gallium-based liquid metal and achieved an inner channel diameter of 0.1 mm. The size of the sensing unit was 3 × 3 mm². This unit exhibited a wide linear sensing range (10–22000 Pa) and high pressure resolution (10 Pa) even on an ultracurved surface (radius of curvature was 6 mm). Sliding was successfully detected at speeds of 8–54 mm/s. An artificial nose with nine sensing units was fabricated, and it exhibited excellent multitouch and sliding trajectory recognition capabilities. This confirmed that the electronic skin functioned normally even on an ultracurved surface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee81821b92657eaa3c29e465929366ef1cceeb37d3c96738fbf0d2d785777a1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
