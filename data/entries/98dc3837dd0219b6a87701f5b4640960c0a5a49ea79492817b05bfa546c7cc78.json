{"title":"Effect of temperature on the protective efficacy of a live attenuated vaccine against herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis in goldfish","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13906?af=R","date":1709960884000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The live attenuated vaccine P7-P8 strain against herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis, which is caused by cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2), exhibits high protective efficacy in goldfish at 25°C, the predominant temperature for this disease; however, the effect of water temperature during the vaccination period on efficacy has not been determined. In this study, an <i>in vitro</i> experiment revealed that the vaccine strain grew between 15 and 30°C in the goldfish cell line RyuF-2. Subsequent <i>in vivo</i> efficacy tests were conducted with vaccination temperatures ranging from 15 to 30°C. During the vaccination period, organs were sampled to determine the vaccine growth dynamics. Blood plasma was collected to assess anti-CyHV-2 antibody titres. The protective efficacy of the vaccine at 15, 20, 25, and 30°C after subsequent virulent CyHV-2 challenge resulted in a relative percentage survival of 73.3%, 77.8%, 100%, and 77.8%, respectively, which indicated that the vaccine is effective over this temperature range. The vaccine virus load in the spleen was lowest at 15°C (10<sup>3.7</sup> DNA copies/mg) and highest at 25°C (10<sup>6.5</sup> DNA copies/mg). This indicates that the vaccine virus load over 10<sup>4</sup> DNA copies/mg may elicit sufficient acquired immunity. No significant differences in antibody titre were observed between groups, which suggests that cell-mediated immunity can be fundamentally involved in protection.</p>","author":"Hiroaki Saito, \nShungo Minami, \nManami Yuguchi, \nAiko Shitara, \nHidehiro Kondo, \nGoshi Kato, \nMotohiko Sano","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"98dc3837dd0219b6a87701f5b4640960c0a5a49ea79492817b05bfa546c7cc78","category":"Environment"}
