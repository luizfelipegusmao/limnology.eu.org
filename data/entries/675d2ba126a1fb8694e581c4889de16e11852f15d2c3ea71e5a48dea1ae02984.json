{"title":"Recyclability of Fire Retarded Biobased Polyamide 11 (PA11) Composites with Basalt Fibers (BF) and Intumescent Fire Retardants (IFR): The Influence of Reprocessing on Structure, Properties and Fire Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0772/v1","date":1718172540000,"content":"The growing requirements regarding the safety of using polymers and their composites are related to the emergence of more effective, sustainable, and hazardous-limited fire retardants (FR). Significant amounts of FR are usually required to effectively affect the polymer burning behavior, while the knowledge of their recycling potential is still insufficient. At the same time, concerns are related not only to the reduced effectiveness of flame retardancy but, above all, to the potential deterioration of mechanical properties caused by the degradation of temperature-affected additives under processing conditions. This study describes the impact of four-time reprocessing of bio-based polyamide 11 (PA11) modified with an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system composed of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), melamine cyanurate (MC) and pentaerythritol (PER) and its composites containing additionally short basalt fibers (BF). Composites manufactured by twin-screw extrusion were subjected to four reprocessing cycles by injection molding, comprehensively analyzing structural, mechanical, and fire behavior changes in each cycle. The obtained results confirmed the safety of using the proposed flame-retardant system for polyamide, processed under the recommended process parameters, without the risk of significant changes in the structure despite the partial increase in flammability caused mainly by the degradation of the polymer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"675d2ba126a1fb8694e581c4889de16e11852f15d2c3ea71e5a48dea1ae02984","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
