{"title":"Market Potential of Applying Autonomous Vehicles in the Shared Mobility Market: Opportunities and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0201/v1","date":1719909369000,"content":"The rapid growth of the sharing economy has propelled shared mobility to the forefront of attention. The continuous advancement of autonomous driving technology also brings new opportunities and challenges to the shared mobility market. This study comprehensively analyzes the market potential concerning autonomous vehicles (AVs) to provide shared mobility services, utilizing SWOT analysis, PESTLE analysis, and Porterâ€™s Five Forces. The findings reveal that AVs can provide improved shared mobility services by increasing transportation safety, reducing emissions, reducing costs, enhancing traffic efficiency, and increasing customer satisfaction and the profitability of shared mobility services. However, challenges such as technological and policy uncertainties, safety concerns, high initial costs, inadequate public communication infrastructure, and the absence of standardized regulations can hinder the widespread adoption of AVs. The benefits are also restricted with a low market penetration rate of AVs. To promote AVs in the shared mobility market, this study also provides implications for AV stakeholders tailored to the evolving shared mobility market dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e1c281e4e92ac0737a9a8ea61ca7a39909315ed2aa1e84b6aa8999568f0363d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
