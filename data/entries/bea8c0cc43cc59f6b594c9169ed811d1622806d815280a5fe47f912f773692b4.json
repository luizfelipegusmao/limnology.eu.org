{"title":"The transcription factors ZAT5 and BLH2/4 regulate homogalacturonan demethylesterification in Arabidopsis seed coat mucilage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4491/7718005?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The level of methylesterification alters the functional properties of pectin, which is believed to influence plant growth and development. However, the mechanisms that regulate demethylesterification remain largely unexplored. Pectin with a high degree of methylesterification is produced in the Golgi apparatus and then transferred to the primary cell wall where it is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs). Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) seed mucilage, pectin demethylesterification is negatively regulated by the transcription factor ZINC FINGER FAMILY PROTEIN5 (ZAT5). Plants carrying null mutations in <span>ZAT5</span> had increased PME activity, decreased pectin methylesterification, and produced seeds with a thinner mucilage layer. We provide evidence that ZAT5 binds to a TGATCA motif and thereby negatively regulates methylesterification by reducing the expression of <span>PME5</span>, <span>HIGHLY METHYL ESTERIFIED SEEDS</span> (<span>HMS</span>)/<span>PME6</span>, <span>PME12</span>, and <span>PME16</span>. We also demonstrate that ZAT5 physically interacts with BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN2 (BLH2) and BLH4 transcription factors. BLH2 and BLH4 are known to modulate pectin demethylesterification by directly regulating <span>PME58</span> expression. The ZAT5â€“BLH2/4 interaction provides a mechanism to control the degree of pectin methylesterification in seed coat mucilage by modifying each transcription factor's ability to regulate the expression of target genes encoding PMEs. Taken together, these findings reveal a transcriptional regulatory module comprising ZAT5, BLH2, and BLH4, that functions in modulating the demethylesterification of homogalacturonan in seed coat mucilage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"bea8c0cc43cc59f6b594c9169ed811d1622806d815280a5fe47f912f773692b4","category":"Environment"}
