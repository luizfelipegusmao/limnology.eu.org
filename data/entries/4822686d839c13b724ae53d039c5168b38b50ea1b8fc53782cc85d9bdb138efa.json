{"title":"N-acetylcysteine attenuates sodium arsenite-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in embryonic fibroblast cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae128/7731849?rss=1","date":1723507200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In recent years, the increase in environmental pollutants has been one of the most important factors threatening human and environmental health. Arsenic, a naturally occurring element found in soil, water, and air, easily enters the human body and leads to many metabolic disorders. In this study, we focused on the possible protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against sodium arsenite (As)-induced toxic effects on embryonic fibroblast cells. The effects of As and NAC treatment on cells were evaluated, including cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Embryonic fibroblast cells were exposed to As (ranging from 0.01 μM to 10 μM) and NAC (at a concentration of 2 mM) for 24 h. The assessment of cytotoxicity markers, such as cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), showed that As significantly reduced cell viability and increased LDH levels. Furthermore, we observed that As increased the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell, decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and triggered apoptosis in cells. Additionally, our research revealed that the administration of NAC mitigates the detrimental effects of As. The results showed that As exerted hazardous effects on embryonic fibroblast cells through the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this context, our study provides evidence that NAC may have a protective effect against the toxicity of As in embryonic fibroblast cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"4822686d839c13b724ae53d039c5168b38b50ea1b8fc53782cc85d9bdb138efa","category":"Environment"}
