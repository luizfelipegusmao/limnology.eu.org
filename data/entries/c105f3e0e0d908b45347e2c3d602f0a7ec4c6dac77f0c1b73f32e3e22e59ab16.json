{"title":"The association between ABO blood types and peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis for patients with cancer: A retrospective 7-year single-center experience and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305746","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Xiao-Hong Wu, Yu Xiao, Ren-Di Tian</p>\r\nBackground <p>This meta-analysis evaluated the association of ABO blood type on central venous catheter-related thrombosis (CRT).</p> Methods <p>Data were derived from 8477 patients at Sichuan Cancer Hospital from January 2015 to December 2021 and articles previously published in Chinese and English databases. Data from our hospital were collected by reviewing electronic medical records. Searched databases included CNKI, VIP, Wan Fang, China Biomedical, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, and OVID (up to July 2023). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 and Revman 5.3. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the Î± test level for reducing the risk of I errors in the multiple comparisons. A P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables were analyzed using a two-independent sample T test. The chi-squared test was used to analyze categorical data.</p> Results <p>A total of 818 studies were identified in the search. However, only four studies met the inclusion criteria. Combined with data from our hospital, five studies were included with a total of 18407 cases. Those studies only focused on peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). According to the data from our hospital, logistic regression revealed that myelosuppression [odds ratio (OR), 1.473; P = 0.005) and radiotherapy(OR, 1.524; P&lt;0.001) were independent risk factors for symptomatic PICC- VTE. Blood types A (OR, 1.404; P = 0.008), B (OR, 1.393; P = 0.016), and AB (OR, 1.861; P&lt;0.001) were associated with a significantly higher risk of symptomatic PICC-VTE than blood type O. And the hematologic tumor has a significantly higher risk of PICC-VTE than breast cancer (OR, 0.149; P &lt; 0.001), and gynecological tumor (OR, 0.386; P = 0.002). In the meta-analysis of the association between ABO blood type and PICC related thrombosis, the I2 statistic was not significant in any of the pairwise comparisons, and a fixed-effects model was subsequently used for all analyses. The meta-analysis indicated that the incidence of symptomatic PICC related thrombosis was significantly lower in individuals with the O blood type (3.30%) than in those with the A (4.92%), B (5.20%), or AB (6.58%) blood types (all P &lt; 0.0083). However, in the pairwise comparisons among A, B, and AB, the differences were nonsignificant (P &gt; 0.0083).</p> Conclusions <p>According to the results from our single center analysis, we found that myelosuppression, radiotherapy, hematologic tumor, and non-O blood type were independent risk factors for symptomatic PICC related thrombosis. In the meta-analysis of further exploration of ABO blood type and PICC related thrombosis, we found that ABO blood type may influence PICC related thrombosis, and individuals with the O blood type had a lower risk of PICC related thrombosis than those with non-O blood type.</p>","author":"Xiao-Hong Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c105f3e0e0d908b45347e2c3d602f0a7ec4c6dac77f0c1b73f32e3e22e59ab16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
