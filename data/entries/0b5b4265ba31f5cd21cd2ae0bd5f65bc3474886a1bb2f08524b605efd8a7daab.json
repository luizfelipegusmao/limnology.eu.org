{"title":"i-PHAOS: An Overview with an Open-Source Collaborative Database on Miniaturized Integrated Spectrometers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0236/v1","date":1728262953000,"content":"On-chip spectrometers are increasingly becoming tools that might help in everyday life needs. The possibility offered by the several available integration technologies and materials to be used to miniaturize spectrometers has led to a plethora of very different devices, that in principle can be compared according to their metrics. Having access to a reference database can help in selecting the most performing on-chip spectrometers and to be up-to-date in terms of standards and developments. In this paper, an overview of the most relevant publications available in literature on miniaturized spectrometers is reported and a database is provided as an open-source project to which researchers can have access and participate in order to improve the share of knowledge in the interested scientific community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b5b4265ba31f5cd21cd2ae0bd5f65bc3474886a1bb2f08524b605efd8a7daab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
