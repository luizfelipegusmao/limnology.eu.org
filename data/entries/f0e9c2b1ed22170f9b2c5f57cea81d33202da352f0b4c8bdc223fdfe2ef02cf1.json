AM of the Inconel 718 is challenging, as this particular alloy possesses a higher melting point, as well as resistance to temperature, which induces ‘hot-cracking’. Thus, the selection of proper input parameters is essential, which was successfully achieved in this present study.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f0e9c2b1ed22170f9b2c5f57cea81d33202da352f0b4c8bdc223fdfe2ef02cf1","category":"Environment"}
