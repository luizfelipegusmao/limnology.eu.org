{"title":"Aboveground biomass determines canopy rainfall interception loss in Semiarid Grassland Communities","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2677?af=R","date":1716887959000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Canopy rainfall interception is one key hydrological process, affecting rainwater redistribution and effectiveness in semiarid regions. Canopy rainfall interception loss is jointly influenced by meteorology, vegetation and topography. The canopy water storage capacity (S), rainfall interception depth (I<sub>m</sub>) and ratio (I<sub>%</sub>) and vegetation characteristics, together with topographic factors of three grassland communities (dominated by <i>Bothriochloa ischaemum</i>, <i>Lespedeza davurica</i> and <i>Artemisia gmelinii</i>, respectively) were investigated on the Loess Plateau of China during the main growing season (June to September). Results showed that I<sub>m</sub> ranged from 0.55 to 0.89 mm and I<sub>%</sub> ranged from 6.14% to 12.1%, with the maximum values occurring in August for three communities, and <i>A. gmelinii</i> community had the largest I<sub>m</sub> (0.89 mm) and I<sub>%</sub> (12.1%). The I<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>%</sub> were positively correlated with aboveground biomass (AGB), coverage (Cov), leaf area index (LAI), community-weighted mean height (CWMH) and altitude (Alt), but negatively correlated with slope degree and rainfall intensity (RI). Hierarchical partitioning analysis (HPA) showed that AGB had the highest contribution for I<sub>m</sub> (20.3%), while Alt had the highest contribution for I<sub>%</sub> (18.2%). The regression models based on forward selection could effectively predict the values of I<sub>m</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.802, RMSE = 0.049) and I<sub>%</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.546, RMSE = 1.434). Topographic factors (altitude, slope degree and aspect) indirectly influenced both I<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>%</sub> by modulating vegetation characteristics (AGB, Cov, etc.). All these indicated that aboveground biomass mainly determines grassland community rainfall interception loss in the semiarid Loess Plateau.</p>","author":"Yang Luo, \nQuan Yang, \nJunjie Zhou, \nChunxia Jian, \nZhifei Chen, \nPeifeng Xiong, \nJairo A.
