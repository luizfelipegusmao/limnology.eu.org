{"title":"Association of Hepatitis B Virus E Antigen With HBV Viral Load in Botswana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1580/v1","date":1713928692000,"content":"(1) Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load (VL) is useful in determining treatment eligibility, however, due to high costs associated with the test, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is recommended as a proxy for HBV VL in resource-limited settings. (2) Methods: We used 299 archived plasma samples with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and HBV VL (cut-off of 20,000 IU/mL and 200,000 IU/mL) results from people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH). HBeAg and HBV VL results were analyzed to evaluate the use of HBeAg to determine CHB treatment eligibility and qualification of HBV prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) prophylaxis for the first time in Botswana. (3) Results: Approximately 70.8% and 87.5% of participants with HBeAg-positive serology had HBV viral loads â‰¥20,000 IU/mL and 200,000 IU/mL respectively. Using logistic regression, the odds of having a qualifying HBV VL for CHB treatment and PMTCT prophylaxis were respectively 55.5 and 110.4 times higher in participants with positive HBeAg serology indicating a statistically significant association between HBeAg status and HBV VL. (4) Conclusions: HBeAg detection may not always correlate with high HBV VL, warranting further research focusing on this association, and other biomarkers that correlate better with HBV VL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91f7205c22b31b1dab00e877a6f90ea96cac669c3e4dab71c6bfd999da310946","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
