{"title":"Scoliosis in Children with Cerebral Palsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1531/v1","date":1729503467000,"content":"Cerebral palsy is a group of nonprogressive conditions that affect movement and posture caused by damage to the central nervous system at an early stage of a child's development. Among this group of patients, there is a higher risk of the appearance and progression of neurogenic scoliosis, which unlike idiopathic scoliosis, progresses after skeletal maturity. The aim of the study was to analyze the association of comorbid factors with the risk of development and progression of neurogenic scoliosis. The study included 133 patients with cerebral palsy. The relationship between comorbidities in children with cerebral palsy and the risk of developing neurogenic scoliosis was demonstrated and proven.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d5eaf0697a98ee2701a035b33c80586035694605b1148093f2debcbbd9ebdbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
