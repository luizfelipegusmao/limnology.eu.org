{"title":"A scalable platform for acquisition of high-fidelity human intracranial EEG with minimal clinical burden","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305009","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Lisa Yamada, Tomiko Oskotsky, Paul Nuyujukian, for the Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center , Stanford Pediatric Epilepsy Center </p>\r\n\r\nHuman neuroscience research has been significantly advanced by neuroelectrophysiological studies from people with refractory epilepsyâ€“the only routine clinical intervention that acquires multi-day, multi-electrode human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). While a sampling rate below 2 kHz is sufficient for manual iEEG review by epileptologists, computational methods and research studies may benefit from higher resolution, which requires significant technical development. At adult and pediatric Stanford hospitals, research ports of commercial clinical acquisition systems were configured to collect 10 kHz iEEG of up to 256 electrodes simultaneously with the clinical data. The research digital stream was designed to be acquired post-digitization, resulting in no loss in clinical signal quality. This novel framework implements a near-invisible research platform to facilitate the secure, routine collection of high-resolution iEEG that minimizes research hardware footprint and clinical workflow interference. The addition of a pocket-sized router in the patient room enabled an encrypted tunnel to securely transmit research-quality iEEG across hospital networks to a research computer within the hospital server room, where data was coded, de-identified, and uploaded to cloud storage. Every eligible patient undergoing iEEG clinical evaluation at both hospitals since September 2017 has been recruited; participant recruitment is ongoing. Over 350+ terabytes (representing 1000+ days) of neuroelectrophysiology were recorded across 200+ participants of diverse demographics. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a research integration within a hospital setting. It is a promising approach to promoting equitable participant enrollment and building comprehensive data repositories with consistent, high-fidelity specifications towards new discoveries in human neuroscience.","author":"Lisa Yamada","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6f52bd15afe4b47dee2dcd8d6e4c85e39e5262331ebecf8c17390ddd57b7ebfc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
