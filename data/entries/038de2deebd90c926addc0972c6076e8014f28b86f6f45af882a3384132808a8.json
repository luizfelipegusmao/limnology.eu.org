In the monolayer form their bandgap becomes direct, making them bright atomically thin light emitters. Integration of TMD monolayers into van der Waals (VdW) heterostructures with materials like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers further possibilities including moir√© potentials or improved optical properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.558-B1\">1</a>]. However, nanoscale investigation of their optical properties requires techniques like cathodoluminescence (CL) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), to access the highly confined excitons, which have a spatial extension of only a few nanometers [<a href=\"#ozae044.558-B2\">2</a>]. Spatially resolved S(T)EM-CL experiments on bare monolayers have been unsuccessful so far, highlighting the importance of the hBN encapsulation [<a href=\"#ozae044.558-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"038de2deebd90c926addc0972c6076e8014f28b86f6f45af882a3384132808a8","category":"Environment"}
