This study utilised an indoor marine RAS for the intensive culture of Pacific white shrimp <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>. The shrimp were stocked into the grow-out system at an average body weight of 0.25 g and a stocking density of 347 shrimp/m<sup>3</sup>. Water quality parameters of temperature, salinity, total dissolved solids, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured twice daily. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite and nitrate were measured once weekly or when needed. Sampling was conducted to calculate the daily feed ratio based on the total estimated biomass. Mortality was recorded as a means of evaluating the overall shrimp health. The data obtained were analysed using Pearson correlation (<i>r</i>) analysis and multi-linear regression with a significant difference accepted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. Correlation (<i>r</i>) established relationships among the water quality parameters, feed load and mortality. The TAN level of 24.20 mg/L was recorded when the feed load increased by 81.2% resulting in the mortality of 40% of shrimp. A negative correlation between TAN and DO resulted in a synergistic effect causing a massive consumption of DO in the water, reducing its availability to the shrimp and leading to a drastic change in the shrimp's behaviour. Overfeeding can lead to an accumulation of uneaten feed and waste, causing ammonia spikes and oxygen depletion in the water. Monitoring and adjusting feed rates accordingly can help maintain optimal water conditions for shrimp growth and health. Therefore, it is essential to use appropriate feed rates in recirculating systems because feed load can influence water quality parameters that can be detrimental to shrimp culture.</p>","author":"Fazeel Mohammed, \nPaul Gabbadon, \nTahmina Ajmal, \nMartin S.
