{"title":"Synthesis, Characterization, and Photocatalytic Properties of Sol-Gel Ce-TiO2 Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0652/v1","date":1715334035000,"content":"In this study, nanostructured cerium-doped TiO2 (Ce-TiO2) films with the addition of different amounts of cerium (0.00, 0.08, 0.40, 0.80, 2.40, and 4.10 wt. %) were deposited on a borosilicate glass substrate, by flow coating sol-gel process. After flow coating, deposited films were dried at the temperature of 100 °C for 1 h, followed by calcination at the temperature of 450 °C for 2 h. For the characterization of sol-gel TiO2 films, the following analytic techniques were used: X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetry (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Sol-gel derived Ce-TiO2 films were used for photocatalytic degrada-tion of the ciprofloxacin (CIP). The influence of the amount of Ce in TiO2 films, the duration of the photocatalytic decomposition, and the irradiation type (UV-A and simulated solar light) on the CIP degradation were monitored. Kinetics parameters (reaction kinetics constants and the half-life) of the CIP degradation, as well as photocatalytic degradation efficiency, were determined. The best photocatalytic activity was achieved by the TiO2 film doped with 0.08 wt.% Ce, under both UV-A,  and solar irradiation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b5cf0fc940459ba12a882a34c1d7390f94d25acdcbb7565930fbe3c07c60cd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
