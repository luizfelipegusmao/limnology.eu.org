{"title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Electrical Characteristics and Changes in Chemical Composition and Structure of OSG Low-k Films under Thermal Annealing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2101/v1","date":1727340885000,"content":"The paper is dedicated to studying the influence of annealing temperature on the chemical, structural and electrophysical properties of low-k films made from porous organosilicate glasses containing terminal methyl groups. The films were deposited using centrifugation, followed by drying at 200 °C and annealing at temperatures ranging from 350 °C to 900 °C. Changes in refractive index, porosity, pore size, chemical composition, and electrical properties as a function of annealing temperature are evaluated. The results of JV measurements indicate that the methyl-modified film, which was annealed at 450 °С, demonstrates minimal leakage currents. This phenomenon can be explained by the almost complete removal of surfactant residues and non-condensed silanols, as well as the minimal thermal degradation of methyl groups. The results of the study on leakage current models in methyl-modified films, obtained at various annealing temperatures, lead us to conclude that the predominant mechanism of charge carrier transfer is Poole–Frenkel emission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a99ad5281a6321edee4af9e143c584846cea79cda6ac8ae8bf47c699acfd19d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
