For instance, magnetic materials hosting novel excitations like skyrmions are of interest in both physics and technology, demanding high spatial and phase sensitivity for mapping of weak magnetization. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is such a technique for the correlative microstructural and functional imaging at the nanoscale. The phase shift of electrons contains quantitative information about functional properties like magnetization and electrostatic potentials. However, this information is lost during image acquisition, where only the squared amplitude of the electron exit wavefunction is recorded. Phase retrieval in LTEM, also known as exit wave reconstruction, is typically achieved by solving the transport of intensity equation (TIE) [<a href=\"#ozae044.227-B1\">1</a>]. To implement TIE requires at least a moderate level of defocusing, which in turns limits its spatial resolution as well as its application on structures with weak magnetizations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"20914e028a744d9cf2976c25dd5fcd6ef75bbf2280bcf136c96635c77bd4e09e","category":"Environment"}
