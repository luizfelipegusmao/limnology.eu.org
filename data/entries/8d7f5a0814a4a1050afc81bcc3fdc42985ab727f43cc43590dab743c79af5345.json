{"title":"The Radiation of Landhoppers (Crustacea, Amphipoda) in New Zealand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1414/v1","date":1724240609000,"content":"A synopsis of current knowledge of the diversity of the New Zealand landhopper fauna is provided. A combination of morphological and molecular analysis was employed on material from across New Zealand. Thirteen new endemic genera soon to be formally described have been discovered, including four belonging to the widespread families Talitridae and Arcitalitridae. These are families that had not been previously reported from New Zealand. We document the existence of at least 48 new provisional native species. This number far exceeds the 28 species currently described. Some described species are now shown to be species complexes and a few of these are very diverse with numerous cryptic species. Six changes to the existing taxonomy are proposed. Dallwitzia simularis (Hurley, 1957) is transferred from Makawidae Myers and Lowry, 2020 to Talitridae Rafinesque, 1815; Kellyduncania hauturu (Duncan, 1994) is reinstated as a member of Dana Lowry, 2011 and Kellyduncania (Lowry and Myers, 2019) is relegated to a synonym of Dana Lowry, 2011; Kanikania Duncan, 1994 is transferred from Makawidae Myers and Lowry, 2020 to Arcitalitridae Myers and Lowry, 2020; Parorchestia longicornis is transferred to Kanikania Duncan, 1994; Waematau kaitaia (Duncan, 1994) is transferred to Kohuroa Lowry, Myers and Nakano, 2019; and Waematau unuwhao (Duncan, 1994) is transferred to Omaiorchestia Lowry and Myers, 2019. This reduces the number of described genera from 17 to 16.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d7f5a0814a4a1050afc81bcc3fdc42985ab727f43cc43590dab743c79af5345","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
