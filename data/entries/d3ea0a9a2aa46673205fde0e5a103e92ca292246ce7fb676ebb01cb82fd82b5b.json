{"title":"Limited Time Resolution of Event Data Loggers Can Bias Intensity Measurements from Tipping-Bucket Rain Gauges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0322/v1","date":1719989577000,"content":"Event data loggers are frequently used to record the date and time of tip events in tipping-bucket rain gauges. The HOBO® pendant event data logger is one such commercially-available device commonly used for this purpose. It can record the contact closure of a TBGR reed switch at a maximum timing resolution of 1 second, tied to the timing of the logger clock, which is set each time the logger is launched. These event loggers are ideal for the routine recording of rainfall. This paper addresses the issue of whether they can also be relied upon when estimating short-term intensities, for which they were not designed. New experiments show that for a series of switch closures at fixed intervals other than exact multiples of 1 s, the HOBO® logger fails to record evenly-spaced tip events. Thus, for example, with pulses at fixed 2.75 s intervals, the logger records some events as occurring at 2 s intervals, and others at 3 s intervals. The duration between logged events is correct only when the mean is calculated for a long series of logged events. In natural rainfall, tip events can occur at any time, and inter-tip times, from which intensity can be estimated, will generally not be an integral number of seconds. Consequently, particularly in intense rain, the logger behaviour just described can lead to erroneous estimates of the rainfall rate estimated from the duration of individual inter-tip times. Possible solutions are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3ea0a9a2aa46673205fde0e5a103e92ca292246ce7fb676ebb01cb82fd82b5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
