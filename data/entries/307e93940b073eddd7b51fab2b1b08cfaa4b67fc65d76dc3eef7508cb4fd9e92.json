{"title":"A Low Fiber Diet Minimize Colonic Short Chain Fatty Acids, Increase Severity and Prolongs Recovery in DSS Induced Colitis, Independent of Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2 and 3 Signaling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2163/v1","date":1717158589000,"content":"Abstract: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the major microbial metabolites produced in the gut through the fermentation of non-digestible fibers. SCFAs act through free fatty acid receptor 2 and 3 (FFAR2 and 3), which are known to be expressed on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-secreting L-cells. This pathway is suggested to protect the intestinal mucosa. We aimed to investigate how lack of fiber affects the production of SCFAs and the vulnerability of the co-lon. Additionally, the involvement of FFAR2 and 3 in GLP-1 secretion and intestinal protection. SCFA concentrations in luminal contents from chow- or fiber-free diet-fed mice were analysed by LCâ€’MS. SCFAs were applied to isolated perfused colons from FFAR2/3 double KO and WT mice, and the secretion of GLP-1 was measured. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis was induced in chow- or fiber-free diet-fed mice as well as in FFAR2/3 KO and WT mice. The removal of die-tary fiber significantly decreased total colonic SCFA concentrations, with specific decreases in acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs significantly increased colonic GLP-1 secretion but not in FFAR2/3 KO mice. In the DSS model, the removal of dietary fiber increased the severity and delayed recovery. Colitis severity was independent of FFAR2 and FFAR3 signaling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"307e93940b073eddd7b51fab2b1b08cfaa4b67fc65d76dc3eef7508cb4fd9e92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
