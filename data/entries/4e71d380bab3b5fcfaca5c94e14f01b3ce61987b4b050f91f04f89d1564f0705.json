{"title":"A Survey on Quantum Cryptography, its Protocols, Applications, and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0333/v1","date":1722918080000,"content":"This paper focuses on the concepts used in Quantum Cryptography and recent progress made. We look at the different categories of key distribution protocols that have been proposed and issues related to those. We then take an overview of two main approaches of communication using quantum cryptography concepts, i.e., ``Quantum Secure Direct Communication'' and ``Deterministic Secure Quantum Communication'', and limitations related to the usage of these schemes in a real-world system. At last, we list down the problems identified in the research and conclude our discussion by proposing areas of focus for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e71d380bab3b5fcfaca5c94e14f01b3ce61987b4b050f91f04f89d1564f0705","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
