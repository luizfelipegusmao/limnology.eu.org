{"title":"Oscillation of a Liquid Column in an Eccentric Annulus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0501/v1","date":1720157316000,"content":"The velocity distribution of flow in an eccentric cylindrical annulus is determined in an attempt to investigate the vertical capillary rise in the channel. The radii ratio and the eccentricity at which a transition from monotone to oscillatory rise occurs, are determined. The results are shown to converge to the well-known limiting cases of concentric annuli and circular tubes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0bfcc148a4c72254c6c2a15c633e56d163198a87535750de3c720428ee827a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
