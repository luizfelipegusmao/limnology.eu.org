{"title":"New Random Walk Algorithm Based on Different Seed Nodes for Community Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0562/v1","date":1720422662000,"content":"The complex network is an abstract modeing of complex systems in the real world, which plays an important role in analyzing the function of complex systems. Community detection is an important tool for analyzing network structure. In this paper, we propose a new community detection algorithm (RWBS) based on different seed nodes aims to understand the community structure of the network, which provides a new idea for the allocation of resources in the network. RWBS provides a new centrality metric ($MC$) to calculate node importance, which calculates the ranking of nodes as seed nodes. Furthermore, two algorithms are proposed for determining seed nodes on networks with and without ground-truth, respectively. We set the number of steps for the random walk to 6 according to the six degrees of separation theory to reduce the running time of the algorithm. Since some traditional community detection algorithms may detect smaller communities, e.g., two nodes become one community, this may make the resource allocation unreasonable. Therefore, modularity ($ Q $) is chosen as the optimization function to combine communities, which can improve the quality of detected communities. Final experimental results on real-world and synthetic networks show that the RWBS algorithm can effectively detect communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05f239831b40eb934b9354ed08215a725b8289a1a67c9f3b8a6d7597aa0aa54a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
