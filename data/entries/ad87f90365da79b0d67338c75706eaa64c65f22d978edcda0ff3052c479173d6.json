{"title":"<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model arthropod carrier for the amphibian chytrid fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307833","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Alyssa M. Byer, Kaylie M. Nguyen, Tatum S. Katz, Renwei Chen, Cheryl J. Briggs</p>\r\n\r\nThe fungal pathogen <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (<i>Bd</i>) causes the disease amphibian chytridiomycosis, which has contributed to population declines in many species of amphibians throughout the world. Previous observational studies have shown that nematodes, waterfowl, lizards, other dipterans, and crayfish have properties which may allow them to harbor and spread <i>Bd</i>; therefore, we sought to determine the carrier capabilities of invertebrates to a further extent in a laboratory setting. We use the insect <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model organism to quantify the potential relationship between insects and <i>Bd</i>. Our findings show that <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> can test positive for <i>Bd</i> for up to five days post-exposure and can transmit <i>Bd</i> to conspecifics without suffering mortality. Insects of various types interact with the amphibian habitat and amphibians themselves, making this a potentially important route of transmission between amphibians and of dispersal across the environment.","author":"Alyssa M.
