{"title":"Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1C) in Cardiac Surgery; a Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1633/v1","date":1726831067000,"content":"Perioperative dysglycemia in cardiac surgery is associated with poor outcomes. Glycemic variability rather than glucose levels are a predictor of length of ICU stay, rise in creatinine and acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values correspond closely with average blood glucose levels and cut off values can be used to define diabetic and pre-diabetic status. These have been correlated with perioperative events. This narrative review discusses the role of glycated hemoglobin in cardiac surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd1c13e9b0ab0abd5fbbd7dce85ad7d43db6fcd5a5cde11320313cbd95c283b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
