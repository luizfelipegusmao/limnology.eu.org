{"title":"Thermo-Mechanical and Thermo-Electric Properties of a Carbon-Based Epoxy Resin: An Experimental, Statistical and Numerical Investigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2079/v1","date":1719587621000,"content":"Due to their remarkable intrinsic physical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can enhance mechanical properties and confer electrical and thermal conductivity to polymers currently investigated for use in advanced applications based on thermal management. An epoxy resin filled with varying concentrations of CNTs (up to 3 wt.%) was produced and experimentally characterized. The electrical percolation curve identified two critical filler concentrations: 0.5 wt%, near the electrical percolation threshold, suitable for exploring mechanical and piezoresistive properties, and 3 wt% for investigating thermo-electric properties due to the Joule effect with applied voltages ranging from 70V to 200V. Numerical models were developed using multiphysics simulation software. Once validated with experimental data, these models were used to investigate additional physical properties of the composites. Furthermore, a statistical approach based on the design of experiments (DoE) was employed to examine the influence of certain thermal parameters on the final performance of the materials. The purpose of this research is to promote the use of contemporary statistical and computational techniques alongside experimental methods to enhance understanding of materials science. New materials can be identified through these integrated approaches, or existing ones can be more thoroughly examined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d992667675e915b45f2d936f5ccafab0cc95ac150c5d6605d7d417b84f510411","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
