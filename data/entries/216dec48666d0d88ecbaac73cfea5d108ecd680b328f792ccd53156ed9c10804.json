{"title":"Association of Diabetes Outcome and Atrazine Exposure Among Pennsylvania Counties, 2011-2019","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1397/v1","date":1716457420000,"content":"Abstract\n\nBackground: Atrazine, a widely used herbicide, is recognized for its potential endocrine-disrupting effects, though its direct link to diabetes has not been extensively studied.\nObjectives: This study investigates the relationship between atrazine exposure and diabetes incidence, especially in agricultural settings, and examines how socioeconomic factors like income and education levels influence diabetes risk.\n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 67 counties in Pennsylvania from 2011 to 2019. Atrazine exposure was measured in local water sources and correlated with diabetes data from the Pennsylvania Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Socioeconomic data were sourced from U.S. Census Bureau records, with logistic regression used to adjust for confounders such as age, race, and lifestyle.\n\nResults: Findings showed a significant association between high atrazine exposure and increased diabetes incidence, even after adjusting for confounders. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusion: The study highlights a significant health risk posed by atrazine, particularly for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. It underscores the need for stricter atrazine regulation and public health interventions to mitigate its impact. Further research is crucial to understand how atrazine affects glucose metabolism and diabetes development. Implementing stricter environmental controls and educational initiatives could reduce the diabetes burden in impacted communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"216dec48666d0d88ecbaac73cfea5d108ecd680b328f792ccd53156ed9c10804","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
