In this microscope, a new magnetic objective lens system that realizes a magnetic field free environment at the sample position [<a href=\"#ozae044.676-B1\">1</a>] is installed. Using this new objective lens system combined with the state-of-the-art higher order aberration corrector, atomic resolution TEM/STEM imaging under magnetic field free condition is now routinely possible.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"36a7316925a0c5c8f9cb62cc196285da63ad19197625bab1b2ee6be0e59ad68c","category":"Environment"}
