{"title":"Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1): An Inflammatory Regulator with Potential Implications in Ferroptosis and Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0889/v1","date":1723595411000,"content":"Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1/CD54), a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been considered as one of the most important adhesion molecules during leukocyte recruitment. It is encoded by the ICAM1 gene and plays a central role in inflammation. It’s crucial role in many inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis are well established. Given that neuroinflammation, underscored by microglial activation, is a key element in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), we investigated whether ICAM-1 has a role in this progressive neurological condition and if so, elucidate the underpinning mechanisms. Specifically, we were interested in potential interaction between ICAM-1, glial cells and ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death that has recently been implicated in PD. We conclude that there exist direct and indirect (via glial cells and T cells) influences of ICAM-1 on ferroptosis and that further elucidation of these interactions can suggest novel intervention for this devastating disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba01236b72e0ad6446df1f3cdfcf9b2534c86e100423f2a196f6b5e6ac0848fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
