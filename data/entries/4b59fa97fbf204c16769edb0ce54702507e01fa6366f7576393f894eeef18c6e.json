{"title":"Understanding Preferences of Indian Three-Wheeler Drivers for Electric Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1911/v1","date":1714378060000,"content":"In India, where the transport sector contributes significantly to CO2 emissions, there has been a growing shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), particularly in the three-wheeler segment. Traditional auto-rickshaws, a staple in urban transportation, are often powered by internal combustion engines, leading to pollution and high fuel consumption. Electric three-wheelers, or e-rickshaws, have emerged as a cleaner, more efficient alternative, with zero tailpipe emissions. However, the successful adoption of electric three-wheelers depends on understanding the preferences and challenges faced by auto-rickshaw drivers, who are key to the Intermediate Public Transport (IPT) system. Based on this motivation, the study contributed to the literature by analyzing stated preference survey data from 2,403 respondents who purchased electric tricycles in 2023. We provide insights into the relationship between consumer demographics (such as age, income, gender, education), Vehicle operations, Vehicle financing and Electrification perspective and their preferences for specific electric and fuel tricycle segments. Finally, we estimate consumers' preference for electric tricycles and fuel tricycles. To do this, we use a discrete choice model and estimate the impact factor of Indian consumers in purchasing electric tricycles to obtain market penetration strategies for future electric tricycles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b59fa97fbf204c16769edb0ce54702507e01fa6366f7576393f894eeef18c6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
