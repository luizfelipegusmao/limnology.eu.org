{"title":"Influence of Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm towards Transfer Function and Contrast resolution of Low Dose CT Lung Cancer Screening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0489/v1","date":1715160879000,"content":"This study assessed the performance of low-dose CT lung scans across various acquisition parameters and examined the impact of iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms on image quality for lung cancer screening. The performance of multi-slice CT scanners was assessed by using a Catphan 600 phantom, specifically within the CTP404 test module that contains materials like Teflon, Delrin, Acrylic, Polystyrene, LDPE, PMP, Air, and water. Three protocols were selected and categorized into standard, low dose, and ultra-low dose. The standard protocol featured a tube voltage of 100 kVp for single-detector CT, a pitch of 0.75, detector collimation of 0.60 mm, and a gantry rotation time of 0.33 seconds, with 5 mm slice thickness. Images were reconstructed using standard kernels like B80f and 170f, combined with either FBP or various IR algorithms. Findings indicated that the noise power spectrum (NPS) peak value (HU2mm2) increased with higher IR levels, with FBP showing the highest peak. Additionally, NPS spatial frequency diminished as IR levels rose. Optimizing contrast and spatial resolution for both background and regions of interest involved adjusting the target transfer function (TTF) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), crucial for protocol optimization. Proper adjustment of IR levels is vital, as higher levels can alter image texture and affect NPS spatial frequency. The results of this study showed that the use of IR algorithms in low-dose CT lung scans significantly improved image quality, particularly in terms of noise reduction and spatial resolution. However, the choice of acquisition parameters also played a crucial","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72967e158a8f1b746e83506f6bb9ccc5da25282116e9fdf93912b59f74e7fd4d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
