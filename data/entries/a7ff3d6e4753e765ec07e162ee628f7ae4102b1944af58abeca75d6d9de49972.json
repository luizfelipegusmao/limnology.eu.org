{"title":"Mitochondrial genomes of Nemourinae species (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) and the phylogenetic implications","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae028/7619560?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Currently, the classification system of 2 subfamilies within Nemouridae has been widely accepted. However, monophyly of 2 subfamilies has not been well supported by molecular evidence. To date, only mitogenomes from genus <span>Nemoura</span> of the subfamily Nemourinae were used in previous phylogenetic studies and produced conflicting results with morphological studies. Herein, we analyzed mitogenomes of 3 Nemourinae species to reveal their mitogenomic characteristics and to examine genus-level classification among Nemouridae. In this study, the genome organization of 3 mitogenomes is highly conserved in gene order, nucleotide composition, codon usage, and amino acid composition. In 3 Nemourinae species, there is a high variation in nucleotide diversity among the 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs). The <span>K</span><sub><span>a</span></sub>/<span>K</span><sub><span>s</span></sub> values for all PCGs were far lower than 1, indicating that these genes were evolving under purifying selection. The phylogenetic analyses highly support <span>Nemurella</span> as the sister group to <span>Ostrocerca</span>. Meanwhile, <span>Nemoura</span> is recovered as the sister group of <span>Malenka</span>; they are grouped with other Amphinemurinae and emerged from a paraphyletic Nemourinae. More molecular data from different taxonomic groups are needed to understand stoneflies phylogeny and evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"a7ff3d6e4753e765ec07e162ee628f7ae4102b1944af58abeca75d6d9de49972","category":"Environment"}
