{"title":"The Impact of Air Pollution on Asthma Severity among Residents Living near the Main Industrial Complex in Oman: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0762/v1","date":1710313573000,"content":"Background:\nAsthma is a widespread chronic respiratory disease that poses a significant public health challenge. The current study investigated the associations between air pollution and asthma severity among individuals residing near the Sohar industrial port (SIP) in Oman. Despite the presence of multiple major industrial complexes in Oman, limited knowledge regarding their impact on respiratory health is accredited. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to offer valuable insights into the respiratory health consequences of industrial air pollution in Al Batinah North.\nMethods:\nThe state health clinics' records for patient visits related to asthma were collected for the timeframe spanning 2014 to 2022. Exposure was defined as the distance from SIP, Majan Industerial Area (MIA) and Sohar Industerial Zone (SIZ) to determine high, intermediate, and low exposure zones (12 km, respectively). Exposure effect modifications by age, gender, and smoking status were also examined.\nResults:\nThe conducted cross-sectional study of 410 patients (46.1% males and 53.9% females) living in over 17 areas around SIP revealed that 73.2% of asthmatics were under 50 years old, with severity significantly associated with closeness to the port. Risk ratios were estimated to be (RR:2.42; CI95%: 1.01–5.78), (RR:1.91; CI95%: 1.01–3.6), and (RR:1.68; CI95%: 0.92–3.09) for SIP, MIP and SIZ areas, respectively, compared to the control area. Falaj Al Qabail (6.4 km) and Majees (6 km) had the highest number of asthma patients (N. 69 and N. 72), and highest percentages of severe asthma cases among these patients (28% and 24%) with significant risk ratios (RR:2.97; CI95%: 1.19–7.45 and RR:2.55; CI95%: 1.00–6.48), correspondingly. Moreover, severe asthma prevalence peaked in the 25-50 age group (RR:2.05; CI95%: 1.26–3.33), and this linkage between asthma and age was much more pronounced in males than females. Smoking and exposure to certain contaminant (dust and smoke) increased also the risk of severe asthma symptoms, but their effects were less important in the high risk zone, suggesting much more important risk factor. A neural network model accurately predicted asthma risk (94.8% accuracy), with proximity to Sohar Industrial Port as the most influential predictor.\nConclusion:\nThe study highlights the High asthma burden near Sohar Industrial Port, linked to port proximity and smoking and wind direction as major risk factors. These findings inform vital public health policies to reduce air pollution and improve respiratory health in the region, prompting national policy review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f107b453f0be3ca2d7029286a53b72578e3bcfe4f8e1e4911185f30227f6028","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
