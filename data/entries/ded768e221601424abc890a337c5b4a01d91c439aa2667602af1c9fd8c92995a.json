{"title":"Reproducible Exploration of Disease Maps with Galaxy Workflows and the MINERVA Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1211/v1","date":1710937814000,"content":"Visual exploration of complex data helps interpretation, especially in the case of omics data analysis in life sciences and clinical research. Generating and analysing omics data requires bioinformatic skills, while they are interpreted by domain experts, for whom parsing large and complex data structures may be challenging. However, outcomes of visual analytics are often difficult to quantify, which emphasises precision and reproducibility, especially for research on human diseases. Here, we propose a workflow combining a reproducible computational environment with a dedicated visualisation functionality for systems biology diagrams. By linking the Galaxy with the MINERVA Platform, we visualise and explore COVID-19 transcriptomic data to demonstrate the utility of our workflow. Visualised data recapitulate findings of the original publication and offer new insights about the COVID-19 pathology. Our results offer a blueprint for quick prototyping of computational workflows that facilitate communication and exploration of complex data in biomedical research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ded768e221601424abc890a337c5b4a01d91c439aa2667602af1c9fd8c92995a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
