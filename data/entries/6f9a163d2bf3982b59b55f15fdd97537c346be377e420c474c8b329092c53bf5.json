{"title":"Cochineal (Dactylopius coccus Costa) Pigment Extraction Assisted by Ultrasound and Microwave Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1546/v1","date":1729494279000,"content":"Currently, there is an increasing interest to develop eco-friendly and efficient pigment extraction processes for diverse applications. In this study, we report the comparison between the assisted extraction performed by ultrasonication and microwave with a conventional method to obtain cochineal pigments from Dactylopius coccus Costa. Our independent variables were solvent amount, temperature and irradiation time, and the corresponding optimization was performed by three factors and three levels with a Box-Behnken design. The pigment contents were quanti-fied through UV-vis spectroscopy, and the pigment mixture of extracts was assessed by infrared spectroscopy. It is highlighted that after optimization, the extraction assisted by ultrasound gave a yield of 47% with an efficiency of 31.3 mg/min, whereas the yield obtained from the extraction assisted by microwave was 41% with 27.3 mg/min efficiency, both higher that the efficiency ob-tained with a conventional method (3.5 mg/ml).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f9a163d2bf3982b59b55f15fdd97537c346be377e420c474c8b329092c53bf5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
