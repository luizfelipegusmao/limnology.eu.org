{"title":"Statistical Investigation of Changing Parameters on Impregnated Carbon Activation Process Using Taguchi Experimental Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0610/v1","date":1720430408000,"content":"This research is concentrated on the physical technique of carbon activation from carbon-based material such as bamboo. In addition, we impregnated the activated carbon by use of experimental methods. In the first case, the results from various parameters on the carbon activation process, such as kiln rotation speed, steaming time, calcination temperature and heating rate at the different levels has been investigated on iodine number of activated carbon. Using the Taguchi method and ANOVA analysis, the optimal test results were obtained which are as follows: steaming time and calcination temperature were the most influential factors and heating rate and kiln rotation speed were the less influential factors in the process. In the second case, palladium-impregnated activated carbon (Pa/AC) was prepared at different conditions of the experiment and effects of optimum ratios on the responses have been studied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea7eaa7125354e7a2a98e11eac0546a9fa373c3ab9d8a49f25dd349d3188bedd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
