{"title":"Physiopathological Roles of White Adiposity and Gut Functions in Neuroinflammation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0687/v1","date":1723215824000,"content":"White adipose tissue (WAT) and gut are involved as inducers of neuroinflammation when they detect injury and trigger inflammation. The autonomous nervous system innervates both tissues, although the roles of the sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems have not been fully elucidated. Here, we revisited the participation of both types of inflamed peripheral tissue in neuroinflammation. We first analyzed how inflamed peripheral WAT plays a key role in neuroinflammation once metainflammation is installed. Second, we described the impact of insulin resistance (IR) on hypothalamic dysfunction, T2DM and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we analyzed the gut-brain axis, examining cell interactions, soluble factors, the sensing of microbes and the role of the intestinal microbiota and mucosal barriers in neuroinflammation. Since intestinal mucosa and secondary lymphoid organs are densely innervated by the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems, we analyzed bidirectional crosstalk between different tissues, neurons, and immune systems in healthy and pathological circumstances to restore normal tissues functions, and consequently homeostasis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5834f18b6039cc5f683f035b2a61dba980f17788ca97b5800722b572e8b31de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
