{"title":"Spatiotemporal change characteristics of vegetation coverage in Shangwan Mine of China’s Shendong Mining Area","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302278","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Ziheng Song, Jie Fang, Jian Zhang, Gang Liu, Liping Sun, Chuangang Gong, Fei Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThe coal mining might cause the disturbance to the vegetation and the disturbance impacts might exist the differences for different areas, and few literatures compared and analyzed different disturbed areas based on the location of the mining face, and paid attention to the post mining self-healing effects of vegetation. Here, this paper selected the GaoFen multispectral images during 2017–2021 to study different areas of Shangwan Mine which includes the old mining area more than 5 years after mining, the new working face underground mined in 2018 and 2019, the natural growth control area and the open-pit mining affected area. The spatiotemporal changes of the surface fraction vegetation coverage (<i>FVC</i>) were analyzed in each area and the correlation between vegetation coverage and climatic factors was studied. The results showed that: (1) The overall vegetation coverage showed a moderate decrease trend in fluctuation from 2017 to 2021. The Open-pit mining affected areas showed the largest decline, reaching 68.3%. The <i>FVC</i> in the underground mining areas had a downward trend, but self-healing effect after mining was also observed. (2) The overall <i>FVC</i> in the study area was positively correlated with the number of precipitation days. (3) There were differences in the sensitivity to mining disturbance for different landform in the underground mining areas. (4) Although the <i>FVC</i> in the Old mining areas had recovered to the level of Natural growth control area, but the annual fluctuation was larger, which might mean lower ecological stability.","author":"Ziheng Song","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"24c9f76fec00355a8f423b7cc246c7b1e0737d6a92e4034646ccd2e1157379ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
