We hereby provide a comprehensive overview of the main types of holders, associated technologies and case studies pertaining to the widely employed heating and gas heating methods, from their initial developments to the latest advancement. In addition to the conventional approaches, we also discuss the emergence of holders that incorporate a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) chip for <span>in situ</span> observations. The MEMS technology offers a multitude of functions within a single chip, thereby enhancing the capabilities and versatility of the holders. MEMS chips have been utilized in environmental-cell designs, enabling customized fabrication of diverse shapes. This innovation has facilitated their application in conducting <span>in situ</span> observations within gas and liquid environments, particularly in the investigation of catalytic and battery reactions. We summarize recent noteworthy studies conducted using <span>in situ</span> liquid TEM. These studies highlight significant advancements and provide valuable insights into the utilization of MEMS chips in environmental-cells, as well as the expanding capabilities of <span>in situ</span> liquid TEM in various research domains.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"b4a01dff78fbe00a80720740794eb1a232b266d75061805930a6bd62fd6e5dde","category":"Environment"}
