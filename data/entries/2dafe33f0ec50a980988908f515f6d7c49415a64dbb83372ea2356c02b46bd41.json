This study introduces a micro-electrometric method using cricket cholinesterase (ChE) to detect OP and CM residues, providing a rapid and economical alternative to conventional chromatographic techniques. The parameters of the method, including the substrate concentration, incubation temperature, and incubation time, were optimized. By leveraging the sensitivity of cricket ChE to OP and CM inhibition, this approach translates enzyme inhibition into an electrical signal to quantify pesticide levels, achieving an impressive limit of detection (LOD) from 0.036 to 0.086 parts per million (ppm). This method demonstrated reproducibility and stability, making it suitable for field applications and on-site testing across various environmental matrices. This research represents a significant advancement in pesticide residue analysis with potential applications in the development of portable biosensor devices for real-time environmental monitoring and public health protection.","author":"Anurak Wongta","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2dafe33f0ec50a980988908f515f6d7c49415a64dbb83372ea2356c02b46bd41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
