{"title":"Resilient Farm Technologies in Achieving Sustainable Development: Performance and Adoption of Sri under Multiple Constraints in Odisha, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0353/v1","date":1722916462000,"content":"Rice yield underperformance coupled with production instability in Odisha state of India is primarily due to low irrigation potential, the spatiotemporal disparity in rainfall pattern and relentless confrontation with biotic and abiotic stresses. System of Rice Intensification (SRI) was introduced in the state with the promises of higher production horizon. However, the present scenario of patchy adoption pattern has necessitated comprehensive study on dynamics and determinants of adoption of SRI. We found that, 57 percent farmers continued SRI, 28 percent discontinued and rest were practicing conventional rice farming. The focused group discussion among the farmers helped us to triangulate the determinants of SRI adoption.The increased SRI area allocation was observed at the expense of reduced number of adopting farmers. Economic scarcity of skilled labour, difficulties in transplantation and mechanical weeding, low irrigation potential and poor on-farm water management were major constraints in SRI practice. Farmers’ compliance in following different resilient SRI components that also varied spatiotemporally has resulted in realized incremental yield. SRI was proved to be resilient to severe drought during 2015-16 and yielded 27 percentage higher than conventional one with considerable decline in hazardous chemicals usage. Farmers’ decision on SRI adoption/discontinuation was analysed using probit regression analysis. The results indicated that, active social involvements of NGOs, on-farm training and demonstrations, and realized incremental rice income influenced SRI adoption. On the other hand, SRI area expansion hindered mainly because of infeasible land topography, area saturation and lack of farmers’ interest. The sustainability index was developed to analyse SRI’s performance to other conventional methods at farm level. Comparatively, SRI adopters benefitted in terms of incremental net return by enhancing ecological balance and sustained productivity of soil, use of eco-friendly and own farm inputs. Nonetheless, higher women labour displacement observed under SRI can be curtailed by providing training to young farm women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ef87674d9e86180ef4418913d2f837f4c70110ffb3ef2435109856a541b8c8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
