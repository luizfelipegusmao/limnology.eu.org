A dual-method approach integrated social media reports and in-person interviews to explore practices, challenges, and conservation implications of recreational fishing for these species. Seasonal capture of guitarfishes required the promotion of catch-and-release, especially during gestational periods, and the development of best angling practices manuals and accessible identification guides. With a focus on land-based activities and engagement with fishers, our findings underscored the importance of collaboration among researchers, recreational fishers, and conservationists to map and monitor recreational capture and contribute to guitarfish research and conservation.</p>","author":"Thomaz Stefani Fuzetti, \nPatricia Charvet, \nNatascha Wosnick","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"959d93c7e76114f2d5e754410f4d85e36c50386fc015cc119ba2eb0186004da1","category":"Environment"}
