{"title":"Importance Of Cbct In Implantology In The Pre - And Post-surgical Phase","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0741/v1","date":1728548164000,"content":"Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a vital tool in implantology, playing a key role in both pre- and post-surgical phases. Preoperatively, CBCT provides detailed three-dimensional evaluation of anatomical structures, offering precise information on bone quality and quantity, as well as the location of critical structure. This accuracy enhances surgical planning, reducing intra- and postoperative risks and ensuring more precise implant placement. Post-surgically, CBCT is equally important for monitoring osseointegration and detecting potential complications, such as failed integration, infections, or implant misalignment. Its high-resolution imaging capabilities enable clinicians to make accurate therapeutic adjustments, improving treatment outcomes. Overall, CBCT improves decision-making in implantology, offering greater predictability and safety compared to traditional two-dimensional radiography, significantly enhancing the success rates of implant-based oral rehabilitation procedures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"279ec23364fc5d17f0b216f5e3983b28448373867a2eb3003501b304c797984e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
