{"title":"Evaluation of Energy Distribution in a Photovoltaic Park Located in Tulcea County, Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2121/v1","date":1724925981000,"content":"This study focuses on the design, installation, and performance evaluation of a photovoltaic farm situated in Tulcea County, Romania, connected to a 20 kV distribution network. The farm, with a peak capacity of approximately 2800 kWp, benefits from Romania’s favorable climate conditions and supportive renewable energy policies. The analysis encompasses both the photovoltaic panel array and the electrical energy evacuation system. The substation at the park is equipped with technology that adheres to European standards and incorporates advanced features typical of modern electricity distribution networks. The assessment includes an evaluation of the park’s operational efficiency, with detailed calculations of the performance ratio and various power losses attributed to factors like temperature fluctuations, fouling, inverter efficiency, grid-related challenges, and availability issues. The farm contributes around 3620 MWh of electricity to the grid annually, demonstrating the effectiveness of photovoltaic installations in promoting sustainable energy solutions within regional energy networks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24a0995cd9dc42744e3b7ff79127e8cfde5cfe429fccf3d518b097007d9e10c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
