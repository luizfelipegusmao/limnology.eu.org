{"title":"Three-Dimensional Printing/Bioprinting and Cellular Therapies for Regenerative Medicine: Current Advances","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1427/v2","date":1729660386000,"content":"The application of three-dimensional (3D) printing/bioprinting technologies and cell therapies has garnered significant attention due to their potential in the field of regen-erative medicine. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of 3D print-ing/bioprinting technology and cell therapies, highlighting their results in diverse medical applications, while also discussing the capabilities and limitations of their com-bined use. The synergistic combination of 3D printing and cellular therapies has been recognised as a promising and innovative approach, and it is expected that these tech-nologies will progressively assume a crucial role in the treatment of various diseases and conditions in the foreseeable future. This review concludes with a forward-looking perspective on the future impact of these technologies, highlighting their potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine through enhanced tissue repair and organ re-placement strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8ae9e523a410604cee5d3ce04b496fd4820f91d11b7be550fabb45289bfe572","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
