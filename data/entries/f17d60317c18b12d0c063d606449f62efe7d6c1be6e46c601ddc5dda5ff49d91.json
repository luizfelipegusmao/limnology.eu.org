{"title":"Experimental Study on the Suitability of Waste Plastics and Glass as Partial Replacement of Fine Aggregate in Concrete Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2002/v1","date":1719564771000,"content":"Solid waste management is a major environmental challenge, especially in developing countries, with increasing amounts of waste glass (WG) and waste plastics (WP) not being recycled. In Ethiopia, managing WG and WP requires innovative recycling techniques. This study examines concrete properties with WG and WP as partial replacements for fine aggregate. Tests were conducted on cement setting time, workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength. Concrete grade C-25, with a compressive strength of 25 MPa, was prepared using an optimum ratio of 14% WG and 6% WP. Mechanical properties were tested at 7 and 28 days of curing. At 20% replacement, workability decreased at water-cement ratios of 0.5 and 0.6 but remained stable at 0.4. Thus, a 0.4 ratio was used. For 10% replacement, compressive strength increased by 12.55% and 6.44% on the 7th and 28th days, respectively. At 20% replacement, compressive strength decreased by 14.35% and 0.73% on the 7th and 28th days, respectively. On the 28th day, splitting tensile strength at optimum replacement was 4.3 MPa, an 8.5% reduction from the control mix. However, flexural strength increased by 19.7%, from 12.46 MPa to 15.52 MPa. Overall, WG and WP improved flexural strength but slightly reduced splitting tensile strength.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f17d60317c18b12d0c063d606449f62efe7d6c1be6e46c601ddc5dda5ff49d91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
