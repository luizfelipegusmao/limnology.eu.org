Stroke often results in impaired motor function, posing significant challenges in daily activities and leading to considerable societal and economic burdens. Traditional physical and occupational therapies have shown limitations in facilitating satisfactory recovery for many patients. In response, our study investigates the potential of motor imagery–based BCIs (MI-BCIs) as an alternative intervention. In this study, MI-BCIs translate imagined hand movements into actions using a combination of scalp-recorded electrical brain activity and signal processing algorithms. Our prior research on MI-BCIs, which emphasizes the benefits of proprioceptive feedback over traditional visual feedback and the importance of customizing the delay between brain activation and passive hand movement, led to the development of RehabSwift therapy. In this study, we recruited 12 chronic-stage stroke survivors to assess the effectiveness of our solution. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (FMA-UE) assessment, complemented by secondary measures including the action research arm test, reaction time, unilateral neglect, spasticity, grip and pinch strength, goal attainment scale, and FMA-UE sensation. Our findings indicate a remarkable improvement in hand movement and a clinically significant reduction in poststroke arm and hand impairment following 18 sessions of neurofeedback training. The effects persisted for at least 4 weeks posttreatment. These results underscore the potential of MI-BCIs, particularly our solution, as a prospective tool in stroke rehabilitation, offering a personalized and adaptable approach to neurofeedback training.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"de4c9eda254cb98d9e45142eb95d7b96f9ae7296cf0e8fad344d96bfffdab099","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
