Fish specimens were collected weekly using gill nets (30.0 m long, 3.0 m high, and mesh size 12.5–127.0 mm) between October 2021 and March 2022. Total length (TL) and weight for each specimen were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 gm, respectively. This study provides first species-specific LWRs for four species (<i>Tor tor</i>, <i>Rasbora daniconius</i>, <i>Rita gogra</i> and <i>Clarias magur</i>), new maximum TL for seven species (<i>Notopterus notopterus</i>, <i>Labeo bata</i>, <i>Systomus sarana</i>, <i>Crossocheilus latius</i>, <i>Xenentodon cancila</i>, <i>Channa marulius</i> and <i>Mastacembelus armatus</i>), and new and wider size range for three species (<i>Chitala chitala</i>, <i>Tenualosa toli</i> and <i>Labeo boggut</i>). Findings of this study have implications in the management and conservation of the species-specific fisheries resources within the geographical range.</p>","author":"Arvind Kumar Dwivedi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"35a014678f6cfd7a780f5312645532e72e3f9ac52b725720c3f2644ad1fdd944","category":"Environment"}
