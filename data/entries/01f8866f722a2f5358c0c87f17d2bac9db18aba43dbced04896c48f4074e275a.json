{"title":"Microorganisms-assisted degradation of Acid Orange 7 dye: a review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-023-05438-y","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The escalating global concern over water pollution, predominantly propelled by industrial activities, underscores the urgency for effective environmental remediation strategies. Of particular, concern is the discharge of synthetic colorants into water bodies, a prevailing issue notably pervasive in textile industries. Azo dyes, ubiquitous in various industrial sectors, including food and textile manufacturing, constitute a significant portion of dye-contaminated wastewater, thereby contributing to soil and water pollution, especially in emerging and economically challenged nations. The deleterious impact of azo dyes on human health and aquatic ecosystems heightens the urgency of addressing this environmental menace. In response to the imperative need for mitigating the adverse effects of azo dyes on the environment, human health, and natural water resources, a spectrum of physio-chemical technologies has been proposed for azo dye degradation. However, a noteworthy paradigm shift toward environmentally friendly approaches is increasingly imperative. This comprehensive review critically examines various strategies employed for the degradation of Acid Orange 7, a representative azo dye, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological interventions. In the realm of biological treatment, the focus is predominantly on microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, bacteria, and algae, which have emerged as promising agents due to their inherent eco-friendly nature. This article provides an in-depth exploration of microbial remediation strategies, highlighting recent advancements in degradation techniques and elucidating the intricate mechanisms underlying azo dye degradation by bacteria. This review aims not only to present a consolidated overview of existing technologies but also to underscore the importance of harnessing the potential of microorganisms in the treatment of azo-dye-containing wastewater. The comprehensive insights provided herein contribute to the evolving discourse on sustainable and environmentally benign approaches for mitigating the impact of azo dyes on global water resources.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"01f8866f722a2f5358c0c87f17d2bac9db18aba43dbced04896c48f4074e275a","category":"Environment"}
