{"title":"The Number Zero  is Welcomed by Mathematics, but Physics Should Be Careful When Dealing With It","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2183/v1","date":1727432941000,"content":"The number zero is happily   used by mathematics, but not physics for various reasons.  It should  be incorrect to say that  $\\phi(x)= 0=\\gamma(x)$, when there are two, different, physical meanings, such as fields for two very different kinds of particles, etc. That could lead to some kind  of confusion in    physics. In that case, it could even be  necessary to {\\bf reject} using the zero number  in certain  expressions, and instead, at least try to  `go around them'. \n\nDo not forget that the number zero was {\\it banned} for 1,500  years, long, long ago!","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5274115a3de1c81d422c247ebe0c062c2e534371f53961dd1ca8e88604f80e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
