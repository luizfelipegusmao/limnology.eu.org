{"title":"Multi-Robot Systems in Agricultural Applications: A Review of the State of the Art","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0761/v1","date":1723432555000,"content":"In the last decade, the integration of robots into agricultural tasks has significantly transformed food production from planting to harvest. The precision and efficiency of a robot allow for specialized crop management in cases such as; plant disease identification, optimization of water and fertilizer use, monitoring of environmental and soil conditions, among others. That is, the adoption of robots in agricultural practices through intelligent automation increases crop yields and decreases environmental impact. Intelligent automation faces contemporary challenges such as climate change and population growth, promoting sustainable food security. Therefore, this article presents a review of the state of the art of modular robots and their applications in agriculture. Modular robots have the ability to reconfigure and adapt to different tasks, promoting versatile solutions for the agricultural sector. These solutions are linked to the robot's control systems, which can be centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. Firstly, centralized control allows for unified management and coordination in high-precision tasks. Secondly, the decentralized approach offers flexibility and robustness in changing environments where adaptability is required. Thirdly, hybrids incorporate features of both control types balancing control and autonomy to increase efficiency and effectiveness in practical applications. In some cases, control systems incorporate bio-inspired motion control techniques, where the robot mimics natural movements and behaviors to improve its adaptability in performing a task. For example, the chemosynthesis model, which is a biological process where bacteria convert an inorganic compound into energy, has been adapted for individual robots to explore and navigate their environment. Therefore, this article presents an overview of modular robots, the incorporation of bio-inspired motion control techniques, and their convergence towards the sustainable solution of contemporary problems in the agro-industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c98476d2d7ca2e9cadd27b0c295136e72573be1462a15edb82c6fcde4b3377ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
