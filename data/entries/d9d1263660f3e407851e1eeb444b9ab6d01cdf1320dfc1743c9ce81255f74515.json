{"title":"Differential Regional Textural Attributes of Tongue in Normal and Acidity Patients in the Light of Traditional Chinese Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0733/v1","date":1720591545000,"content":"Introduction: In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), tongue diagnosis plays an important role. Besides shape, colour and textural attributes of tongue regions have significance due to their association with different organs (viz. heart, lung, kidney-bladder, liver-gallbladder and stomach-spleen) in health and disease. Although numerous quantitative methods have been proposed to reduce inter and intra observer variability in tongue diagnosis, almost all of them considered only global colour/ textural features i.e. from entire body of tongue. In this work, regional colour and texture information of tongue have been analysed for healthy subjects (NOM) and patients suffering from chronic acidity-indigestion (ACD). Methods: Tongue boundaries are marked manually in each image and then tongue bodies are automatically partitioned into five regions linked with said internal organs. Rough assessments of regions’ boundaries are obtained from literature and then they are fine-tuned according to experts’ advice. As boundaries are not well defined, regions near the common boundary of two or more organs, are not assigned to any organ. Several first and second order statistical features based on grey scale intensities and a* values of LAB colour space (indicative of redness) have been extracted from five different regions of tongue images. Intragroup analysis using Wilcoxon signed rank test compared different regions within individual study group. Additionally, intergroup analysis using Wilcoxon rank sum test compared tongues of NOM with ACD for each region separately. Results: Intragroup analysis reveals a* values are statistically different (p&amp;lt;0.01) between stomach-spleen and liver-gallbladder regions for ACD while no significant change of a* are noted between these regions of normal tongue. It was found from intergroup analysis that correlation (one of the second order texture features extracted from grey scale images) of heart region has significantly decreased while correlation of kidney, liver-gallbladder and stomach-spleen regions significantly increased from NOM to ACD. Conclusion: This study sheds light on importance of inclusion of regional textural analysis of tongue in quantitative studies and can be applied to automated tongue diagnosis for other diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9d1263660f3e407851e1eeb444b9ab6d01cdf1320dfc1743c9ce81255f74515","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
