{"title":"93 Evaluating the efficacy of anthelmintics in an upper Midwest horse herd","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/251/7664981?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cyathostomins in the gastrointestinal tract are ubiquitous in horses around the world and remain a target in parasite control programs. Resistance to anthelmintics has risen in recent years with widespread resistance to benzimidazoles and pyrantels and emerging resistance to macrocyclic lactones. Thus, investigating the efficacy of anthelmintics in different locations is important to direct future parasite control programs. This 2-yr study evaluated the efficacy of three anthelmintic drugs in a university-owned equine herd in the upper Midwest using fecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT). Additionally, the effect of age group and body condition score (BCS) on fecal egg shedding was evaluated. We hypothesized that drug resistance is present in the parasite population of this equine herd. Fecal egg counts (FEC) of strongelid eggs were determined using the McMaster method. The efficacy of anthelmintics was determined by calculating the percentage of reduction in FEC between d 0 and d 14 post-treatment. Eighteen horses of various breeds were used in the study. The horses were grouped by age (&lt; 10, 10-16, and &gt; 16 yr; n = 6 in each group) and BCS using the Henneke system (5.0-5.5, n = 9; 6.0-6.5., n = 6; and 7.0-8.0, n = 3). In yr 1, horses within age group were randomly assigned to anthelmintic treatment: pyrantel pamoate, fenbendazole, or ivermectin. In yr 2, all horses received ivermectin. Individual FEC were performed on the day of anthelmintic treatment (d 0) using freshly voided feces. FEC were repeated 14 d after treatment. FEC were log transformed before analysis. Efficacy of the anthelmintics were compared using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures (SAS 9.4). Results were considered significant when <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. The FECRT was greater when treated with ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate (94.8 ± 11.6 % and 96.6 ± 14.3 %, respectively) compared with fenbendazole (54.4 ± 10.8 %; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). The FECRT increased from 54.4% when treated with fenbendazole to 100% when the same horses were treated with ivermectin (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Age tended to affect egg shedding in horses (<span>P</span> = 0.0548). Young horses (&lt; 10 yr) had a greater FEC compared with older horses (&gt;16 yr; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) but were not different from horses aged 10 to 16 yr (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). There was no effect of BCS on strongelid egg shedding in this study (<span>P</span> = 0.9468). These results indicate the efficacy was within the expected range with no signs of resistance to pyrantel pamoate (93.3 to 100% reduction). There was evidence of emerging resistance to ivermectin (70.4 to 100% reduction) and significant resistance to fenbendazole (0 to 71.5% reduction) in the cyathostomin population in this horse herd. The findings of this study agree with previous research demonstrating resistance to anthelmintics. These results highlight the importance of designing improved parasite control programs to limit the spread of drug resistance with the ultimate goal of improving overall health of the horse.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"eb1abf050dc9eea065858760ba9ed918cac5c87221ffefdc4a5f6b0c1e3da69b","category":"Environment"}
