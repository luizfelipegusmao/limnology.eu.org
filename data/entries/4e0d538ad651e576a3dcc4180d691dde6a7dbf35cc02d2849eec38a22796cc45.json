{"title":"&ldquo;Exercise&hellip;.to Me, It&rsquo;s Freedom&rdquo;: Motivation, Support, and Self-Management to Keep Physically Active with Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease: A Qualitative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1594/v1","date":1716530836000,"content":"Objective: To explore motivation to exercise, support, and self-management needs among people with Parkinson’s (PwP), family-members and physiotherapists. Methods: Purposeful and maximum difference sampling methods (age, sex, geographical setting, and disease severity) were employed. PwP and family-members were recruited through physiotherapy services and local support groups. Semi-structured interviews with 12 PwP, focus groups with four family-members, and five physiotherapists were conducted. Interview guides were informed by patient-public input, and a recent systematic review. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four common themes emerged: 1) The value of an intrinsic connection with exercise: but there are challenges. A greater connection to exercise led to long-term compliance. 2) Tailoring exercise is essential. Preferred exercises and environments were mixed, with differences emerging between sexes. 3) Physiotherapists’ aim to only maintain physical function led to frustration. Limited self-management opportunities, stigma and dehumanisation were discussed. 4) Non-motor symptoms, stigma, fear, and determination. Apathy, pain, and low mood were discussed. Conclusion: Exercise provided physical, emotional, and social rewards. Supports are necessary; however, challenges arise when PwP’s motivation are mismatched to family-members’ and physiotherapists’ goals. Co-created goals, tailored to their preferences, and exercise plans with supported self-management are recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e0d538ad651e576a3dcc4180d691dde6a7dbf35cc02d2849eec38a22796cc45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
