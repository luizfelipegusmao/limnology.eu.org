{"title":"A New Approach to Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem with Several Examples","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1744/v1","date":1727079801000,"content":"These counterexamples have shown the relationships between the power of a Pythagorean equation and Pythagorean’s triples. There are three positive integers that satisfy Fermat’s equation when the power n is equal to 2 in the case of the Pythagorean theorem and it’s applicable relationships in right triangles. On the other hand, as the power varies from positive to negative integers or any integers other than 2, such as in the case of Fermat’s last theorem, the hypotenuse z of a right triangle tends to be equal to one of the sides x or y of the triangle and the other side tends to be equal to zero. And the application of this idea describes the behavior of a mass object in motion. Since the total energy of the object is the sum of its energy in motion and its rest energy, at a particular power n, the total energy of the object tends to be equal to either the rest energy or the photon energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d98c379b4bd67fba99d1c41629d800ab2229a79e571e67595efa572fd35d1f2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
