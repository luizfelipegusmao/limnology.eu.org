{"title":"Modification and Performance Evaluation of a Biomass Pelleting Machine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1267/v1","date":1718814246000,"content":"The use of biomass as a source of energy has been identified to be energy intensive which involves high cost of handling. However, pelletization reduces the bulk density of biomass, thereby reducing the cost of handling and enhancing ease of use. This study modified and evaluated an existing hand operated fish feed pelleting machine. The parts of the machine that were redesigned are hopper and power transmission unit. Corncob was used to evaluate the modified machine using die hole diameter (5,6 and 7 mm) and binder quantity (0, 2.5 and 5 wt%) as factors. The average results obtained for machine efficiency, throughput, pellet length and bulk density were 58.83%, 4.24 kg/h, 15.51 mm and 0.160 g/cm3. Die hole diameter had significant effect on pellet length only. Binder quantity had significant effect on machine efficiency, throughput and pellet length. Machine efficiency and throughput reduces as the quantity of binder increases and pellet length increases with increasing quantity of binder.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"941913739f42e82ab9e244f813a24ef4b104be576e6ee3593ba11821a1033549","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
