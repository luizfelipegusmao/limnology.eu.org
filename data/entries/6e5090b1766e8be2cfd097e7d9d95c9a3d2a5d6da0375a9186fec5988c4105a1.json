{"title":"Evaluation of CacyBP/SIP expression and its relationship with ERK1/2 and p38 kinase in testicular seminoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1375/v1","date":1721184993000,"content":"Testicular cancer accounts for approximately 1% of adult cancers and 5% of all urologic cancers. The most common histopathological diagnosis of testicular neoplastic lesions are germ cell tumors (90-95% of cases), among which the majority of cases are seminomas, the most common malignant tumors among men aged 15-44. For better clinical diagnosis and treatment, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of tumor formation. In this study, the expression of the CacyBP/SIP protein and ERK1/2 and p38 kinases was analyzed for the first time in seminomas and normal testicular tissues. The research was carried out using archival tissue material from 30 patients undergoing surgery due to testicular seminoma, whereas the comparative material consisted of the adjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were used to identify the expression of CacyBP/SIP, ERK1/2, and p38. A very clear weakening of both immunoreactivity and gene expression of all tested parameters was demonstrated in seminomas compared to healthy tissues. Our findings suggest the involvement of the CacyBP/SIP protein in the ERK1/2 and p38 signalling pathways, which may be involved in the processes of testicular seminoma carcinogenesis. The results of our research provide the basis for further research in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e5090b1766e8be2cfd097e7d9d95c9a3d2a5d6da0375a9186fec5988c4105a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
