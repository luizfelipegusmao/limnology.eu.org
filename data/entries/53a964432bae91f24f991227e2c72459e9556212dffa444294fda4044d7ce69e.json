{"title":"The effect of ribociclib on the expression levels of <i>miR-141</i> and <i>CDK4/6-USP51</i> signaling pathway genes in <i>MCF-7</i> and <i>MDA-MB-231</i> cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309289","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Shayeste Sadat Baghermanesh, Mahmood Barati, Arshad Hosseini</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Patients with breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer, have a poor prognosis. There is still no effective treatment for this disease. Due to resistance to traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, there is a need to discover novel treatment strategies to treat this disease. Ribociclib is a selective <i>CDK4/6</i> inhibitor. Approximately 20% of patients with HR+ breast cancer developed primary resistance to <i>CDK4/6</i> inhibitors, and more than 30% experienced secondary resistance. Since most patients experience resistance during <i>CDK4/6</i> inhibitor treatment, managing this disease is becoming more challenging. Many malignant tumors abnormally express microRNA (miR)-141, which participates in several cellular processes, including drug resistance, proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion.</p> Materials and methods <p>In the present study, we cultured <i>MDA-MB-231</i> and <i>MCF-7</i> cells in DMEM-F12 medium. By performing MTT assay we determined the cytotoxic effects of ribociclib on breast cancer cells, as well as determining the IC50 of it. Then, we treated the cells with ribociclib at two time points: 24 h and 72 h. After that, RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Finally, we performed qRT‒PCR to evaluate how ribociclib affects the expression level of desired genes.</p> Results and conclusion <p>We found that ribociclib can inhibit cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We examined the mRNA expression of 4 genes. After ribociclib treatment, the mRNA expression of <i>CDK6</i> and <i>MYH10</i> decreased (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05). The mRNA expression of <i>CDON</i> increased (p&lt;0.05), but no significant changes were observed in <i>ZEB1</i> mRNA expression. Furthermore, the qRT‒PCR results for <i>miR-141</i> showed that the expression of <i>miR-141</i> increased (p&lt;0.01) after 72 h of treatment with ribociclib.</p>","author":"Shayeste Sadat Baghermanesh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"53a964432bae91f24f991227e2c72459e9556212dffa444294fda4044d7ce69e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
