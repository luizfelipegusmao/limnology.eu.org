{"title":"Concluding Embryogenesis After Diaspora: Seed Germination in Illicium Parviflorum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1352/7205501?rss=1","date":1687392000000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Albuminous seeds, dispersed with a minimally developed embryo surrounded by nutrient storage tissue, are pervasive across extinct and extant early diverging angiosperm lineages. Typically, seed ontogenic studies have focused on the time between fertilization and seed release, but in albuminous seeds, embryogenesis is incomplete at the time of seed dispersal. Here, I studied the morphological and nutritional relationships between the embryo and the endosperm after seed dispersal in <span>Illicium parviflorum</span> (Austrobaileyales). Seeds of <span>I. parviflorum</span> germinate over a period of three months. Different stages during the germination process were anatomically evaluated using a combination of histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. At dispersal, the seeds of <span>Illicium</span> contain a tiny achlorophyllous embryo with minimal histological differentiation, surrounded by copious amounts of lipo-protein globules stored in the endosperm within cell walls rich in un-esterified pectins. Six weeks later, the embryo expanded and differentiated the vascular tissues before the emergence of the radicle through the seed coat, as the stored lipids and proteins coalesced within cells. Six weeks later, the cotyledons contained starch and complex lipids intracellularly, and accumulated low-esterified pectins in their cell walls. The proteolipid-rich albuminous seeds of <span>Illicium</span> exemplify how woody angiosperms of the Austrobaileyales, Amborellales, and many magnoliids release seeds with high-energy storage compounds that are reprocessed by embryos that complete development during germination. Seedlings of these lineages thrive in the understory of tropical environments, which match with the predicted habitats where angiosperms evolved.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"ee38661ffe2ea29b559fc51083d06befab4aa6940aca956e7576dde6561c748a","category":"Environment"}
