{"title":"Florence Nightingale on Rural Health Management: Health Missioners and their contribution to Public Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0043/v1","date":1722568994000,"content":"Background: The Victorian era in Great Britain was a historical period that brought about profound changes for humanity. The confluence of various factors fostered the development of numerous scientific disciplines. In the field of health sciences, Florence Nightingale played a central role. Following her training as a nurse and her role as superintendent during the Crimean War, she made decisive contributions to establishing a public health network. Methods: This is a retrospective historical heuristic and hermeneutic study analyzing documentation of Nightingale's contributions to public health from around 1890 to 1900. The historical method was used to collect, classify, and analyze primary and secondary sources relevant to the study's objectives. Results: Nightingale supported the development of the concept of “health at home” by training women to implement healthy measures that contributed to the well-being of families and communities. Through the training and development of a formal “Health Missioners program”, she provided the necessary guidance to improve the health of rural communities across the English countryside. Conclusion: The role of Health Missioners has persisted, as health visitors continue to visit homes in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the contribution of Florence Nightingale to public health is unquestionable. This study was not registered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b0b943a7902fcc22fa01197c27ef64fcc78bfbdc43f8bf34e916ba6e6ae3871","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
