{"title":"Simulated And Experimental Study Of The Available Energy Transfer From An Ev Battery In A V2g System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1420/v1","date":1716363948000,"content":"ABSTRACT\nThe work is focused on determining the energy transfer from EV’s to grid for different operating conditions. The study has been simulated on a scaled model and later validated through experimental tests on batteries of 20 kWh, 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 80 kWh for EV’s energy rates from 130 Wh/km to 180 Wh/km. Tests have been developed to evaluate the energy transfer from driving distance between 0 and 50 km. Results have proved there is a linear dependence between energy transfer and energy rate. Experimental and simulated values have been correlated showing a 99.6% accuracy. The ratio of energy transfer to battery energy capacity depends not only on this latter parameter, but also on the energy rate of the electric vehicle. Experimental tests have shown a variation from a minimum transfer ratio of 54.1% for the highest electric vehicle energy rate and lowest battery energy capacity and power transfer to grid rate to a maximum of 88.6% for the highest power transfer to grid rate and battery energy capacity and lowest electric vehicle energy rate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59b1cffe706f7bad2b62d85601f3b2c204c768a8868f7b4b57580e319eb8b58a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
