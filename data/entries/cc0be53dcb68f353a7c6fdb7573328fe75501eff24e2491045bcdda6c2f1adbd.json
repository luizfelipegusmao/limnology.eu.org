{"title":"Effect of Waste Plastic on Performance of Asphalt Mixtures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0774/v1","date":1725948675000,"content":"Currently, the use of recycled waste plastic in road construction is not just considered ecofriendly but also considered advantageous for improving road performance over time. This research explores using recycled plastic bags, made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), in asphalt mixtures to improve road performance and manage waste. The study aims to assess the effects of incorporating different amounts of shredded waste plastic into asphalt mixes and determine the optimal percentage. The aggregate used was obtained from Sargodha quarry Pakistan and asphalt used was 60/70 grade obtained from national refinery limited Pakistan. Using the Marshall mix design, the optimum bitumen content (OBC) was found to be 4.5% of the asphalt mix weight. Thirty samples were tested with waste plastic proportions of 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 14% of OBC weight, along with a standard mix. Tests on stability, bulk density, flow, and air voids showed that a 10% plastic content significantly enhances asphalt performance, increasing stability by around 25%. The study recommends using 10% plastic by OBC weight in asphalt mixes for better performance and suggests further research on optimal incorporation techniques of waste materials in asphalt mixtures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc0be53dcb68f353a7c6fdb7573328fe75501eff24e2491045bcdda6c2f1adbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
