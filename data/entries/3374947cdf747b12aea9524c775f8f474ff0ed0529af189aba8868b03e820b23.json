In this present work, we precisely controlled the tilt angle of the irradiation electron beams to obtain the schlieren images under a special boundary condition between the brightfield and darkfield conditions of the hollow-cone Foucault imaging system. We utilized the obtained contrast and intensity changes in the schlieren images to visualize the electromagnetic fields in the space around the specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.761-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3374947cdf747b12aea9524c775f8f474ff0ed0529af189aba8868b03e820b23","category":"Environment"}
