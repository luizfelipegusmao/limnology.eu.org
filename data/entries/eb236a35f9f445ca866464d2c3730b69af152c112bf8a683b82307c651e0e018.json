{"title":"Development of a human liver microphysiological coculture system for higher throughput chemical safety assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/2/227/7604532?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chemicals in the systemic circulation can undergo hepatic xenobiotic metabolism, generate metabolites, and exhibit altered toxicity compared with their parent compounds. This article describes a 2-chamber liver-organ coculture model in a higher-throughput 96-well format for the determination of toxicity on target tissues in the presence of physiologically relevant human liver metabolism. This 2-chamber system is a hydrogel formed within each well consisting of a central well (target tissue) and an outer ring-shaped trough (human liver tissue). The target tissue chamber can be configured to accommodate a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid-shaped microtissue, or a 2-dimensional (2D) cell monolayer. Culture medium and compounds freely diffuse between the 2 chambers. Human-differentiated HepaRG liver cells are used to form the 3D human liver microtissues, which displayed robust protein expression of liver biomarkers (albumin, asialoglycoprotein receptor, Phase I cytochrome P450 [CYP3A4] enzyme, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 transporter, and glycogen), and exhibited Phase I/II enzyme activities over the course of 17â€‰days. Histological and ultrastructural analyses confirmed that the HepaRG microtissues presented a differentiated hepatocyte phenotype, including abundant mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and bile canaliculi. Liver microtissue zonation characteristics could be easily modulated by maturation in different media supplements. Furthermore, our proof-of-concept study demonstrated the efficacy of this coculture model in evaluating testosterone-mediated androgen receptor responses in the presence of human liver metabolism. This liver-organ coculture system provides a practical, higher-throughput testing platform for metabolism-dependent bioactivity assessment of drugs/chemicals to better recapitulate the biological effects and potential toxicity of human exposures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"eb236a35f9f445ca866464d2c3730b69af152c112bf8a683b82307c651e0e018","category":"Environment"}
