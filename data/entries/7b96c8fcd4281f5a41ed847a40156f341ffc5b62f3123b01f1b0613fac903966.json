{"title":"Telehandler Dynamics Analysis using Bond Graph Methodology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2337/v1","date":1727680460000,"content":"Technological advancements and evolving government regulations are driving the adoption of construction equipment powered by renewable energy sources, aiming to significantly reduce emissions. Electrifying non-road mobile machinery (NRMM), particularly self-propelled Rough-Terrain Variable Reach Trucks (RTVRT) with telescopic booms, presents stability challenges. Replacing diesel engines with electric motors and battery packs shifts the centre of gravity, necessitating precise load capacity determinations via load charts to ensure safe operation. This paper introduces a virtual model developed using multi-physic modelling with Bond Graph methodology. The model encompasses crucial components, including the chassis, rear axle, telescopic boom, attachment fork, and wheels, requiring three-dimensional treatment for spatial dynamics resolution. An illustrative example, supported by experimental data, demonstrates the model's capabilities. Special focus is placed on calculating ground wheel reaction forces and hydraulic self-leveling of the attachment fork. Numerical results validate the BG-3D simulation model of the telehandler with 20-Sim as a promising tool for estimating stability limits with satisfactory precision and predicting dynamic behavior across various operating conditions. Moreover, the paper explores potential extensions of the model, such as integrating the virtual vehicle model with a platform of variable inclination in subsequent phases which aims to evaluate telehandler longitudinal and lateral stability, aligning with the ISO 22915 standard and operator safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b96c8fcd4281f5a41ed847a40156f341ffc5b62f3123b01f1b0613fac903966","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
