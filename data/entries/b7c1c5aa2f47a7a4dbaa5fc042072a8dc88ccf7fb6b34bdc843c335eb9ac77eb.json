{"title":"Mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6 phosphorylate receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase CDL1 to regulate soybean basal immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/963/7596134?rss=1","date":1706745600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Soybean cyst nematode (SCN; <span>Heterodera glycines</span> Ichinohe), one of the most devastating soybean (<span>Glycine max</span>) pathogens, causes significant yield loss in soybean production. Nematode infection triggers plant defense responses; however, the components involved in the upstream signaling cascade remain largely unknown. In this study, we established that a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling module, activated by nematode infection or wounding, is crucial for soybeans to establish SCN resistance. GmMPK3 and GmMPK6 directly interact with CDG1-LIKE1 (GmCDL1), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII. These kinases phosphorylate GmCDL1 at Thr-372 to prevent its proteasome-mediated degradation. Functional analysis demonstrated that GmCDL1 positively regulates immune responses and promotes SCN resistance in soybeans. GmMPK3-mediated and GmMPK6-mediated phosphorylation of GmCDL1 enhances GmMPK3 and GmMPK6 activation and soybean disease resistance, representing a positive feedback mechanism. Additionally, 2 L-type lectin receptor kinases, GmLecRK02g and GmLecRK08g, associate with GmCDL1 to initiate downstream immune signaling. Notably, our study also unveils the potential involvement of GmLecRKs and GmCDL1 in countering other soybean pathogens beyond nematodes. Taken together, our findings reveal the pivotal role of the GmLecRKs–GmCDL1–MAPK regulatory module in triggering soybean basal immune responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"b7c1c5aa2f47a7a4dbaa5fc042072a8dc88ccf7fb6b34bdc843c335eb9ac77eb","category":"Environment"}
