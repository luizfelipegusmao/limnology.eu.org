The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of YCHD on lipid metabolism of juvenile largemouth bass fed on high-carbohydrate diet. Triplicate groups of fish (5.6 ± 0.2 g) were fed six experimental diets (one low-carbohydrate diet and five high-carbohydrate diets with gradients YCHD) for 10 weeks. The results showed that appropriate YCHD administration reversed the adverse effects of high-carbohydrate diet on the growth performance. Meanwhile, YCHD decreased the depositions of hepatic T-CHO, TG and NEFA, and alleviated lipids deposition in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, as the key energy regulating element, <i>AMPK</i> was significantly increased by YCHD, coupled with high expression of β-oxidation (<i>PPARα</i> and <i>CPT1</i>) and lipids transport (<i>APoB100</i>, <i>MTP</i>, <i>PNPLA7 CD36</i>, <i>CETP</i> and <i>FABP1</i>) genes. Furthermore, PI3K-AKT pathway was prominently suppressed by YCHD, and the expression of lipids synthesis-related genes (<i>ACCA</i>, <i>FAS</i> and <i>SCD1</i>) was notably down-regulated. Additionally, YCHD up-regulated the expression of glycogen metabolism-related genes (<i>GSK3β</i>, <i>PGY</i> and <i>GSY</i>). In summary, our results demonstrated that YCHD promoted lipids β-oxidation and transport, enhanced glucose metabolism and reduced lipids deposition, indicating its beneficial effects on juvenile largemouth bass fed on high-carbohydrate diet.</p>","author":"Ji Liang, \nLiulan Zhao, \nChenxin Gong, \nQiao Liu, \nYifan Hu, \nHao Liu, \nJiazhong Guo, \nRui Huang, \nZhiqiong Li, \nSong Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"81bcdea1ab3a67e150a1cf6e5190322824b6dc6a9cb4f302062bc73b8894da7c","category":"Environment"}
