{"title":"Prognostic Impact of Pulmonary Diseases in 952 Patients with Thoracic and/or Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0070/v1","date":1727781947000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Pulmonary diseases are common in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although high prevalences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer (LC) are known, the prevalence of these and other pulmonary diseases regarding their relation to outcome of TAA and/or AAA are not determined. Methods: Pulmonary diseases present at aortic aneurysm (AA) diagnosis and follow-up periods and cause of death of 952 patients with TAA, AAA, or TAA+AAA (including thoracoabdominal AA) treated at our institution in Japan, were retrospectively analyzed. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate potential risk factors of mortality. Results: Mean patient age was 72.4 years, and median follow-up was 4.92 years. At diagnosis, 528 (55.5%) patients had pulmonary diseases, including emphysema without interstitial lung disease (ILD) or LC, LC, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) without LC, non-IPF ILD without LC, and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) without LC in 250, 85, 65, 15, and 58 patients, respectively. During follow-up, LC and acute exacerbation (AE) of IPF developed in 50 and 12 patients, respectively. In 213 patients who died, there were 45 (21.1%) aortic disease-related deaths. Other causes of death included LC (27.7%), cardiovascular event (9.4%), pneumonia (5.6%), and interstitial lung disease (4.7%). In a multivariate Cox regression hazard model, age, larger maximum aneurysm diameter, and coexisting LC, IPF, or concomitant cancer were associated with poor prognosis. Conclusions: In patients with AA, not only age and aneurysm diameter but also coexisting LC and IPF were prognostic factors for mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7a4dc4b972f3f2b6d4a34fa4501656fb289172ba3a2acc1eaa91989d8c950ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
