{"title":"Interspecific hybridization of decapod crustacean species with commercial interestâ€”A review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12864?af=R","date":1710918000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Interspecies hybridization has been widely used in the development of aquaculture in fish species but there is not much impact in crustacean species. Several species of crustaceans that have been successfully crossed still have low hatching rates and the hybrids obtained have not met expectations. This review tries to summarize and analyse interspecific hybridization of cultured crustacean species (shrimps, lobsters, crayfish and crabs) and its potential for development of crustacean aquaculture production. The success of cross-breeding on several species of shrimp and lobster has been supported by artificial insemination technology. In crabs, artificial insemination cannot be applied and cross-breeding still relies on natural mating with an unstable success rate. In addition to cross-breeding in captivity, cross-breeding of crustacean species (shrimp, lobster, crayfish and crab) in nature has also been found. Interbreeding of crustacean species in nature cannot always be distinguished morphologically, hybrids between them can be known with certainty after carrying out molecular analysis. Even though the level of reproductive performance in cross-breeding of shrimp, lobster, crayfish and crab species is still low, cross-breeding efforts must be continued to obtain more information so that it can later be mapped which species have the potential to develop hybrids for cultivation. Furthermore, growth, reproductive performance, monosex hybridity and disease resistance are all hybrid parameters that must be evaluated.</p>","author":"Muhammad Nur Syafaat, \nMuyassar H.
