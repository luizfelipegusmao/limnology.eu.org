Starting from an experimental database from literature sources, we extend the (<i>P</i>-<i>T</i>) space on which the transport properties are calculated by employing MD simulations and ML predictions, in a synergistic mode. Results refer to all fluid states (gas, liquid, supercritical), under ambient and supercritical conditions, suggesting an alternative path that can be accurately followed to bypass expensive experiments and costly numerical simulations. Nine different ML algorithms are exploited and assessed on their prediction ability, with tree-based architectures achieving increased accuracy on the implied data set. The proposed computational platform runs fast in a common python Jupyter environment, both for MD and ML, and can be adjusted and extended for the calculation of material properties both in interpolation and extrapolation applications.</p>","author":"Christos Stavrogiannis, \nVasilis Tsioulos, \nFilippos Sofos","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"ddcf95420a2ac8a4af5a7f3e34aa7b292c9a6ae88bb3c11c4c4f70715f61b3b5","category":"Environment"}
