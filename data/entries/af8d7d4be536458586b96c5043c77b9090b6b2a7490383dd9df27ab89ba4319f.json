{"title":"Determination of Nine Fentanyl and Six Amphetamine Drugs in Hair Samples by GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0194/v1","date":1725341400000,"content":"Background: We prepared reference materials of fentanyl and amphetamines in hair, and established methods for the certification of reference materials of fentanyl and amphetamines in hair samples. Methods: Hair samples containing 15 drugs were prepared by immersion method (water-dimethylsulfoxide). On the basis of single-factor experiment, Box-Behnken design-response surface was used to optimize the pre-treatment conditions of samples. In MRM/SIM mode, 15 drugs were quantitatively analyzed by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS methods. Results: The contents of 15 drugs in the mixed hair samples were: 1.050 ng mg-1~7.771 ng mg-1, RSDs&amp;lt;7%(n=11). The results showed that the two analytical methods developed were highly sensitive (LODs as low as 0.05 pg mg-1), reproducible (intra-day and inter-day precision RSDs were&amp;lt;10%) and accurate. F-test was performed on the prepared hair samples and the results showed that the homogeneity of the prepared hair samples was good. Conclusions: The established methods were used for the detection of fentanyl and amphetamine drugs in human hair, with high sensitivity, accuracy and specificity. It can be used as a certified method for the development of fentanyl and amphetamine matrix certified reference materials. The developed hair reference materials are expected to be applied in forensic drug abuse detection and laboratory quality control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af8d7d4be536458586b96c5043c77b9090b6b2a7490383dd9df27ab89ba4319f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
