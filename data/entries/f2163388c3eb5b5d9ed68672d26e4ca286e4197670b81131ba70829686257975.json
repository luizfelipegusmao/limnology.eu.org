Hence, the most acceptable fracture analysis is given with the A. A. Griffith studies, since he helped to relate the size of the crack with the stress to the fracture that is generated, through the relationship of a=Kic2πσ2, where the factor <span>\"K\"</span> refers to the value of the stress intensity, the value of \"<span>a\"</span> is the maximum allowable length that the crack can form in mechanical elements. In this condition, the initiation of the crack is considered due to a stress intensifier, caused by the geometry of the cam lubrication vein, in the same way the degradation due to lack of adequate maintenance becomes a stress intensifier that generates a nucleation for the generation of a brittle fracture. The way in which the mentioned nucleation is generated is shown by the finite element analysis, generating a stress <span>7.12 e 7 Pas</span>, if the way in which the crack shown in the model propagates is studied, it will be observed that it is following the appearance of the main maximum stresses [<a href=\"#ozae044.262-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f2163388c3eb5b5d9ed68672d26e4ca286e4197670b81131ba70829686257975","category":"Environment"}
