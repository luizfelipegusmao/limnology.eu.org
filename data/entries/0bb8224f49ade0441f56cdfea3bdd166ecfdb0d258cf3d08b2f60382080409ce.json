However, these findings were based on surveys or retrospective studies with small sample sizes. This study examined if subjects with a previous COVID-19 infection in 2020 experienced sleep disorders in 2021. Using the 2019–2021 Utah All Payers Claims Database (APCD), adults (≥18 to 62 years old in 2019) covered by private insurance and Medicaid were identified. Sleep disorders were identified from the primary and secondary diagnosis in 2021. Baseline characteristics of subjects such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, type of insurance, and comorbid conditions were identified from the database. Entropy balancing was used to balance the baseline characteristics of subjects with and without a COVID-19 infection in 2020. Weighted logistic regression was used to identify significant factors that were associated with sleep disorders. A total of 413,958 subjects were included in the study. The average (SD) age was 38 (17) years old in 2019 and 58% were female. Among the subjects, about 39% had a COVID-19 infection in 2020. Those who had a COVID-19 infection in 2020 were 53% more likely to have a sleep disorder in 2021 (OR = 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.48–1.58). Sleep disorders could be one of long-term COVID-19 symptoms. More screening and observations for those who had a COVID-19 infection could be important to improve sleep related problems.","author":"Jaewhan Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0bb8224f49ade0441f56cdfea3bdd166ecfdb0d258cf3d08b2f60382080409ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
