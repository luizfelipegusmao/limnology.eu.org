{"title":"Methionol as an aggregation-sex pheromone of the desert-dwelling beetle Eustromula valida (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/101/7504767?rss=1","date":1703980800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As part of a long-term project on unraveling the use of pheromones in the large beetle family Cerambycidae, field trials were conducted with generic blends of known cerambycid pheromones at a desert site in southern California. In the first year of testing (2022), the species <span>Eustromula valida</span> (LeConte) (subfamily Cerambycinae, tribe Elaphidiini) and <span>Aethecerinus latecinctus</span> (Horn) (Cerambycinae, Trachyderini) were weakly attracted to one of the lure blends. In follow-up trials in 2023, only <span>E. valida</span> were caught, and collection of volatiles from both sexes of <span>E. valida</span> determined that males sex-specifically produced 3-methylthiopropan-1-ol (methionol), a compound that was not in the tested lure blends. Beetles of both sexes were strongly and specifically attracted to this compound in field bioassays, verifying that it is an aggregation-sex pheromone. No sympatric species were attracted to methionol while it was deployed in the field. Several recent studies have identified methionol as a pheromone component for other cerambycid species in both North and South America, suggesting it may represent another common pheromone component within the Cerambycidae.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"68f03f1f8f40bc98459b48f61fd91b338fe1fe347867b826a7a26e8b30f3218b","category":"Environment"}
