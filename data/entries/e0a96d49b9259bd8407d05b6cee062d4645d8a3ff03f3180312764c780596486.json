{"title":"Evaluating Masks Through the Lens of Evidence-based Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0614/v1","date":1712674106000,"content":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, masks have been promoted as an important tool for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, even though masks are plausible experimental interventions, their mechanistic effectiveness has not been validated by randomized clinical trials (RCTs), with reduction risks of just 1.1-fold (11%) or less. Several meta-analyses have suggested that masks effectively reduce viral transmission, but all of them rely heavily or exclusively on observational data. Indeed, there is a strong inverse correlation between the effectiveness of masks and the number of RCTs included in the meta-analysis. RCTs on alternative therapies often show similar low levels of effectiveness. Thus, masks can be compared with potential new drugs or therapies that failed clinical trials despite showing mechanistic evidence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0a96d49b9259bd8407d05b6cee062d4645d8a3ff03f3180312764c780596486","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
