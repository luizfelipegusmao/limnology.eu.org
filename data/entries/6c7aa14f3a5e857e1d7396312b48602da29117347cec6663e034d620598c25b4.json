{"title":"Effects of a dietary intervention on cardiometabolic risk and food consumption in a workplace","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301826","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Archana Shrestha, Dipesh Tamrakar, Bhawana Ghinanju, Deepa Shrestha, Parashar Khadka, Bikram Adhikari, Jayana Shrestha, Suruchi Waiwa, Prajjwal Pyakurel, Niroj Bhandari, Biraj Man Karmacharya, Akina Shrestha, Rajeev Shrestha, Rajendra Dev Bhatta, Vasanti Malik, Josiemer Mattei, Donna Spiegelman</p>\r\nBackground <p>Worksite-based health programs have shown positive impacts on employee health and have led to significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factor profiles. We aimed to determine the effect of cafeteria intervention on cardio-metabolic risk factors diet in a worksite setting (Dhulikhel Hospital) in Nepal.</p> Methods <p>In this one-arm pre-post intervention study, we recruited 277 non-pregnant hospital employees aged 18â€“60 with prediabetes or pre-hypertension. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03447340; 2018/02/27). All four cafeterias in the hospital premises received cafeteria intervention encouraging healthy foods and discouraging unhealthy foods for six months. We measured blood pressure, fasting glucose level, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol in the laboratory, and diet intake (in servings per week) using 24-hour recall before and six months after the intervention. The before and after measures were compared using paired-t tests.</p> Results <p>After six months of cafeteria intervention, the median consumption of whole grains, mono/polyunsaturated fat, fruits, vegetable and nuts servings per week increased by 2.24(p&lt;0.001), 2.88(p&lt;0.001), 0.84(p&lt;0.001) 2.25(p&lt;0.001) and nuts 0.55 (p&lt;0.001) servings per week respectively. The median consumption of refined grains decreased by 5.07 servings per week (p&lt;0.001). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 2 mmHg (SE = 0.6; p = 0.003) and 0.1 mmHg (SE = 0.6; p = 0.008), respectively. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was significantly reduced by 6 mg/dL (SE = 1.4; p&lt;0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Overall, we found a decrease in consumption of refined grains and an increase in consumption of whole grains, unsaturated fats, fruits, and nuts observed a modest reduction in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol following a 6-month cafeteria-based worksite intervention incorporating access to healthy foods.</p>","author":"Archana Shrestha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6c7aa14f3a5e857e1d7396312b48602da29117347cec6663e034d620598c25b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
