{"title":"Sulfur-Based Energy Storage Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0473/v1","date":1725586826000,"content":"The increasing global demand for efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions has driven the exploration of sulfur-based battery technologies. Sulfurâ€™s abundance, low cost, and high theoretical energy density make it a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy systems. This paper reviews the development of sulfur-based batteries, including lithium-sulfur (Li-S), sodium-sulfur (Na-S), magnesium-sulfur (Mg-S), solid-state sulfur, sulfur-carbon nanocomposites, and hybrid sulfur flow batteries. Each technology is analyzed based on its advantages, challenges, and potential applications. Key research areas such as advanced electrolytes, nanomaterial integration, and sustainable manufacturing are highlighted, along with the current technological barriers to large-scale adoption. This review underscores the importance of continued research and innovation in sulfur-based battery technology to meet future energy storage demands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e5c1cd8a961c2ca9e3035aad49a2545bed44a002619287b5f8e7c8aabfb26ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
