{"title":"177Lu Anti-angiogenic Radioimmunotherapy Targeting ATP synthase in Gastric Cancer Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1497/v1","date":1716453386000,"content":"This study investigated a novel radioimmunotherapy strategy for targeting tumor angiogenesis. We developed a radiopharmaceutical complex by labeling an anti-adenosine triphosphate syn-thase (ATPS) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with the radioisotope 177Lu using DOTA as a chelating agent. 177Lu-DOTA-ATPS mAb demonstrated high labeling efficiency (99.0%) and stability in se-rum. MKN-45 cancer cells exhibited the highest cellular uptake, which could be specifically blocked by unlabeled ATPS mAb. In mice, 177Lu-DOTA-ATPS mAb accumulated significantly in tumors, with a tumor uptake of 16.0 Â± 1.5%ID/g on day 7. 177Lu-DOTA-ATPS mAb treatment sig-nificantly reduced the viability of MKN-45 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In a xenograft tumor model, this radioimmunotherapy strategy led to substantial tumor growth inhibition (82.8%). Furthermore, combining 177Lu-DOTA-ATPS mAb with sunitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug, en-hanced the therapeutic efficacy of sunitinib in the mouse model. Our study successfully developed 177Lu-DOTA-ATPS mAb, a radioimmunotherapy agent targeting tumor blood vessels. This ap-proach demonstrates significant promise for inhibiting tumor growth, both as a single therapy and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28fde2c2039531088b4c03f558c94aa5227774c754887d2d747e1f40aaa63182","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
