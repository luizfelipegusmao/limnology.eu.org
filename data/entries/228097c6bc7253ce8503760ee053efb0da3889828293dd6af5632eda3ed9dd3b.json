{"title":"A systematic review of the factors associated with malaria infection among forest rangers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303406","date":1715781600000,"content":"<p>by Rahmat Dapari, Muhamad Zazali Fikri Mohd Yusop, Dharsshini Chinnasamy, Nurul Izati Zakaria, Siti Munisah Mohd Shoaib, Mohd Erfan Edros</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Malaria is a vector-borne disease that initially manifests as fever, headache, and chills. The illness could progress to more severe conditions, including lethargy, impaired consciousness, convulsions, shortness of breath, blood in urine, jaundice, and haemorrhage if left untreated. The risk of contracting malaria is considerably heightened in specific occupational settings, particularly among forest rangers, following frequent exposure to natural habitats. Consequently, advancing the understanding of malaria and emphasising how specific occupational environments (including those of forest rangers) contribute to disease risk and management is imperative.</p> Objective <p>The present study aims to determine the factors associated with malaria infection among forest rangers by systematically reviewing electronic articles from three databases (EBSCOhost, ScienceDirect, and ResearchGate).</p> Methods <p>The current review was prepared based on the updated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. First, three independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the data collected. The information was then stored in Endnote20 based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The articles were critically appraised with the mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT) to assess their quality.</p> Result <p>A total of 103, 31, and 51 articles from EBSCOhost, ScienceDirect, and ResearchGate, respectively, were selected, resulting in 185 unique hits. Nevertheless, only 63 full-text publications were assessed following a rigorous selection screening, from which only five were included in the final review. The studies revealed that several factors contribute to malaria infection among forest rangers. The parameters were classified into sociodemographic, individual, and living condition-related.</p> Conclusion <p>A better understanding of malaria progresses and identifying its potential risk factors is essential to impact worker well-being. The findings might be utilised to improve malaria infection prevention programme implementations, hence maximising their success. Pre-employment and regular health screenings could also aid in evaluating and identifying potential risks for malaria infection among forest rangers.</p>","author":"Rahmat Dapari","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"228097c6bc7253ce8503760ee053efb0da3889828293dd6af5632eda3ed9dd3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
