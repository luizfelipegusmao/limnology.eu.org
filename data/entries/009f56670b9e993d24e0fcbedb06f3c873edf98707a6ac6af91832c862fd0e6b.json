{"title":"Selected Micropollutants Removal from Municipal Wastewater","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0170/v1","date":1712047812000,"content":"Micropollutants belongs to various groups of chemicals. One of the most diverse and large group of them are pharmaceuticals. The presence of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater poses a significant challenge to water quality and environmental health. This paper provides an overview of recent advancements in the removal of pharmaceuticals from water, focusing on various treatment processes and their effectiveness in eliminating micropollutants. Through a review of literature, including studies on ozonation, UV irradiation, sulphate radical-based tech-nologies, and photocatalytic processes, insights into degradation mechanisms and optimal con-ditions for their removal are synthesized. Additionally, with new legislation mandating the monitoring of selected micropollutants and the implementation of quaternary treatment in wastewater treatment plants, the paper discusses prospects for future research and recommen-dations for effective pharmaceuticals removal. Key actions include conducting comprehensive laboratory and pilot trials, implementing quaternary treatment of wastewaters, continuously monitoring of water quality, investing in research and development, and promoting collabora-tion and knowledge sharing among stakeholders. By embracing these strategies, we can work towards safeguarding water resources and protecting public health from the adverse effects of pharmaceutical contamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"009f56670b9e993d24e0fcbedb06f3c873edf98707a6ac6af91832c862fd0e6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
