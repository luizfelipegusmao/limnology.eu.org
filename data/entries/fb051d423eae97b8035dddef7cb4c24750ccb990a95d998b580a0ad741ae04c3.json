{"title":"Male Body Odor Affects Emotional State, LH and Cortisol Secretion in Women of Different Age Groups","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0651/v1","date":1718093357000,"content":"Hormone changes across women's menstrual cycle may lead to changes in perception of chemical signals and hormonal responses to these cues. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of menstrual cycle phase on the effects of extracts of male axillary secretions (EMAS) in women. We tested healthy reproductive age and premenopausal women (n=29). EMAS/control solution was applied once in two hours either in the follicular or luteal phase, while collecting saliva samples for LH and cortisol monitoring. LH and cortisol concentrations were analyzed using EIA technique. PANAS and VAS were used to assess the mood. We observed a significant increase in the number of LH peaks (p=0.0447) and their amplitude (p=0.0469) when EMAS was applied in the follicular phase. The same application in the luteal phase lowered the amplitude of LH peaks (p=0.0382). EMAS application increases salivary cortisol level in reproductive age women relative to premenopausal women (p=0.0032). PANAS revealed changes in positive and negative affect after EMAS application. Our data indicate the significance of the menstrual cycle phase for EMAS effects on LH secretion, mood, but not on cortisol secretion in women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb051d423eae97b8035dddef7cb4c24750ccb990a95d998b580a0ad741ae04c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
