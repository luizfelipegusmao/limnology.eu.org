{"title":"Comparative life‐history strategies in three Lebiasinidae (Characiformes) in a Rio Negro tributary, Brazilian Amazon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15875?af=R","date":1721290857000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Reproductive traits co-evolve and form successful life-history strategies adapted to the biology and environment of a particular taxon, maximizing offspring and species survival chances, therefore studies investigating differences in adaptive traits across different environments can enhance our understanding of the natural selection process and evolution. Herein, we address whether the reproductive strategies of phylogenetically closely related fishes are influenced by habitat predictability, using three species of the Lebiasinidae family as models. The predominance of larger and mature individuals during the flood season, with high waters characterized by smaller immature individuals, suggests a seasonal reproductive strategy for <i>Nannostomus trifasciatus</i>. <i>Copella callolepis</i>, which inhabits both habitats, also showed a single reproductive peak. However, compared to <i>N. trifasciatus</i>, this species displayed late spawning, restricted to the flood season, as indicated by the higher abundance of larger and mature individuals during this period and the presence of smaller (juveniles) and spawned individuals in the following season. The reproductive tactics observed in <i>N. marginatus</i> differed significantly from the single reproductive peak of the other species, as two reproductive peaks were observed: one during the flood season and another during the low water season. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the environment strongly influences reproductive strategies for lebiasinids. <i>N. marginatus</i>, restricted to small water bodies, exhibited an opportunistic reproductive strategy, whereas the species inhabiting main rivers, <i>N. trifasciatus</i> and <i>C. callolepis</i>, exhibited a more seasonal strategy.</p>","author":"Bruno B.
