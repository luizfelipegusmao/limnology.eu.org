{"title":"Secure Key Exchange in Tropical Cryptography: Leveraging Efficiency with Advanced Block Matrix Protocols","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0123/v1","date":1712020101000,"content":"In the quest for robust and efficient digital communication, this paper introduces cutting-edge key exchange protocols leveraging tropical semirings’ computational prowess and block matrices’ structural resilience. Moving away from the conventional use of finite fields, these protocols deliver markedly faster processing speeds and heightened security. We present two implementations of our concept, each utilizing a different platform for the set of commuting matrices: one employing tropical polynomials of matrices and the other employing Linde-de la Puente matrices. The inherent simplicity of tropical semirings leads to a decrease in operational complexity, and using block matrices enhances our protocols’ security profile. The security of these protocols relies on the Matrix Decomposition Problem. We also provide a comparative analysis of our protocols against existing matrix block-based protocols in finite fields. This research marks a significant shift in cryptographic protocol design, specifically tailored for demanding engineering applications, and sets a new standard in secure and efficient digital communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88306a0b94c2bb3ae31d5f08156fa31f838187ed5fa64dd4387a4ca11e08a867","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
