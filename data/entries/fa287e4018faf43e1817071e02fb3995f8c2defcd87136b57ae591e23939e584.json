{"title":"Atom Exchange Radical Cyclization: A Sustainable Synthetic Approach Towards New Functionalized Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0158/v1","date":1714713096000,"content":"In this study, we demonstrate the direct preparation of dihalo-Î³-lactams featuring two distinct halogens from dichloroamides using a novel Atom Exchange Radical Cyclization (AERC) procedure. This method integrates the established Atom Transfer Radical Cyclization with halogen exchange in solution. The technique operates under mild conditions and requires little amounts of metallic copper, serving as both a supplemental activator and reducing agent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa287e4018faf43e1817071e02fb3995f8c2defcd87136b57ae591e23939e584","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
