{"title":"A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Analysis of Self-Reported Adverse Events Following Immunization with the Shingrix Vaccine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0502/v1","date":1720163849000,"content":"This paper investigates the safety profile of the Shingrix vaccine, focusing particularly on persistent adverse events post-vaccination. Shingrix, crucial for preventing shingles caused by the varicella-zoster virus, has shown efficacy in clinical trials but is associated with varying degrees of adverse reactions. This retrospective, cross-sectional survey-based study, spanning two years and involving 77 respondents who experienced severe adverse events after vaccination, reveals a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including reports of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and neuropathy. These findings underscore the need for ongoing vigilance in vaccine safety monitoring and highlight the importance of personalized care approaches for managing post-vaccination adverse effects. The study aims to contribute to informed decision-making regarding shingles vaccination strategies and calls for continued research into the long-term safety and efficacy of Shingrix.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c56efe21baae293159172870645cd7c40459c97b9a8d35c352c1623c23f33152","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
