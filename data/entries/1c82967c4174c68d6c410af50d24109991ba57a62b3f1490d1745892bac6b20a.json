With the push to achieve manned missions to Mars and increase the analytical reach of unmanned spacecraft, or even fully understand space in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), understanding how the intense environment of space affects the electronics of analytical and operational equipment becomes important for: the longevity of the experiment; requirements on shielding; and understanding the evolution of materials and potential failures or artifacts that may arise. While this understanding of materials under the irradiating environment of space is important, sending materials to orbit for various exposure times is expensive. Simulating space-based irradiation on-planet gives a first order approximation for the main effects of material evolution. Here we examine the effects of irradiation on a GaN stack on Si under a series of irradiation conditions by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging and correlative atom probe tomography (APT) to understand the evolution of the material and how interfaces, such as might be expected in power electronics, affect that evolution including crystallinity and diffusion across interface boundaries.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1c82967c4174c68d6c410af50d24109991ba57a62b3f1490d1745892bac6b20a","category":"Environment"}
