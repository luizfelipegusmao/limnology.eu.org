{"title":"Post-Operative Tearing of Zygomatic Implant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2249/v1","date":1727674023000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Total rehabilitation of atrophic maxillae with zygomatic implants (ZI) has become a more common practice nowadays. However, the need for training and expertise of surgeons to correctly perform the technique in order to minimize possible complications has been described. The objective of this article is to describe an atypical case of tearing for 24 hours after the installation of a zygomatic implant. Materials and Methods: A 58-year-old male patient, with dark skin, without systemic alterations, who during the installation of one of the ZIs suffered a greenstick fracture of the zygomatic body, thus, a second, deeper milling was performed in the zygomatic body. Results: After the uneventful surgical procedure, the molding was performed, and the patient complained of excessive tearing in his right eye with regression 24 hours after surgery. The implant-supported prosthesis was installed one week after surgery and the patient continues to rehabilitate without functional or aesthetic complaints.Conclusions:Therefore, since the literature on the subject of postoperative complications of ZIs is still scarce, we believe that since the milling and installation of IZs are always close to the foramen of the zygomaticofacial nerve, this type of complication may become more frequent due to the increase in indications for rehabilitation using ZIs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99fe974a6a03ca8010ec6cb96566c1016a055b7d856e9f6de20ec4ec7bf12c10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
