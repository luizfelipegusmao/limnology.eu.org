{"title":"Thinking the Unthinkable: An Alternative Route to a Unified Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2457/v1","date":1727709033000,"content":"One of the greatest quests in physics in current times is the search for a grand unified theory â€“ to bring all the forces of nature into one coherent explanatory framework. Despite two centuries of progress, both in comprehending the individual forces and formulating mathematical constructs to explain the existence and operation of such forces, the final step to unify the localised atomic and subatomic forces with gravity has proven to be elusive. The pursuit for an answer has been driving physicists to explore increasingly extraordinary ideas from string theory to various other options requiring multiple dimensions. There may be another approach, which instead looks afresh at our comprehension of the nature of matter. By changing our perspective, including altering how we interpret the mathematics underpinning entropy, it is possible to derive a provocative and compelling alternative solution, which not only allows for an appreciation of all the forces of nature including gravity within a singular explanatory construct but also resolves other puzzles, such as what causes entropy, why wave/particle duality and how to reconcile the physical with the social and life sciences. The outcome, however, challenges our whole understanding of the universe and fundamentally changes our relationship with matter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0b2ba7a365af56370882fd57e5ce8fc2bbbc3c384a6c1969a8f6ced3b8664ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
