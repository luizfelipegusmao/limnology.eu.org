{"title":"Unraveling the Impact of Climate Change on Fish Physiology: A Focus on Temperature and Salinity Dynamics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5782274?af=R","date":1728967748000,"content":"<p>In recent decades, climate change has significantly altered the environmental dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, profoundly impacting the intricate balance of life within them. This review paper delves into the multifaceted impacts of climate change on the physiology of aquatic life, emphasizing temperature and salinity as pivotal ecological factors unique to aquatic environments. The intricate relationship between rising global temperatures and their repercussions on freshwater and seawater habitats forms the cornerstone of this exploration. Elevated temperatures and escalating frequency of extreme heatwave events have reshaped the paradigm for fish survival, pushing them beyond optimal temperature thresholds. Furthermore, the study delves into the interconnection of seemingly disparate abiotic factors, where heightened greenhouse gas concentrations amplify coastal winds, precipitating coastal upwelling. The consequence—nutrient-rich yet oxygen-deprived waters—fuels a cascade of challenges, inducing hypoxic conditions that significantly impact aquatic organisms. The plight of fish, as ectotherms finely tuned to environmental fluctuations, is underscored, illuminating their susceptibility to temperature variations. The direct correlation between external and internal temperatures, exacerbated by climate-induced fluctuations, accentuates the urgency of addressing climate change’s impact on aquatic habitats. This review disentangles the complex web of interconnected environmental shifts, illuminating their far-reaching repercussions on the physiology of aquatic life. It emphasizes the imperative for collective endeavors aimed at understanding and addressing the challenges imposed by our evolving climate on these indispensable ecosystems.</p>","author":"Deepak Agarwal, \nSeerappalli Aran Shanmugam, \nAyyathurai Kathirvelpandian, \nSuresh Eswaran, \nMohd Ashraf Rather, \nGowrimanohari Rakkannan, \nPronob Das","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"3e5250f7caed6e4e263f9665cdbd374a7edc0963dd36017f34e2db0be9b36806","category":"Environment"}
