{"title":"Orthodontic alloy wires and their hypoallergenic alternatives: corrosion in artificial saliva","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0078/v1","date":1719831674000,"content":"Today, legislative framework addresses the metal alloysâ€™ corrosion issues, demanding the re-striction of use of the probable carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction at humans (CMG) metals, like nickel, cobalt and chromium, and demand to develop new biomaterials. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate and compare ion release of standard dental alloys and their hypoallergenic equivalents. Six types of orthodontic alloy wires (nickel-titanium (NiTi), coated NiTi, stainless steel (SS), Ni-free SS, cobalt-chromium (CoCr), and titanium-molybdenum (TMA) were immersed into artificial saliva of pH 5.5 and 6.6. Release of metal ions was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) after 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. Data analyses were done using analysis of variance, results with P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ddfa32f37a2b6a7294dde828edd938b041d4b0e79573b64ccfb421d25b54ecf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
