{"title":"Optimization of High-Temperature CO2 Capture by Lithium Orthosilicate-Based Sorbents Using Response Surface Methodology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0448/v1","date":1720155574000,"content":"The major challenge in the current context of a rising world’s energy demand is to limit the global temperature increase for mitigating climate change. This goal requires a large reduction of CO2 emissions, mainly produced by power generation and industrial processes using fossil fuels. In this study, a novel methodology for K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents production for CO2 capture at high temperature was adopted based on the Design of Experiments (DoE). Different synthesis (temperature and K2CO3 content) and adsorption conditions (sorption temperature and CO2 concentration) were systematically tested by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain predictive models of CO2 uptake and Li4SiO4 conversion. The results of RSM analysis evidenced a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.4 mg/g for a sorbent produced at 600 °C and with 36.9 wt% of K2CO3, tested at 500 °C and 4 vol% of CO2. Whereas at 50 vol% of CO2, the best uptake of 295.6 mg/g was obtained with a sorbent synthesized at 600 °C, containing less K2CO3 (17.1 wt%) and tested at higher temperature (662 °C). The obtained results highlight that K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents can be tailored for maximizing CO2 capture at different operating conditions, making them suitable for use in industrial processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59edeff38a738a93a8953a2d830b3838c9b56d3586a3eb8d2f64e7012abe383b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
