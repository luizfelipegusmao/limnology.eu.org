{"title":"PVC/CNT Electrospun Composites: Morphology, Thermal and Impedance Spectra","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1875/v1","date":1721814665000,"content":"PVC/CNT membranes were electrospun, and subsequently characterized by thermal analyses (TGA and DSC), transmission and scanning electron microscopies (TEM and FEG) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). TEM images show that most of the nanotubes were encapsulated, inside the fibers and oriented along them. FEG showed no significant differences in the average diameters. The CNTs caused a significant reduction (up to 20 Â°C) in the glass transition temperature (Tg) in relation to the resin and a positive impact on thermal stability. Nyquist plots is possible to observe a charge transfer resistance of 38 and 40 Mohm, respectively, for pure PVC and PVC/CNT 3%. It is suggested the high porosity and encapsulation of CNTs in the fibers prevents the formation of a percolation network. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of the encapsulation of CNTs  in morphology, thermal and impedance spectra of electrospun composites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db0951b4e2bd1749adc096a0868505e1b2b4374894a2b9b46a9bd9dbf95fa550","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
