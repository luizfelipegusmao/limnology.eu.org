On the other hand, it is important to consider the extreme working conditions that engineering parts are exposed to and their useful life; therefore, guaranteeing good adhesion by means of boriding can be the key to reducing wear and improving the useful life of engineering parts.

Currently, there is little literature on adhesion with thermochemical reuse processes, with the purpose of preserving the environment and obtaining a layer with good adhesion in order to extend the life of the parts.
