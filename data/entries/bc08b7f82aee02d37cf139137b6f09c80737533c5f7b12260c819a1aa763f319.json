{"title":"Open-ended Ridged Waveguide Elements for LEO Direct Radiating Arrays in Ka-band","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0258/v1","date":1719928424000,"content":"This paper presents an extensive performance analysis of open-ended waveguide elements for direct radiating arrays with high scan angle (± 50º/60º). The evaluated designs are based on square and hexagonal apertures loaded with ridges. Both square and triangular lattices are considered in the framework of Ka-band downlink design requirements for future LEO mega-constellations. The parameter space defined by the monomodal condition has been explored to find an optimum value for each structure. The analyses are validated with both infinite and finite full-wave models in terms of active reflection coefficient, scan loss and cross-polar discrimination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc08b7f82aee02d37cf139137b6f09c80737533c5f7b12260c819a1aa763f319","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
