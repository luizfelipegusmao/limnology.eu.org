{"title":"Existences Results for Some Nonsingular $p$-Kirchhoff Problems with $\\psi$-Hilfer Fractional Derivative","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1687/v1","date":1711543099000,"content":"In this paper, we prove the existence of three solutions for a  $p$-Kirchhoff problem with $\\psi$-Hilfer fractional derivative. To be more precise, we use the variational method and we prove that the associated functional energy admits a critical point in each of the three constructed sets, these critical points are weak solutions for a studied problem. Moreover, by definition of these sets, one of these solutions is positive, the second is negative, and the third one change sign. At the end of this work, we present an example to validate our main results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1033235a0ef0fd32332d4cfc00d50d8e491728f85ea5a36e8d19a865f7ca2153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
