{"title":"Evaluation of Improvest effects on production parameters of gilts from two different genetic sire lines","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad144/7492715?rss=1","date":1703289600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to evaluate the effects of Improvest on the performance and carcass characteristics of gilts from two different genetic sire lines and the performance of Improvest gilts with castrated male pigs. It was hypothesized that performance parameters observed for Improvest gilts would be similar to barrows, thus narrowing the performance gaps between traditionally managed gilts and barrows. Pigs were from Large White/Landrace dams and either Duroc–Pietrain (<strong>DP</strong>) or Duroc (<strong>D</strong>) sires. Females within each genetic sire line were randomized by weight to receive the first dose of Improvest (<strong>IMP</strong>) on day 25 of the study or to serve as a nontreated control (DP IMP gilt (<span>n</span> = 6 pens; 19 pigs/pen), D IMP gilt (<span>n</span> = 6 pens; 19 pigs/pen), DP CON gilt (<span>n</span> = 6 pens; 19 pigs/pen), D CON gilt (<span>n</span> = 6 pens; 19 pigs/pen). The second dose of Improvest was administered 6 wk later (i.e., day 67). Barrows did not receive Improvest (DP barrow [<span>n</span> = 10 pens; 19 to 20 pigs/pen], D barrow [<span>n</span> = 10 pens; 19 to 20 pigs/pen]). Average daily gain (<strong>ADG</strong>), average daily feed intake (<strong>ADFI</strong>), and gain-to-feed ratio (<strong>G:F</strong>) were measured at 21 d intervals throughout the duration of the study. The targeted weight for pigs to be marketed was 133 ± 2.5 kg. Carcass characteristics and loin quality parameters were evaluated on a subset of pigs (<span>n</span> = 283). Improvest-treated gilts of both genetic lines had increased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) ADG and ADFI compared to untreated gilts during the post-second dose intervals with values exceeding that of barrows from day 84 to marketing. Overall, DP IMP gilts had increased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) G:F post-second dose compared to DP CON gilts and DP barrows, yet all other treatments were similar. As pigs were marketed at a similar weight, there was no difference in the final weight, however, DP IMP gilts and DP barrows reached market weight sooner (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) than DP CON gilts (109.9 and 111.8 vs. 114.3 ± 0.8 d). Backfat and loin weight were greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) in IMP gilts versus CON gilts, while IMP gilts and barrows had similar values within each respective genetic sire line. There were no differences between treatments (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.08) for pH and instrumental color of the loins. When the pass rate of loins (Japanese color score ≥ 3.0 and marbling ≥ 2.0) was evaluated, IMP gilts were at intermediate values between CON gilts and barrows for each respective genetic sire line. Overall, Improvest within a genetic line improved gilt carcass measurements so that they were more similar to barrows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"a88d2d446cb442c4e7bf54eef06365225bd1ddb8d48b88310b80d0acaa4932c9","category":"Environment"}
