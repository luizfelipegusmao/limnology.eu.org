{"title":"Analysis of YouTube-Based Therapeutic Content for Children with Cerebral Palsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0564/v1","date":1718009997000,"content":"Cerebral palsy (CP) presents challenges in movement and posture due to central nervous system damage, necessitating lifelong management. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited access to traditional treatments, increasing demand for home-based therapies and digital resources. This study analyzed the qualitative and quantitative aspects of YouTube videos focusing on CP therapy for children. In total, 95 videos were evaluated for content quality, therapeutic program efficacy, and popularity. Most videos were uploaded by health professionals. Neuromotor therapy types varied, with Bobath therapy being prominent. The quality assessments revealed moderate to high reliability in video content; nonetheless, shortcomings in addressing uncertainties were observed. Therapeutic programs often lack crucial details such as intensity and outcome assessment methods. No significant differences were found between professional and non-professional uploads. Classifiable videos based on exercise type, in contrast to the types of neuromotor therapy, exhibited better therapeutic quality than unclassified ones. Notably, video popularity did not correlate with quality. This study underscores the need for improved educational content on YouTube, particularly in providing comprehensive therapeutic information for CP management. Further refinement of evaluation tools is essential for assessing the rationale behind neuromotor therapeutic modalities for children with CP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39324351aa095a736eed727f8221edd94a1dd02a333c58774466a83c73c47aa6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
