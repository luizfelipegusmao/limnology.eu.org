{"title":"Evaluation of the Damage and Neuroprotective Effects in the Central Nervous System Using a Model of Perinatal Asphyxia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.405/7719762?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Impaired gas exchange close to labor causes perinatal asphyxia (PA), a neurodevelopmental impairment factor, PA is an obstetric complication that strongly affects brain structure and function he estimated incidence of this life-threatening complication ranges from 1 to 8 up to 26 per 1,000 live births in developed and developing countries, respectively PA is associated with high morbimortality in term and preterm neonates. Nearly 25 % of the newborns who survive PA develop neurological disorders such cerebral palsy and certain neurodevelopmental and learning disabilities where synaptic connectivity disturbances may be involved. Since pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by PA are not still totally unveiled, we investigated changes in the cytoskeleton organization, synapse, and astrocytes in the nervous tissue along the time. For this study, we used a well-established murine model of PA (1). After one, two, four and 6 months of severe PA (19 min) rats were sacrificed and their brains were analyzed by combining photooxidation, conventional electron microscopy and electron tomography 3-D reconstruction techniques in two areas hypoxia sensible: neostriatum and hippocampus. Slightly modifications we observed at 21 days of PA in the different regions of the brain (1). After one month of PA, we found an increase in the F-actin staining in neostriatal and hippocampal dendritic spines together with some filopodia-likes structures, a typical embryonic type of spines in photo-oxidated tissue. In contrast, after second month of PA, spines were less consistent phalloidin-stained. In addition, we observed an increment of marker for neuronal and glial dysfunction such as GFAP, neurofilament and MAP-2 (2). These modifications were more clearly defined after 4 months of PA-(3) After 6 months of PA postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in neostriatum were highly modified. Using three-D reconstructions and electron tomography we were able to find clear signs of degeneration in the asphyctic PSDs (4). Some of these results were replicated in cell cultures under hypoxic conditions. Several neuroprotective agents (hypothermia, palmitoylethanolamide, steroids analogs, thioredoxins) showed high efficiency in reverting sone of theses alterations Therefore, we hypothesize that the cytoskeletal adjustment induced by PA in the rat CNS could lead to the severe modifications in synapse and related structures that trigger neuronal damage. At the beginning filopodia formation suggest that the brain train to rescue or recovery part of the damage neurons. However cellular response is not enough, and synapse are severely modified. In addition, high resolution technique such as Electron tomography, 3-D reconstruction and photooxidation contributed to dissect critical alterations generated by PA that are not easily displayed using conventional microscopic techniques. Alterations are well correlated with some impairment in behavioral test related with learning and memory and triggered some biochemical password (6, 7). These modifications are used to determine the grade of damage that allow to use more precise therapeutic tools that are tested in my laboratory such as thioredoxins (8, 9), palmitoylethanolamide (1) and estradiol and its analogues.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"539da73f5b999de034f024107c48efdc88f160b1650d8502a857b942cd9bb5c4","category":"Environment"}
