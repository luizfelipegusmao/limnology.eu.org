{"title":"Entropy and Energy for Non-Mechanical Work at the Bose-Einstein Transition of a Harmonically Trapped Gas Using an Empirical Global-Variable Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1225/v1","date":1718703295000,"content":"Quantum thermal engines are receiving much attention in recent years, due to their potential applications.~For a candidate group, harmonically trapped gases under Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), we see little investigation on the energy transference around that transition.~Therefore, we present an empirical study with rubidium-87 gas samples in a magnetic harmonic trap.~We developed an empirical Equation of State model to fit to our experimental dataset, expressing the pressure parameter ($\\mathcal{P}$) in terms of temperature ($T$) and six technical coeffcients ($\\{a_i\\}_{0,\\dots,4}$, $T_\\mathrm{th}$), functions of volume parameter ($\\mathcal{V}$) and number of atoms ($N$).~For weakly interacting gases, the internal energy is $U\\cong3\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{V}$, thus we determine the entropy with $U = TS - \\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{V}$ for fixed $N$.~As expected, we show that the entropy at the BEC transition ($S_c$) is constant for varying $\\mathcal{V}$.~Being isentropic makes BEC transition an energy source for non-mechanical work.~Hence, we observed that the enthalpy at the BEC transition $H_c = E_c + \\mathcal{P}_c\\mathcal{V} = T_cS_c$, at fixed values of $\\mathcal{V}$ and varying $N$, grows fairly linearly with $N$.~We fitted $H_c=\\eta{N}-H_c^0$ to that data, being $\\eta$ the specific enthalpy of BEC transformation and $H_c^0$ an intrinsic enthalpic loss.~We deem this study to be a step closer to practical quantum-based engines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df122276025b90767228d80da235a413791fac1f9ddd4b4345689a09f70b9623","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
