{"title":"Machine learning reveals that climate, geography, and cultural drift all predict bird song variation in coastal Zonotrichia leucophrys","link":"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/doi/10.1093/ornithology/ukad062/7478684?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Previous work has demonstrated that there is extensive variation in the songs of White-crowned Sparrow (<span>Zonotrichia leucophrys</span>) throughout the species range, including between neighboring (and genetically distinct) subspecies <span>Z. l. nuttalli</span> and <span>Z. l. pugetensis</span>. Using a machine learning approach to bioacoustic analysis, we demonstrate that variation in song is correlated with year of recording (representing cultural drift), geographic distance, and climatic differences, but the response is subspecies- and season-specific. Automated machine learning methods of bird song annotation can process large datasets more efficiently, allowing us to examine 1,913 recordings across ~60 years. We utilize a recently published artificial neural network to automatically annotate White-crowned Sparrow vocalizations. By analyzing differences in syllable usage and composition, we recapitulate the known pattern where <span>Z. l. nuttalli</span> and <span>Z. l. pugetensis</span> have significantly different songs. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that these differences are caused by the changes in characteristics of syllables in the White-crowned Sparrow repertoire. This supports the hypothesis that the evolution of vocalization behavior is affected by the environment, in addition to population structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithology Current Issue","siteHash":"4b42e15d9ceec568e037973cb16bc8a0448c103c6eaf3f714117d3650f8eefe7","entryHash":"a726c9e40ee33e45a07094cbfe4f1880ba3c2514baacc674427274d7abe27c2c","category":"Environment"}
