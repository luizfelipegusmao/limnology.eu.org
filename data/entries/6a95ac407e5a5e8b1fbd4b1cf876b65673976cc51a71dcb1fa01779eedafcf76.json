{"title":"Habitat engineering effects of freshwater mussels in rivers vary across spatial scales","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05545-y","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Ecosystem engineers alter habitat and resource availability within ecosystems, but the magnitude of these effects depends on abiotic context and spatial scale. We examined how the effects of freshwater mussels, an ecosystem engineer, changed with spatial scale. We combined a field enclosure experiment and comparative field study to evaluate associations among mussels and macroinvertebrate communities across three spatial scales: mussel individuals (~ 0.01 m<sup>2</sup>), patches of mussels (0.25 m<sup>2</sup>), and large aggregations of many mussel patches (mussel beds, ~ 1000 m<sup>2</sup>). We used canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning to evaluate how mussel abundance, food availability, substrate heterogeneity, and flow influenced macroinvertebrate communities. We found that mussels’ influence on macroinvertebrate communities differed among spatial scales. At the smallest scale, macroinvertebrate density increased on the shells of live mussels, likely due to mussel influences on food availability to grazers. At the patch scale, we found no mussel effects, likely because they were overridden by a flood event. At the mussel bed scale, macroinvertebrate communities were primarily controlled by flow and secondarily by food availability. As such, the continued loss of freshwater mussels means the loss of habitat creation and food provisioning for other aquatic groups, and alteration of facilitation landscapes within streams.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"6a95ac407e5a5e8b1fbd4b1cf876b65673976cc51a71dcb1fa01779eedafcf76","category":"Environment"}
