However, the specific molecular and neural processes modulated by steroid hormones to generate social behaviors remain to be elucidated. We investigated whether some actions of androgen signaling in the control of social behavior may occur through the regulation of estradiol synthesis in the highly social cichlid fish, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>. Specifically, we examined the expression of <i>cyp19a1</i>, a brain-specific aromatase, in the brains of male <i>A. burtoni</i> lacking a functional ARα gene (<i>ar1</i>), which was recently found to be necessary for aggression in this species. We found that <i>cyp19a1</i> expression is higher in wild-type males compared to <i>ar1</i> mutant males in the anterior tuberal nucleus (ATn), the putative fish homolog of the mammalian ventromedial hypothalamus, a brain region that is critical for aggression across taxa. Using <i>in situ</i> hybridization chain reaction, we determined that <i>cyp19a1<sup>+</sup>\n</i> cells coexpress <i>ar1</i> throughout the brain, including in the ATn. We speculate that ARα may modulate <i>cyp19a1</i> expression in the ATn to govern aggression in <i>A. burtoni</i>. These studies provide novel insights into the hormonal mechanisms of social behavior in teleosts and lay a foundation for future functional studies.</p>","author":"Mariana S. Lopez, \nBeau A.
