{"title":"Chaotic Oscillations in a System of Two Coupled Self-Oscillatorswith Dedicated Inertia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1289/v1","date":1716201379000,"content":"Using the example of a generator model with dedicated inertia, a theoretical study of two coupled self-oscillators with capacitive coupling, their sequential single-frequency synchronization, chaos and two-frequency synchronization with an adiabatic change in the magnitude of the coupling between partial self-oscillators was carried out. The parameters of self-oscillators and the values of the coupling coefficient at which the specified operating modes of coupled self-oscillators exist are determined. The results of numerical studies, illustrating the conditions for excitation of single-frequency, chaotic and dual-frequency oscillations in a system of coupled self-oscillators are presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd3bb2fffa1f2534b2bc7f2fa6e67388ef2ab2ddc5afe05821f336f98e09c0f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
