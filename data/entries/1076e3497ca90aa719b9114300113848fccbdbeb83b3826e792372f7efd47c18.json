{"title":"Electronic Heart (ECG) Monitoring at Birth and Newborn Resuscitation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1122/v1","date":1713335589000,"content":"Neonatal electronic cardiac monitoring in labor and delivery room (DR-ECG) is shown to be sustained at a tertiary care regional perinatal center despite COVID-19 and other complex organizational challenges. In this contemporary cohort, initial increase in chest compressions at birth associated with the introduction of DR-ECG monitoring was mitigated by focused educational interventions on effective ventilation with no difference in neonatal mortality. DR-ECG may help our understanding of human and system factors, identify potential better practices for optimal resuscitation team performance and assess impact of targeted training initiatives on clinical outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1076e3497ca90aa719b9114300113848fccbdbeb83b3826e792372f7efd47c18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
