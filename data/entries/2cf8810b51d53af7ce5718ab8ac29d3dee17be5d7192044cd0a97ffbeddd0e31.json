Previous theoretical studies developed various types of neuronal models to study the physiological functions of the LSO. These models were usually tuned to a small set of physiological data with specific aims in mind. Therefore, it is unclear whether and how they can be related to each other, how widely applicable they are, and which model is suitable for what purposes. In this study, we address these questions for six different single-compartment integrate-and-fire (IF) type LSO models. The models are divided into two groups depending on their subthreshold responses: passive (linear) models with only the leak conductance and active (nonlinear) models with an additional low-voltage-activated potassium conductance that is prevalent among the auditory system. Each of these two groups is further subdivided into three subtypes according to the spike generation mechanism: one with simple threshold-crossing detection and voltage reset, one with threshold-crossing detection plus a current to mimic spike shapes, and one with a depolarizing exponential current for spiking. In our simulations, all six models were driven by identical synaptic inputs and calibrated with common criteria for binaural tuning. The resulting spike rates of the passive models were higher for intensive inputs and lower for temporally structured inputs than those of the active models, confirming the active function of the potassium current. Within each passive or active group, the simulated responses resembled each other, regardless of the spike generation types. These results, in combination with the analysis of computational costs, indicate that an active IF model is more suitable than a passive model for accurately reproducing temporal coding of LSO. The simulation of realistic spike shapes with an extended spiking mechanism added relatively small computational costs.","author":"Go Ashida","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2cf8810b51d53af7ce5718ab8ac29d3dee17be5d7192044cd0a97ffbeddd0e31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
