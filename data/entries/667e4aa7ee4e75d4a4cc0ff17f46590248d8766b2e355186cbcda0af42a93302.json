Up to this time, the observation itself has been enabled by the current TEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.841-B2\">2</a>]. However, its characterization, such as identifying where interface between two particles is in neck growth evaluation, likely relies on human recognition/judgement so far. Establishing automated as well as objective data processing workflow is necessary for quantitatively characterizing many body systems. In this study, we developed an image processing pipeline for analyzing sintering behavior of Cu nanoparticles (NPs).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"667e4aa7ee4e75d4a4cc0ff17f46590248d8766b2e355186cbcda0af42a93302","category":"Environment"}
