{"title":"Insights on the In Vitro Wound Healing Effects of Sedum telephium L. Leaf Juice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0973/v1","date":1718371410000,"content":"Chronic wounds remain a significant clinical challenge, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic agents. Sedum telephium L. (syn. Hylotelephium telephium (L.) H. Ohba) leaf juice, known for its traditional medicinal uses, was evaluated for its wound healing properties. This study aimed to chemically characterize the leaf juice and assess its efficacy in promoting wound healing in vitro. Fresh leaves were collected and processed to obtain the juice, which was analyzed for polyphenols, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and proteins. Key bioactive compounds, including flavonols such as kaempferol glycosides and quercetin glycosides, were identified. The juice and its polysaccharidic fraction were tested on human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and fibroblasts (HFF-1) to assess cell viability, wound closure, and the production of growth factors and pro-collagen I. Our results indicated that the whole juice significantly enhanced wound closure in both cell types, with a marked increase in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and LAP(TGF-Î²1) production in keratinocytes, highlighting its potential mechanisms of action. The polysaccharidic fraction alone showed limited efficacy, emphasizing the importance of the complete phytocomplex. These findings suggest that Sedum telephium L. represents a promising candidate in the setting of skin regeneration and repair.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99302eba242d3ca4d4dfe2a96a57e78988f0d56132e7535a395f4b3445b2153e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
