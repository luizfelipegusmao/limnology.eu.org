{"title":"Novel Esthetic Technique for Restoring Dental Implant Access Holes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1188/v1","date":1726472289000,"content":"For dental implant treatment to be successful, esthetics, functionality, and cleanability are all required of the superstructure, the final prosthesis. Screw fixation and cementation have been the conventional methods of choice for the crown prosthesis of implants, but these individual methods cannot fulfill all the requirements. As a solution to this problem, we have devised a new implant superstructure restoration method (inlay covering esthetic technique) using computer-aided design / computer-aided manufacturing inlays. This involves the placement of an inlay covering the access hole in a highly translucent partially stabilized zirconia crown. This technique expands the indications for implant treatment and improves the oral quality of life of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ce3812ecfa6624ecbe8a050356e62d5d37c4a41ae0d8b31f0f78f8679fe4868","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
