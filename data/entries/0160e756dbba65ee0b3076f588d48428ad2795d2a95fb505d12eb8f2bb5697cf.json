{"title":"Seasonal dynamics of cell-to-cell transport in angiosperm wood","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1331/7444957?rss=1","date":1700697600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study describes the seasonal changes in cell-to-cell transport in three selected angiosperm tree species, <span>Acer pseudoplatanus</span> (maple), <span>Fraxinus excelsior</span> (ash), and <span>Populus tremula</span> × <span>tremuloides</span> (poplar), with an emphasis on the living wood component, xylem parenchyma cells (XPCs). We performed anatomical studies, dye loading through the vascular system, measurements of non-structural carbohydrate content, immunocytochemistry, inhibitory assays and quantitative real-time PCR to analyse the transport mechanisms and seasonal variations in wood. The abundance of membrane dye in wood varied seasonally along with seasonally changing tree phenology, cambial activity, and non-structural carbohydrate content. Moreover, dyes internalized in vessel-associated cells and ‘trapped’ in the endomembrane system are transported farther between other XPCs via plasmodesmata. Finally, various transport mechanisms based on clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis, and membrane transporters, operate in wood, and their involvement is species and/or season dependent. Our study highlights the importance of XPCs in seasonally changing cell-to-cell transport in both ring-porous (ash) and diffuse-porous (maple, poplar) tree species, and demonstrates the involvement of both endocytosis and plasmodesmata in intercellular communication in angiosperm wood.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0160e756dbba65ee0b3076f588d48428ad2795d2a95fb505d12eb8f2bb5697cf","category":"Environment"}
