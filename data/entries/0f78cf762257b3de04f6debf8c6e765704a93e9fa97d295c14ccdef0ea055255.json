{"title":"Alternatives Cover Crops and Soil Managements Modified Macronutrients, Enzymes Activities and Soil Microbial Diversity in Rainfed Olive Orchards (cv.Ch&eacute;toui) under Mediterranean Conditions in Tunisia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0939/v1","date":1710513883000,"content":"In Tunisia, olive is the most cultivated fruit crop while in the north where rainfall exceeded 400mm.year-1, the olive growing area is in widely extension in marginal soil with high slope gradient.  Thus, the inclusion of cover crops is a sustainable solution to increase the ecosystem productivity, improve the soil fertility and oil yields. But, in Tunisia a few study were investigated the effect of legumes cover crop on the olive productivity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term (two cropping seasons s 2021 and 2022) effects of different seeded cover crops and soil management practices on the cover crops and soil characteristics, as well as enzymes activities and related microbial diversity. Six intercropping were tested in rainfed olive orchards (cv.Chétoui): Spontaneous vegetation (Spont), Wheat, Vetch, Oat, Fenugreek, mixture Vetch-Oat and compared to control (3 periodic tillage/year without intercropping). During the first cropping season, cover crops were cut as animal feed and only residues were incorporated into the soil. While, during the second year, all cover crops biomass were incorporated into the soil. Results indicate that the dry biomass and carbon uptake were significantly higher in grasses species (Wheat and Oat). But, highest level of nitrogen was found in Fenugreek cover crops. As compared to control, all cover crops including spontaneous vegetation increased soil organic matter and macronutrient level, mainly phosphorus. The most activity of β-glucosidase, phosphatase and arysulphatase was found in the cover crops plot of wheat and oat. In addition, this study improve that the utilization of the carbon sources was dominated by amides, amine and amino-acids in the fenugreek plot; while it was dominated by polymers and carboxylic acids in the case of wheat and oat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f78cf762257b3de04f6debf8c6e765704a93e9fa97d295c14ccdef0ea055255","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
