{"title":"mirSNPs as Potential Colorectal Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2291/v1","date":1727694653000,"content":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common neoplasm in the world and the second with the highest mortality rate. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes (mirSNPs) may be related to dysregulated miRNA expression in several neoplasms. This systematic review aims to investigate studies that investigate SNPs located in regions of miRNA genes that influence their expression and are associated with CRC, as well as their potential as biomarkers for the disease, based on the available literature. For this, searches were performed in public databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus. The rigorous review of the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the methodological quality of the studies were assessed sing the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Of the 175 studies identified, 26 were considered eligible: 18 of them highlighted mirSNPs as potential biomarkers of risk and prognosis for CRC; 4 studies suggested a protective role; 1 study linked mirSNPs to treatment; and 3 studies found no relevant evidence. These results highlight the need for further research on this topic, since these variants have the potential to serve as biomarkers and may be useful in assessing risk, prognosis, and developing therapeutic strategies for patients with CRC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a35c71b18b670f2626ab64028d18a1f2b7dcdd5aeddb4abf5339981219b056c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
