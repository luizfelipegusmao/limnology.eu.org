{"title":"Gender differences in the effects of emotion induction on intertemporal decision-making","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299591","date":1710943200000,"content":"<p>by Eleonora Fiorenzato, Patrizia Bisiacchi, Giorgia Cona</p>\r\n\r\n‘Good things come to those who wait’ is a popular saying, which goes along with numerous daily life decisions requiring trade-offs between immediate-small and later-larger rewards; however, some individuals have a tendency to prefer sooner rewards while discounting the value of delayed rewards, known as delay discounting. The extant literature indicates that emotions and gender can modulate intertemporal choices, but their interplay remains hitherto poorly investigated. Here, 308 participants were randomized to different conditions, inducing distinct emotions–fear, joy, a neutral state–through standardized movie clips, and then completed a computerized delay discounting task for hypothetical money rewards. Following the induction of fear, women discount the future steeper than men, thus preferring immediate-smaller rewards rather than larger-delayed ones. Also, women were more prone to choose immediate rewards when in a fearful condition than when in a positive state of joy/happiness. By contrast, men were unaffected by their emotional state when deciding on monetary rewards. Our findings provide evidence that fear can trigger different intertemporal choices according to gender, possibly reflecting the adoption of different evolutionary strategies.","author":"Eleonora Fiorenzato","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8bdbe49bfea3e1050a6ad73555e21963631e88e5a084e265bf431707008dd2ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
