{"title":"Impact of feralization on evolutionary trajectories in the genomes of feral cat island populations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308724","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by María Esther Nieto-Blázquez, Manuela Gómez-Suárez, Markus Pfenninger, Katrin Koch</p>\r\n\r\nFeralization is the process of domesticated animals returning to the wild and it is considered the counterpart of domestication. Molecular genetic changes are well documented in domesticated organisms but understudied in feral populations. In this study, the genetic differentiation between domestic and feral cats was inferred by analysing whole-genome sequencing data of two geographically distant feral cat island populations, Dirk Hartog Island (Australia) and Kaho’olawe (Hawaii) as well as domestic cats and European wildcats. The study investigated population structure, genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, highly differentiated genes, and recombination rates. Genetic structure analyses linked both feral cat populations to North American domestic and European cat populations. Recombination rates in feral cats were lower than in domestic cats but higher than in wildcats. For Australian and Hawaiian feral cats, 105 and 94 highly differentiated genes compared to domestic cats respectively, were identified. Annotated genes had similar functions, with almost 30% of the divergent genes related to nervous system development in both feral groups. Twenty mutually highly differentiated genes were found in both feral populations. Evolution of highly differentiated genes was likely driven by specific demographic histories, the relaxation of the selective pressures associated with domestication, and adaptation to novel environments to a minor extent. Random drift was the prevailing force driving highly divergent regions, with relaxed selection in feral populations also playing a significant role in differentiation from domestic cats. The study demonstrates that feralization is an independent process that brings feral cats on a unique evolutionary trajectory.","author":"María Esther Nieto-Blázquez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"28101f4971384fe4911f8be9f26025dc149d1185063d6ad370f9074641090d2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
