{"title":"Research on the expansion, shrinkage properties and fracture evolution of red clay stabilised with phosphogypsum under dry-wet cycles","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308616","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Jinxiong Chen, Kaisheng Chen, Zeyu Liu</p>\r\n\r\nIn view of the special engineering properties of red clay and the waste of phosphogypsum resources, the expansion and contraction deformation and fissure evolution of phosphogypsum stabilized red clay under different conditions were investigated by laboratory tests and image processing system. The research results show that: (1) the absolute expansion and absolute shrinkage of phosphogypsum stabilized red clay are positively correlated with the compaction degree, the number of dry and wet cycles and the cement dosage, and negatively correlated with the initial water content and the phosphogypsum dosage; (2) the fissure rate increases with the increase of the number of dry and wet cycles, and decreases with the increase of the initial water content, the compaction degree, the cement, and the phosphogypsum dosage; (3) The relationship among absolute expansion rate (absolute shrinkage), degree of compaction and fracture rate can be fitted by the equation f(x,y) = ax+by+cx<sup>2</sup>+dy<sup>2</sup>+e; (4) Phosphogypsum has an obvious inhibiting effect on the expansion, shrinkage and cracking of the mix. It is recommended that the cement mixing amount of 6% and phosphogypsum: red clay = 1:1~1:2 as roadbed filler.","author":"Jinxiong Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f2074358ea62e55e2854eb0d82bc2977950e4d2dd1cd432a82014470d3641054","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
