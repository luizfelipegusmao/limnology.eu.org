{"title":"Efficiency Analysis and Optimization of Two Speed Regions Operation of PMSM Taking into Account Iron Losses Based on Linear Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1729/v1","date":1729772021000,"content":"In this article, the linear non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach is used to analyze the energy regularities of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) taking into account iron losses. The IPMSM is considered a linear power converter (PC) that is multiple linearized at operating points with given angular velocity and load torque. A universal description of such a PC by a system of dimensionless parameters and characteristics made it possible to analyze the perfection of energy conversion in the object. For IPMSM, taking into account iron losses, a mathematical model of the corresponding PC has been built, and an algorithm and research program have been developed, which is valid in a wide range of machine speed regulations. This allows you to obtain the efficiency maps for IPMSM and choose the optimal points of PC operation according to the maximum efficiency criteria. The results of the studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for determining the optimal reference of the components d and q of the armature current for both the MTPA strategy at motor speed adjusting below the nominal value and for the FW strategy at its adjusting above the nominal value.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b36a0eb3f3a3b438ce309cb50d7f5fc4149aaed317370f42013a8852f573f9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
