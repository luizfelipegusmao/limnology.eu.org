{"title":"Improving Urban Energy Efficiency with Ground Source Heat Pump Systems Integrated with Energy Piles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1167/v1","date":1726474263000,"content":"Urban areas are increasingly challenged by the urban heat island effect, resulting in increased energy consumption and reduced efficiency of conventional air source heat pumps (ASHPs). This study explores the integration of ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems with energy piles in urban environments, focusing on small to medium sized residential units. Energy piles combine structural support with geothermal heat exchange capabilities, taking advantage of stable ground temperatures to improve energy efficiency. The research examines key design considerations such as soil thermal properties, heat transfer mechanisms, and the optimal configuration of heat exchangers within the piles. Results indicate that GSHP systems can significantly reduce electricity consumption and operating costs compared to ASHPs, despite higher initial costs. Several factors, including site conditions, pile materials, and heat exchanger designs, are critical to system performance. The study concludes that while GSHP systems offer significant long-term benefits, their widespread adoption in Southeast Asia will require further development of construction methods and design strategies, as well as supportive government policies to mitigate initial costs. This work aims to advance the understanding and implementation of energy piles in urban environments, thereby promoting sustainable energy use in smart city development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ce9bc96e2c3012247b61501de9d40816023688781b0d2531ed7fc55a34761cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
