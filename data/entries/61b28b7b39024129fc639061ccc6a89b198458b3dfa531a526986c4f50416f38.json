{"title":"Obstructed Labor, Evolution, and Health Disparities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2143/v1","date":1727360417000,"content":"The female pelvis is often evolutionarily described as a compromise to accommodate the birthing process and bipedalism. This compromise puts a mother and baby at risk for fetopelvic disproportion, the mismatch between the size of the fetus and the mother's pelvis, impacting the ease at which the vaginal birthing process occurs. Obstructed labor, commonly caused by fetopelvic disproportion, is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity and has serious medical sequelae for the fetus. In this review, this evolutionary aspect of fetopelvic disproportion is being reconsidered within a broader sociocultural and environmental approach related to a change of paradigm from a more reductionist Neo-Darwinist to a more encompassing Extended Evolutionary Synthesis view. The review explores a more comprehensive understanding of several factors related to fetopelvic disproportion, including socioeconomic factors and ethnic disparities amongst individuals that might lead to a higher likelihood of obstructed labor and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61b28b7b39024129fc639061ccc6a89b198458b3dfa531a526986c4f50416f38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
