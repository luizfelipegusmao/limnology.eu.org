{"title":"When I am sixty-four… evaluating language markers of well-being in healthy aging narratives","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302103","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Tabea Meier, Matthias R.

The type of words individuals use can reveal important psychological processes that underlie well-being across the lifespan. In this preregistered, cross-sectional study, we propose a conceptual model of language markers of well-being and use written narratives about healthy aging (<i>N</i> = 701) and computerized text analysis (LIWC) to empirically validate the model. As hypothesized, we identified a model with three groups of language markers (reflecting affective, evaluative, and social processes). Initial validation with established self-report scales (<i>N</i> = 30 subscales) showed that these language markers reliably predict core components of well-being and underlying processes. Our results support the concurrent validity of the conceptual language model and allude to the added benefits of language-based measures, which are thought to reflect less conscious processes of well-being. Future research is needed to continue validating language markers of well-being across the lifespan in a theoretically informed and contextualized way, which will lay the foundation for inferring people’s well-being from their natural language use.","author":"Tabea Meier","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7c9f1a36c0929689dcec2996d9c0cd1d48f7616e64901c353b373fe7c7790891","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
