However, the pathogenesis of amyloodiniosis remains unknown, hindering the development of targeted anti-parasitic drugs. The <i>A. ocellatum</i> in vitro model is an indispensable tool for investigating the pathogenic mechanism of amyloodiniosis at the cellular and molecular levels. The present work developed a new cell line, ALG, from the gill of yellowfin seabream (<i>Acanthopagrus latus</i>). The cell line was routinely cultured at 28°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). ALG cells were adherent and exhibited an epithelioid morphology; the cells were stably passed over 30 generations and successfully cryopreserved. The cell line derived from <i>A. latus</i> was identified based on partial sequence amplification and sequencing of cytochrome B (<i>Cyt b</i>). The ALG was seeded onto transwell inserts and found to be a platform for in vitro infection of <i>A. ocellatum</i>, with a 37.23 ± 5.75% infection rate. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that <i>A. ocellatum</i> parasitizes cell monolayers via rhizoids. <i>A. ocellatum</i> infection increased the expression of apoptosis and inflammation-related genes, including caspase 3 (<i>Casp 3</i>), interleukin 1 (<i>IL-1</i>), interleukin 10 (<i>IL-10</i>), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (<i>TNF-α</i>), in vivo or in vitro. These results demonstrated that the in vitro gill cell monolayer successfully recapitulated in vivo <i>A. latus</i> host responses to <i>A. ocellatum</i> infection. The ALG cell line holds great promise as a valuable tool for investigating parasite–host interactions in vitro.</p>","author":"Zhicheng Li, \nJingyu Zhuang, \nJiaming Chen, \nJizhen Cao, \nQing Han, \nZhi Luo, \nBaotun Wang, \nHebing Wang, \nAnxing Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"1e14493f16d51612962d1c87339bf6dadf91d2e1625307126c9164d163c74489","category":"Environment"}
