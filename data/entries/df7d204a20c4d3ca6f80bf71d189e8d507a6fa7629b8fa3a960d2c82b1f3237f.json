COVID-19 is a systemic ailment affecting various tissues and organs, including the lungs and liver. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is one of the most common liver cancer, and cancer patients are particularly at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 on ICC patients.</p> Methods <p>With the methods of systems biology and bioinformatics, this study explored the link between COVID-19 and ICC, and searched for potential therapeutic drugs.</p> Results <p>This study identified a total of 70 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by both diseases, shedding light on their shared functionalities. Enrichment analysis pinpointed metabolism and immunity as the primary areas influenced by these common genes. Subsequently, through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, we identified <i>SCD</i>, <i>ACSL5</i>, <i>ACAT2</i>, <i>HSD17B4</i>, <i>ALDOA</i>, <i>ACSS1</i>, <i>ACADSB</i>, <i>CYP51A1</i>, <i>PSAT1</i>, and <i>HKDC1</i> as hub genes. Additionally, 44 transcription factors (TFs) and 112 microRNAs (miRNAs) were forecasted to regulate the hub genes. Most importantly, several drug candidates (Periodate-oxidized adenosine, Desipramine, Quercetin, Perfluoroheptanoic acid, Tetrandrine, Pentadecafluorooctanoic acid, Benzo[a]pyrene, SARIN, Dorzolamide, 8-Bromo-cAMP) may prove effective in treating ICC and COVID-19.</p> Conclusion <p>This study is expected to provide valuable references and potential drugs for future research and treatment of COVID-19 and ICC.</p>","author":"Xinyi Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"df7d204a20c4d3ca6f80bf71d189e8d507a6fa7629b8fa3a960d2c82b1f3237f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
