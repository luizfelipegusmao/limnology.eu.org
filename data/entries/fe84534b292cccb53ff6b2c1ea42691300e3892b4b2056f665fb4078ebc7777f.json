{"title":"Immunoglobulins: Structure, Function, and Therapeutic Applications in Immune Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0760/v1","date":1728544138000,"content":"The article titled \"Immunoglobulins and Its Applications\" provides a comprehensive overview of the structure, function, and therapeutic significance of immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies. These vital proteins, produced by plasma cells in response to immunogens, are essential components of the immune system, playing a critical role in recognizing and neutralizing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The article elaborates on the five primary classes of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM), each distinguished by its unique structural and functional properties. It discusses the molecular composition of immunoglobulins, highlighting the significance of their variable and constant regions in antigen binding. The paper also explores the diverse immune functions mediated by these proteins, including precipitation, agglutination, and neutralization of antigens. Additionally, the article emphasizes the therapeutic applications of immunoglobulins, particularly in treating immune deficiencies and other diseases. Advances in monoclonal antibody technology have significantly expanded the utility of immunoglobulins in both research and medicine, leading to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches such as humanized monoclonal antibodies and bifunctional antibodies. This comprehensive analysis underscores the critical role of immunoglobulins in both natural immunity and therapeutic interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe84534b292cccb53ff6b2c1ea42691300e3892b4b2056f665fb4078ebc7777f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
