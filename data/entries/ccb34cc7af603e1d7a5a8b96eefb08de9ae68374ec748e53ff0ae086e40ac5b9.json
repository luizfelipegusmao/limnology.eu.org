{"title":"Male and Female Perceptions of Supervision During Strength Training","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1264/v1","date":1729066759000,"content":"A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 1322 members of a 1-on1 personalized strength training studio. 366 respondents (n=134 male and n=232 female), all aged over 20 years reported considerable training experience; 55% of males and 42% of females reporting 5+ years. Data were analyzed and reported descriptively with differences &amp;gt;5% identified based on use of the 5-point likert scale, sample size and nature of the observations. Disparity between males and females were identified; males reported higher perceptions of managing effort, technique, and programming without supervision compared to females. Safety was noted as being more important to females compared to males. Qualitatively, additional themes were raised including analogy of the personal relationship between trainer and trainee being similar to that of medical professionals. This was validated where participants discussed their adaptations from supervised strength training including quality of life in aging, and recovery from medical conditions and injury. Data is discussed in context of a previous body of literature suggesting males falsely report higher confidence in tasks compared to females, particularly in relation to effort, role models, and verbal encouragement. This research proves beneficial for strength training practitioners in enhancing their understanding and expectations of clients, as well as hopefully proving insightful in engaging more people in strength training.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccb34cc7af603e1d7a5a8b96eefb08de9ae68374ec748e53ff0ae086e40ac5b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
