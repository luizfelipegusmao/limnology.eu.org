{"title":"Theory of Relationships between  Spaces to Obtain  Numerical Knowledge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.0053/v2","date":1719195779000,"content":"The theory says that number interacts with spaces based on the meaning of mathematics, in this way it is possible to obtain numerical knowledge. The theory shows the possibility of using spaces related to each other to explain the reasons why two even numbers form a pair, two odd numbers form a pair, an even number and an odd number form an odd number, three odd numbers form an odd number . three even numbers make an odd number. an even, an odd and two evens make an odd, two odd and an even make a pair. Furthermore, it is possible to extend the logic to larger numbers, but applying rules to make it work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c69d4ae3b21c3499e68e4a8d8ac877562d40ff562888f5674a366d7b7ac6b372","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
