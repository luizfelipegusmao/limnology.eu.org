{"title":"PSIV-A-2 Comparison of rising plate meter and total collection methods for forage mass determination of tall fescue","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/356/7664906?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to compare estimates of forage mass (FM) determined with a rising plate meter (RPM) with forage mass determined by total collection method. Estimates of FM impact management decisions and give the producer a greater understanding of forage availability for their herd. Traditional methods of FM estimation using a forage ring or quadrat and total collection are labor intensive and time consuming. The RPM tool aims to provide a quicker method of FM estimation without sacrificing accuracy. The reliability of this tool can be impacted by season, species composition, plant growth state, and pasture management. Forage samples were collected from six random locations within both continuous and rotationally grazed systems. The predominant forage species was endophyte-infected tall fescue. A 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> forage ring was randomly thrown, then two RPM (Jenquip Manual Platemeter) measurements were collected in the ring, followed by five measurements adjacent to the ring. The RPM determined the compressed sward height (CSH). Subsequently, forage within the ring was hand-clipped at ground level and collected. Samples were dried for 120 h at 55° C to determine forage availability (kg/ha). This process was repeated weekly for 6 wk. Rising plate meter FM was estimated using the equation: kg dry matter (DM)/ha = CSH × 158 + 200. Data were analyzed using the CORR procedure of SAS 9.4. Forage mass estimates from total ring collection method and RPM were weakly correlated in the rotational grazing system (r = 0.26; <span>P</span> = 0.13) and in the continuous grazing system (r = 0.20; <span>P</span> = 0.24). It is important to note that certain sample collection dates had stronger correlations than others. In the rotationally grazed paddocks, FM from RPM were strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.89, <span>P</span> ≤ 0.02) with FM from total ring collection on 6/23/23 and 7/26/23. In the continuously grazed paddocks, FM estimations from RPM were strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.73, <span>P</span> ≤ 0.10) with forage mass from total collection on 7/20/23 and 7/26/23. Variation among the seven RPM readings at each collection site could have contributed to variability. Coefficient of variation ranged from 9 to 48% and averaged 18% for all samples. The inconsistencies in relationship of forage mass determination methods suggests that more variables need to be considered when determining the accuracy of RPM-derived estimates of forage mass of tall fescue.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7f1d2efcf027babd1cab2f9089a4a20ae76874051a911933675fcd4fe305b0f5","category":"Environment"}
