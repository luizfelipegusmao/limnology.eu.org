Collaborative planning integrates traditionally separate functions to enhance operational efficiency, customer responsiveness, and strategic alignment. The study employs semi-structured interviews with key informants from diverse MNCs across industries and geographies to explore practices, challenges, and outcomes associated with collaborative planning initiatives. Findings highlight the pivotal role of cross-functional collaboration and advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, in improving demand forecasting accuracy, optimizing inventory management, and enabling personalized marketing strategies. Challenges include organizational resistance, cultural barriers, and the complexity of aligning global strategies. Strategic outcomes encompass improved operational efficiency, cost savings, enhanced customer satisfaction, and strengthened competitive advantage. Moreover, the integration of sustainability goals underscores the importance of environmental responsibility and regulatory compliance in collaborative planning frameworks. The study also identifies emerging trends in digital transformation and agile supply chains shaping future practices. Overall, collaborative planning emerges as a strategic imperative for MNCs to navigate complexities, capitalize on opportunities, and sustain growth in a globalized marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c04e192e41f2e25c434763bc7160c2375a92a9866f842264eb20ee2bea21709","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
