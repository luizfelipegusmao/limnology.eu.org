{"title":"Treatment of textile wastewater in a single‐step moving bed‐membrane bioreactor: Comparison with conventional membrane bioreactor in terms of performance and membrane fouling","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12942?af=R","date":1720075472000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is a promising technology for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater, including highly contaminated textile wastewater. However, membrane fouling remains a critical challenge due to reduced flux. This study investigates the efficacy of a moving bed MBR (MB-MBR) technology for textile wastewater treatment, focusing on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, and its impact on mitigating membrane fouling. In a 50-day study, a conventional MBR (R<sub>1</sub>) was compared with an MB-MBR (R<sub>2</sub>) augmented with free-floating biocarriers (accounting for 20% of the reactor volume). Both systems used flat sheet ceramic membrane modules. The results indicate that the MB-MBR achieved superior performance, with COD and colour removal of 89% and 81%, respectively, compared with 87% and 73% in the conventional MBR. Importantly, the introduction of biocarriers eliminated the need for offline physical membrane cleaning in the MB-MBR. The free-floating biocarriers lowered transmembrane pressure, reduced capillary suction time and reduced fouling through their scouring action.</p>","author":"Emine Sule Tecirli, \nKadir Akgun, \nAbdulkadir Caglak, \nHanife Sari Erkan, \nGuleda Onkal Engin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"b6b3296cc3c3bee85f282627a169e0264395e6a4a5287d338de350203c9d7677","category":"Environment"}
