{"title":"Economic assessment of using Bermudagrass stockpiling and annual cereal pasture to extend grazing in cow-calf operations","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae067/7655844?rss=1","date":1713744000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bermudagrass (<span>Cynodon dactylon</span> L.) stockpiling and cool-season annual pastures can extend grazing seasons in cow-calf operations and reduce winter feeding costs, but less is known about how these practices interact and their effect on producer profitability. Data from a completely randomized-design experiment in South-Central Oklahoma were collected on three grazing systems for cows and calves: bermudagrass pasture (CONTROL), stockpiled bermudagrass and interseeded cool-season pasture (SPINT), and stockpiled bermudagrass plus cropland no-till seeded with a summer cover-crop followed by cool-season annuals (SPCROP). A mixed model was used to estimate the effects of grazing system on weaning weights, total hay, and total range cubes (crude protein [CP] = 30%) fed in each system. Enterprise budgeting was used to calculate the expected net return of each system. Weaning weight did not vary between systems (<span>P </span>= 0.6940), resulting in similar revenues. Relative to other treatments, the quantity of cubes fed in the CONTROL system were significantly higher (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) while hay fed was significantly higher in the SPCROP system (<span>P </span>= 0.0036). Increased machinery costs, seed costs, and fertilization requirements in bermudagrass stockpiling, interseeding, and cropland production outweighed the cost savings associated with less feeding. Total costs were $446 ha<sup>−1</sup> ($722 hd<sup>−1</sup>), $451 ha<sup>−1</sup> ($732 hd<sup>−1</sup>), and $553 ha<sup>−1</sup> ($895 ha<sup>−1</sup>) for the CONTROL, SPINT, and SPCROP systems, respectively. Overall, the CONTROL system was $3.13 ha<sup>−1</sup> ($5.08 hd<sup>−1</sup>) and $98.91 ha<sup>−1</sup> ($160.10 hd<sup>−1</sup>) more profitable than the SPINT and SPCROP systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"a8f9d54b83a22220e8fedd8972f99f66b3f9419ae4a3396a338bf43202277cb0","category":"Environment"}
