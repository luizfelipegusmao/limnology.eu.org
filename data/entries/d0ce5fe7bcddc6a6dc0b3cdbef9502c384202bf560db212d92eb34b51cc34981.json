Fairlight makes the steel frame in both regular and tall variants, to suit different rider morphology, with each bike built to order so you can choose your own spec.</p>\n<p>There’s plenty of room for wide tyres – 36mm – and mudguards to get you through the worst of the weather. Endurance features include a third bottle cage mount.</p>\n<p>We rated the ride quality as unobtrusive – the frame does a great job of smoothing the road, holds a line and climbs well and – as usual – we took in some bridleways on wider tyres, which were handled with ease.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/fairlight-strael-3-0-review/\">Read our full Fairlight Strael 3.0 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Giant Defy Advanced 0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Defy Advanced 0 road bike\" title=\"Giant Defy Advanced 0 - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Giant Defy Advanced 0 is one of the cheaper and better bikes in its category.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£2,899/£4,350 as tested</li>\n<li>Outstanding value</li>\n<li>Excellent drivetrain</li>\n<li>Comfortable</li>\n<li>Precise handling</li>\n</ul><p>The Giant Defy Advanced 0 is nearly perfect for its very reasonable price (for a modern endurance road bike).</p>\n<p>The superbly designed frame and 32mm tubeless tyres contribute to a plush, yet by no means dull, ride experience.</p>\n<p>The highlight of a top-value spec is the SRAM Rival eTap AXS groupset.

But rather than the race-targetted machine that this would usually indicate, it’s an endurance bike with a higher stack for all-day riding. That’s offset by deeper drops than found on most endurance bikes though, so you can get lower if you want an extra turn of speed.</p>\n<p>In this spec, it’s kitted out with a 52/36t Ultegra 12-speed groupset with 11-34t cassette and 40mm deep Vision carbon wheels with 28mm Hutchinson tyres.</p>\n<p>The ride is firmer than on many endurance bikes and handling is racier as well. Unlike many endurance bikes, you don’t get mudguard eyes, perhaps reflecting the weather in BH’s Spanish home.

They’re intended to take away some of the fatigue induced by road imperfections on an all-day ride.</p>\n<p>Endurance road bikes tend to have wider tyres than race bikes, to aid comfort and help create a smoother ride.</p>\n<p>While the latest race bikes are generally limited to a maximum <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-tyre-sizes/\">tyre size</a> of 28 to 32mm (though this is much wider than just a few years ago, thanks to the rise of disc brakes), some of the latest endurance road bikes have room for 35mm or wider tyres – which is wider than the tyres on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">cyclocross bikes</a> and not far off some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Endurance road bikes also tend to have a lower gear range than race bikes. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">Compact 50/34t chainsets</a> and cassettes with 32-tooth sprockets are not uncommon and some bikes will even have a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">sub-compact chainset</a>, which will help you crest steep ascents at the end of a long day.</p>\n<p>Greater versatility is built into endurance road bikes, too. Race bikes might forgo features such as mudguard mounts, but endurance road bikes tend to have these and are consequently better for riding all-year round.</p>\n<h3>Frame details</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Ribble Endurance Ti road bike\" title=\"Ribble Endurance Ti 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mudguard mounts make endurance road bikes more practical than many race bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Endurance road bikes are made with a range of different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>. Most of the bikes in this list have an all-carbon frame, which helps create a lightweight and compliant ride. Having said this, alloy frames can be designed to be very compliant and tend to offer a price saving.</p>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-road-bikes/\">best steel road bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-titanium-road-bikes/\">best titanium road bikes</a> fall into the endurance road bike category, too. These materials tend to be favoured for comfort-orientated, long-distance bikes because they both do a great job of absorbing any road buzz.</p>\n<p>You might want to look for an endurance road bike with mudguard mounts. They used to be a rarity, but you’ll increasingly find them even on top-end endurance machines and they’re often hidden so they don’t spoil the bike’s aesthetics if you decide not to fit guards.</p>\n<p>If you’re lucky to go out on dry roads, you may not need them. But if the heavens open on the day of your ride, you will enjoy it much more if your bike is fitted with mudguards and you and your bike are protected from wheel spray. And if you’re riding in a group, those following you will definitely thank you.</p>\n<p>Mudguards are also a good bet through winter if you live somewhere with a wet climate, making an endurance road bike a good choice for a four-seasons machine.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">best mudguards</a> normally require mounts on the frame to provide full coverage, so look out for a frame with the appropriate mounting points if that’s important to you.</p>\n<h3>What is endurance road bike geometry?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Giant Defy Advanced Pro 2 road bike\" title=\"Giant Defy Advanced Pro 2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endurance bikes can look a lot like race bikes, but the geometry often puts the rider in a more upright position.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many bike brands will label their bikes as having either racing or endurance geometry.</p>\n<p>Racing geometry will typically give you faster handling, a lower position and the ride may be firmer, whereas endurance geometry gives a more upright riding position and more stable handling.</p>\n<p>All our picks above are from the brands’ endurance road bike ranges. You can also read our explainer on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road bike geometry</a> to better understand the angles and measurements involved.</p>\n<h3>Are endurance road bikes slow?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist riding the Trek Domane SLR 7 road bike\" title=\"Trek Domane SLR 7 - 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endurance bikes might be designed around comfort, but this doesn’t stop them from being fun to ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On the face of it, endurance road bikes might seem like a slower option if you compare them to WorldTour-ready <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">lightweight race bikes</a> or the fastest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Firstly, this is because the more upright position of endurance road bikes means you are less aerodynamic than on more aggressive road bikes, and consequently it takes more effort to travel at the same speeds.</p>\n<p>And while <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/are-wider-tyres-faster/\">wider tyres can often be faster than old-school narrow tyres</a>, there may be an aero, rolling resistance or weight penalty here, too, if your endurance road bike is using all of its generous frame clearance.</p>\n<p>Having said this, endurance road bikes, like all bikes, exist on a spectrum and there are some that have racier geometries than others. On top of that, the latest endurance road bikes occupy a finely balanced sweet spot between speed and comfort.</p>\n<p>Many still enable you to adopt a fairly low position, so don’t worry too much about your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/average-speed-cycling/\">average speed</a>. Almost all will feel markedly quicker than a gravel bike or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring bike</a>.</p>\n<p>And remember, endurance bikes place a greater focus on comfort. So whether that enables you to ride further, or gives you the option for light off-road detours, you’ll ultimately end up at your destination quicker than a race bike with an uncomfortable position and limited versatility.</p>\n<h3>Endurance road bike gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Racers interested in the Madone 9.0 might want to swap out the compact 50/34 crank\" title=\"trek-madone-9.0-12-1505154139489-8fiq05gx5yw8-bb33444\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endurance bikes tend to have compact gears, like the 50/34t crankset pictured here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Endurance bikes are designed to meet the challenge of long rides over up and down terrain, enabling riders to tackle it in relative comfort, rather than being forced to turn a massive gear.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to take on sportives, these are designed to give you a bit of a challenge and much of the ride is often on rolling terrain. Most sportives will throw in a few steeper hills, while some routes take you up and down as much elevation as possible. That means having a good gear range is paramount.</p>\n<p>A compact chainset with 50- and 34-tooth chainrings is a good starting point for any endurance bike.</p>\n<p>At the back, you’ll normally get a cassette that goes from 11 teeth for its smallest sprocket (or 10 teeth for SRAM’s eTap AXS 12-speed groupsets) up to 30, 34 or more teeth for its largest.</p>\n<p>That should give you plenty of low range to tackle steeper uphills, with lowest ratios close to or below 1:1. You’ll also have enough top-end gears to ride comfortably on faster, flatter sections.</p>\n<p>Some brands may spec a semi-compact 52/36t chainset on their endurance bikes. These give you a bit more top-end gearing, but paired with a wide-range cassette you still have the lower gears for easier climbing.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re relatively new to cycling, live in a hilly area or are planning on taking your bike to the mountains, a compact will give you more gearing options for climbing.</p>\n<h3>Groupset</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Felt FR Advanced 105 Disc road bike is equipped with a Shimano 105 drivetrain\" title=\"Felt FR Advanced 105 Disc - 05\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano 105 is a popular groupset on mid-range endurance road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupset</a> will give you light, precise shifting, with a broad range of gears for a wide variety of terrain.</p>\n<p>Most endurance bikes come with 11-speed or 12-speed groupsets.

Hydraulic disc brakes are more effective, but they’re also pricier, so you’ll find them on higher-spec machines.</p>\n<p>Rim brakes are fine in drier weather, but you need to be more careful how you ride if it’s wet (and especially if your bike has carbon rims), allowing for more stopping distance.</p>\n<h3>Saddle</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Synapse Disc Ultegra endurance road bike\" title=\"Cannondale Synapse Disc Ultegra 5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Finding the right saddle for your anatomy is important for comfort on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>You’ll want to be comfortable as you ride and a good-quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">saddle</a> that suits your anatomy is important. There’s a huge range of options. Many endurance-oriented bikes will come fitted with a quality saddle, which you might find perfectly serviceable.</p>\n<p>However, if you find that you don’t get on with your saddle, it’s worth swapping out for another model. Aftermarket saddles come at a range of price points and most saddle ranges will have a budget option. It will be heavier than a pricier saddle further up the range, but should have similar ride characteristics.
