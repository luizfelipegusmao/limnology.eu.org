{"title":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Antibiotic Use Among Students in Ecuador and Nigeria: A Comparative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0773/v1","date":1728546238000,"content":"Antibiotic resistance is a global public health issue, largely driven by the misuse of these medications. This study aimed to compare the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to antibiotic use among students in Ecuador and Nigeria through a cross-sectional survey. The results indicated a strong understanding in both countries of the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic use and the importance of completing prescribed treatments. However, significant differences were noted in the practice of self-medication, which was more prevalent in Ecuador. Additionally, behaviors such as insistence on obtaining antibiotics and the storing of leftover medications were common, underscoring the need for targeted educational interventions. The implications of these findings for promoting responsible antibiotic use are further discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f29f05ff3d39fe426799d2909ab1941c7c36e6de96424b3d775727c966555fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
