Over the last two decades, the rapid development of genomics and metagenomics research on these species has enriched our knowledge of their biology, ecology, physiology, genetics, and evolution, which is crucial and useful for their conservation. We describe the evolutionary history, endangerment processes, genetic diversity, and population structure of wild giant pandas and two species of red pandas (Chinese and Himalayan red pandas). In addition, we explore how genomics and metagenomics studies have provided insight into the convergent adaptation of pandas to the specialized bamboo diet. Finally, we discuss how these findings are applied to effective conservation management of giant and red pandas in the wild and in captivity to promote the long-term persistence of these species.</p></div>","author":"Yisi Hu, Yibo Hu, Wenliang Zhou and Fuwen Wei","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Animal Biosciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"88ae807e8b2cfc417a41d31c2599db29fa2c783b0d3a8de2765d823f4bd5cf41","entryHash":"0a4c3401c382d46db85900369c4c3b313e6627b228fc5ca142ecec0c323288af","category":"Environment"}
