{"title":"Patient experience with hospital care following the Maryland global budget revenue model: A difference-in-difference analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308331","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Ronnie L. Shammas, Jenna Li, Evan Matros, Oluseyi Aliu</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>As a result of the success of Maryland’s full risk capitated payment model experiment (Global Budget Revenue) in constraining healthcare costs, there is momentum for expanding the reach of such models. However, as these models are implemented, studies analyzing their long-term effects suggest unintended spillover effects that may ultimately influence patient experiences. The aim of this study was to determine whether implementation of the GBR was associated with changes in patient experience.</p> Methods <p>Cross-sectional study using a difference-in-difference analysis to examine changes in patient experiences according to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) domains before and after implementation of the GBR model. Acute care hospitals from 2010–2016 with completed HCAHPS surveys were included. Hospitals identified for inclusion were then matched, based on county location, to area level characteristics using the Area Health Resource File.</p> Results <p>A total of 844 hospitals were included. Compared to hospitals in non-GBR states, hospitals in GBR states experienced significant declines in the following HCAHPS domains: “would definitely recommend the hospital to others” [Average treatment effect (ATT) = -1.19, 95% CI = -1.97, -0.41)] and 9–10 rating of the hospital (ATT = -0.93, 95% CI = -1.71, -0.15). Results also showed significant increases in the HCAHPS domains: “if patient’s rooms and bathroom were always kept clean” (ATT = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.20, 2.00). There were no significant differences in changes for the other domains, including no improvements in: nursing communication, doctor communication, help from hospital staff, pain control, communication on medicines, discharge information, and quietness of the patient environment.</p> Conclusion <p>These findings suggest there should be efforts made to ascertain and mitigate potential adverse effects of care transformation initiatives on patient experience. Patients are stakeholders and their inputs should be sought and incorporated in care transformation efforts to ensure that these models align with improved patient experiences.</p>","author":"Ronnie L.
