{"title":"Design and Analysis of a Proportional Electromagnet with Experimental Validation for Static and Dynamic Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1770/v1","date":1729676198000,"content":"This study presents the design and analysis of a proportional electromagnet used in electro-pneumatic brake systems for heavy vehicles. The solenoid was designed using a traditional method and its static and dynamic characteristics were investigated both theoretically and experimentally. ANSYS Maxwell was employed for theoretical static analysis, focusing on the effects of geometric dimension parameters in the fixed and moving pole contact region on the Force-Displacement characteristics. Optimal dimensions for proportionality were determined under suitable operating conditions. The static analysis results provided magnetization curve data, which were used to create look-up tables for a dynamic model in MATLAB-Simulink. Following static analysis, a prototype electromagnet was manufactured and tested. The solenoid achieved a constant magnetic force of 45 Â± 3N with a current of 1.3A over a working range of 1-3 mm. The dynamic model, incorporating data from ANSYS, yielded results that closely matched experimental findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1c6fb978b3aaa9bb75795a36f08569a6b713d68e4bba8710ea1e384d02f3f1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
