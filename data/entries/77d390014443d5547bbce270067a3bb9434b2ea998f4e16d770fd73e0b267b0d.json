{"title":"Fluvial habitat associations of riverine dragonflies (Odonata, Gomphidae) in the Huron Mountains (Michigan, USA)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4339?af=R","date":1720003471000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The presence of sediment-burrowing clubtail dragonflies (Gomphidae) may be directly related to riverine geomorphic properties. Their synchronous emergence behavior, marked by persistent exuviae, allows for the examination of emerging adult-stage habitats. Here we explore how emerging adult and benthic larvae are related to hydrogeomorphic factors through regression modeling. Nine sites in two subwatersheds of the Huron Mountain region (Michigan, USA) were surveyed during two periods: May/June 2021 and August 2021. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and discharge were measured concurrent with invertebrate surveys, and field samples of total suspended solids, nutrients, and substrate particle size distribution were also taken. In spring, 317 exuviae were collected, including 153 Gomphidae. In August, 45 larvae were collected including 22 Gomphidae. Spearman's rank correlations preceded robust regression analysis to aid variable selection. Although nonsignificant, Gomphidae exuviae were negatively correlated with conductivity, average water depth, and percent sand while non-Gomphidae exuviae were positively correlated with the same variables. The model selection found the top models for Gomphidae and non-Gomphidae exuviae abundance to relate to depth and conductivity, while the top model for Gomphidae larvae was with discharge. All single variable models (discharge, width, and percent sand) had similar AICc criterion values when examining their relationship with non-Gomphidae larval abundance. Our study demonstrates that larvae of several riverine dragonfly taxa in the Huron Mountains co-occur despite hydrogeomorphic variation, yet, at emergence, specific taxa may be responding to different stream properties. Understanding the habitat requirements of riverine dragonflies and how these potentially shift throughout development can support conservation efforts.</p>","author":"Jessica M.
