{"title":"Creation of the Corneal Flap for Laser In Situ Keratomileusis with a 3-Dimension Femtosecond Laser Cut: Clinical and Optical Coherence Tomography Features","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1705/v1","date":1711615523000,"content":"Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the gold standard in the surgical correction of refractive errors on the cornea. It entails the creation of a superficial hinged corneal flap by a femtosecond laser, ablation of the underlying stromal bed by an excimer laser, and reposition of the flap.\nThe corneal flap can be build in a 2-dimension (2D) fashion with tapered edges, or in a 3-dimension (3D) fashion, with angled sidecut. The latter reduces the risk of flap dislocation and infiltration of epithelial cells. \nThis retrospective study compares with optical coherence tomography 3D and 2D flaps, and respective intra- and early post-operative complications.\nFour hundred consecutive eyes were included, 200 for each group. In the 3D group, the mean edge angle was 92Â°. The procedure was in average 5.2 seconds slower in the 3D group (p=0). Non visually significant flap folds were found in 13 eyes of the 2D group and in 7 eyes of the 3D group (p= 0.17). An intracorneal opaque bubble layer induced by laser photodisruption was more commonly observed in the 3D group (9 eyes vs. 2; p=0.03).\n\tIn conclusion, the creation of a LASIK flap by a 3D-femtosecond laser cut was safe and effective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"217829572b52149131153c4e135df3c636b7aa92e7da32f46824a7f69f210cb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
