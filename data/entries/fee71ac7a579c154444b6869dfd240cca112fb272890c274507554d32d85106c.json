Phase transitions are milestone events in the cycle of life. LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), ABA INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), FUSCA3 (FUS3), and LEC2 proteins, collectively known as LAFL, are master transcription factors (TFs) regulating seed and other developmental processes. Since the initial characterization of the <span>LAFL</span> genes, more than three decades of active research has generated tremendous amounts of knowledge about these TFs, whose roles in seed development and germination have been comprehensively reviewed. Recent advances in cell biology with genetic and genomic tools have allowed the characterization of the LAFL regulatory networks in previously challenging tissues at a higher throughput and resolution in reference species and crops. In this review, we provide a holistic perspective by integrating advances at the epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and protein levels to exemplify the spatiotemporal regulation of the LAFL networks in <span>Arabidopsis</span> seed development and phase transitions, and we briefly discuss the evolution of these TF networks.</p></div>","author":"Sonia Gazzarrini and Liang Song","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Plant Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f9af7703a9e08f35edcf21995cc07f36402e9892411dd5042fb57fa6c1c4e57d","entryHash":"fee71ac7a579c154444b6869dfd240cca112fb272890c274507554d32d85106c","category":"Environment"}
