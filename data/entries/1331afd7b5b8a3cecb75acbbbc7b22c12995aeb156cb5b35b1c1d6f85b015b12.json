Calcium nitrate has been utilized to treat activated carbon to improve its catalytic ability in the regeneration of Co(II)TETA. The biggest Co(III)TETA conversion is gained by the carbon being soaked in 0.3 mol/L calcium nitrate solution at 65°C for 12 h with a solid/liquid ratio of 1 g/50 mL followed being carbonized at 400°C for 2 h in nitrogen. The characterization with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, XPS, BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and Boehm titration indicates that the modification with calcium nitrate increases the specific surface area and acidic groups on activated carbon. The continuous experiments reveal that the NO removal efficiency obtained by the modified carbon is over 12% up to that by the original one.</p>","author":"Shuang‐wei Zhang, \nZi‐qiu Li, \nXiang‐li Long","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"1331afd7b5b8a3cecb75acbbbc7b22c12995aeb156cb5b35b1c1d6f85b015b12","category":"Environment"}
