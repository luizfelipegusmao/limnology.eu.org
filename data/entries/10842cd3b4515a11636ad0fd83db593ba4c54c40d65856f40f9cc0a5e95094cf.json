{"title":"Suppressive Effects of β-Hydroxybutyrate Administration on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation in Broiler Chickens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1813/v1","date":1721797467000,"content":"β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is generated as one of the ketone bodies in the liver under fasted and hypoglycemic conditions. While BHB is utilized as an alternative energy substrate in extrahe-patic tissues/organs, this ketone body has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects via modulating inflammatory signaling cascades. Several bacterial pathogens that originated in hy-gienic litter conditions consecutively threaten chickens, and its harmful constituent, lipopoly-saccharide (LPS), induces intestinal and systemic inflammation. Therefore, the management of inflammation is a significant concern in poultry production. However, the therapeutic effects of BHB on inflammation have yet to be investigated in chickens. This study demonstrated that BHB administration can alleviate LPS-induced inflammation in broiler chickens, and the effects could be dependent on gene expression levels of ketolytic enzymes, BHB dehydrogenase-1 and suc-cinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase, in extrahepatic tissues/organs. This study is the first to show the therapeutic effects of BHB on LPS-induced inflammation in chickens, possibly via an involvement of BHB utilization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10842cd3b4515a11636ad0fd83db593ba4c54c40d65856f40f9cc0a5e95094cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
