{"title":"BAFormer: A Novel Boundary-Aware Compensation UNet-like Transformer for High-Resolution Cropland Extraction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0053/v1","date":1717400645000,"content":"Utilizing deep learning for semantic segmentation of cropland from remote sensing imagery has become a crucial technique in land surveys. Cropland illustrates diverse morphologies and degrees of fragmentation on the Earthâ€™s surface, underscoring the importance of accurately perceiving the complex boundaries of cropland which are crucial for effective segmentation. This paper introduces a UNet-like boundary-aware compensation model BAFormer. Cropland boundaries typically exhibit rapid transformations in pixel values and texture features, often appearing as high-frequency features in remote-sensing images. To enhance the recognition of these high-frequency features as represented by cropland boundaries, the proposed BAFormer integrates a Feature Adaptive Mixer (FAM) and develops a Deep Wide Large Kernel Multi-Layer Perceptron (DWLK-MLP) to enrich the global and local cropland boundaries features separately. Specifically, FAM adaptively mixes high-frequency and low-frequency features through the advantages of convolution and self-attention; DWLK-MLP expands the convolutional receptive field by deeply decomposing large kernel convolutions. The efficacy of BAFormer has been evaluated on the Vaihingen, Potsdam, and LoveDA public datasets, as well as the Mapcup dataset. It has demonstrated advanced performance, achieving mIoU scores of 84.5%, 87.3%, 53.5%, and 83.1% on these datasets respectively. Notably, BAFormer-T, the lightweight iteration of the model, surpasses other lightweight models on the Vaihingen dataset with scores of 91.3% F1 and 84.1% mIoU.
