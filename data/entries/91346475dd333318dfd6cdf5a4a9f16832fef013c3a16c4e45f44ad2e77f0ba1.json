{"title":"Significant Reduction of Potential Exposure to Extreme Marine Heatwaves by Achieving Carbon Neutrality","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004420?af=R","date":1718456395000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Marine heatwave (MHW), a prolonged period of anomalously warm seawater, has a catastrophic repercussion on marine ecosystems. With global warming, MHWs have become increasingly frequent, intense, and prolonged. To avoid irreversible damages from such extreme events, net-zero carbon emissions by the 2050s, called carbon neutrality, were proposed. Here, we evaluate the impact of carbon neutrality on MHWs in the late 21st century using multi-model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1–1.9 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios. It is found that if the current regional rivalry over carbon emissions continues (i.e., SSP3-7.0), the MHWs in the late 21st century will become stronger and longer than historical ones, especially in the western boundary current and equatorial current regions. Approximately 68% of the global ocean will be exposed to permanent MHWs, regionally 93% in the Indian Ocean, 76% in the Pacific Ocean, 68% in the Atlantic Ocean, 65% in the Coastal Ocean, and 48% in the Southern Ocean. Such MHWs can be significantly reduced by achieving carbon neutrality (i.e., SSP1-1.9). In particular, the spatial proportion of the ocean exposed to permanent MHWs can be reduced to as low as 0.02%–0.07%, depending on the regions. This result underscores the critical importance of ongoing efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions to reduce the potential ecological risks induced by extreme MHWs.</p>","author":"Seok‐Geun Oh, \nSeok‐Woo Son, \nSujong Jeong, \nYang‐Ki Cho","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"91346475dd333318dfd6cdf5a4a9f16832fef013c3a16c4e45f44ad2e77f0ba1","category":"Environment"}
