This article synthesizes findings from extensive academic literature and empirical studies to examine the relationship between healthcare system type and patient outcomes across various countries. By focusing on mortality rates as a key indicator, we elucidate the nuanced impacts of public versus private healthcare delivery. Our analysis reveals the multifaceted challenges inherent in both systems and their implications for patient survival. We conclude by identifying crucial gaps in current research and proposing policy recommendations to optimize healthcare outcomes in diverse global contexts.This revised abstract:Starts with a strong opening statement that immediately captures the topic's importance. Clarifies the article's methodology (synthesizing existing literature and studies).Specifies the focus on mortality rates as the primary outcome measure.Hints at the complexity of the findings, avoiding oversimplification.Ends with a clear statement about the article's contributions to both research and policy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"712553242763db89f79ea5ba0d2696adbcce283116227c640a9da6286ebfad7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
