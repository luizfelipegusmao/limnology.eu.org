Compared to conventional Lorentz TEM with Transport-of-Intensity equation (TIE) and off-axis electron holography, 4D-STEM can achieve better spatial resolution. The key to obtain high quality magnetic field mapping is to accurately determine the position of the central disk in a 4D-STEM pattern, which is very challenging, especially in the presence of complex diffraction contrast within the disk. Here, we propose a robust procedure by refining the peak shape and position of the Circular Hough Transformed diffraction disk to accurately determine the central disk position for magnetic field mapping [<a href=\"#ozae044.496-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"239b5738091f7156cee6b9c144799988d979546621be998c84b5971ebcfa4d80","category":"Environment"}
