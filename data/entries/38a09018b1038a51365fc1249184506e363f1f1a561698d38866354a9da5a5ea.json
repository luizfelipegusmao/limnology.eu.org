{"title":"Role of Graphene Sheets in Controlling Effects of Radon Decay in Human Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1951/v1","date":1724754890000,"content":"It is known that Radon gas within the air could reach lung cells and cause cancer. We suggest a technique to absorb alpha particles radiated by Radon decay near DNAs within human cells. In this technique, we create some non-paired negative electrons on graphene sheets and build some negative graphene tubes. Alpha particles are attracted and negative beta particles are repelled by the graphene tubes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38a09018b1038a51365fc1249184506e363f1f1a561698d38866354a9da5a5ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
