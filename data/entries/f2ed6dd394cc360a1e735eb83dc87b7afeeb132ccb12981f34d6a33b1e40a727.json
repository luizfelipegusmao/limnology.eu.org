{"title":"The potential to prevent unnecessary emergency department visits by timely diagnosis of migraineâ€“A prospective observational study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312106","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Hristina Drangova, Nicole Kofmel, Mattia Branca, David Gloor, Beat Lehmann, Aristomenis Exadaktylos, Simon Jung, Urs Fischer, Christoph J. Schankin</p>\r\nAim <p>Successful acute migraine treatment potentially prevents emergency room (ER) consultations but requires that the diagnosis of migraine was given earlier. The aim of this study is to quantify the problem of missed migraine diagnosis prior to ER visits.</p> Methods <p>Inclusion criterion for this single-center prospective study was the presentation at the ER for acute headache. Patients with acute migraine attacks were assessed for previous migraine attacks, and whether they were given a diagnosis of migraine in the past.</p> Results <p>Of 137 patients with migraine diagnosis at discharge, 108 (79%) had previous headache attacks fulfilling the criteria for migraine according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3). Of those, 54 (50%) received the diagnosis for the first time.</p> Conclusion <p>Half of the migraine patients (50%) presenting in the ER for headache could have been diagnosed earlier. This highlights the need for better detection and treatment of migraine by pre-hospital healthcare providers, as earlier diagnosis and specific acute treatment could have prevented the ER visit.</p>","author":"Hristina Drangova","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f2ed6dd394cc360a1e735eb83dc87b7afeeb132ccb12981f34d6a33b1e40a727","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
