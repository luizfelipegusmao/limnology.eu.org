{"title":"Affective Neuroscience and Sex Differences in the Relationship between Anger and Fear. If Fear Increases, Seeking and Play Decrease, in the Female Sample.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0607/v1","date":1723111532000,"content":"Background. The possible interactions between anger and fear have not been widely explored in the psychological literature. Fear and anger are currently beginning to be studied by looking at their interrelationships, rather than seeing them as simply opposing emotions. Furthermore, there is a tendency to think that anger is more typical of men and fear of women. Our contribution proposes a particular perspective of affective neuroscience. The objectives of the study are: 1) To assess possible differences in affective systems, states, and traits of anger in relation to biological sex; 2) To assess correlations between ANGER, FEAR, and PANIC, state and trait anger in both a female and male sample; 3) To assess possible differences in basic affective systems in relation to different levels of ANGER, FEAR, and PANIC, state and trait anger, in sample of female and in sample of male. Methods. A non-clinical sample of 339 females and 99 males completed the ANPS 3.1 to assess basic affective states and the STAXI 2 to assess anger states and traits. Results. No significant differences were found for ANGER and FEAR scores and for state and trait scores between the male and female samples. Clear correlations emerged (p &lt; .01) between FEAR. PANIC and FEAR in both the female and male samples. Among the differences that emerged in the affective systems, we emphasise that in the female group as FEAR increases, there are significant variations in systems of SEEKING, PLAY, and CARE. Furthermore, only in the female sample as PANIC increases, PLAY progressively decreases, and CARE shows an irregular trend. Discussion. Given the importance of the SEEKING and PLAY systems for well-being and gender equality the hypoactivation of these systems to increases in FEAR and PANIC highlights the need to monitor conditions that may trigger these affective systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a21f9f90eae63af8e63dccbd05c6fad249ea665e39694490df491ebb5d6bfdfc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
