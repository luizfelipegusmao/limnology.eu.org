RIS modifies local composition at these locations and can lead to detrimental consequences. In addition, when the local solution concentration is driven above the solubility limit, precipitation can occur, and the material properties can, as a result, change significantly. For example, in irradiated austenitic stainless steels, RIS causes Cr depletion at grain boundaries that can lead to irradiation-assisted stress-corrosion cracking [<a href=\"#ozae044.659-B2\">2-3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b2bdb4b9d60469272b2ddf4bf02960b5034b2f589c07d2de882b4e6825a16daa","category":"Environment"}
