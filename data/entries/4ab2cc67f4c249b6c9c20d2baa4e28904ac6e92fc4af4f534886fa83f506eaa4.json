{"title":"Numerical Analysis of Hydrogen-Methane Flame in Different Header Types of Premixed Combustors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1643/v1","date":1714272646000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of thin flame combustor design on hydrogen flame characteristics and combustion performance through numerical simulations. Variations in flame shape and combustibility between 100% methane and 100% hydrogen combustion are analyzed. Three combustor header shapes (flat, concave, and convex) are modeled to assess their influence on flame behavior. Results show distinct flow patterns, with concave headers promoting strong central flows and convex headers dispersing the flow outward. Temperature field analysis indicates that hydrogen flames have higher temperatures and shorter quenching distances compared to methane flames. A comparative analysis of combustion products is conducted to evaluate combustion performance and NOx emissions. Consequently, the concave header has high combustibility and increases temperatures and NOx fraction in hydrogen combustion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ab2cc67f4c249b6c9c20d2baa4e28904ac6e92fc4af4f534886fa83f506eaa4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
