{"title":"Overview of the Multifaceted Functions of LncRNA HOTAIR in Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1411/v1","date":1721212812000,"content":"Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor and is considered to be the most common primary one. Recurrence after treatment is a major problem. The recurrence of GBM is related to different cellular mechanisms and molecular signaling. Therapies to prolong survival are not completely effective. Epigenetics and non-coding genetic elements play a crucial role in gliomagenesis. Non-coding RNAs are novel regulatory RNAs that play key roles in different physiological processes such as gene regulation, cell differentiation, and proliferation. Interestingly, some LncRNAs have a tumor suppressor role while others are oncogenic. In this review article, we are going to illustrate the role of a well-known lncRNA HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) in glioma and highlight the possible functions in glioma in both pre-clinical and clinically evident studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9597a82dbebc696efd75a3d4a5e9a808cebdef2727702f4cab4b2c075c78270c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
