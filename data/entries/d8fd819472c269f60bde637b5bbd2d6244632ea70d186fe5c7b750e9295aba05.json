{"title":"Research Progress on the Mechanisms of Terrestrial Plant Uptake, Transport, and Growth Inhibition Responses to Micro (nano) Plastics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0483/v1","date":1720437151000,"content":"Micro (nano) plastics are emerging pollutants and their gradual accumulation in soil due to factors such as improper wastewater processing, plastic film abuse and atmospheric deposition could pose a significant threat to the environment. However, there is limited research on the uptake and transposition of micro (nano) plastics by terrestrial plants and the effects of microplastics on terrestrial plant growth. Therefore, the sources of plastics in soil as well as the uptake and transposition pathways of micro (nano) plastics in terrestrial plants are systematically summarized in this study. The effects of micro (nano) plastics on plants and their mechanisms are thoroughly discussed, which mainly affect the growth and development of plants by blocking roots, triggering oxidative damage and altering the nature of the soil and the microbial community as well as the combined toxic effects with other pollutants. Future research should strengthen the in-situ experiments to study the mechanisms by which soil micro (nano) plastics affect the uptake and transposition of individual plants and plant growth. It should also focus on the factors affecting the uptake of micro-(nano) plastics, the behaviour of micro-(nano) plastics in soil and plant uptake, transposition processes and their mechanisms and combined effects of micro-(nano) plastics and pathogens on plants. Moreover, new detection technologies should be developed to monitor their impacts on ecosystems to better manage their potential risks to the environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8fd819472c269f60bde637b5bbd2d6244632ea70d186fe5c7b750e9295aba05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
