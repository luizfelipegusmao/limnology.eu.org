{"title":"Insights on the Bonding Mechanism, Electronic and Optical Properties of Diamond Nanothread&mdash;Polymer and Cement&mdash;Boron Nitride Nanotube Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0460/v1","date":1717738638000,"content":"The success of composite materials is attributed to the nature of bonding at the nanoscale and the resulting structure-related properties. This study reports the interaction, electronic, and optical properties of diamond nanothread/polymers (cellulose and epoxy) and boron nitride nanotube/calcium silicate hydrate composites using density functional theory modeling. Our findings indicate that the interaction between the nanothread and polymer is due to van der Waals-type bonding. Minor modifications in the electronic structures and absorption spectra are noticed. Conversely, the boron nitride nanotube and calcium silicate hydrate composite display an electron-shared type of interaction. The electronic structure and optical absorption spectra of the diamond nanothread and boron nitride nanotube in all configurations studied in the aforementioned composite systems are well maintained. Our findings offer an electronic-level perspective into the bonding characteristics and electronic-optical properties of diamond nanothread/polymer and boron nitride nanotube/calcium silicate hydrate composites for developing next-generation materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e0fa3ff702924cfa9afa3ccae0b13b26391060c6fd64aafaaa0faa3718737a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
