{"title":"HDAC10 inhibits non-small-cell lung cancer cell ferroptosis through the microRNA-223-5p-SLC7A11 axis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae164/7820071?rss=1","date":1728777600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Objective</div>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading attributor to cancer deaths. High HDAC10 and low microRNA (miR)-223-5p levels have been observed in NSCLC. But their roles remain elusive. This study illustrated their roles in NSCLC cell ferroptosis and the mechanism.<div>Methods</div>HDAC10, miR-223-5p, and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) levels in cells were determined by RT-qPCR. Iron ion content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels were tested using reagent kits, and levels of SLC7A11 and Acyl-CoA synthesis long chain family (ACSL4) were examined using Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecision was performed to analyze the enrichment of HDAC10 and acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9ac) on the miR-223-5p promoter. The targeted binding of miR-223-5p and SLC7A11 was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. Joint experiments were designed to identify the role of miR-223-5p/SLC7A11 axis in HDAC10-regulated ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.<div>Results</div>HDAC10 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells. Silencing HDAC10 significantly reduced GSH and SLC7A11 levels, upregulated iron ion content, ROS levels, and ACSL4 expression, promoting cell ferroptosis. Mechanically, HDAC10 inhibited miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby targeting SLC7A11. The joint experimental results showed that overexpression of SLC7A11 or downregulation of miR-223-5p alleviated the promoting effect of silencing HDAC10 on ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.<div>Conclusion</div>HDAC10 inhibits miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby promoting SLC7A11 expression and inhibiting ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"8fad82336ac9b6643167c3a2c89c840d7a2d555873d95e5b1e5c14a828181b81","category":"Environment"}
