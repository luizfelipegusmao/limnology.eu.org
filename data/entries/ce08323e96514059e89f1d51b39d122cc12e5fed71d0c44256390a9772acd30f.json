This study delves into the ways businesses navigate these disruptions, with a particular emphasis on qualitative insights into risk management practices. The complexity and interconnectivity inherent in modern supply chains make them vulnerable to a broad spectrum of disruptions, ranging from natural disasters and geopolitical conflicts to technological failures and pandemics. Effective supply chain risk management requires a structured approach to identifying potential risks, evaluating their likelihood and potential impact, and formulating robust mitigation strategies. Employing a qualitative research methodology, this study gathers in-depth insights from semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers, industry experts, and executives. The findings underscore the necessity of proactive risk identification and comprehensive assessment processes. Advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain, are highlighted as crucial tools for enhancing visibility and responsiveness within supply chains. Strategies such as diversifying suppliers and maintaining safety stock emerge as vital components of risk mitigation, ensuring supply continuity in the face of disruptions. Strong relationships with suppliers are pivotal, facilitating better information sharing and collaborative problem-solving. Leadership commitment to risk management and fostering a culture of resilience within organizations is also critical. Training programs and simulation exercises are identified as effective means of preparing employees to handle disruptions. Furthermore, adherence to regulatory compliance and a focus on sustainability are integral to maintaining long-term stability and reducing the risk of future disruptions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce08323e96514059e89f1d51b39d122cc12e5fed71d0c44256390a9772acd30f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
