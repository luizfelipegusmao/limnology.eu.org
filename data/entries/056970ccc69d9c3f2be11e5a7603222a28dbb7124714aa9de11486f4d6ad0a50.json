This alopecia is the most common cause of progressive hair loss in men and causes low self-esteem in patients. In this study we used various methods, including quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, ELISA, and immunocytochemistry, to evaluate the biological effects of germinated hemp seeds extract and exosomes derived from calli of germinated hemp seeds. This research reveals pre-ventive functions of two biomaterials (GE2000: 2000 ug/mL germinated hemp seeds extract; E40: 40 ng/mL exosomes derived from calli of germinated hemp seeds) for androgenetic alopecia through three biochemical categories: genetic modulation in hair follicle dermal papilla stem cells (HFDPSCs), cellular differentiation, and modulation of immune systems. Despite exposure to dihydrotestosterone (DT), two materials upregulated alopecia preventing genes including Wnt, β-catenin, and TCF in HFDPSCs. Conversely, alopecia activating genes (STAT1, 5α-reductase type 1, and IL-15R) were suppressed. Moreover, two materials suppressed alopecia genes (NKG2DL, IL2-Rβ, JAK1, and STAT1) in CD8+ T cells. Notably, E40 was effected more in-tensely in these biochemical categories than those of GE2000. Consequently, E40 and GE2000 ef-fectively prevented DT stress. Additionally, two materials activated mechanisms for hair for-mation through the biological activities of three categories.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"056970ccc69d9c3f2be11e5a7603222a28dbb7124714aa9de11486f4d6ad0a50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
