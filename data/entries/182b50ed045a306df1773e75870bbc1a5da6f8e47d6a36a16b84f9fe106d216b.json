{"title":"Research Progress on Ferroptosis-Based Drugs for Renal Cancer Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2175/v1","date":1721991974000,"content":"Renal cancer is a common and serious malignant tumor of the urinary system. While surgery effectively treats early-stage renal cancer, advanced cases pose a significant challenge due to poor treatment outcomes and chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of programmed cell death characterized by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides, which plays a critical role in tumor progression and drug resistance. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of renal cancer, ferroptosis related genes can induce cell apoptosis, and can be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of renal cancer and participate in drug resistance of renal cancer chemotherapy. With the continuous improvement of the mechanism of ferroptosis, drugs targeting ferroptosis for the treatment of renal cancer are emerging in an endless stream, Based on the theoretical basis of the occurrence of ferroptosis, this paper reviewed drug-induced ferroptosis in renal cancer cells from the aspects of herbal medicine, natural compounds, drug resistance mechanisms, and nanomaterials, hoping to provide a new strategy for the treatment of renal cancer with ferroptosis related drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"182b50ed045a306df1773e75870bbc1a5da6f8e47d6a36a16b84f9fe106d216b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
