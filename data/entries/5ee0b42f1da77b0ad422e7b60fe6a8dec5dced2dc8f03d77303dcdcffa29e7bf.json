{"title":"Thermography in Pig Farming: A PLF Technique from Breeding to Slaughter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1508/v1","date":1716444122000,"content":"Infrared thermography is a contactless imaging technique, useful to measure surface temperature at distance which has been widely applied in animal production. The possible applications within the pig husbandry include sow heat detection, reduction of the incidence of neonatal mortality, recognition of febrile state caused by pathogens, study of metabolic efficiency, evaluation of stress caused by heat, by constraints, or by aggressive interaction and meat quality prediction. Even if this technique could be easily influenced by environmental factors, the continuous improvement in the procedures and the decrease in the cost of the equipment will allow in the next future new and more applications in swine farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ee0b42f1da77b0ad422e7b60fe6a8dec5dced2dc8f03d77303dcdcffa29e7bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
