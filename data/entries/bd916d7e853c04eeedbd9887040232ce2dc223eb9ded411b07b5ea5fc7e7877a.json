{"title":"Utilization of the Fungus Pycnoporus sp. for Remediation of a Sugarcane Industry Effluent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2051/v1","date":1721986417000,"content":"Lignocellulosic fungi are highly versatile organisms with valuable applications in bioremediation processes, including the biodegradation of agro-industrial effluents. In this work, the use of a native strain of the white-rot fungus, Pycnoporus aff. sanguineus, was studied for its use in the bioremediation of the sugar industry waste called vinasse, originating from the San Mart√≠n del Tabacal Sugar Mill, located in the north of the Salta province, Argentina. We studied under controlled laboratory conditions the bioremediation process of 3 concentrations of vinasse (5, 10, and 25% in distilled water) with a native isolated strain. The results showed biomass growth at all three tested concentrations, with a maximum at the highest vinasse concentration (25%), while the percentages of color and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal indicated that the most efficient treatment was with 10% vinasse. The results obtained are promising for the treatment of effluents from the sugar industry using white-rot fungi considering the valuable subproducts of Pycnoporus spp. biomass.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd916d7e853c04eeedbd9887040232ce2dc223eb9ded411b07b5ea5fc7e7877a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
