{"title":"Sow reproductive and progeny growth performance when fed Pichia guilliermondii yeast postbiotic: systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae137/7758101?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Previous research suggested that feeding sows with a product containing an inactivated strain specific <span>Pichia guilliermondii</span> yeast postbiotic (<strong>PG</strong>; Citristim, ADM Animal Nutrition, Quincy, IL) has the potential to support fecundity, and progeny performance at birth, weaning, and after weaning. To summarize these effects, a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis was carried out to determine the effects of feeding sows with PG during gestation and lactation on reproductive the performance of sows and the growth of progeny after weaning. All experiments included were randomized trials reporting side-by-side comparisons of an appropriate control (<strong>CON</strong>) and the CON with the inclusion of PG. The effects of PG inclusion in sow diets were evaluated using the raw mean difference and effect size calculations. Analysis included seven trials for sow reproductive and litter performance until weaning, and eight trials for progeny performance after weaning. The risk of publication bias was assessed by funnel plots. In the case of publication bias, the Trim and Fill method was used. Heterogeneity was assessed using <span>I</span><sup>2</sup> statistics. Sows fed PG during gestation and lactation had more piglets born alive (BA), BA + stillborn, and BA + stillborn + mummies (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). The individual birth weight of the piglets was not affected by the supplementation (<span>P</span> = 0.835). As a result, litter weight at birth was greater in sows-fed PG (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Piglets born from PG-fed sows tended to be weaned 0.34 d younger than those from CON-fed sows (<span>P</span> = 0.060). Twenty-one-day adjusted pig weight at weaning tended to be lighter by 0.122 kg in the PG sow group (<span>P</span> = 0.069); however, litter weight at weaning adjusted to 21 d remained similar across groups (<span>P</span> = 0.516). The number of piglets weaned and mortality-adjusted number of piglets weaned per sow were greater in PG than in CON sows (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.023). A carryover effect was observed for progeny of PG-fed sows after weaning. Piglets born from PG-supplemented sows had greater weight gain (<span>P</span> = 0.030) and tended to have a better survival rate (<span>P</span> = 0.055) until the end of the nursery phase. These results indicate that feeding PG to sows during gestation and lactation consistently and significantly improves not only the performance of sows at farrowing but also performance of the progeny after weaning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"9286ecbd3951736deffc7d6e99e49a0bf098929350f60893b83be78acea7d33c","category":"Environment"}
