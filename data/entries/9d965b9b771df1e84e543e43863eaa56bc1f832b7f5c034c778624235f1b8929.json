{"title":"Catabolism of phenolics from grape peel and its effects on gut microbiota during in vitro colonic fermentation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13540?af=R","date":1713266919000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Grape peels, the main by-products of wine processing, are rich in bioactive ingredients of phenolics, including proanthocyanidins, flavonoids and anthocyanins. Phenolics have the function of regulating intestinal microbiota and promoting intestinal health. From the perspective of the dietary nutrition of grape peel phenolics (GPP), this study was to investigate the influence of GPP on the composition and metabolism of human gut microbiota during <i>in vitro</i> fermentation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results indicated that GPP could decrease pH and promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). ACE and Chao1 indices in GPP group were lower than that of the Blank group. GPP enhanced the levels of <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG-004</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>, but reduced the <i>Firmicutes</i>/<i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio. KEGG enrichment pathways related to phenolic acid metabolism mainly included flavonoid, anthocyanin, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. Gut microbiota could accelerate the release and breakdown of phenolic compounds, resulting in a decrease in the content of hesperetin-7-<i>O</i>-glucoside, delphinidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-rutinoside <i>etc. In vitro</i> antibacterial test found that GPP increased the diameters of the inhibition zones of <i>Escherichia</i> coli (<i>E.</i> coli) and <i>Staphylococcus</i> aureus (<i>S.</i> aureus) in a dose-dependent manner.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The above results revealed that GPP might be a potential prebiotic-like to prevent diseases by improving gut health. This study could provide theoretical basis for potential to exploit GPP as dietary nutrition to maintain intestinal function.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
