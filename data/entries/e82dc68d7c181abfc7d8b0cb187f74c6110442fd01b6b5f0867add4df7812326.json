The interaction is electrostatic and is described as a Rutherford backscattering process. The elastic peak is a strong signal of the secondary electron distribution and allows the measurement of recoil losses at low primary beam current in the nA range. Correspondingly, a high spatial resolution can be achieved in a SEM. The measurement of the recoil energy loss requires a high energy resolution analyzer to measure the elastic peak position and shape. The compact energy analyzer used is described in [<a href=\"#ozae044.099-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.099-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e82dc68d7c181abfc7d8b0cb187f74c6110442fd01b6b5f0867add4df7812326","category":"Environment"}
