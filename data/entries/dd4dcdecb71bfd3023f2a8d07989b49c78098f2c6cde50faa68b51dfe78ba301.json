{"title":"Evaluating the Efficiency of zk-SNARK, zk-STARK, and Bulletproof in Real-World Scenarios: A Benchmark Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0397/v1","date":1720079735000,"content":"This study builds on our previous Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that assessed the applications and performance of zk-SNARK, zk-STARK, and Bulletproof Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof (NIZKP) protocols. To address identified research gaps, we designed and implemented a benchmark comparing these three protocols using a dynamic MiMC hash application. We evaluated performance across four general-purpose programming libraries and two programming languages. Our results show that zk-SNARK produced the smallest proofs, while zk-STARK generated the largest. In terms of proof generation and verification times, zk-STARK was the fastest, and Bulletproof the slowest. Interestingly, zk-SNARK proofs verified marginally faster than zk-STARK, contrary to other findings. These insights enhance our understanding of the functionality, security, and performance of NIZKP protocols, providing valuable guidance for selecting the most suitable protocol for specific applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd4dcdecb71bfd3023f2a8d07989b49c78098f2c6cde50faa68b51dfe78ba301","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
