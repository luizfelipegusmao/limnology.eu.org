{"title":"Assessment of trabecular bone score using updated TBS<sub>TT</sub> in anorexia nervosa—The AN-BO study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311499","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Judith Haschka, Martina Behanova, Didier Hans, Annina Arens, Christian Muschitz, Larisa Dzirlo, Julia Binder, Stylianos Kapiotis, Jochen Zwerina, Heinrich Resch, Roland Kocijan</p>\r\nObjective <p>Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is characterized by a distortion of body image, very low body weight, malnutrition and hormonal dysregulations, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and impaired bone microarchitecture. The updated Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) algorithm accounts for soft tissue thickness (TBS<sub>TT</sub>) instead of BMI (TBS<sub>BMI</sub>). The aim of the study was to assess both TBS algorithms in adult AN patients compared to normal-weight controls(CTRL).</p> Method <p>This retrospective cross-sectional study investigated 34 adult female anorexia nervosa (AN) patients and 26 healthy normal-weighted age- and sex-matched controls (CTRL). Bone texture analysis was assessed by TBS<sub>TT</sub> and TBS<sub>BMI</sub> (TBS iNsight<sup>®</sup> V4.0 and V3.1), bone mineral density (BMD; lumbar spine LS, femoral neck, total hip) and body composition by DXA (GE Lunar iDXA<sup>TM</sup>). Laboratory analyses included bone turnover markers (CTX; P1NP; sclerostin). Data analysis was performed using parametric (t-test) or non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney-U-Test) depending on normality, one-way ANCOVA and correlation analysis (Perason’s or Spearman’s).</p> Results <p>AN patients (BMI 14.7(1.6)) and CTRL (BMI 22.4(4.0)) were of comparable age (22.8(7.1) vs.25.0(4.0)years, p = 0.145). TBS<sub>TT</sub>(1.319±0.09 vs.1.502±0.07, p&lt;0.001) and TBS<sub>BMI</sub>(1.317±0.10 vs.1.548±0.09, p&lt;0.001) were significantly lower in AN patients compared to CTRL. Soft tissue thickness was lower in AN (p&lt;0.001). Within the CTRL group, but not in AN, TBS<sub>TT</sub> and TBS<sub>BMI</sub> were significantly different (p&lt;0.001). BMD was lower at all sites in AN patients (p&lt;0.001 for all), being lowest at LS. Bone Mineral Content, Lean Body mass and Fat Mass were lower in AN (p&lt;0.001). AN patients had lower P1NP (p = 0.05), but higher CTX (p = 0.001) and sclerostin (p = 0.003) levels.</p> Conclusion <p>Adult AN patients have lower TBS<sub>TT</sub> and TBS<sub>BMI</sub>, reduced BMD and an uncoupling of bone turnover. In AN both TBS algorithms show similar reduced trabecular bone microarchitecture. The observed difference of TBS<sub>TT</sub> and TBS<sub>BMI</sub> in CTRL with normal body composition highlight the importance of the new algorithm.</p>","author":"Judith Haschka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6063d4f94484b4f11a6701384de7dcfc8de7aeaf13d25b0907ae688baded5b9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
