{"title":"A Survey of Quantitative Techniques in Electricity Consumption â€“ A Global Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0062/v1","date":1722506120000,"content":"This study uses the Scopus and Web of Science databases to review the forecast of electricity consumption from 2015 to 2024. Based on the keywords used in the article title, which are associated with electricity consumption forecasts, the study retrieved 821 docu-ments for additional analysis using various techniques. For frequency analysis, we used Mi-crosoft Excel; for data visualisation, we used VOSviewer; and for citation metrics and analysis, we used Harzing's Publish or Perish. Standard bibliometric variables, including publication growth, authorship patterns, collaboration, prolific authors, national contribution, most active institutions, favourite journals, and highly cited articles, are used in this study's reporting of the findings. Our analysis indicates that over ten years, starting in 2015, publications on the forecasting of electricity consumption have continued to increase. China was the country that contributed the most to research on electricity consumption. Most of the research publications on electricity consumption were published in the Journal of Energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1db3ab607bbf18912190a667a80d3ad82d7f1f9e9267c2b73ee9f1d4f4498ea4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
