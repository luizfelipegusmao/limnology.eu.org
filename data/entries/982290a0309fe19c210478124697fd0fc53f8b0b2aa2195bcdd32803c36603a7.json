{"title":"Volatiles from nutritional fungal symbiont influence the attraction of Anisandrus maiche (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to ethanol-baited traps","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/108/7515197?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Anisandrus maiche</span> Stark (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is a non-native ambrosia beetle from central Asia that has been spreading throughout the eastern United States since 2005. Preferred hosts of <span>A. maiche</span> are not well characterized within its currently invaded range, but it is established in managed and natural forests throughout Indiana. Current monitoring and detection efforts for this beetle rely on ethanol-baited traps, but fungal volatiles may alter the attraction of <span>A. maiche</span> to ethanol. In this study, we conducted trapping experiments in Indiana to determine the extent to which a suite of common fungal alcohols influences the response of <span>A. maiche</span> to ethanol-baited traps. We then evaluated isoamyl and isobutyl alcohol as potential attractants for <span>A. maiche</span> and their ability to enhance attraction to ethanol. Lastly, we used SPME-GC-MS to identify volatiles from <span>Ambrosiella cleistominuta</span> (Mayers &amp; Harr.), the fungal symbiont of <span>A. maiche</span>, grown for 7 and 14 days on malt extract agar. Benzyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, hexanol, methyl phenylacetate, phenethyl alcohol, and piperitone reduced the attraction of <span>A. maiche</span> to ethanol-baited traps in the field. Moreover, adding methyl benzoate and isoamyl alcohol individually to ethanol-baited traps did not further increase <span>A. maiche</span> capture. When paired with ethanol, isoamyl alcohol repelled beetles in the early flight period but did not significantly increase trap capture during the fall flight. These results represent a first step in understanding the role of fungal volatiles in the colonization behavior of <span>A. maiche</span> and may ultimately inform management strategies for this species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"982290a0309fe19c210478124697fd0fc53f8b0b2aa2195bcdd32803c36603a7","category":"Environment"}
