In this paper, we present an improved mountain gazelle optimizer (IMGO) based on the newly proposed mountain gazelle optimizer (MGO) and design a binary version of IMGO (BIMGO) to solve the feature selection problem for medical data. First, the gazelle population is initialized using iterative chaotic map with infinite collapses (ICMIC) mapping, which increases the diversity of the population. Second, a nonlinear control factor is introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation components of the algorithm. Individuals in the population are perturbed using a spiral perturbation mechanism to enhance the local search capability of the algorithm. Finally, a neighborhood search strategy is used for the optimal individuals to enhance the exploitation and convergence capabilities of the algorithm. The superior ability of the IMGO algorithm to solve continuous problems is demonstrated on 23 benchmark datasets. Then, BIMGO is evaluated on 16 medical datasets of different dimensions and compared with 8 well-known metaheuristic algorithms. The experimental results indicate that BIMGO outperforms the competing algorithms in terms of the fitness value, number of selected features and sensitivity. In addition, the statistical results of the experiments demonstrate the significantly superior ability of BIMGO to select the most effective features in medical datasets.","author":"Ying Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1187f4fbed4d951e0583d3170f16dc770841603915c133afb0009676be06931f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
