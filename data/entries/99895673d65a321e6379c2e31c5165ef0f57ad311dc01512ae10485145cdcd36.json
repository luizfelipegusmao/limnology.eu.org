{"title":"Assessing Invasive Carp in the Neosho River‐Grand Lake System of Kansas and Oklahoma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/4270117?af=R","date":1726579066000,"content":"<p>Invasive carp populations have purported a negative influence on native biota at high densities. These invasive fishes (i.e., bighead carp <i>Hypophthalmichthys nobilis</i>, silver carp <i>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</i>, grass carp <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and black carp <i>Mylopharyngodon piceus</i>) each exhibit similar life history characteristics. In the Neosho River-Grand Lake system (i.e., John Redmond Reservoir, Kansas, downstream to Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees, Oklahoma), only bighead carp and grass carp have been documented to date. The distribution and status of bighead carp throughout this system were previously unknown due to limited historical data and low abundance. While few bighead carp are encountered within this system, grass carp exhibited relatively higher abundance a were used to provide insights into bighead carp. Captures of both species were used to inform management and suppression efforts. Sampling locations (<i>n</i> = 18) were established for environmental DNA analyses throughout the Neosho River-Grand Lake system. We sampled 13 sites using a suite of gears for standardized targeted fish sampling. All invasive carp were measured, sexed, and otoliths removed for ageing and microchemical analysis. Grass carp were processed for ploidy testing following the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protocol. Environmental DNA analyses generated positive results for the eDNA presence of bighead carp and silver carp. Otolith age estimates suggest fish are long lived and supported by multiple year classes. Additionally, a sampled two-year-old grass carp demonstrates spawning and recruitment potential. Otolith microchemistry suggests largescale broad movement patterns. Ploidy testing confirmed the first documented evidence of diploid grass carp in the Neosho River-Grand Lake system and revealed reproductive viability. Our results may provide future insights into locations for containment, removal, and/or eradication.</p>","author":"Ethan J. Rasset, \nHae H. Kim, \nBen C. Neely, \nQuinton E. Phelps, \nGreg W.
