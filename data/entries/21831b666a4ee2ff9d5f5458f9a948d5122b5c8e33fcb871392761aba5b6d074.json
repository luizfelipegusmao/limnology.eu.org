{"title":"Role of Lipoprotein(a) Reduction in Cardiovascular Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0673/v1","date":1728458750000,"content":"Recent studies have shown that Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an important risk factor for a plethora of different cardiovascular diseases. It has been proven that Lp(a) levels are genetically determined, and correlate with risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of lifestyle factors. As of yet, treatment options to reduce Lp(a) levels are limited, but new research into Lp(a) reduction yields promising results. This review delves into Lp(a) biochemistry, mechanism of effect, association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular diseases, and possible therapies to minimize cardiovascular disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21831b666a4ee2ff9d5f5458f9a948d5122b5c8e33fcb871392761aba5b6d074","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
