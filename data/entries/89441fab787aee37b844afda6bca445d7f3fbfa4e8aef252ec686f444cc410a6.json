{"title":"Impact of Social Media Marketing Activities and ESG Green Brand Involvement on Green Product Repurchase","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1138/v1","date":1710855151000,"content":"Global warming, exacerbated by greenhouse gas emissions from non-green product manufacturing, necessitates a shift towards green production to safeguard ecosystems and finite resources. The United Nations Environment Programme emphasizes the importance of environmental considerations in corporate ESG criteria. Despite the higher costs of designing and manufacturing green products, which deter some companies and lead to greenwashing, efforts persist to promote sustainable goods. This study explores enhancing consumer repurchase intentions for green products through social media marketing, emphasizing green values, environmental concerns, brand image, and involvement. Findings reveal social media's role in boosting these factors, thus encouraging green repurchases. Insights are valuable for green businesses, social media groups, environmental agencies, and future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89441fab787aee37b844afda6bca445d7f3fbfa4e8aef252ec686f444cc410a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
