{"title":"Investigating Inherited Heart Diseases Using Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2169/v1","date":1727413634000,"content":"Inherited heart diseases (IHDs) are caused by genetic mutations that disrupt the physiological structure and function of the heart. Understanding the mechanisms behind these diseases is crucial for developing personalised interventions in cardiovascular medicine. Development of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated to any nucleated adult cell type, has enabled the creation of personalised single-cell and multicellular models, providing unprecedented insights into the pathophysiology of IHDs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in human iPSC models used to dissect the molecular and genetic underpinnings of common IHDs. We examine multicellular models and tissue engineering approaches, such as cardiac organoids, engineered heart tissue, and multicellular co-culture systems, which simulate complex intercellular interactions within heart tissue. Recent advancements in stem cell models offer a more physiologically relevant platform to study disease mechanisms, enabling researchers to observe cellular interactions, study disease progression, and identify therapeutic strategies. By leveraging these innovative models, we can gain deeper insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying IHDs, ultimately paving the way for more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"990d94fbf78a582d7f1bf046e928607bbbd1c609863f700205641e2292f79719","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
