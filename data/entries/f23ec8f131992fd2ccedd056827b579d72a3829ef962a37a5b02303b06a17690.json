{"title":"Globalization versus Regionalization in Agri-Food Exports from Spain and Portugal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0989/v1","date":1715722253000,"content":"The Southern European countries of Spain and Portugal both show a high degree of export spe-cialization in agri-food products compared to the EU-27 as a whole. This sector plays a funda-mental role in their economies, determining the management of natural resources, with the food and beverage industry being the most important manufacturing activity in both countries. Drawing on evidence obtained from Eurostat's database on foreign trade, this study analyzes whether the geographical concentration of agri-food exports from the Iberian Peninsula coun-tries to the EU-27 increases between 2008 and 2022, or, conversely, if there is a process of spatial diversification in favor of non-EU markets. Expansion towards new trading partners, as indicat-ed by estimated concentration indices, is significant in Spain but does not occur in Portugal. However, in both economies, the regional market with European partners, characterized by strong competition and low development expectations, remains decisive in the evolution of their exports in the short and medium term. Consequently, institutions and companies in this sector must adopt a more dynamic approach and implement measures that allow for increased sales orientation towards higher growth markets, thus enhancing the global competitiveness of the national agri-food sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f23ec8f131992fd2ccedd056827b579d72a3829ef962a37a5b02303b06a17690","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
