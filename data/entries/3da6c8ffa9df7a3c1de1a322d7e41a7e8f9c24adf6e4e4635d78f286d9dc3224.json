{"title":"Validation of the Kinematic Assessment Protocol Used in the Technology Supported Neurorehabilitation System: Rehabilitation Technologies for Hand and Arm (R3THA&trade;), in Children with Cerebral Palsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0335/v1","date":1717652560000,"content":"This study evaluates the R3THA™ technology-supported assessment protocol for home-based rehabilitation in children with cerebral palsy (CP). It focuses on the reliability and validity of R3THA™ in assessing hand and arm function, comparing kinematic assessments with standard clinical assessments. Conducted during a 4-week summer camp, the study involved children with CP aged 3-18, assessing their functional and impairment levels. The findings suggest that R3THA™ is more reliable for children aged 8 and older, indicating that age significantly influences the protocol's effectiveness. Results also showed that R3THA-AP's kinematic measurements of hand and wrist movements were positively correlated with the Box and Blocks Test Index (BBTI), reflecting hand function and dexterity. Additionally, R3THA-AP's accuracy metrics for hand and wrist activities aligned with the Melbourne Assessment 2's Range of Motion (MA2-ROM) scores, suggesting a meaningful relationship between R3THA-AP data and clinical assessments of motor skills. However, no significant correlations were observed between R3THA-AP and MA2's accuracy and dexterity measures, indicating areas for further research. These findings validate R3THA-AP's utility in assessing motor abilities in CP, supporting its integration into clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3da6c8ffa9df7a3c1de1a322d7e41a7e8f9c24adf6e4e4635d78f286d9dc3224","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
