Due to the polar structure of BiInO<sub>3</sub> (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>-type) [<a href=\"#ozae044.552-B4\">4</a>], twin domains readily form during the cooling process post-growth, involving phase transformations from a high-temperature non-polar to a low-temperature polar phase. The reduced dimensionality and distinct chemical and structural characteristics at the domain walls hold the potential to significantly impact device performance [<a href=\"#ozae044.552-B5\">5</a>]. Therefore, a thorough multiscale characterization becomes imperative.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0eeb4301988936da3f56a40768a580c8fdd524193dba6d77505fc0d428777f89","category":"Environment"}
