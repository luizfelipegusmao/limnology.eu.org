Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, data were collected from 96 individuals classified as R1 and R2 by the European Commission. A detailed questionnaire and Web-Assisted Personal Interviewing (WAPI) identified key relationships. Findings show a significant positive correlation between job satisfaction and research perfor-mance, underscoring the role of professional satisfaction in fostering sustainable academic ex-cellence. Professional commitment is also a crucial predictor of research performance, aligning with existing studies and highlighting the importance of sustainable career practices. Statistical analysis via SPSS version 23.0 validated the initial hypotheses, emphasizing each dimension's significance in a sustainable academic career. Results reflect Romania's research environment, emphasizing the need for sustainable working conditions, effective research evaluation, sup-portive career frameworks, and strong professional commitment to motivate young researchers. This research proposes innovative, sustainable practices for enhancing academic performance and career management, advocating clear objectives, leadership development, continuous competency improvement, and a collaborative, inclusive work environment. Understanding these factors aids individuals and institutions in making informed decisions that support sustainable academic career trajectories and professional growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26ab4fa400f42db4b0e5df22269265077af506c0baf1f29275e9a6a658614032","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
