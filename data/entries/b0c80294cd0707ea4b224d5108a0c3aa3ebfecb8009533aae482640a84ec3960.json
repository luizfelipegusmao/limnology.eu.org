It is thus unclear whether women receive appropriate and sufficient information on side effects they may experience. The objective of this study is to describe which specific side effects of hormonal contraception or copper IUD users are counseled on and identify relevant user characteristics associated with receipt of counseling, using nationally representative cross-sectional data from Ethiopia. Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of women between October and December 2019. Analyses were restricted to 2,039 current users of hormonal contraception (implant, injectable, pill, or emergency contraception) or the copper IUD. Descriptive analyses identified the types and number of side effects, across all methods and by the injectable, implant, and pill. Multinomial regression identified factors associated with receipt of counseling on bleeding changes only, non-bleeding changes only, or both, relative to no counseling on side effects, adjusting for method type, source, and socio-economic characteristics. Less than 10% of users were told of at least one bleeding and non-bleeding side effect. Relative to implant users, injectable and other method users were less likely to be told about bleeding changes only (aRRR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46–0.93 and aRRR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.16–0.61, respectively) and users of other methods were less likely to be told about both a bleeding and non-bleeding change (aRRR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.19–0.93). Users who received their method from a non-public source were less likely to receive counseling on any kind of side effect and nulliparous women were less likely to be told about both kinds of side effects. There is need to improve counseling on the method specific side effects on which women are counseled, particularly in the private sector.","author":"Linnea A.
