{"title":"The Arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov: A Crossroad between Free Speech and Content Moderation through the Lens of the Harm Principle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2053/v1","date":1724840462000,"content":"The arrest of Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, represents a critical moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding free speech and content moderation. This event exemplifies the tension between upholding individual liberties and addressing the potential societal harms caused by unregulated digital communication. This paper explores the implications of Durov’s arrest and Telegram’s stance on free speech through the lens of John Stuart Mill’s Harm Principle. The Harm Principle, as articulated in Mill’s seminal work On Liberty (1859), provides a valuable theoretical framework for examining the balance between individual freedom and societal protection. This paper argues that the application of the Harm Principle can offer a nuanced perspective on the ethical responsibilities of digital platforms like Telegram in the age of global communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c244219b5eff4c4407ec6540858a4f2d10988e87efc37614bbb7b65ad4c7123","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
