{"title":"AI-Enhanced Healthcare: Integrating ChatGPT-4 in ePROs for Improved Oncology Care and Decision Making:A pilot Evaluation.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1755/v1","date":1719352343000,"content":"Background:\nIn 2023, ChatGPT-4 has been impactful across several sectors including healthcare, where it aids in medical information analysis and education. Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePROs) play a crucial role in monitoring cancer patients’ post-treatment symptoms, enabling early in-terventions. However, managing the voluminous ePRO data presents significant challenges. This study assesses the feasibility of utilizing ChatGPT-4 for analyzing side effect data from ePROs.\n                             Methods:\nThirty cancer patients were consecutively collected via a web-based ePRO platform, reporting side effects over 4 weeks. ChatGPT-4, simulating oncologists, dietitians, and nurses, analyzed this data and offered improvement suggestions, which were then reviewed by professionals in those fields.\nResults:\nTwo oncologists, two dieticians and two nurses evaluated the AI’s performance across roles with 540 reviews. ChatGPT-4 excelled in data accuracy and completeness, and was noted for its empathy and support, enhancing communication and reducing caregiver stress. It was particularly effective as a dietician.\nDiscussion:\nChatGPT-4 shows promise in processing ePRO data with high accuracy, suggesting that AI can enhance clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, its limitations in emotional engagement highlight the need for AI to supplement, not replace, human care. Emphasizing the role of dietitians underscores the importance of nutritional advice in cancer care. Future studies will further explore the feasible application of AI and ePRO in cancer care clinical processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b43d522e8354d9af193241701c88efa6b01d276f8ee8899532da18a79ea66add","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
