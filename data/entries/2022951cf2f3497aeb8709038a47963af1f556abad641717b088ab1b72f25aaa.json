{"title":"Pathogen perception and signaling in plant immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1465/7585700?rss=1","date":1705968000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant diseases are a constant and serious threat to agriculture and ecological biodiversity. Plants possess a sophisticated innate immunity system capable of detecting and responding to pathogen infection to prevent disease. Our understanding of this system has grown enormously over the past century. Early genetic descriptions of plant disease resistance and pathogen virulence were embodied in the gene-for-gene hypothesis, while physiological studies identified pathogen-derived elicitors that could trigger defense responses in plant cells and tissues. Molecular studies of these phenomena have now coalesced into an integrated model of plant immunity involving cell surface and intracellular detection of specific pathogen-derived molecules and proteins culminating in the induction of various cellular responses. Extracellular and intracellular receptors engage distinct signaling processes but converge on many similar outputs with substantial evidence now for integration of these pathways into interdependent networks controlling disease outcomes. Many of the molecular details of pathogen recognition and signaling processes are now known, providing opportunities for bioengineering to enhance plant protection from disease. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of the main principles of plant immunity, with an emphasis on the key scientific milestones leading to these insights.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"2022951cf2f3497aeb8709038a47963af1f556abad641717b088ab1b72f25aaa","category":"Environment"}
