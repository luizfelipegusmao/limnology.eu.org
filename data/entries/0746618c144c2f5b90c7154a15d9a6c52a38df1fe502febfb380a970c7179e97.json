{"title":"Phase transition thermodynamics of 1,3,5-tris-(α-naphthyl)benzene: theory and experiment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0240/v1","date":1712135656000,"content":"1,3,5-Tris-(α-naphthyl)benzene is an organic non-electrolyte with notable stability of an amorphous phase. Its glassy and supercooled liquid states were previously studied by spectroscopic and calorimetric methods. However, the thermodynamic parameters of phase transitions available from the literature are inconsistent. In this work, the heat capacities of crystalline and liquid phases, the temperature dependence of the saturated vapor pressures, fusion and vaporization enthalpies were determined using differential and fast scanning calorimetry and verified using the estimates based on solution calorimetry. The structural features of 1,3,5-tris-(α-naphthyl)benzene are discussed based on the computations performed and the data on the molecular refractivity. The consistency between the values obtained by independent techniques was demonstrated. The deviations in the previously published data were attributed to possible polymorphism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0746618c144c2f5b90c7154a15d9a6c52a38df1fe502febfb380a970c7179e97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
