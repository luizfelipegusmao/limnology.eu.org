{"title":"Neurodevelopment of Children Born with Forceps Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1104/v1","date":1715853333000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Forceps delivery is a crucial obstetrical technique that has been increasingly underutilized in favor of cesarean delivery, despite numerous complications related to cesarean section. The major concerns in assisted vaginal birth (AVB) are the safety and long-term consequences. Thus, we aimed to investigate the neurodevelopmental outcome of children born with forceps delivery up to the age of seven.\nMethods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted from January 2011 to December 2016 among 49 women from our department in the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Clinical Center of Serbia. The study included women with term singleton cephalic pregnancies. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the baseline demographic and clinical features, whereas the logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between various perinatal parameters and neurological status of newborns. The Sarnat and Sarnat classification was used to evaluate neurological status of newborns, while long-term neurodevelopmental outcome was assesed with Griffiths Mental Development Scale and additional questions based on the neurologist's clinical practice and experience.\nResults: Pathological neurological status of the newborn was found in 16.3%, with pathological ultrasound of CNS in 3%. A statistically significant association was observed with Apgar score, odds ratio of 0.575 (95% CI: 0.407–0.813, p = 0.002) and perinatal asphyxia, odds ratio of 9.882 (95% CI: 1.111–87.902, p = 0.04). However, this was unlikely to be related to the mode of delivery. Long-term adverse neurological outcome was seen in three cases, which accounts for 6.4%. These included mild disorders, such as delayed milestone, speech delay and motor clumsiness. \nConclusion: The present study highlights the safety of forceps delivery regarding children's neurological outcomes at 7 years of age. This is an important contribution to the modern management of labor, especially in light of increasing rates of cesarean deliveries worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1171f772d4f2f42cc0b1c64d3b2a79a0038e9d094cdec570a5327b913bdc9d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
