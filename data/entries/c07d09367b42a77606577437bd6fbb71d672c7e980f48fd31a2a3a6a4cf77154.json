{"title":"Dynamical Behaviors of a Stochastic SITRS Cholera Model With Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0187/v1","date":1717560203000,"content":"In this study, a cholera infection model with the bilinear infection rate is developed by considering the perturbation of the infection rate by the mean-reverting process. First of all, we give the existence of a globally unique positive solution for a stochastic system at arbitrary initial value. On this basis, the sufficient condition for the model to have an ergodic stationary distribution is given by constructing proper Lyapunov functions and tight sets. This indicates in a biological sense the long-term persistence of cholera infection. Furthermore, after transforming the stochastic model to an relevant linearised system, an accurate expression for the probability density function of the stochastic model around a quasi-endemic equilibrium is derived. Subsequently, the sufficient condition to make the disease extinct is also derived. Eventually, the theoretical findings are shown by numerical simulations. Numerical simulations show that the impact of regression speed and fluctuation intensity on stochastic systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c07d09367b42a77606577437bd6fbb71d672c7e980f48fd31a2a3a6a4cf77154","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
