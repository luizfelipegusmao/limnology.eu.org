{"title":"Gemcitabine Delivery System Based on Chitosan Capsules with Magnetite and Natural Zeolite (Clinoptilolite). Synthesis, Characterization and Evaluation of Its Anticancer and Bactericidal Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0846/v1","date":1726042921000,"content":"Cancer and infectious diseases are two of the world's major public health problems. Gemcitabine (GEM) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent against several types of cancer. In this study, we developed macrocapsules by incorporating GEM into a chitosan matrix blended with magnetite and zeolite. The physico-chemical characterization of the precursor materials and the new delivery system was carried out by HRTEM-ED, XRD, FESEM-EDS, FT-IR, TGA, encapsulation efficiency (%E.E.) and release profiles at pH 7.4 and 5.0. Cell viability tests on A549 and H1299 cell lines and microbiological properties against staphylococcal strains were performed. Our results revealed the successful production of hemispherical capsules with an average diameter of 1.22 mm, a rough surface and characteristic FT-IR material interaction bands. GEM encapsulation rates exceeded 80%, and release profiles were well-controlled over 24 hours at tested pH levels. Notably, cell viability in H1299 cells was lower than the free GEM control. Moreover, the formulation exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, highlighting its dual action as a chemotherapeutic and antimicrobial agent. This dual effect underscores the potential of these macrocapsules as innovative delivery system for treating lung cancer in patients who are also at risk of infectious diseases and who are immunosuppressed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a853afde783591762a9a3df26b84a049c0f8ed2cb4daa8ba33a623f1f952d60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
