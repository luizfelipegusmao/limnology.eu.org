{"title":"Understanding the Role of Collaboration in Mitigating Price Inflation in Renewable Energy Supply Chains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1563/v1","date":1716475707000,"content":"This study focuses on the impact of collaboration on reducing price inflation in renewable energy supply chains. The study utilises in-depth interviews and theme analysis to reveal the complex dynamics of collaboration among stakeholders and the resulting implications for addressing difficulties in the renewable energy sector. Trust is a key factor in successful collaboration, whereas legal frameworks and policy incentives are important in influencing collaborative activities. Collaborative procurement, cooperative research and development, strategic alliances, and collaborative supply chain management are recognised as crucial measures for decreasing expenses, promoting innovation, and improving resilience in renewable energy supply chains. Nevertheless, in order to achieve successful collaboration, it is necessary to overcome obstacles such as lack of trust, uncertainty in regulations, and competitive dynamics. Creating a cooperative environment that prioritises common objectives, openness, and reciprocal advantages is crucial for fully harnessing the potential of renewable energy supply chains in promoting sustainable energy transitions. The report provides practical insights and recommendations for policymakers, industry professionals, and academics who aim to encourage collaboration and reduce price inflation in renewable energy supply chains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db990670b0be305c8bda51a5c8e95f04a3ac8b21246ad5ea6ead86c6e0afc684","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
