{"title":"Hierarchical Optimization Configuration Strategy of Synchronous Condenser in High Penetration Wind Power Sending Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1026/v1","date":1728985637000,"content":"The increasing deployment of large-scale wind turbines in place of conventional generators is expected to lead to the dominance of asynchronous power sources in future power systems, further accelerating the trend toward grid electrification. As a result, the ability of power sources to support system voltage and frequency is gradually diminishing. Synchronous condensers (SC), which are synchronous machines operating without prime movers, serve as effective devices for providing both dynamic voltage support and inertia. They can significantly enhance the systemâ€™s capacity to maintain voltage and frequency stability. However, most existing studies on the optimization of synchronous condenser configurations tend to focus on only one aspect at a time, rather than addressing both simultaneously, limiting the full potential of these devices. Optimizing either voltage or frequency in isolation often results in suboptimal improvements in the other. Moreover, simultaneous optimization of both voltage and frequency can lead to non-convergent outcomes, complicating the search for an optimal solution. To address this, the paper proposes a hierarchical optimization strategy for synchronous condenser configuration aimed at enhancing both voltage and frequency stability. First, the configuration sites for the synchronous condensers are determined based on short-circuit ratio (SCR) constraints. Next, an outer layer optimization model is developed to minimize the total installed capacity of the condensers, while taking into account SCR and transient overvoltage levels as constraints. Following this, an inner layer optimization model is introduced, incorporating  and  as constraints. The model is solved using the bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA). Finally, a case study of a power grid with a high proportion of wind power validates the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous condenser configuration strategy. Compared to traditional methods, the total required capacity of synchronous condensers was significantly reduced.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c16c951f66a26b8b5224d2d4b5118980680dc1cd686246aa66c6aa6a09c8892c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
