{"title":"Eye health knowledge, attitude, and practice among special school managers and barriers to eye health programmes in special schools in Hyderabad, India","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002124","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Winston D. Prakash, Priya Morjaria, Ian McCormick, Rohit C. Khanna</p>\r\nBackground <p>Children with special education needs (SEN) are at high risk of developing vision problems. In India, there is no data available on the awareness level of eye health needs of children with SEN among special school managers (SSM) and on the barriers to providing eye care for these children in schools. This study aimed to identify the awareness level among SSM and the barriers to organizing School Eye Health (SEH) programmes in special schools, as reported by the eye health program organizers.</p> Methods <p>A mixed-method study was conducted between July and August 2020 among SSM and eye health programme organizers from a local eye care provider in Hyderabad, India. SSM participants completed an online questionnaire assessing their knowledge, attitude, and practice concerning the eye health needs of children with SEN. Quantitative responses were described with summary statistics. Qualitative interviews with eye health programme organizers were conducted via telephone, and transcripts were thematically analysed. Results: In total, 13/67 (19.4%) invited SSM participated and 2/4 invited eye health programme organizers (50%) were interviewed. Among the SSM participants, 92.3% were aware of vision impaired (VI) children in their schools. Awareness of potential causes of VI ranged from 53.9%-92.3%, common eye conditions ranged from 7.7%-69.2%, and difficulties experienced by children with SEN in classroom activities ranged from 46.2%-76.9%. Only 30.8% of the special schools organized SEH programmes at least once a year. Eye health programme organizers reported barriers, such as a lack of interest from SSM, unavailability of qualified screening staff, and a lack of provision for spectacles and low-vision devices.</p> Conclusion <p>This study identified varied levels of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of SSM related to the eye health needs of children with SEN. Key barriers to conducting SEH programmes included a lack of demand, inadequate human resource availability, and limited access to government-funded resources. As the study was negatively impacted by the Covid pandemic, further research with wider representation is needed to plan comprehensive eye health programmes for children with SEN.</p>","author":"Winston D.
