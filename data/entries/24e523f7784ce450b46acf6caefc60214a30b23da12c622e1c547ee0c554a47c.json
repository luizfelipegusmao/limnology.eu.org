For example, plant scientists are interested in their growth and tolerance for different climate conditions, animal scientists are interested in diet of the animals which eat the eucalyptus leaves, and fire scientists are interested in understanding how Eucalypts pyrolyse and combust in bushfires.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"24e523f7784ce450b46acf6caefc60214a30b23da12c622e1c547ee0c554a47c","category":"Environment"}
