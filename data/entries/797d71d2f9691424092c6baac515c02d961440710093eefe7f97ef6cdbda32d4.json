{"title":"SANT proteins modulate gene expression by coordinating histone H3KAc and Khib levels and regulate plant heat tolerance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/902/7695745?rss=1","date":1718668800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as acetylation and recently identified lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib), act as active epigenomic marks in plants. SANT domain-containing proteins SANT1, SANT2, SANT3, and SANT4 (SANT1/2/3/4), derived from <span>PIF/Harbinger</span> transposases, form a complex with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 (HDA6) to regulate gene expression via histone deacetylation. However, whether SANT1/2/3/4 coordinates different types of PTMs to regulate transcription and mediate responses to specific stresses in plants remains unclear. Here, in addition to modulating histone deacetylation, we found that SANT1/2/3/4 proteins acted like HDA6 or HDA9 in regulating the removal of histone Khib in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Histone H3 lysine acetylation (H3KAc) and histone Khib were coordinated by SANT1/2/3/4 to regulate gene expression, with H3KAc playing a predominant role and Khib acting complementarily to H3KAc. <span>SANT1/2/3/4</span> mutation significantly increased the expression of heat-inducible genes with concurrent change of H3KAc levels under normal and heat stress conditions, resulting in enhanced thermotolerance. This study revealed the critical roles of <span>Harbinger</span> transposon-derived SANT domain-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation by coordinating different types of histone PTMs and in the regulation of plant thermotolerance by mediating histone acetylation modification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"797d71d2f9691424092c6baac515c02d961440710093eefe7f97ef6cdbda32d4","category":"Environment"}
