{"title":"Prospects of Creating a Geopark in the Ulytau Region of Kazakhstan: Geoheritage and Geotourism Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1746/v1","date":1729695951000,"content":"The article is devoted to the study of geoheritage objects and scientific justification for the creation of a geopark in the Ulytau region of Central Kazakhstan. This region is the largest copper-bearing province in the world and has a unique natural and cultural heritage. \nPurpose of the article: to show the scientific and tourist significance of geoheritage objects of the potential Ulytau Geopark. The geological history of this area tells about no less than 500 million years of the planet's development. Geological, historical and sacred objects make this area an extremely interesting object for the development of geotourism and the creation of geoparks as a basis for sustainable development of the area. \nThe research methods include a bibliographic method, which made it possible to collect information on the geoheritage of the territory; field survey techniques; and methods based on the evaluation of the criteria for eligibility for UNESCO Geoparks. The methodology includes five main blocks of assessment (geology and landscape, structure and management model, interpretation and environmental education, geotourism, sustainable development at the regional level) and represents an integrated interdisciplinary approach that allows to present regional features in the context of the geological heritage of the world. \nDespite the length of time geology has been studied and resources actively used, geoheritage sites have not been previously studied and characterised. Geoparks in Kazakhstan are at an early stage of development and this article aims to show the potential for establishing geoparks in the Ulytau region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d8a235cb65f5ecb7f01c6d5bb8853d4ad1ab6b36578c087bf344f7808339faf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
