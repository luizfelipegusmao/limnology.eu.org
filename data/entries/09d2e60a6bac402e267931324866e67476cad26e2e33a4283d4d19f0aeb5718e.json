{"title":"The 14-3-3 protein GRF8 modulates salt stress tolerance in apple via the WRKY18-SOS pathway","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1906/7439457?rss=1","date":1700524800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Salinity is a severe abiotic stress that limits plant survival, growth, and development. 14-3-3 proteins are phosphopeptide-binding proteins that are involved in numerous signaling pathways, such as metabolism, development, and stress responses. However, their roles in salt tolerance are unclear in woody plants. Here, we characterized an apple (<span>Malus domestica</span>) 14-3-3 gene, <span>GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR 8</span> (<span>MdGRF8</span>), the product of which promotes salinity tolerance. <span>MdGRF8</span> overexpression improved salt tolerance in apple plants, whereas <span>MdGRF8-</span>RNA interference (RNAi) weakened it. Yeast 2-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that MdGRF8 interacts with the transcription factor MdWRKY18. As with <span>MdGRF8</span>, overexpressing <span>MdWRKY18</span> enhanced salt tolerance in apple plants, whereas silencing <span>MdWRKY18</span> had the opposite effect. We also determined that MdWRKY18 binds to the promoters of the salt-related genes <span>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 2</span> (<span>MdSOS2</span>) and <span>MdSOS3</span>. Moreover, we showed that the 14-3-3 protein MdGRF8 binds to the phosphorylated form of MdWRKY18, enhancing its stability and transcriptional activation activity. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism by the MdGRF8â€“MdWRKY18 module for promoting the salinity stress response in apple.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"09d2e60a6bac402e267931324866e67476cad26e2e33a4283d4d19f0aeb5718e","category":"Environment"}
