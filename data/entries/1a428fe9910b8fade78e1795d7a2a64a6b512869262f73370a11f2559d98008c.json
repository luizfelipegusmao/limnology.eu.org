{"title":"Evaluation of Groundwater Quality in Larkana Pakistan Based on the Use of Synthetic Pollution Index","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1518/v1","date":1716450765000,"content":"In light of growing concerns over water contamination, particularly in regions like Sindh, Pakistan, this research aimed to evaluate and map the groundwater quality in Taluka Larkana for both drinking and irrigation applications, addressing the expressed worries of the local community. A total of forty groundwater samples were collected from various sources such as hand pumps, taps, and tube wells. These samples underwent comprehensive analysis encompassing parameters including color, odor, taste, turbidity, pH, total hardness (TH), electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS), with comparisons drawn against WHO guidelines.Results indicated that taste, color, odor, and turbidity of the groundwater samples generally fell within acceptable ranges. However, EC levels varied from moderately elevated to excessively high. Notably, a significant proportion of samples (84% EC, 21% Cl, 30% Ca, 37% Mg, 22% TH, and 84% TDS) exceeded WHO-recommended thresholds.Assessment via the SPI model classified approximately 16% of samples as moderately contaminated, while 65% were deemed highly contaminated, and 19% were found unsuitable for drinking purposes. These findings underscore the pressing need for concerted efforts to address water quality issues in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a428fe9910b8fade78e1795d7a2a64a6b512869262f73370a11f2559d98008c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
