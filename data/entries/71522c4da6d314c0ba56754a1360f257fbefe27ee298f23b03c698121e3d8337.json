{"title":"SOAMC: A Semi-Supervised Open Set RecognitionAlgorithm for Automatic Modulation Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2099/v1","date":1727347709000,"content":"Abstractâ€”Traditional automatic modulation classificationmethods operate under the closed-set assumption, which provesto be impractical in real-world scenarios due to the diversenature of wireless technologies and the dynamic characteristicsof wireless propagation environments. Open-set environments introduce substantial technical challenges, particularly in terms ofdetection effectiveness and computational complexity. To addressthe limitations of modulation classification and recognition inopen-set scenarios, this paper proposes a semi-supervised openset recognition approach, termed SOAMC (Semi-SupervisedOpen-Set Automatic Modulation Classification). The primaryobjective of SOAMC is to accurately classify unknown modulation types, even when only a limited subset of samples ismanually labeled. The proposed method consists of three keystages: (1) A signal recognition pre-training model is constructedusing data augmentation and adaptive techniques to enhancerobustness. (2) Feature extraction and embedding are performedvia a specialized extraction network. (3) Label propagation isexecuted using a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) toefficiently annotate the unlabeled signal samples. Experimentalresults demonstrate that SOAMC significantly improves classification accuracy, particularly in challenging scenarios with limitedlabeled data and high signal similarity. These findings are criticalfor the practical identification of complex and diverse modulationsignals in real-world wireless communication systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71522c4da6d314c0ba56754a1360f257fbefe27ee298f23b03c698121e3d8337","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
