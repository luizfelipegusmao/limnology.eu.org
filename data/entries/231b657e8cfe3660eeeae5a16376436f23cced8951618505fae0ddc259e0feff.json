{"title":"Exploring the Benefits of Herbal Medicine Composite 5 (HRMC5) for Skin Health Enhancement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1068/v1","date":1728906021000,"content":"The skin, as the body's largest organ, is vital for protecting against environmental stressors, regulating temperature, and preventing water loss. Maintaining a healthy skin barrier is essential for overall skin health and function. We examined the potential of a mixture of five traditional Korean herbal extracts—Cimicifuga racemosa, Paeonia lactiflora, Phellodendron amurense, Rheum rhaponticum, and Scutellaria baicalensis— referred to as herbal medicine composite 5 (HRMC5) for enhancing skin health. High-performance liquid chromatography identified 14 bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, anthraquinones, and alkaloids, known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. The extract showed concentration-dependent effects on cell viability and provided UV protection at 6.25 g/L. It also significantly promoted wound healing, similar to the efficacy of epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, the mixture exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by downregulating Cox2 expression and upregulated key skin barrier proteins, including Involucrin, Claudin 1, and Collagen Type 1. These findings highlight the potential of this herbal mixture for addressing skin barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and facial redness, supporting its use in developing natural skincare products. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms behind these effects and assess its clinical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"231b657e8cfe3660eeeae5a16376436f23cced8951618505fae0ddc259e0feff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
