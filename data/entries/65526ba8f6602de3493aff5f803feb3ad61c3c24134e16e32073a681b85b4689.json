{"title":"Socio‐techno‐economic‐environmental sizing of hybrid renewable energy system using metaheuristic optimization approaches","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14386?af=R","date":1709541836000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Electricity supply reliability in an electricity distribution network is majorly affected due to unexpected power failures and power cuts. A hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) with the optimal size of renewable energy sources can substantially improve power reliability. Therefore, this article develops an objective function incorporating socio-techno-economic-environmental (STEE) factors for HRES optimal sizing to supply reliable power to a rural village. The factors considered in the objective function are namely social (employment generation factor, human progress index, and land cost), technical (excess energy factor, renewable energy portion, and loss of power supply probability), economical (total net present cost, cost of energy, and annualized cost of system), and environmental (emission cost). In this article, for the first time, marine predators algorithm (MPA) based metaheuristic optimizer is devised to address the sizing optimization problem of HRES. Three HRES configurations, having different arrangements of diesel generator (DG), biogas generator (BG), battery (BAT), wind turbine (WT), and photovoltaic (PV), are examined utilizing MPA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and genetic algorithm (GA) for optimal configuration. Due to the lowest value of economical and environmental factors and the highest value of the social factor, the PV-WT-BAT-BG-DG configuration is optimal compared to other investigated configurations with MPA. Comparing the four optimizers, MPA has the best STEE factor values, as well as stronger convergence, greater ability to escape from local minima, and higher ability to approach the global optimum. Additionally, by contrasting it with the PSO result for the three HRES configurations, the MPA result quality is confirmed. Furthermore, the cost of energy (0.1799 $/kWh) of the optimal configuration is less than the latest addressed in the literature.</p>","author":"Pawan Kumar Kushwaha, \nChayan Bhattacharjee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"65526ba8f6602de3493aff5f803feb3ad61c3c24134e16e32073a681b85b4689","category":"Environment"}
