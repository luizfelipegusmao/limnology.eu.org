{"title":"A Proposal of Geoengineering Method as Global Warming Countermeasure：\nStratospheric O3 Increase to Reduce Earth＇s Surface Temperature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0854/v1","date":1710413647000,"content":"A method of geoengineering/solar radiation management is proposed as global warming countermeasure. The idea is to decrease surface temperature by increasing stratospheric ozone. One-dimensional (vertical) radiative-convective equilibrium temperature calculations show that surface temperature can be lowered by increasing the amount of ozone in the stratosphere. It was the increase in altitude above about 25 km that reduced surface temperatures. The method of increasing the amount of ozone (O3 injection), the rate of decrease of surface temperature after the ozone increase, and the rate of decrease of ozone concentration by photochemical reaction and diffusion/transport after the ozone increase are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96852205fa799d0c6be947207d23d04c4b33cf1efa2fd004e2b3376cc4f60a9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
