{"title":"Evaluation of Psychosomatic, Respiratory, and Neurocognitive Health in COVID-19 Survivors 12 Months after ICU Discharge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0464/v1","date":1720131795000,"content":"Patients who survived critical COVID-19 frequently reported post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) such as psychosomatic and neurocognitive health problems. The goal of this study was to identify clinical risk factors and other predictors for such long-term consequences in severely ill COVID-19 patients.\nAdult COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) survivors from August 2020 to May 2021 were enrolled. A broad range of clinical, laboratory and chest computed tomography (CT) data was collected during ICU stay. The association between ICU predictors and psychosomatic, respiratory and neurocognitive assessments 12 months after ICU discharge was analyzed using univariate regression analysis.\nIn 17 patients (mean age 58.9 Â± 11.4 years), laboratory markers (CRP, lymphocytes, hemoglobin), ICU severity (SOFA, SAPS II, need for mechanical ventilation), complications (ARDS), and lung CT data (ground-glass opacity) were promising predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms, fatigue, and sleep problems.\nRecovery of psychosomatic health such as fatigue, depression and anxiety correlated with lower levels of inflammation and high hemoglobin levels. ARDS, mechanical ventilation and worse SOFA and SAPS II scores were further risk factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our study identified novel associations such as pulmonary ground-glass opacity being positively associated with depression, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1823dd024298575355d11ad491850bb1c7c0daabdfd1a5d3fbd269746d7a5b32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
