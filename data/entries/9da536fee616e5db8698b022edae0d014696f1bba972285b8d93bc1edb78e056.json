{"title":"Amylolytic Capability and Performance of Probiotic Strains in a Controlled Sorghum Fermentation System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0114/v1","date":1717423527000,"content":"This study aimed to explore the fermentation behavior of selected potential probiotic strains during sorghum fermentation, considering their microbial counts, pH levels, and antibacterial activity, their ability to break down starch. The fermentation processes were conducted in the presence and absence of glucose, and the lactic acid bacterial strains underwent controlled fermentation to assess microbial counts, amylase activity, pH, and lactic acid levels in the presence and absence of glucose. In addition, the inhibitory activity of these potential probiotic strains against pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staph-ylococcus aureus) was examined through co-culturing. The results demonstrated that all nine Lactobacillus strains exhibited robust growth in both sugar and sugar-free fermentation experiments. Glucose supple-mentation significantly enhanced lactic acid yield which was in a range of 0.19-0.52 % compared to fer-mentation without glucose with a range of 0.03-0.29 %. The selected Lactobacillus strains effectively lowered the pH to less than 4 after 24 hours, producing substantial lactic acid. Notably, in the absence of glucose, only Lb. helveticus D7 and Lb. amylolyticus D12 achieved pH levels below 4 after 8 hours, producing the highest lactic acid amounts of 0.27 and 0.29 % after 24 hours, respectively. Amylase activity was detected on two strains D7 and D12. Furthermore, most of the tested Lactobacillus strains demonstrated complete inhibition of pathogen growth after 24 hours of co-culturing, suggesting their potential for enhancing the safety quality of sorghum-based fermented products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9da536fee616e5db8698b022edae0d014696f1bba972285b8d93bc1edb78e056","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
