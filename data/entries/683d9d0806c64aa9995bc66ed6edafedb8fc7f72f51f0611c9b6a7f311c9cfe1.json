He was admitted to the neurologic department and comprehensive neurological workup, brain magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral fluid analysis, EEG, blood test allowed the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was treated with plasmapheresis, high dose of intravenous steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. The patient improved and he is now well with a performance status 1. This case is interesting since the AE developed approximately 10 months after the cessation of immunotherapy, the underlying cancer was in complete remission and the AE showed a good response to the treatment done.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"683d9d0806c64aa9995bc66ed6edafedb8fc7f72f51f0611c9b6a7f311c9cfe1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
