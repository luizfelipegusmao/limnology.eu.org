{"title":"Disturbance Observer Based Backstepping Terminal Sliding Mode Aeroelastic Control of Airfoils","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1024/v1","date":1728897632000,"content":"This paper studies on aeroelastic control for the two-dimensional airfoil-flap system with unknown gust disturbances and model uncertainties. Open loop limit cycle oscillation (LCO) happens at the post-flutter speed. Structural stiffness of the aeroelastic system is represented by nonlinear polynomials. To robustly suppress aeroelastic vibration within finite time, a backstepping terminal sliding mode control (BTSMC) is proposed. In addition a learning rate is incorporating into the backstepping TSMC to adjusthow fast the aeroelastic response converges to zero. In order to overcome the limitation of the BTSMC design that it is dependent on prior knowledge, a nonlinear disturbance-observer (DO) is designed to estimate the variable observable disturbances. The closed-loop aeroelastic control system is proved to be globally asymptotically stable and converge within finite time by using Lyapunov theory. Simulation results of an aeroelastic two-dimensional airfoil with both trailing-edge (TE) and leading-edge (LE) control surfaces show that the proposed DO-BTSMC is effective for flutter suppression, even when subjected to gusts and parameter uncertainties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4cbe32503f3c719d326f48cf00d0349c30e67fa47b0324a1ba6ae88a632e51f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
