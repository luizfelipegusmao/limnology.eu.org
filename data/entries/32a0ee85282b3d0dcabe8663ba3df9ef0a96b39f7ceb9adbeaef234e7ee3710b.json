{"title":"The Future of Telemedicine: Overcoming Barriers to Widespread Adoption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1147/v1","date":1728970802000,"content":"Telemedicine has emerged as a transformative tool in modern healthcare, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which catalyzed its rapid expansion. Despite its demonstrated potential in enhancing remote patient monitoring, AI-driven diagnostics, and telepsychiatry, widespread adoption of telemedicine remains constrained by persistent barriers. This review examines the current state of telemedicine, identifying major advancements alongside key challenges that impede its full integration into global healthcare systems. These barriers include the digital divide, regulatory inconsistencies across regions, and patient concerns about data security and the quality of virtual care. Addressing these issues requires a coordinated multi-sectoral approach, emphasizing infrastructure development, regulatory harmonization, patient education, and the incorporation of emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and virtual reality. By overcoming these challenges, telemedicine can be established as a cornerstone of equitable, accessible, and patient-centered healthcare worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32a0ee85282b3d0dcabe8663ba3df9ef0a96b39f7ceb9adbeaef234e7ee3710b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
