Batran, Eman Y. Ahmed, Hanem M. Awad, Nehad A. Abdel Latif<br />New naturally based pyrazoline derivatives were investigated as anti-breast cancer agents targeting APN, VEGFR2 and MMP9. The effects on wound healing, cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated. Docking and ADMET studies were performed as well.<br />The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"RSC - RSC Adv. latest articles","siteHash":"da3e282678330308414c63a405ade89dd3738fcce2936ca8a2fe3a6d7e967d99","entryHash":"b52a08f66dc08bca857127b054e40248ec19a41e853a83411d61eae435af95b1","category":"Environment"}
