The authors behind this month's cover image tested the reliability of an assay measuring faecal <i>glucocorticoid metabolites</i> (GCM) used in their previous study. They found that, in contrast to that study, grassiness and sex ratio no longer predicted GCM concentrations and could not replicate their previous results. Their new results have changed the author's conservation management recommendations. They introduce the terms “insensitive” and “sub-optimal” to categorise assays that are tested but fail validation, and assays that are comparatively poor at detecting relevant hormone changes, respectively, and discuss how these could lead to incorrect inferences about population stressors and counterproductive conservation recommendations.\n</p>\n<br />","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"b5247afe096a1c742b16dfdb2729533dbc681234efca21e12bfc99e3a916fcb3","category":"Environment"}
