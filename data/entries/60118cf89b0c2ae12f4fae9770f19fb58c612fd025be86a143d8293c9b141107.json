Micro-CT and gross volumetric estimation of ocular volume were employed to acquire data on ocular volume, anterior chamber volume, lens volume, and vitreous cavity volume for each eye.</p> Results <p>The eyeball volume of pigs ranges from approximately 5.36 ± 0.27 to 5.55 ± 0.28 ml, the lens volume from approximately 0.33 ± 0.02 to 0.37 ± 0.06 ml, the anterior chamber volume from approximately 0.19 ± 0.05 to 0.28 ± 0.04 ml, and the vitreous volume is approximately 3.20 ± 0.18 ml. For rabbits, the eye volume, lens volume, anterior chamber volume, and vitreous volume range from approximately 3.02 ± 0.24 to 3.04 ± 0.24 ml, 0.41 ± 0.02 to 0.44 ± 0.02 ml, 0.23 ± 0.04 to 0.26 ± 0.05 ml, and 1.54 ± 0.14 ml, respectively. In SD rats, the volumes are 0.14 ± 0.02 to 0.15 ± 0.01 ml for the eyeball, 0.03 ± 0.00 to 0.03 ± 0.00 ml for the lens, 0.01 ± 0.00 to 0.01 ± 0.01 ml for the anterior chamber, and 0.04 ± 0.01 ml for the vitreous volume.</p> Conclusion <p>The integration of micro-CT and gross volumetric estimation of ocular volume proves effective in determining the eyeball volume in Bama Miniature Pigs, New Zealand rabbits, and SD rats. Understanding the volume distinctions within the eyeballs and their components among these experimental animals can lay the groundwork for ophthalmology-related drug research.</p>","author":"Yajun Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"60118cf89b0c2ae12f4fae9770f19fb58c612fd025be86a143d8293c9b141107","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
