{"title":"Contribution of the Types of Tropical Coastal Aquaculture Ponds to the Differential Distribution of the Family Bacillaceae Bacterial Community","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/4522234?af=R","date":1685689200000,"content":"<p>The family Bacillaceae bacteria, particularly <i>Bacillus</i> communities, are useful and attractive probiotics with desirable features to fulfill the vast demand for aquaculture. In Hainan Island, the coastal aquaculture ponds hold about 1% of the total area in China, whereas the knowledge of Bacillaceae bacterial communities was limited. Herein, the Bacillaceae bacterial communities in the coastal aquaculture ponds of the artificial ponds (lined with high-density polyethylene plastic sheets) and earthen ponds were investigated by the culturable method. The characteristics of culturable Bacillaceae communities in these two types of coastal aquaculture ponds showed a massive difference. All the culturable Bacillaceae bacteria were identified as <i>Bacillus</i> in the artificial ponds, whereas the earthen ponds were dominated by <i>Bacillus</i> followed by <i>Halobacillus</i>. It is worth noting that the artificial ponds with a low Bacillaceae diversity displayed a high Bacillaceae concentration with a better water quality, whereas the earthen ponds with a higher Bacillaceae diversity and concentration displayed a higher risk of <i>Vibrio</i> infection, indicating that the Bacillaceae concentration than its diversity made a greater contribution to water purification and <i>Vibrio</i> control. This work besides providing a promising strategy for healthy coastal aquaculture by balancing the relationship between Bacillaceae concentration and its diversity also will lay a foundation for the development of probiotic Bacillaceae agents for wastewater purification and disease control.</p>","author":"Wei Ren, \nZiqiao Feng, \nXinyi Wang, \nYing Li, \nHao Long, \nXiaoni Cai, \nAiyou Huang, \nZhenyu Xie, \nHisham Abdelrahman","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"16e89f1930067ab2ff4f2e90d042d8174e04f3de587bd2b5686284986f173a9d","category":"Environment"}
