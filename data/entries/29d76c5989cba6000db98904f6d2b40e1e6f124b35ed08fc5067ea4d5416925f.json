{"title":"Probing T-cell activation in nanoliter tumor co-cultures using membrane displacement trap arrays","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyae014/7723323?rss=1","date":1722211200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Immune responses against cancer are inherently stochastic, with small numbers of individual T cells within a larger ensemble of lymphocytes initiating the molecular cascades that lead to tumor cytotoxicity. A potential source of this intra-tumor variability is the differential ability of immune cells to respond to tumor cells. Classical microwell co-cultures of T cells and tumor cells are inadequate for reliably culturing and analyzing low cell numbers needed to probe this variability, and have failed in recapitulating the heterogeneous small domains observed in tumors. Here we leverage a membrane displacement trap array technology that overcomes limitations of conventional microwell plates for immunodynamic studies. The microfluidic platform supports on-demand formation of dense nanowell cultures under continuous perfusion reflecting the tumor microenvironment, with real-time monitoring of T cell proliferation and activation within each nanowell. The system enables selective ejection of cells for profiling by fluorescence activated cell sorting, allowing observed on-chip variability in immune response to be correlated with off-chip quantification of T cell activation. The technology offers new potential for probing the molecular origins of T cell heterogeneity and identifying specific cell phenotypes responsible for initiating and propagating immune cascades within tumors.<div><strong>Insight Box</strong> Variability in T cell activation plays a critical role in the immune response against cancer. New tools are needed to unravel the mechanisms that drive successful anti-tumor immune response, and to support the development of novel immunotherapies utilizing rare T cell phenotypes that promote effective immune surveillance. To this end, we present a microfluidic cell culture platform capable of probing differential T cell activation in an array of nanoliter-scale wells coupled with off-chip cell analysis, enabling a high resolution view of variable immune response within tumor / T cell co-cultures containing cell ensembles orders of magnitude smaller than conventional well plate studies.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"29d76c5989cba6000db98904f6d2b40e1e6f124b35ed08fc5067ea4d5416925f","category":"Environment"}
