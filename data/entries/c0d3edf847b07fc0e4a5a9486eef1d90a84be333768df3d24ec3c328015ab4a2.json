{"title":"Artemisia argyi extract exerts antioxidant properties and extends the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13273?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Chinese mugwort (<i>Artemisia argyi</i>) possesses extensive pharmacological activities associated with anti-tumour, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant and anti-ageing effects of <i>A. argyi</i> extract (AAE) on the fruit fly (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) ageing model by detecting antioxidant enzyme activities and the mRNA level of antioxidant genes.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>AAE could significantly lengthen the mean lifespan, 50% survival days, and maximum lifespan of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, especially when the amount of AAE added reached 6.68 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, the mean lifespan of both female and male flies increased by 23.74% and 22.30%, respectively, indicating the effective life extension effect of AAE. At the same time, AAE could improve the climbing ability and tolerance to hydrogen peroxide in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. In addition, the addition of AAE effectively increased the activities of copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase, manganese-containing superoxide dismutase and catalase in <i>D. melanogaster</i> and reduced the contents of malondialdehyde. Moreover, when reared with diets containing AAE, the expression of antioxidant-related genes SOD1, SOD2 and CAT was up-regulated in <i>D. melanogaster</i> and down-regulated for MTH genes.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study indicates that AAE effectively enhances the antioxidant capacity of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and has potential applications as an antioxidant and anti-ageing agent in the nutraceutical industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuhua Yang, \nYuping Cao, \nJianming Zhang, \nLi Fan, \nYan Huang, \nThuan‐Chew Tan, \nLee‐Hoon Ho","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c0d3edf847b07fc0e4a5a9486eef1d90a84be333768df3d24ec3c328015ab4a2","category":"Environment"}
