{"title":"Performance of a Cable-Driven Robot Used for Cyber-Physical Testing of Floating Wind Turbines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0770/v1","date":1723451975000,"content":"Cyber-physical testing has been applied for a decade in hydrodynamic laboratories to assess the dynamic performance of floating wind turbines (FWT). Rotor loads, computed by a numerical simulator fed with measurements, are applied in real time on the physical floater by using actuators. The present paper proposes a set of short and targeted benchmark tests that aim at quantifying the performance of actuators used in cyber-physical testing of FWT. They aim at ensuring good load tracking over all frequencies of interest, and satisfactory disturbance rejection for large motions. These benchmark tests are exemplified on two radically different 15MW FWT models tested at SINTEF Ocean.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6110b041dc6120fc559dd38b9519b0dbdfdc475ade13782c999db873fc1d1cda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
