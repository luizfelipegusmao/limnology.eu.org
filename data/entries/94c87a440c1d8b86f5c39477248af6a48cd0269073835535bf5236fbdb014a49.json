{"title":"Structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activities of protein hydrolysates from Zanthoxylum seed","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13218?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Zanthoxylum</i> seed, as a low-cost and easily accessible plant protein resource, has good potential in the food industry. But protein and its hydrolysates from <i>Zanthoxylum</i> seed are underutilized due to the dearth of studies on them. This study aimed to investigate the structure and physicochemical and biological activities of <i>Zanthoxylum</i> seed protein (ZSP) hydrolysates prepared using Protamex®, Alcalase®, Neutrase®, trypsin, or pepsin.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Hydrolysis using each of the five enzymes diminished average particle size and molecular weight of ZSP but increased random coil content. ZSP hydrolysate prepared using pepsin had the highest degree of hydrolysis (24.07%) and the smallest molecular weight (&lt;13 kDa) and average particle size (129.80 nm) with the highest solubility (98.9%). In contrast, ZSP hydrolysate prepared using Alcalase had the highest surface hydrophobicity and foaming capacity (88.89%), as well as the lowest foam stability (45.00%). Moreover, ZSP hydrolysate prepared using Alcalase exhibited the best hydroxyl-radical scavenging (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) 1.94 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and ferrous-ion chelating (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.61 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) activities. Additionally, ZSP hydrolysate prepared using pepsin displayed the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.54 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These data showed that enzyme hydrolysis improved the physicochemical properties of ZSP, and enzymatic hydrolysates of ZSP exhibited significant biological activity. These results provided validation for application of ZSP enzymatic hydrolysates as antioxidants and antihypertensive agents in the food or medicinal industries. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Si‐Yu Dong, \nYing‐Qiu Li, \nXin Sun, \nGui‐Jin Sun, \nChen‐Ying Wang, \nYan Liang, \nDong‐Liang Hua, \nLei Chen, \nHai‐Zhen Mo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"94c87a440c1d8b86f5c39477248af6a48cd0269073835535bf5236fbdb014a49","category":"Environment"}
