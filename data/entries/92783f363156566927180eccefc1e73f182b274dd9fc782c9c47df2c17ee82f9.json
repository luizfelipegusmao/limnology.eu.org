{"title":"83 Effect of stocking density on F1 gilt reproductive performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/253/7664978?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Replacement females are the future of a farm, and their development can impact production. Currently, replacement gilts are housed in many different environments. Stocking density of replacement females is one factor that varies across production systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different stocking densities on replacement gilt reproductive performance. At 10 wk of age, DNA L241 females (n = 824; DNA Genetics, Columbus, NE) were randomly allotted to finishing pens with 3 different stocking densities. Each stocking density consisted of 12 pens of 0.71 m<sup>2</sup> (n = 360), 0.93 m<sup>2</sup> (n = 264), and 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> (n = 204). Heat detection started at 20 wk of age with fence line exposure for 2 wk at 15 minutes per pen. Within pen boar exposure occurred from 22 to 31 wk of age for a minimum of 10 min per pen. Starting at 20 wk of age, females that exhibited red and swollen vulvas or standing estrus were recorded. Body weight, backfat, and loin depth measurements were collected at estrus detection. A blood progesterone assay was performed on all females at 24 wk of age. Further blood progesterone assays were performed at 27, 29 and 31 wk of age on any female for which progesterone was not detected on previous assays. Females were mated on their 2<sup>nd</sup> estrus if they were at least 136 kg or on their first estrus if they were over 145 kg. Body weight was recorded at the time of mating. For females that cycled by 31 wk, females in the 0.71 m<sup>2</sup> treatment cycled significantly earlier than the 0.93 m<sup>2</sup> treatment, 147 vs 153 d post-weaning respectively (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). No difference was detected in age at mating; however, gilts in the 0.71 m<sup>2</sup> treatment were 5.9 kg and 8.2 kg lighter than the 0.93 and 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> treatments respectively (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). At 31 wk of age 60% of the 0.71 m<sup>2</sup>, 71% of the 0.93 m<sup>2</sup>, and 77% of the 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> treatments had cycled according to visual heat detection. However, according to the progesterone assay, at 31 wk of age 75% of 0.71 m<sup>2</sup>, 81% of the 0.93 m<sup>2</sup>, and 84% of the 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> had cycled. The accuracy of visual heat detection compared with progesterone assay were 79.4% for 0.71 m<sup>2</sup>, 77.3% for 0.93 m<sup>2</sup>, and 85.8% for 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> treatments. Overall, the 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> treatment resulted in heavier females at mating, a greater rate of females cycling, and a more accurate detection of females cycling than the 0.71 m<sup>2</sup> treatment. Swine producers can improve the percentage of females detected in estrus and mated in the desired period by providing additional rearing space during gilt development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"92783f363156566927180eccefc1e73f182b274dd9fc782c9c47df2c17ee82f9","category":"Environment"}
