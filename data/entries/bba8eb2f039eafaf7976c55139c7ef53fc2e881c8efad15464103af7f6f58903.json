{"title":"Impact of Additive Manufacturing on Supply Chain Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2618/v1","date":1722437086000,"content":"Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology in supply chain management (SCM). This abstract explores how AM influences various aspects of SCM, including inventory management, production processes, and logistics. By enabling on-demand production and reducing reliance on traditional manufacturing methods, AM minimizes inventory costs and enhances customization capabilities. It also facilitates localized production, which can reduce lead times and transportation costs. The integration of AM into SCM fosters greater flexibility and resilience, allowing businesses to respond more swiftly to market changes and disruptions. This study highlights both the opportunities and challenges associated with adopting AM, emphasizing the need for strategic adjustments to fully leverage its potential in modern supply chains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bba8eb2f039eafaf7976c55139c7ef53fc2e881c8efad15464103af7f6f58903","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
