{"title":"Inactivated Aeromonas salmonicida impairs adaptive immunity in lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13944?af=R","date":1717797159000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Aeromonas salmonicida</i>, a widely distributed aquatic pathogen causing furunculosis in fish, exhibits varied virulence, posing challenges in infectious disease and immunity studies, notably in vaccine efficacy assessment. Lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>) has become a valuable model for marine pathogenesis studies. This study evaluated several antigen preparations against <i>A. salmonicida</i> J223, a hypervirulent strain of teleost fish, including lumpfish. The potential immune protective effect of <i>A. salmonicida</i> bacterins in the presence and absence of the A-layer and extracellular products was tested in lumpfish. Also, we evaluated the impact of <i>A. salmonicida</i> outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and iron-regulated outer membrane proteins (IROMPs) on lumpfish immunity. The immunized lumpfish were intraperitoneally (i.p.) challenged with 10<sup>4</sup>\n<i>A. salmonicida</i> cells/dose at 8 weeks-post immunization (wpi). Immunized and non-immunized fish died within 2 weeks post-challenge. Our analyses showed that immunization with <i>A. salmonicida</i> J223 bacterins and antigen preparations did not increase IgM titres. In addition, adaptive immunity biomarker genes (e.g., <i>igm</i>, <i>mhc-ii</i> and <i>cd4</i>) were down-regulated. These findings suggest that <i>A. salmonicida</i> J223 antigen preparations hinder lumpfish immunity. Notably, many fish vaccines are bacterin-based, often lacking efficacy evaluation. This study offers crucial insights for finfish vaccine approval and regulations.</p>","author":"Setu Chakraborty, \nHajarooba Gnanagobal, \nAhmed Hossain, \nTrung Cao, \nIgnacio Vasquez, \nDanny Boyce, \nJavier Santander","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"91a1e31612904983b26316e19bbb106566ef72629290c7c7e452c415c891814b","category":"Environment"}
