{"title":"Repeat Sampling of Female Passerines During Reproduction Reveals Surprising Higher Plasma Oxidative Damage During Resting Compared to Active State","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1197/7271395?rss=1","date":1694476800000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Traditional models of oxidative stress predict accumulation of damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as highly correlated with aerobic metabolism, a prediction under increasing scrutiny. Here, we repeat sampled female great tits (<span>Parus major</span>) at two opposite levels of energy use during the period of maximum food provisioning to nestlings, once at rest and once during activity. Our results were in contrast to the above prediction, namely significantly higher levels of oxidative damage during rest opposed to active phase. This discrepancy could not be explained neither using levels of “first line” antioxidant enzymes activity measured from erythrocytes, nor from total nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity measured from plasma, as no differences were found between states. Significantly higher levels of uric acid, a potent antioxidant, were seen in the plasma during the active phase than in rest phase, which may explain the lower levels of oxidative damage despite high levels of physical activity. Our results challenge the hypothesis that oxidative stress is elevated during times with high energy use and call for more profound understanding of potential drivers of the modulation of oxidative stress such as metabolic state of the animal, and thus also the time of sampling in general.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"bbfbe80a404bc46567b41ce4d9023afce2b486f7e2eaf6f49541f282fe19dbc6","category":"Environment"}
