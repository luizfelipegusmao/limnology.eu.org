{"title":"7 Role of the preovulatory follicle in oocyte metabolic and developmental competence for pregnancy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/97/7757085?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A majority of bovine pregnancy loss occurs in the first 7 d of gestation. The oocyte is a key driver of embryo viability during this time, and its competence for embryo development and pregnancy establishment is greatly influenced by the surrounding microenvironment during oocyte maturation. Assisted reproductive technologies allow for more efficient propagation of superior genetics and improved reproductive management of the cattle herd; however, many assisted reproductive technologies alter the normal microenvironment of the maturing oocyte and negatively impact oocyte competence for early embryo development. For example, oocytes induced to ovulate from preovulatory follicles of lesser physiological maturity (decreased estradiol production and smaller diameter) have reduced blastocyst development, poorer embryo quality, and a hastened rate of embryo development compared with those ovulated from follicles of greater maturity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the intrafollicular milieu of physiologically mature preovulatory follicles provides the necessary microenvironment to metabolically program maturing oocytes for successful embryo development. Studies by our team have demonstrated that the follicular fluid metabolite milieu during in vivo oocyte maturation differs between preovulatory follicles of greater and lesser maturity and that such differences have direct effects on the maturing oocyte. Numerous follicular fluid metabolites involved in glucose and amino acid metabolism were more abundant in preovulatory follicles of greater versus lesser physiological maturity. Additionally, abundance of transcripts encoding glycolytic enzymes was higher in cumulus cells from follicles of greater maturity, and both ATP and levels of key transcripts in the mitochondrial respiratory chain were higher in oocytes collected from preovulatory follicles of greater versus lesser maturity. We supplemented in vitro maturing oocytes with follicular fluid from preovulatory follicles of greater or lesser maturity to determine causality of differing follicular fluid milieu on cumulus-oocyte metabolism and oocyte competence for early embryo development. Follicle maturity status had robust effects on cumulus-oocyte complex consumption or production of key metabolites in glucose, purine, and amino acid metabolism pathways during oocyte maturation. We also observed hastened development rate in embryos arising from in vitro matured oocytes supplemented with lesser maturity follicular fluid, mirroring past in vivo findings by others. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing of resulting blastocysts of identical stage and quality suggested more efficient metabolism and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in blastocysts derived from oocytes matured in preovulatory follicular fluid from greater maturity follicles. In contrast, transcriptome profiles of blastocysts from oocytes matured in preovulatory follicular fluid from lesser maturity follicles indicated oxidative stress and dysregulated cell division. These recent findings by our lab indicate that impacts of follicle maturity and the resulting follicular fluid microenvironment on the maturing oocyte withstand throughout early embryo development and hold promising roles to improve reproductive efficiency in cattle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1b55c356c79464261af6fce4e255471cffa205528303a4cd1a806620473bea86","category":"Environment"}
