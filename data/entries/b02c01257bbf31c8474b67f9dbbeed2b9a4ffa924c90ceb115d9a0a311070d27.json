{"title":"Machine Reading Comprehension Model Based on Fusion of Mixed Attention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0966/v1","date":1715679307000,"content":"To address the problems of insufficient semantic fusion between text and questions and the lack of consideration of global semantic information encountered in machine reading comprehension models, we proposed a machine reading comprehension model called BERT_hybrid based on BERT and hybrid attention mechanism. In this model, BERT is utilized to separately map the text and questions into the feature space. Through the integration of Bi-LSTM, attention mechanism, and self-attention mechanism, the proposed model achieves comprehensive semantic fusion between text and questions. The probabilities distribution of answers is computed using Softmax. Experimental results on the public dataset DuReader demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improvements in BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L scores compared to existing models. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model design, we analyze the factors influencing the modelâ€™s performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b02c01257bbf31c8474b67f9dbbeed2b9a4ffa924c90ceb115d9a0a311070d27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
