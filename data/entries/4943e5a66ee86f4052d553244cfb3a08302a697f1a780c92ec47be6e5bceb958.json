{"title":"Heavy Metal Content in the Soil and Typical Crops of the Pannonian Region of Slovenia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0300/v1","date":1725431404000,"content":"Soil contamination and the uptake of contaminants by food crops is a global problem that differs significantly from region to region, with the key factors affecting the contaminants present in local soils being the mineralogical composition of the underlying layers and local human activity. The area of ​​the Pannonian region is known for the fact that agriculture has, historically, played an important role since Roman times, which was particularly influenced by human activity. In this study we performed a preliminary study of the contamination of soil samples across the Pannonian region, to determine the potential presence of harmful contaminants. Both soil and crop samples were analysed for the potential presence of heavy metals, with additional focus placed on the potential presence of microplastics in the region`s soil.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4943e5a66ee86f4052d553244cfb3a08302a697f1a780c92ec47be6e5bceb958","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
