{"title":"Mesocosm experiments validate induction of Daphnia vertical migration by the fish‐derived kairomone 5α‐cyprinol sulfate","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10375?af=R","date":1706339706000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The fish-derived bile salt 5α-cyprinol sulfate (CPS) has been identified as a kairomone inducing the predator avoidance behavior “diel vertical migration” (DVM) in <i>Daphnia magna</i> in response to fish. However, conclusions about the ecological significance of CPS have been derived from laboratory experiments only. Using a mesocosm approach, we investigate whether the role of CPS as a kairomone can be confirmed in the field. We demonstrate that CPS induces downward migration during daytime in a field-derived <i>Daphnia</i> community mainly consisting of <i>Daphnia longispina</i> and <i>Daphnia cucullata</i> within the experiment. In the study lake, the actual population of <i>D. longispina</i> shows a similar pattern of DVM, while concomitant quantification of CPS by HPLC-MS confirms that CPS in situ concentrations are sufficiently high for induction of daytime downward migration of <i>D. longispina</i> in this oligo-mesotrophic lake. Together, these observations infer that CPS is a significant kairomone-inducing DVM-like behavior in <i>Daphnia</i>.</p>","author":"Johanna Ahlers, \nMeike Hahn, \nMaria Stockenreiter, \nHerwig Stibor, \nEric von Elert","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"e95662a101a396d4e09707d8d0813bb876d8f4ea359cdae879162b59ebc99ede","category":"Environment"}
