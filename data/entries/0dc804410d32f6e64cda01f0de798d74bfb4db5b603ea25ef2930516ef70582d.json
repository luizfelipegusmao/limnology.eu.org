Conventional bright-field and dark-field imaging modes are widely used across materials science to characterize structures at high resolutions. However, the contrast and dose challenges in these approaches make their utility much more limited for weakly scattering and electron-beam sensitive structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.912-B1\">1</a>]. 4D-STEM techniques, where a diffraction pattern is acquired at each position in real space, can overcome many of the limitations of conventional modalities. The structural information in this scanning diffraction data can be reconstructed to efficiently characterize features that would not be visible with conventional imaging methods [<a href=\"#ozae044.912-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0dc804410d32f6e64cda01f0de798d74bfb4db5b603ea25ef2930516ef70582d","category":"Environment"}
