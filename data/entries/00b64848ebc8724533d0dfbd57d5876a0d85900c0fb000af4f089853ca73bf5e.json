{"title":"Real-World Clinical Outcomes of Neoadjuvant Platinum-Based Chemotherapy with Nivolumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2388/v1","date":1727682711000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) within a real-world context. We analyzed medical records from January 2022 to August 2023, focusing on individuals aged 18 and older diagnosed with resectable NSCLC who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy prior to surgical intervention. The cohort comprised 56 patients, predominantly smokers (95%) and male (74%), with 80% presenting at stage III. Of the participants, 44 underwent surgery, with 95% receiving lobar resection. Clinical assessments via PET-CT imaging revealed an 86% rate of response or disease stabilization, while pathological evaluations showed complete and major pathological responses in 61% of cases. This real-world data supports the safety and efficacy of incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant treatment of NSCLC, followed by surgical resection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00b64848ebc8724533d0dfbd57d5876a0d85900c0fb000af4f089853ca73bf5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
