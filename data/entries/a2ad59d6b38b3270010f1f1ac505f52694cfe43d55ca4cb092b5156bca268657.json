{"title":"MITIGATING THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT: Thermal Performance of Shade-Tree Planting in Downtown Los Angeles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2090/v1","date":1724852506000,"content":"As urban areas expand and populations grow, environmental challenges such as the urban heat island effect, air pollution, and light pollution intensify. The urban heat island effect exacerbates extreme heat conditions, leading to prolonged periods of unhealthy and hazardous environments for both humans and other species. This study investigates the thermal environment associated with the urban heat island effect, focusing on the role of trees in mitigating this issue. Using ENVI-met simulations, the study examines various factors influencing tree cooling effectiveness, including seasonal variations, building shading, transpiration rates, tree placement, and spacing. A new tree-planting strategy is developed based on these findings, aiming to enhance thermal comfort. The study compares the thermal environment of sidewalks under the new tree-planting scheme with the existing arrangement across different months. Results indicate that the new scheme reduces UTCI temperatures by 2.2°C on the hottest day, 0.97°C on the coldest day, and 1.52°C annually in the study area of Los Angeles, demonstrating that the cooling benefits of trees in hot weather outweigh the potential drawbacks in cold weather, highlighting its potential to mitigate the urban heat island effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2ad59d6b38b3270010f1f1ac505f52694cfe43d55ca4cb092b5156bca268657","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
