{"title":"Limits of Special Relativity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1651/v1","date":1721634636000,"content":"HIGHLIGHTS  Special relativity has been successfully used to describe the behaviour of particles (Rossi &amp; Hall, 1941), but there is no observation of special relativity in our world. On the contrary, there are at least two paradoxes based on special relativity: the twin paradox (Langevin, 1911) and Ehrenfest's paradox (1909). This paper is presenting a first experiment, based on Ehrenfest's paradox, where an effect of special relativity was expected but not observed. The validity of special relativity in our macro world will be questioned and an alternative will be offered.   ABSTRACT  After presenting the history of special relativity, the non-simultaneity of special relativity is questionned in our macro world. In addition, some incompatibilities between light clocks and the application of Lorentz transformation are presented. All this indicates some issues with special relativity which appears to be correct only for particles and would be invalid in our macro world. A new theory is presented based on an adaptation of special relativity; this new theory solves the anomalies and could be a solution to the twin paradox. This paper also presents a new experiment and its observation. The preliminary result shows that special relativity has no effect in our macro world and therefore supports the new theory. A lack of special relativistic effects has been observed in the universe (Davis et al., 2004); that is another observation where special relativity doesn't work. That second observation is also explained with the new theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"300b6b813315091fae380bf0f2fb59aa8684c327d9abee9db23178701e992922","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
