El Rouby, Aliasgar Shahiwala</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Indigenous plants have historically been crucial in treating human diseases across various cultures worldwide. Research continues to uncover new therapeutic uses for indigenous plants, from treating infectious diseases to managing chronic conditions such as diabetes and wound care. This study aimed to examine the effect of palm tree leaves \"<i>Phoenix dactylifera L</i>\" extract and its topical film formulation on wound healing and blood glucose levels.</p> Methods <p>Palm leaves were collected, authenticated, powdered, and extracted with ethanol by cold maceration. Saponins were isolated. The dried extract was analyzed using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography to identify the phytochemicals present. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (40mg/kg). Rats with blood glucose levels â‰¥ 200 mg/dl were used to determine the reduction in blood glucose with or without the oral extract. Incision and excision wounds were induced in both diabetic and normal rats. Topical films containing extract or saponin and inert films were applied to the wounds every other day, and wound sizes were recorded until the wound was completely healed.</p> Results <p>The presence of six flavonoids, Naringin, Rutin, Quercetin, Kaempferol, Apigenin, and Catechin, and five phenolic acids, Syringic acid, p Coumaric acid, Caffeic acid, Ferulic acid, Ellagic acid were detected in the dried extract. A significant reduction in blood sugar in diabetic rats and wound diameter in the treated group compared to the control group in both diabetic and normal rats was observed, confirming the promising role of palm leaf extract on diabetes and wound care. Macroscopic, morphometric, and histological data suggested that the cutaneous wound healing in rats treated with the leaf extract was better and faster than the control or inert groups.</p> Conclusions <p>Our research findings highlight the marked effect of <i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> extract as a supportive or alternative treatment for both hyperglycemia and incision or excision wounds. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms of action.</p>","author":"Hanan S.
