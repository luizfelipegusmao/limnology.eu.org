{"title":"Bioeconomics of juvenile seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) culture: Optimal harvest time","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13076?af=R","date":1722826820000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The culture of seahorses <i>Hippocampus erectus</i> in captivity represents a window of opportunity for the diversification of the aquaculture activity in the ornamental industry. In this study, we have constructed a bioeconomic model to evaluate the optimal harvest time (OHT) over a culture period of 562 days. The bioeconomic model was integrated with three submodels: biological, technological, and economic. Three different mortality rates were used for different periods in culture, registering a higher survival in the period from 0 to 60 days with a rate of 53.4%. The sensitivity analysis showed that the mortality rate in this period was the parameter with the greatest influence on the benefits. The Von Bertalanffy growth model was indicated to describe the growth of <i>H. erectus</i> given its statistical significance using Theil's inequality coefficient, registering parameters of (L∞ = 141.62 mm) and (k = 0.0049 month-1). The bioeconomic model determined the OHT in the 4th month of culture, the time when the maximum profit is recorded. It is concluded that the culture presents challenges to be addressed although the bioeconomic model allows for demonstrating the OHT.</p>","author":"Omar Sánchez‐Becerril, \nJuan Carlos Seijo Gutiérrez, \nMiguel A.
