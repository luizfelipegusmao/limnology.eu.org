French</p>\r\nBackground <p>Identifying women aged 30–39 years at increased risk of developing breast cancer would allow them to receive screening and prevention offers. For this to be feasible, the practicalities of organising risk assessment and primary prevention must be acceptable to the healthcare professionals who would be responsible for delivery. It has been proposed that primary care providers are best placed to deliver a breast cancer risk assessment and primary prevention pathway. The present study aimed to investigate a range of primary care provider’s views on the development and implementation of a breast cancer risk assessment and primary prevention pathway within primary care for women aged 30–39 years.</p> Methods <p>Twenty-five primary care providers working at general practices in either Greater Manchester or Cambridgeshire and Peterborough participated in five focus groups (n = 18) and seven individual interviews. Data were analysed thematically and organised using a framework approach.</p> Results <p>Three themes were developed. <i>Challenges with delivering a breast cancer risk assessment and primary prevention pathway within primary care</i> highlights that primary care are willing to facilitate but not lead delivery of such a pathway given the challenges with existing workload pressures and concerns about ensuring effective clinical governance. <i>Primary care’s preferred level of involvement</i> describes the aspects of the pathway participants thought primary care could be involved in, namely co-ordinating data collection for risk assessment and calculating and communicating risk. <i>Requirements for primary care involvement</i> captures the need to provide a training and education package to address deficits in knowledge prior to involvement. Additionally, the reservations primary care have about being involved in the management of women identified as being at increased risk are discussed and suggestions are provided for facilitating primary care to take on this role.</p> Conclusions <p>Despite optimism that primary care might lead a breast cancer risk assessment and primary prevention pathway, participants had a range of concerns that should be considered when developing such a pathway.</p>","author":"Sarah Hindmarch","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b9e82f0f422b39bf5530905d7433fd7bfe00aa5e76ffd95225c01ea4d8f723ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
