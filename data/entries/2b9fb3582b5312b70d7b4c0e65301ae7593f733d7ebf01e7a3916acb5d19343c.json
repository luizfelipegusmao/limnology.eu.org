{"title":"Uptake and associated factors of six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing differentiated service delivery model of care among stable clients on antiretroviral therapy in Southern Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310400","date":1726149600000,"content":"<p>by Fasika Merid, Tamirat Gezahegn Guyo, Simegn Wagaye, Mesele Mekuria, Abraham Anbesie, Temesgen Mohammed Toma</p>\r\nBackground <p>Differentiated service delivery models have been developed to accommodate the rising number of stable antiretroviral therapy clients and to maintain improvements in health outcomes and care retention. Ethiopia adopted the appointment spacing model and has had notable successes in implementing it. However, with the implementation of the six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing model in Ethiopia, little is known about the uptake and its associated factors. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the uptake and associated factors of the six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing differentiated service delivery model of care among stable clients on antiretroviral therapy in Southern Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 stable clients on antiretroviral therapy in southern Ethiopia from June 22 to September 29, 2023. A systematic sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Using a structured questionnaire, socio-demographic, health service delivery, behavioral, and clinical-related data were collected. The collected data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using Stata version 14. Variables with a P-value &lt;0.05 in the multivariable logistic analysis were considered statistically significant. Multicollinearity and model fitness were checked using the variance inflation factor and the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit tests, respectively.</p> Results <p>The uptake of the six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing differentiated service delivery model of care was 63.25% (95% confidence interval (CI): 58.61%, 67.88%). Missed appointment (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.91 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.25)), distance to antiretroviral therapy facility (AOR: 2.90 (95% CI: 1.67, 5.04)), duration on antiretroviral therapy (AOR: 2.21 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.64)), and intermediate social support (AOR: 2.02 (95% CI: 1.29, 3.17)) and strong social support (AOR: 2.71 (95% CI: 1.23, 5.97)) were factors significantly associated with the uptake.</p> Conclusion <p>The uptake of six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing differentiated service delivery models of care was six out of ten clients on antiretroviral therapy. To further improve the uptake, a precise intervention on the identified associated factor is required.</p>","author":"Fasika Merid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2b9fb3582b5312b70d7b4c0e65301ae7593f733d7ebf01e7a3916acb5d19343c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
