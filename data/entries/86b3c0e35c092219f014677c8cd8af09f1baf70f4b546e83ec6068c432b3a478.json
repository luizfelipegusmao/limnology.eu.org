{"title":"Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy in an Infant with Atrial Flutter and Prolonged Recovery of Cardiac Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0020/v1","date":1714530623000,"content":"Background: Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) is caused by prolonged tachycardia leading to left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction with heart failure. Although TIC is more common in adult, it is rare in early infant. Methods: Clinical testing was performed as part of medical evaluation and management. Next gene se-quencing (NGS) was performed for a patient with TIC. Literature review about TIC was con-ducted. Results: The case was a 5-month-old infant referred the hospital due to symptoms with heart failure at least lasting two months. Heart rate was 200 beats per minute, left ventricular ejection fraction fell below 14%, and electrocardiograms showed atrial flutter, suggesting TIC. After cardiover-sion, there was no recurrence of atrial flutter, and cardiac function was improved at 98 days after tachycardia arrest. There were no pathogenic variants identified according to NGS. Literature review identified 8 early infantile cases with TIC reported. However, there were no previous re-ports such as our case with longer duration of TIC. Conclusions: Improvement of cardiac function depends on the duration of TIC. TIC should be considered in all patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy of uncertain origin and who have tachycardias such as atrial flutter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86b3c0e35c092219f014677c8cd8af09f1baf70f4b546e83ec6068c432b3a478","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
