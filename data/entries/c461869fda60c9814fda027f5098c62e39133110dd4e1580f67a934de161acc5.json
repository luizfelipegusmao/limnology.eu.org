{"title":"Identification of the First Case of Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma in Amphibians: Insights from Maculopaa medogensiss","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2070/v1","date":1727337361000,"content":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is a rare and aggressive type of cancer primarily reported in humans, with no documented cases in animals. In this study, we present the first case of DDLPS in a wild amphibian species, Maculopaa medogensis. The tumor was discovered during a routine examination and diagnosed through a combination of advanced diagnostic methods, including micro-CT imaging, gross anatomical inspection, histological analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The tumor exhibited both well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components, characteristic of DDLPS, with evidence of tissue invasion and multiple metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong positive expression of markers such as S100A4, CDK4, MDM2, and CD34, while Leptin expression was negative, further confirming the diagnosis. This is the first reported case of DDLPS in a non-human species, expanding our understanding of cancer in wildlife and underscoring the significance of amphibians as environmental indicators. These findings provide valuable insights for veterinary medicine and wildlife conservation, particularly regarding the role of environmental stressors in cancer development. This study highlights the need for comprehensive diagnostic approaches in wildlife pathology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c461869fda60c9814fda027f5098c62e39133110dd4e1580f67a934de161acc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
