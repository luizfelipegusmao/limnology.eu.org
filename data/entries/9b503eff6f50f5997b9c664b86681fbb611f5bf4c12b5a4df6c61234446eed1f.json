{"title":"Impact of Twig-Tip Dieback on Leaf Nutrient Status and Resorption Efficiency of Mango (Mangifera indica L.) Trees","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2002/v2","date":1719229929000,"content":"Mineral nutrition is essential for plant growth and interaction of plants with biotic and abiotic stresses. Mango twig-tip dieback (MTTD) is a new type of mango decline, but its impact on the trees’ mineral nutrition is unknown. This study was conducted to determine the effect of MTTD infection on the nutrient status, balance, and resorption efficiency (RE) of mango. Leaf nutrient concentrations and deviation from the optimum percentage (DOP) indices of ‘Kensington Pride’ (KP) mango trees with low (LD) and high (HD) levels of MTTD infections were analyzed to compare the foliar nutrition status and nutrient balance between the LD and HD trees. Moreover, the nutrient resorption efficiency of MTTD-infected dried leaves (RED) was compared with the resorption efficiency of healthy (RES) leaves of KP mangoes. The concentrations of the total Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were lower in the HD trees than in the LD trees. But the total K content was higher in the HD trees, and its DOP index was sufficient, while the total K concentration was low and deficient level in LD trees. Moreover, DOP indices for total Ca, Mn, and Zn were less deficient in LD trees than in HD trees, and overall nutrient imbalances were exacerbated in HD trees. RED was significantly lower than RES for the total N, P, S, Cu, Fe, and Zn but significantly higher than RES for K. The study underscores the significant influence of MTTD on the mineral nutrition of KP mangoes, revealing distinct nutrient variations between trees with low and high MTTD infection levels. These findings have important implications for mango crop management, emphasizing the need for targeted nutrient interventions to address imbalances induced by MTTD and enhance the overall health and resistance of mango trees against MTTD infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b503eff6f50f5997b9c664b86681fbb611f5bf4c12b5a4df6c61234446eed1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
