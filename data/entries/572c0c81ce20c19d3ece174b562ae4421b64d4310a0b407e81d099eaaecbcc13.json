{"title":"Self-Coagulation Theory and Related Astro-Structures in Electronegative and Gaseous Discharging Plasmas of Laboratory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1645/v1","date":1724319206000,"content":"The astro-structures with the shape of comet and semi-circle, are found in the electronegative inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs), e.g., Ar/O2 and Ar/SF6. They are formed by means of the self-coagulation theory. This theory is built and based on two-dimensional fluid model simulation dynamic data of the above ICP sources. Concretely, quasi-Helmholtz equation is constructed through the free diffusion transport component and a novel negative chemical source term. The absolute value of recombination rate is higher than the attachment rate and so the net source of simulated anion is negative. This is quite a new chemical phenomenon in the electronegative and gaseous discharging plasmas when compared to the previously reported normal positive chemical source that will generate ambi-polar diffusion potential. In electronegative plasma, the self-coagulation is ambi-polar to sustain the electrical neutrality. Besides, when the anions are accelerated by ambi-polar potential before self-coagulated, the self-coagulation is again advective which leads to the formation of blue sheath. At the ambi-polar self-coagulation of high electronegativity, the electrons dynamics are relatively decoupled from ions and meanwhile they have their own relatively weak, spontaneous, and monopolar self-coagulation in the periphery of astro-structure. At the ambi-polar self-coagulation, both the anion and cation are individually treated as mass point models that carry charge (point charge models, more precisely). When the charge amounts of two individual astr-structures, e.g., semi-circle SF3+ and Ar+, are equal, the coagulated profile of heavy species SF3+ collapses by the expelling effect of Coulomb force that exists between the two point-charges. This is an anti-collective behavior of astro-structure, instead of the collective interaction of plasma, since the collapse of coagulated heavy species creates spatially dispersed charge density that cannot be shielded. The simulation shows that the lighter the species, the easier it self-coagulates, determined by the inertial effect of density quantity. The discharge picture of electronegative plasma is combined by a dynamic continuum transport (e.g., forming the ellipse background) and the mechanical balance contained in the static self-coagulation process (proven by dimensional analysis of continuity equation). The popular astro-structure of electronegative ICP source awaits urgently for the validation of experiment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"572c0c81ce20c19d3ece174b562ae4421b64d4310a0b407e81d099eaaecbcc13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
