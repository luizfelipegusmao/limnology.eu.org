{"title":"Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy: A Case Report and Review of Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1988/v1","date":1719535488000,"content":"Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1:1,000,000 population. It results from pathogenic variants in the PLA2G6 gene located on chromosome (22q13.1). The onset of symptoms usually occurs between 6 to 18 months, causing developmental regression leading to debilitating symptoms such as muscle weakness, dementia, and loss of basic skills. Eventually, it progresses to life-threatening symptoms including breathing difficulties, which limits the life expectancy to 5-10 years. While potential genetic therapy for treatment is are being developed, they are yet to be approved for use, and management remains essentially supportive. This case report is of a 9-year-old Pakistani girl with INAD. She presented with recurrent chest infections, developmental regression, loss of speech, paralysis, hypertension, and eventually breathing difficulties. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and genetic testing con-firmed the diagnosis. This case posed diagnostic challenges in view of its overlapping clinical presentation. Through this report, we aim to raise awareness about the condition among practitioners, outline the importance of genetic counseling in susceptible couples and suggest potential areas of further research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2e33038967841833627f0019149d0c0b267e07f0a3fde855879522c3ec22531","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
