This is perhaps most well-known with biological samples but is also extremely important in materials science with many materials being extremely beam sensitive, such as MOFs, zeolites, and organic perovskites. While scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has come to dominate in high resolution materials science, for the most beam sensitive materials TEM has remained predominant due to the dose efficiency of its phase contrast imaging. Recent technological advances have, however, started to challenge this status quo for low dose imaging with the combination of fast 4D STEM and ptychography. Ptychography has been shown to be able to exceed the dose efficiency of TEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.929-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.929-B2\">2</a>] but had been limited by low camera speeds, making 4D STEM exceedingly slow for high probe position count dataset. This bottleneck has been completely overcome using event driven camera technology [<a href=\"#ozae044.929-B3\">3</a>] and conventional framing cameras are also increasing closing the gap between 4D STEM scan speeds and high-speed conventional STEM scans. This greatly facilitates drift free and low dose 4D STEM data acquisition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"87523caccdfdcb00ef9113d28161f079d1997c61ddac77d52bd03ed0497aa166","category":"Environment"}
