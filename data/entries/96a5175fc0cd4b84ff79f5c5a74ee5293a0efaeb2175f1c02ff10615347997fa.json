{"title":"East African highland cooking banana: towards an efficient selection of hybrids with user‐preferred food quality traits","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13070?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Determinants of culinary qualities of East African highland cooking bananas (EAHCB) are not well known. This constrains the inclusion of user-preferred traits in breeding. The present study aimed to quantify key indicators of user-preferred characteristics to enable selection of acceptable hybrids.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Qualitative characteristics that drive preference were big bunches (15–34 kg), long straight/slightly curved fingers (12–23 cm), yellowness and soft texture. Descriptive sensory analysis of the intensity of colour and texture the 23 genotypes revealed that landraces Kibuzi, Mbwazirume, Nakitembe and Mpologoma had higher intensity of yellowness and lower intensity of hardness (softer) and a low score (≤ 1.0) of astringency taste. A preference test showed that they had higher acceptability scores. Biochemical, instrumental and sensory data revealed correlations between sensory firmness and instrumental hardness (<i>r</i> = 0.5), sensory firmness and amylopectin (<i>r</i> = −0.54), suggesting that qualitative descriptions can be predicted by instrumental and biochemical indicators. Significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) variations in amylose and total starch content were observed in different varieties. Moderate correlations between instrumental hardness and firmness in mouth (<i>r</i> = 0.55), cohesiveness and firmness in the mouth (<i>r</i> = 0.57), and adhesiveness and firmness in the mouth (r = 0.64) were observed. Surprisingly, carotenoids content was not correlated with yellowness in cooked matooke. However, positive correlations were observed between chroma (<i>b</i>*) parameters of raw matooke and sensorial assessed color on cooked samples.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Qualitative characteristis; the bunch, pulp colour and texture; that drive users-preference in the EAHCB were quantified, paving way for breeders to use them to select genotypes with these attributes early in the breeding process. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Kephas Nowakunda, \nElizabeth Khakasa, \nHernan Ceballos, \nAkankwasa Kenneth, \nRobooni Tumuhimbise, \nChristophe Bugaud, \nMoreen Asasira, \nBrigitte Uwimana, \nAlexandre Bouniol, \nEphraim Nuwamanya, \nLora Forsythe, \nPricilla Marimo, \nDominique Dufour, \nWilberforce Tushemereirwe","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"96a5175fc0cd4b84ff79f5c5a74ee5293a0efaeb2175f1c02ff10615347997fa","category":"Environment"}
