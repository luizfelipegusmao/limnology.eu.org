{"title":"In-Situ Microstructural Evolution and Mechanical Performance of Nickel-Containing Steels During High-Temperature Heat Treatment: Precipitation Behavior and Its Impact on Material Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0314/v1","date":1722920095000,"content":"This study investigates the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of steel subjected to high-temperature heat treatment, with a focus on the formation and effects of dark phase precipitates. High Temperature Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (HTCLSM) was employed to observe the in-situ changes in microstructure as the steel was heated from room temperature to 900째C. The observations revealed that dark phase precipitates, identified as chromium carbides (Cr7C3), began forming at approximately 820째C and increased in quantity and size up to 900째C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed that these precipitates significantly enhance the material's hardness, with microhardness values of 320 HV for the precipitates compared to 270 HV for the matrix. Tensile tests showed that the tensile strength of the steel increases with soaking time at 900째C, reaching a maximum after 3 minutes due to the strengthening effect of the precipitates. Beyond this point, strength decreases due to grain coarsening.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e89912d4711bed162872ffcd54a35eb0686085d9a74eab28ea9101465d5fdcc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
