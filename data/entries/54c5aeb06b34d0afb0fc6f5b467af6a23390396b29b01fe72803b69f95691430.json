{"title":"Chinese Scholarship on Concurrent Analyses of Indonesia and Timor-Leste: Patterns, Themes, and Positioning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1036/v1","date":1718614583000,"content":"This paper systematically examines Chinese academic discourse that concurrently addresses Indonesia and Timor-Leste, analysing 137 articles from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and indexed by the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI). The analysis reveals significant publication trends, particularly during periods of heightened geopolitical and economic engagement, such as the global expansion of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It identifies predominant themes such as economic cooperation, security concerns, and historical-cultural dynamics. The findings highlight China’s strategic interests and leadership aspirations in Southeast Asia， providing insights into how Chinese scholars perceive and articulate China’s strategic interests and diplomatic efforts in the region involving Indonesia and Timor-Leste.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54c5aeb06b34d0afb0fc6f5b467af6a23390396b29b01fe72803b69f95691430","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
