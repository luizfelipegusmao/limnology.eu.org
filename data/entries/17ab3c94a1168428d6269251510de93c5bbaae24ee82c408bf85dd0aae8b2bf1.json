{"title":"Digital Trio: Integration of BIM-EIR-IoT for Facilities Management of Mega Construction Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1754/v1","date":1716813137000,"content":": Facility Management (FM) has increasingly focused on using Building Information Modeling (BIM) in large-scale development projects. To successfully integrate BIM in the FM sector, cooperation among different participants involved in various project stages must be improved. The objective of this digital revolution in FM is to enhance the efficacy of planning, constructing, and managing assets, benefiting all parties involved. However, the utilization of BIM in FM is limited due to factors such as incomplete owner understanding, insufficient data accessibility, and stakeholders' unfamiliarity with BIM procedures and standardization. Although the FM industry acknowledges BIM's significance, achieving successful implementation remains challenging. Facility managers lack a clear understanding of BIM's benefits in expediting operations and cost efficiency and the necessary skills for efficient utilization. To address this constraint, it is essential to develop an Employeeâ€™s Information Requirement (EIR) at the outset of a project, serving as a strategic plan and providing a comprehensive vision for all parties involved, particularly large-scale projects. Two essential technologies that facilitate the transition towards building operations are BIM and the Internet of Things (IoT). Incorporating these technologies is crucial to reducing time, expenses, and operational challenges throughout any project. The aim of this research is to create a Digital-Trio workflow, as a new expression, by providing a methodology for using facility management with BIM through the integration of EIR and IoT, maximizes the benefit of stakeholders strategically and operationally. It also explores how the preparation of the EIR by communicating with all parties will definitely improve the design process, sustainability, efficiency, cost, and time for any project, especially megaprojects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17ab3c94a1168428d6269251510de93c5bbaae24ee82c408bf85dd0aae8b2bf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
