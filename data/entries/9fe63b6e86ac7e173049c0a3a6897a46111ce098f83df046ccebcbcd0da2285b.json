{"title":"Lightweight Optic Disc and Optic Cup Segmentation Based on MobileNetv3 Convolutional Neural Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2472/v1","date":1722385141000,"content":"Glaucoma, a global leading cause of blindness, necessitates accurate segmentation of the optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) for effective screening. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from high computational complexity and long inference times. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end segmentation method for the OD and OC using a lightweight MobileNetv3 as the feature extraction network. Our approach incorporates boundary branches and an adversarial learning network to achieve multi-label segmentation of the OD and OC. We evaluate the proposed method on three publicly available datasets: Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE. The experimental results demonstrate segmentation accuracies of 0.974/0.900, 0.966/0.875, and 0.962/0.880 for the OD and OC on the respective datasets, while significantly reducing inference time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fe63b6e86ac7e173049c0a3a6897a46111ce098f83df046ccebcbcd0da2285b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
