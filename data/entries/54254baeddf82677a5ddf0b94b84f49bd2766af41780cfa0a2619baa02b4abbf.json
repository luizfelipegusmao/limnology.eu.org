{"title":"Semi‐industrial ultrasound‐assisted extraction of grape‐seed proteins","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13395?af=R","date":1711025069000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>To manage industrial waste in accordance with the circular bioeconomy concept it is sometimes necessary to handle grape seeds, an abundant by-product of the wine-making process. This study presents a process based on ultrasound technology for the extraction of grape-seed proteins, due to their nutritional and techno-functional properties. The protein content of extracts obtained under silent and lab-scale conditions was compared with that obtained under semi-industrial ultrasound conditions, and the chemical composition (carbohydrates, total phenols, and lipids) and the elemental profiles of the final, up-scaled downstream extracts were characterized.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This work found that the maximum amount of protein in the final product was 378.31 g.kg<sup>−1</sup> of the extract. Chemical characterization revealed that each 1 kg of extract had an average content of 326.19 g gallic acid equivalent as total phenols, 162.57 g glucose equivalent as carbohydrates, and 382.76 g of lipophilic compounds. Furthermore, when the extract was checked for hazardous elements, none were found in levels that could be considered a risk for human health.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The proposed semi-industrial strategy has the potential to contribute greatly to the valorization of grape seeds through the preparation of a protein-rich extract that can be used as an alternative to synthetic wine stabilizers and for the development of novel food and nutraceutical products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Salah Chaji, \nGiorgio Capaldi, \nLorenzo Gallina, \nGiorgio Grillo, \nLuisa Boffa, \nGiancarlo Cravotto","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"54254baeddf82677a5ddf0b94b84f49bd2766af41780cfa0a2619baa02b4abbf","category":"Environment"}
