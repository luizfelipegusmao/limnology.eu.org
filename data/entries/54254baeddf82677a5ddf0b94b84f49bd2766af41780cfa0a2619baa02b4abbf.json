{"title":"Semi‐industrial ultrasound‐assisted extraction of grape‐seed proteins","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13395?af=R","date":1708351758000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Handling grape-seeds, an abundant by-product of the wine-making process, is essential for managing industrial waste in accordance with the circular bioeconomy concept. An ultrasound-technology-based scaling-up process for the extraction of grape-seed proteins, due to their nutritional and techno-functional properties, is therefore presented herein. The protein contents of the extracts obtained under silent and on lab and semi-industrial ultrasound conditions have been compared, and the chemical composition (carbohydrates, total phenols and lipids) and elemental profile of the final, up-scaled downstream extract have been characterized.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The findings of the present work showed that the maximum protein amount in the final product was 378.31 g.kg<sup>−1</sup> of extract. The chemical characterization revealed that each 1 kg of extract had an average content of 326.19 g gallic acid equivalents as total phenols, 162.57 g glucose equivalents as carbohydrates and 382.76 g of lipophilic compounds. Furthermore, when the extract was checked for hazardous elements, none were found in levels that could be considered a risk for human health.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The proposed semi-industrial strategy has the potential to greatly contribute to the valorisation of grape-seeds through the preparation of a protein-rich extract that can be used as an alternative to synthetic wine stabilizers and for the development of novel food and nutraceutical products.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
