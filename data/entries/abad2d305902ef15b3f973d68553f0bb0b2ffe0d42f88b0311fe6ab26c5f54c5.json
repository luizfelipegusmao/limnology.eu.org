{"title":"Antibody-Drug Conjugates and Their Potential in the Treatment of Patients with Biliary Tract Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1960/v1","date":1727247659000,"content":"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are aggressive in nature, often presenting asymptomatically until they are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgical resection or liver transplantation are potential curative options. However, a large proportion of patients present with incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease and most of these patients are only eligible for palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care. More recently, targeted therapies have proven beneficial in a molecularly selected subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on previous lines of systemic treatment. However, only a minority of patients with BTCs whose tumours harbour specific molecular alterations can access these therapies. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are novel anti-cancer therapies designed to minimise challenges of systemic drug distribution and are currently being investigated in multiple types of malignancies, after failure of standard therapeutic options. This review outlines the mechanism of action of ADCs and the current research in this field in various cancer types, including BTCs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abad2d305902ef15b3f973d68553f0bb0b2ffe0d42f88b0311fe6ab26c5f54c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
