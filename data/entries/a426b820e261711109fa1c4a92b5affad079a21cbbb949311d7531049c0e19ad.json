{"title":"Enthesitis in IBD Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1972/v1","date":1716977554000,"content":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompasses two main subtypes, Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is frequently accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), with axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) being the most common. Enthesitis, an inflammation of the bone insertions of capsules, ligaments, and tendons, represents an initial lesion in SpA. However, enthesitis remains an underestimated and often obscured EIM. The early detection of subclinical enthesial involvement in IBD patients using ultrasound (US) could provide an opportunity for timely intervention. While previous meta-analyses have reported on the incidence and prevalence of SpA in IBD, specific attention to enthesitis has been lacking. Therefore, this narrative review aims to resume the current knowledge on existing IBD-SpA cohorts, focusing specifically on enthesitis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a426b820e261711109fa1c4a92b5affad079a21cbbb949311d7531049c0e19ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
