{"title":"Multi-trait analysis of gene-by-environment interactions in large-scale genetic studies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/2/504/7075729?rss=1","date":1678406400000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Identifying genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is challenging because the GEI analysis generally has low power. Large-scale consortium-based studies are ultimately needed to achieve adequate power for identifying GEI. We introduce Multi-Trait Analysis of Gene–Environment Interactions (MTAGEI), a powerful, robust, and computationally efficient framework to test gene–environment interactions on multiple traits in large data sets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB). To facilitate the meta-analysis of GEI studies in a consortium, MTAGEI efficiently generates summary statistics of genetic associations for multiple traits under different environmental conditions and integrates the summary statistics for GEI analysis. MTAGEI enhances the power of GEI analysis by aggregating GEI signals across multiple traits and variants that would otherwise be difficult to detect individually. MTAGEI achieves robustness by combining complementary tests under a wide spectrum of genetic architectures. We demonstrate the advantages of MTAGEI over existing single-trait-based GEI tests through extensive simulation studies and the analysis of the whole exome sequencing data from the UKB.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"7b937496f9d01fd1741603ae7b47be5327a0197b3a06ac789d6c7ab60c701bfd","category":"Environment"}
