{"title":"Reliability analysis using Limit equilibrium and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics-based method for homogeneous soil slopes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300293","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Xuesong Chu, Jiahui Wen, Liang Li</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper develops a combined method to predict the volume of sliding mass for homogeneous slopes in an efficient manner. Firstly, the failure surface with minimum factor of safety (FS) in Limit Equilibrium Method is equated to that one determined by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm to obtain the threshold displacement value for unstable and stable particles. Secondly, the threshold displacement value is used to identify the volume of sliding mass using SPH. Finally, a regression model is developed based on a finite number of SPH simulations for homogeneous soil slopes. The proposed LEM-SPH based method is illustrated through a cohesive soil slope. It is concluded that the use of failure surface with minimum FS in LEM tends to underestimate the volume of sliding mass and to give an unconservative risk value. The Coefficient of Variation (Cov) of volume of sliding mass are 0.14, 0.28, 0.4, 0.48, 0.53 for Cov of soil properties = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively. The uncertainty of soil properties has a significant effect on the mean value of volume of sliding mass and therefore the landslide risk value. The proposed method is necessitated for cases where large uncertainties in soil properties exist.","author":"Xuesong Chu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2c9fd8dc3f470330707c4241897b3942547ab248c01b0e4443bee4ba2c6ffec0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
