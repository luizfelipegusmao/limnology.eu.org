{"title":"The Influence of Different Solvents on the Physical Properties of ZnO Thin Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1640/v1","date":1721629093000,"content":"Polycrystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were deposited on soda-lime glass substrates using the chemical spray pyrolysis method at three different substrate temperatures: 400, 450, and 500 ºC. The solvents used in the precursor solution consisted of either ethanol or methanol. The effects of these solvents on the compositional, structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties were studied with different techniques, including Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Four-Point method and Ultraviolet and Visible Spectroscopy (Uv-Vis). The results show that both temperature and the type of solvent modify the properties of the materials. An essential outcome of the study was that at 500 ºC, the ZnO thin films prepared with either ethanol or methanol exhibited almost the same high-quality crystallinity, stoichiometry, average crystallite size, energy band gap, and resistivity. These findings contribute to our understanding of the properties of these materials and their potential applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35d3e4337e05ebf112c8a6ebf825bb989e014263b1483f0ee655e0f10f128e6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
