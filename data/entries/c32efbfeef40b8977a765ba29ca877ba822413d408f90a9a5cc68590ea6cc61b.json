{"title":"Multifunctional 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde O-methyltransferases (CAldOMTs) in plant metabolism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/6/1671/7515073?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Lignin, flavonoids, melatonin, and stilbenes are plant specialized metabolites with diverse physiological and biological functions, supporting plant growth and conferring stress resistance. Their biosynthesis requires <span>O</span>-methylations catalyzed by 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde <span>O</span>-methyltransferase (CAldOMT; also called caffeic acid <span>O</span>-methyltransferase, COMT). CAldOMT was first known for its roles in syringyl (S) lignin biosynthesis in angiosperm cell walls and later found to be multifunctional. This enzyme also catalyzes <span>O</span>-methylations in flavonoid, melatonin, and stilbene biosynthetic pathways. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the convergent evolution of enzymes with OMT activities towards the monolignol biosynthetic pathway intermediates in some gymnosperm species that lack S-lignin and <span>Selaginella moellendorffii</span>, a lycophyte which produces S-lignin. Furthermore, neofunctionalization of CAldOMTs occurred repeatedly during evolution, generating unique <span>O</span>-methyltransferases (OMTs) with novel catalytic activities and/or accepting novel substrates, including lignans, 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene, and phenylpropenes. This review summarizes multiple aspects of CAldOMTs and their related proteins in plant metabolism and discusses their evolution, molecular mechanism, and roles in biorefineries, agriculture, and synthetic biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c32efbfeef40b8977a765ba29ca877ba822413d408f90a9a5cc68590ea6cc61b","category":"Environment"}
