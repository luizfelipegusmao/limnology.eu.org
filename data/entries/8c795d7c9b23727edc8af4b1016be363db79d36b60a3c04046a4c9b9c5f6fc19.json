{"title":"Advancements and Perspectives in Additive Manufacturing of Tungsten Alloys and Composites: Challenges and Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1108/v1","date":1718604172000,"content":"This review examines additive manufacturing for refractory tungsten (W) and its alloys. It emphasizes the primary challenges and determining factors involved in additive manufacturing pure W, W alloys, and composites. Our focus in this regard extends to both process and alloying strategies designed to address critical issues such as densification, micro-cracking, and mechanical properties in tungsten-based components produced through additive techniques. Throughout the review, we organize existing knowledge and insights into convenient tables, serving as valuable resources for researchers embarking on a deeper exploration of these topics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c795d7c9b23727edc8af4b1016be363db79d36b60a3c04046a4c9b9c5f6fc19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
