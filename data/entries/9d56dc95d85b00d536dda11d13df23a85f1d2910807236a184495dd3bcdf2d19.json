{"title":"Establishment of a Suitable Diagnostic Pipeline to Ensure Sensitive Detection of African Swine Fever Virus Genome in Porcine Semen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0482/v1","date":1715153915000,"content":"The rapid spread of African swine fever virus (ASFV), causing severe and often lethal disease in domestic pigs and Eurasian wild boar, continues to be a threat for pig populations and dependent industries. Despite scientific achievements that deepen our understanding of ASFV pathogenesis, alternative transmission routes for ASFV remain to be elucidated. We previously demonstrated the efficient transmission of ASFV from infected boars to na√Øve recipient gilts via artificial insemination, thereby highlighting the importance of surveillance in boar semen prior to shipment. Since accurate and reliable detection of even low amounts of ASFV in boar semen is key for disease prevention and control, we established a suitable diagnostic pipeline to efficiently detect ASFV genome in boar semen. Here, we assessed sensitivity, specificity and overall performance of various routine nucleic acid extraction kits as well as qPCR protocols in detecting ASFV genome in blood and semen of boars. Feasibility of respective kits and methods for future use in boar studs was also considered. Variability in sensitivity mostly concerned samples with low to very low amounts of ASFV genome. Ultimately, we defined a well-suited pipeline to precisely detect ASFV genome in boar semen, as early as 2 days post ASFV infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d56dc95d85b00d536dda11d13df23a85f1d2910807236a184495dd3bcdf2d19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
