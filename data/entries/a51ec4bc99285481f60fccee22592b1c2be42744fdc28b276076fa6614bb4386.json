{"title":"The Alphabet Soup of Microscopy: An Introduction to Advanced Imaging Techniques. Part I: Super-Resolution’s STED, SIM, SMI, and SMLM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/4/42/7718049?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As technology advances, the field of microscopy offers unique opportunities for scientific exploration. However, the complex terminology used to describe these cutting-edge techniques often appears as a jumble of letters, akin to alphabet soup. Among the plethora of acronyms, some of the most prevalent are associated with super-resolution microscopy, including Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED), Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), Spatially Modulated Illumination (SMI), and Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). These techniques push past the limitations of conventional light microscopy, achieving resolutions down to the tens of nanometers. This article aims to decode these common super-resolution techniques, fostering a deeper understanding of microscopy and igniting interest in their application.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"a51ec4bc99285481f60fccee22592b1c2be42744fdc28b276076fa6614bb4386","category":"Environment"}
