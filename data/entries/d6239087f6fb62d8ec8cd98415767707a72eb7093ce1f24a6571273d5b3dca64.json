{"title":"263 Public perspectives of calf handling: A survey of Canadians","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/93/7757303?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In North American beef production handling and restraint of young calves is integral to animal welfare and management practices. This study used a mixed method approach to gather public perceptions of three handling and restraint methods common on beef operations in western Canada (RW - Roping and Wrestling, NF – roping and NordForks, and TT – Tilt Table). Canadian participants (n = 551) recruited by CloudResearch to represent the national demographics participated in an online survey that included videos of each handling method to ascertain preferences and acceptability. Prior to watching the videos, participants were given industry information about handling and restraint or generic information regarding hay as a control information statement within the topic of agriculture. The survey also collected information about knowledge of the beef industry, animal welfare, and empathy toward animals. The reasons for preferences were described as presence of a perceived positive attribute and absence of a perceived negative for most preferred methods, and inversely when explaining least preferred method. The findings focused on calf’s experience, perception of handler actions, and pragmatic balancing of handler needs and a good life for the calf. Methods were rated as more acceptable for participants that ate meat consistently, knew more about the beef industry, and, to a lesser extent, if the individual had a lower animal empathy score (Table 1). Acceptability was not affected by providing information about the practices; however, information about handling and restraint did elicit more pragmatic reasoning. Most participants preferred TT over NF and RW (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) and found TT more acceptable as well (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). The TT was the most preferred method due to calf experience and human handling, notably the absence of dragging a calf, which was predominant in why participants selected NF or RW as their least preferred method. Consistency of themes highlights that the Canadian public has a fundamental expectation of value for the quality of life of the calf, humane handling, and pragmatism which aligns with beef sustainability initiatives and represent points of connection for building trust between industry and the public.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d6239087f6fb62d8ec8cd98415767707a72eb7093ce1f24a6571273d5b3dca64","category":"Environment"}
