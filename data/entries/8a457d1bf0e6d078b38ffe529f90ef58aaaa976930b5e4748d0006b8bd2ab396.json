{"title":"Crossing Point Estimation in Human/Robot Navigation - \nStatistical Linearization versus Sigma-Point-Transformation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1747/v1","date":1711635989000,"content":"Interactions between mobile robots and human operators in common areas require a high safety especially in terms of trajectory planning, obstacle avoidance and mutual cooperation. In this connection the crossings of planned trajectories, their uncertainty based on model fluctuations, system noise and sensor  noise,play an outstanding role. This paper discusses the calculation of expected areas of interactions du ring human-robot navigation with respect to fuzzy and noisy information. Expected crossing points of possible trajectories are nonlinearily associated with positions and orientations of robot and human. The nonlinear transformation of a noisy system input, such as directions of motion of human and robot, to a system output, the expected area of intersection of \ntheir trajectories,  is done by two methods: statistical linearization and the sigma-point-transformation. For both approaches fuzzy approximations are  presented and the inverse problem is  discussed where the input distribution parameters are computed from given output distribution parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a457d1bf0e6d078b38ffe529f90ef58aaaa976930b5e4748d0006b8bd2ab396","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
