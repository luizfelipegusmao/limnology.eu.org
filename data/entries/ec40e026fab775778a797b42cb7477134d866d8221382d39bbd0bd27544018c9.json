{"title":"39 Effectiveness of an educational program covering on-farm finishing of beef cattle for direct-to-consumer in Kentucky","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/3/7617967?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>An educational program was developed to educate beef producers interested in marketing beef directly to the consumer. The program consisted of online webinars and two in-person sessions that were held in 6 locations throughout the state. Online webinar topics included marketing, working with the processor, food safety, forage management, confinement facilities, and environmental stewardship. In-person topics included growth and development and nutrition. The program participants were asked to complete a post-program survey at the end of the in-person session. Twenty-five survey responses were collected from the 95 in-person participants. Of the respondents, 44% indicated they were currently finishing cattle on-farm for direct markets, and the remaining participants included commercial cow-calf producers (44%), backgrounder-stocker producers (8%), and seedstock producers (4%). Participants were asked to indicate the overall level of information gained from the in-person sessions using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not very informative; 5 = very informative), with an average response of 4.0. When asked to rate whether participating in the in-person sessions was an effective use of time using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not very effective; 5 = very effective), the average response was 4.45. Participants were asked to rate their knowledge of various topics before and after each session using a 5-point Likert scale. Differences in pre- and post-knowledge levels were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (SAS; Version 9.4; Cary, NC, USA). Participants reported increased knowledge of the length of time required to finish cattle in various production systems (P &lt; 0.001). Participants reported an increased understanding of bunk scoring systems (P = 0.004). Participants also reported an increased knowledge related to mineral nutrition of finishing cattle (P = 0.01). When asked if participants planned to implement management changes due to this educational program 83% of respondents stated that they would implement management changes on their operations. The results from this survey suggest that participants increased their knowledge related to finishing cattle nutrition and management and that this increase in knowledge should result in on-farm changes improving the efficiency of finishing cattle for direct marketing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ec40e026fab775778a797b42cb7477134d866d8221382d39bbd0bd27544018c9","category":"Environment"}
