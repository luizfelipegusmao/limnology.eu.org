Recent advances in AABs, in particular the development of metal-air batteries (e.g. Fe-air, Al-air and Zn-air), have provided a new promising alternative to Li-ion batteries due to their cost effectiveness, natural abundance of anode materials, environmental friendliness, safety and high specific capacity [<a href=\"#ozae044.808-B1\">1-3</a>]. However, the development of these batteries is still at an early stage, and faces critical challenges, such as corrosion and passivation of the metal anode and dendrite formation in certain systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.808-B3\">3-4</a>]. While numerous strategies have been proposed to address these issues through electrode and electrolyte engineering [<a href=\"#ozae044.808-B2\">2</a>], our understanding of the mechanisms by which these methods improve anode performance is limited. For example, the effects of electrolyte additives on the morphology and phase changes at the anode interface during battery operation is still under debate due to the lack of <span>operando</span> characterization techniques capable of providing detailed spatial and temporal insights into the electrode behaviors [<a href=\"#ozae044.808-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"733d98f940e4bdfed5fbbfe8345978cbb5bcfda9df054b52d4940caf50ce4dd3","category":"Environment"}
