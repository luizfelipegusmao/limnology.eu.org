{"title":"An Efficient Privacy and Anonymity Setup on Hyperledger Fabric for Blockchain-enabled IoT Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1485/v1","date":1716454440000,"content":"The rise in IoT (Internet of Things) devices poses a significant security challenge. Maintaining privacy and ensuring anonymity within the system is a sought-after feature with inevitable trade-offs, such as scalability and increased complexity, making it incredibly challenging to handle. To tackle this, we introduce our proposed work for managing IoT devices using Hyperledger fabric. We integrated our system on the blockchain with a closed-circuit television (CCTV) security camera fixed at a rental property. The CCTV security camera redirects its feed whenever a new renter walks in. We have introduced the web token for authentication from the renter to the owner. Our contributions include the proposition of efficient framework architecture, a novel chain code algorithm, and stealth addresses with modified ring signatures. We performed different analyses to show the system's throughput and latency through stress testing. We have shown the advantages of the proposed architectures by comparing similar existing schemes. Our proposed scheme enhances the security of blockchain-enabled IoT devices and mitigates the single point of failure issue. Our future work includes scaling it up to cater to the needs of the healthcare system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e5fed333da596bfe97deb13d96b4ac3e895e55c166cc023370d810e307d2405","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
