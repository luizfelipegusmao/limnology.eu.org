{"title":"The Plant Mediator Complex in the Initiation of Transcription by RNA Polymerase II","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070623-114005?TRACK=RSS","date":1721606400000,"content":"<div><p>Thirty years have passed since the discovery of the Mediator complex in yeast. We are witnessing breakthroughs and advances that have led to high-resolution structural models of yeast and mammalian Mediators in the preinitiation complex, showing how it is assembled and how it positions the RNA polymerase II and its C-terminal domain (CTD) to facilitate the CTD phosphorylation that initiates transcription. This information may be also used to guide future plant research on the mechanisms of Mediator transcriptional control. Here, we review what we know about the subunit composition and structure of plant Mediators, the roles of the individual subunits and the genetic analyses that pioneered Mediator research, and how transcription factors recruit Mediators to regulatory regions adjoining promoters. What emerges from the research is a Mediator that regulates transcription activity and recruits hormonal signaling modules and histone-modifying activities to set up an off or on transcriptional state that recruits general transcription factors for preinitiation complex assembly.</p></div>","author":"Santiago Nicolás Freytes, María Laura Gobbini and Pablo D.
