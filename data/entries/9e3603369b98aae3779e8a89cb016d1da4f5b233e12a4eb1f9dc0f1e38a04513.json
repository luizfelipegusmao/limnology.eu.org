{"title":"Preparedness, Prevention, Investigation, and Response to the Emergence of Mpox in Khartoum, Sudan in 2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0168/v1","date":1717490593000,"content":"Mpox, formerly known as Monkeypox, is a rare viral disease initially discovered in Africa in 1958. Since its first identification, several outbreaks have occurred in various African nations. Recently, the global community has witnessed a resurgence in the number of Mpox cases reported worldwide, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the ongoing multi-country outbreak a public health emergency in July 2022. This study reports on the first cases of Mpox detected in Khartoum State, Sudan, outlining the epidemiology, preparedness, and public health response to this new challenge. A total of 55 suspected cases were identified, with two confirmed cases. The clinical manifestations observed in these cases align with the classic skin rash typical of Mpox, presenting alongside symptoms like fever, headache, and joint pain. The findings underscore the need for heightened surveillance, early detection, and timely intervention to prevent the domestic spread of Mpox and its potential impact on public health. Continued global efforts are needed to support effective screening, diagnostic, and control measures, ultimately enhancing preparedness and response in the face of this emerging disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e3603369b98aae3779e8a89cb016d1da4f5b233e12a4eb1f9dc0f1e38a04513","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
