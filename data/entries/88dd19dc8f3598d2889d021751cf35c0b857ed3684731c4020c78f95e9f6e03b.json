Asiaticoside (ATS) is a triterpenoid saponin that has been indicated to possess an antitumor activity in several malignancies. Nonetheless, its detailed functions in NSCLC remain unclarified. In this study, NSCLC cells were exposed to various doses of ATS. Functional experiments were employed to estimate the ATS effect on NSCLC cell behaviors. Western blotting was implemented for protein expression evaluation. A xenograft mouse model was established to assess the ATS effect on NSCLC in vivo. The results showed that ATS restrained NSCLC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasiveness. ATS reversed TGF-β-induced promotion in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, ATS inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in NSCLC. Upregulating β-catenin restored ATS-mediated suppression of NSCLC cell aggressiveness. Moreover, ATS administration repressed tumorigenesis in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, ATS represses growth and metastasis in NSCLC by blocking EMT via the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p>","author":"Yanan Zhang, \nJiangyong Liu, \nGang Yang, \nJiani Zou, \nYan Tan, \nErping Xi, \nQing Geng, \nZheng Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"88dd19dc8f3598d2889d021751cf35c0b857ed3684731c4020c78f95e9f6e03b","category":"Environment"}
