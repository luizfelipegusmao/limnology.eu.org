{"title":"The AMR Pandemic Is Here: Implementation Challenges and Need of the One Health Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1400/v1","date":1721203172000,"content":"The issue of antibiotic resistance represents a significant threat that extends beyond human health, encompassing animal welfare and the sustainability of the natural environment. The inappropriate use of antibiotics, poor sanitation and inadequate control measures, have contributed to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which can spread at the human-animal-environment interface. The documented presence of antimicrobials in agriculture, veterinary medicine and human medicine has convinced all stakeholders of the need to contribute to the development of a \"One Health\" approach, which recognises the interrelationships between animals, humans and their environment and the need to adopt a common strategy encompassing these sectors to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Although a number of countries have implemented integrated surveillance systems to monitor antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance, available data suggest that the use of antibiotics in humans, animals and the environment is increasing worldwide. Consequently, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is becoming a recurring concern. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the measures that are necessary to be taken and implemented in order to guarantee global health security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7cf59323b4b6fcc2a939e59b420a760bf20233f35dbe0b850264ab440b34525","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
