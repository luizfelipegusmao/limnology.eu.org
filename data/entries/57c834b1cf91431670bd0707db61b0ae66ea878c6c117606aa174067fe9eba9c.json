{"title":"Analyzing the Approximate Error and the Applicable Condition of Fractional Reduced Differential Transform Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1168/v1","date":1715952463000,"content":"The fractional reduced differential transform method is a finite iterative  method based on infinite fractional expansions. The result obtained  is the approximation of the real value.  There are few reports on the approximate error and the applicable condition.  In this paper, according to the fractional expansions, we study the factors related to the approximate errors. Our research shows that the approximate errors relate not only to fractional order but also to time $t$ and increase rapidly with time $t$. This method can only be applied within a certain time range and the time range is relevant to fractional order and fractional expansions. Then, many obtained achievements may be incorrect if the applicable conditions are not satisfied. Some examples presented in this paper verify our analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57c834b1cf91431670bd0707db61b0ae66ea878c6c117606aa174067fe9eba9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
