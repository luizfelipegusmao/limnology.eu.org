In thioredoxin- and glutathione/glutaredoxin-dependent redox cascades, protein cysteinyl redox steady states are set by varying oxidation and reduction rates. The specificity and interplay of these different redox-active proteins are still under investigation, for example to understand how plants cope with adverse environmental conditions by acclimation. Genetically encoded biosensors with distinct specificity can be targeted to subcellular compartments such as the chloroplast stroma, enabling <span>in vivo</span> real-time measurements of physiological parameters at different scales. These data have provided unique insights into dynamic behaviours of physiological parameters and redox-responsive proteins at several levels of the known redox cascades. This review summarizes current applications of different biosensor types as well as the dynamics of distinct protein cysteinyl redox steady states, with an emphasis on light responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"fcf32a46b837aa747c873cca533a2ff20869401bb290f667c39e45b109c47c77","category":"Environment"}
