{"title":"Our perception may not be reality: A longitudinal study of the relationship between perceived and actual change in smoking behavior","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301515","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Astrid Juhl Andersen, Solène Wallez, Maria Melchior, Murielle Mary-Krause</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Results of the impact of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in cigarette smoking are mixed. Previous studies examining smoking changes during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 have mainly focused on smoker’s perception of changes in cigarette consumption. Such measure has not been widely used in other contexts, and therefore we aim to compare the discrepancy between smokers’ perceived changes in cigarette smoking and the actual change in the number of cigarettes smoked, using repeated measurements.</p> Methods <p>We included 134 smokers from the French TEMPO cohort with repeated measurements of their perceived changes in smoking habits during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of cigarettes smoked repeatedly from March to May 2020. We used generalized estimation equations (GEE) to examine the association between changes in the number of cigarettes smoked and the odds of mismatched answers.</p> Results <p>The results suggest that at each study wave, 27–45% of participants provided mismatching answers between their perceived change in smoking habits and the actual change in the number of cigarettes smoked daily, measured repeatedly. Results from GEE analysis demonstrated that a mismatching assessment of smoking behavior was elevated among those who had an increase (OR = 2.52 [1.37;4.65]) or a decrease (OR = 5.73 [3.27;10.03]) in number of cigarettes smoked.</p> Discussion <p>Our findings highlight the possibility of obtaining different results depending on how changes in tobacco smoking are measured. This highlights the risk of underestimating the actual changes in cigarette smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also more generally when validating public health interventions or smoking cessation programs. Therefore, objective measures such as the actual consumption of psychoactive substances should be utilized, preferably on a longitudinal basis, to mitigate recall bias.</p>","author":"Astrid Juhl Andersen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cd46cf7b38875e10b582a617cb6be7a04af7f87e962270dd6d35488052f774eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
