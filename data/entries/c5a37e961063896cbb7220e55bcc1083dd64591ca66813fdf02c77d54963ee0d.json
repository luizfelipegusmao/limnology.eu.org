{"title":"Morphological Diversity of Turtle Hyoid Apparatus is Linked to Feeding Behavior","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae014/7663569?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The hyoid apparatus of tetrapods is highly diverse in its morphology. It plays an important role in feeding, breathing, sound production, and various other behaviors. Among turtles, the diversity of the hyoid apparatus has been recurrently linked to their habitat. The ossification of the hyoid corpus is often the main trait used in correlations with “niche” occupancy, an ossified corpus being associated with aquatic environments and a cartilaginous corpus with terrestrial life. Most studies conducted so far have focused on species belonging to Testudinoidea, the clade that occupies the biggest diversity of habitats (i.e., terrestrial, semi-terrestrial, and aquatic animals), while other turtle lineages have been largely understudied. We assessed the adult anatomy of the hyoid apparatus of 92 turtle species from all “families”, together with ossification sequences from embryological series of 11 species, some described for the first time here. Using nearly 40 different discrete anatomical characters, we discuss the evolutionary patterns and the biological significance of morphological transformations in the turtle hyoid elements. Morphological changes are strongly associated to feeding modes, with several instances of convergent evolution within and outside the Testudines clade, and are not as strongly connected to habitat as previously thought. Some of the hyoid character states we describe are diagnostic of specific turtle clades, thus providing phylogenetically relevant information.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"c5a37e961063896cbb7220e55bcc1083dd64591ca66813fdf02c77d54963ee0d","category":"Environment"}
