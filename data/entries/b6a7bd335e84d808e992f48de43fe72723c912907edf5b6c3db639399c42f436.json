{"title":"Structural integrity of a submersible sea cage exposed to extreme oceanographic conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13052?af=R","date":1717392617000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study focuses on the structural integrity analyses of a submersible cage with dimensions of 20 m in diameter and 10 m depth under extreme oceanographic conditions, including current speed of 0.5 and 1 m/s, combined with waves ranging from 2 to 5 m in height and a period of 7 s. Employing a dynamic simulation model based on finite elements, The study examines the stresses in the cage's pipes, as well as the tension in the bridle lines and mooring lines. Results indicate that submerging the cage leads to a reduction in peak tensions, with mooring lines experiencing a decrease of up to 32% and bridle lines experiencing a decrease of up to 59%. Furthermore, the stresses in the pipes exhibit a significant decline of up to 71.4%. These findings demonstrate that the submersible cage, when submerged, significantly reduces peak stresses, thereby decreasing the risk of structural loss or damage when the system is submerged.</p>","author":"Jesús López, \nCarlos Felipe Hurtado, \nJean Pierre Toledo, \nGonzalo Suazo, \nVíctor Zamora, \nDante Queirolo, \nAlfonso Gutiérrez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"b6a7bd335e84d808e992f48de43fe72723c912907edf5b6c3db639399c42f436","category":"Environment"}
