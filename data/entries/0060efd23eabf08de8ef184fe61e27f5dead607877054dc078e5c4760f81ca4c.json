{"title":"Next generation blockchain technology: The Entropic Blockchain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1301/v1","date":1718787543000,"content":"Storage, transmission and processing of data become a significant problem when large digital data files or databases are involved, as in the case of decentralized online global databases such as blockchain. Here we propose a novel method that allows the scalability of digital assets, including blockchain databases in the download, validation and confidentiality process, by developing a lightweight blockchain technology called Entropic Blockchain. This is a computer-implemented mathematical method to generate an information-entropic numerical representation of a digital asset, which can be utilized on its own, or as an optically machine-readable entropic barcode, for data secure transmission, processing, labelling, identification, one-way encryption and compression, validation, and digital tamper-proof check.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0060efd23eabf08de8ef184fe61e27f5dead607877054dc078e5c4760f81ca4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
