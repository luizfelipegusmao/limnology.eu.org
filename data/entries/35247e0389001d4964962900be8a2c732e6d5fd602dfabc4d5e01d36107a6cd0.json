{"title":"Testing and Visualization of Associations in Three-Way Contingency Tables: A Study on Gender Gap in Patients with Type I Diabetes and Cardiovascular Complications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2146/v1","date":1717148149000,"content":"Using data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register, this study examines the gender disparity among patients with type I diabetes who have experienced a specific cardiovascular complication, while exploring the association between weight variability, age group, and gender. Fourteen cardiovascular complications have been considered. This analysis is conducted by using three-way correspondence analysis (CA) which allows for the partitioning and decomposition of Pearsonâ€™s three-way chi-squared statistic. The dataset comprises of information organized in a data cube, detailing how weight variability among these patients correlates with a cardiovascular complication, age group and gender. The three-way CA method presented in this paper allows for one to assess the statistical significance of the association between these variables and to visualize this association, highlighting the gender gap among these patients. It is worth noting that the association between weight variability, age group, and gender varies among different types of cardiovascular complications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35247e0389001d4964962900be8a2c732e6d5fd602dfabc4d5e01d36107a6cd0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
