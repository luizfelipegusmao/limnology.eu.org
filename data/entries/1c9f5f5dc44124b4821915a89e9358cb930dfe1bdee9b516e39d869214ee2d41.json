(fig) peels is a valuable and recyclable constituent that may bring huge economic benefits. To maximize the utilization of this resource, deep eutectic solvent (DES)-assisted extraction was applied to extract pectin from fig peels, and the extraction process was optimized with response surface methodology.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>When DES (choline chloride/oxalic acid = 1:1) content was 168.1 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, extraction temperature was 79.8 °C, liquid–solid ratio was 23.3 mL g<sup>−1</sup>, and extraction time was 120 min, the maximum yield of 239.6 g kg<sup>−1</sup> was obtained, which was almost twice the extraction of hot water. DES-extracted fig peel pectin (D-FP) exhibited better nature than hot water-extracted fig peel pectin (W-FP) in terms of uronic acid content, particle size distribution, and solubility, but lower molecular weight and esterification degree. D-FP and W-FP had similar infrared spectra and thermodynamic peaks but differed in monosaccharide compositions. D-FP also showed good antioxidant capacities and exhibited better functional activities than W-FP.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results indicated that D-FP was of promising quality being utilized in food or medical industries and the optimal DES-assisted extraction method might be applied as a sustainable process for the effective extraction of bioactive pectin from fig peels with the excellence of low equipment requirements and simple operation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hongzhi Liu, \nJihui Lin, \nYaowu Hu, \nHui Lei, \nQian Zhang, \nXiaoyu Tao, \nDan Zhang, \nHong Niu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1c9f5f5dc44124b4821915a89e9358cb930dfe1bdee9b516e39d869214ee2d41","category":"Environment"}
