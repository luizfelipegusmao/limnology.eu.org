{"title":"Heat Index: An Alternative Indicator for Measuring the Impacts of Meteorological Factors on Diarrhoea in the Climate Change Era: A Time-Series Study in Dhaka, Bangladesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0050/v1","date":1725260063000,"content":"Heat index (HI) is a biometeorological indicator that combines temperature and relative humidity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between heat index and daily counts of diarrhoea hospitalisation in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data on daily diarrhoea hospitalisations and meteorological variables from 1981–2010 were collected. We categorised heat index of &gt;94.3°F, &gt;100.7°F and &gt;105°F as high, very high and extremely high heat index, respectively. We applied time-series adjusted generalised linear model (GLM) with negative binomial distribution to investigate the effects of heat index and extreme heat index on hospitalisations for diarrhoea. Effects were assessed for all ages, &lt;5 children and by gender. A unit higher HI, and high, very high and extremely high HI were associated with 0.8%, 8%, 7% and 9% increase in diarrhoea hospitalisation in all ages, respectively. The effects varied slightly by gender and were most pronounced in &lt;5 children with a rise of 1°F in high, very high and extremely high HI associated with a 14.1% (95% CI: 11.3% – 17.0%), 18.3% (95% CI: 13.4% – 23.5%) and 18.1% (95% CI: 8.4% – 28.6%) increase of diarrhoea, respectively. This suggest that heat index may serve as an alternative indicator for measuring the combined effects temperature and humidity on diarrhoea.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9055b2b006d99dd413e2efd8bc41cec816cb1b57e23222d962f69ff9aac33ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
