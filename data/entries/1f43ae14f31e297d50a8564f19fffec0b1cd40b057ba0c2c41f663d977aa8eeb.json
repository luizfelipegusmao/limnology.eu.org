However, context and species-specific responses make it challenging to draw general conclusions about the most important components of landscapes that support diverse and abundant pollinator communities.\n\nIn this study, we took a functional-traits approach to community assembly and tested the hypothesis that landscape properties act most strongly on pollinators indirectly, through their influence on flowering plant communities. Using plant and pollinator data from 96 landscapes in Britain, we tested the associations between plant and pollinator communities and local environmental factors, such as habitat cover and configuration, using path analysis based on Mantel and partial Mantel statistics.\n\nWhen all pollinators were considered, we found that the environmental factors had stronger links to the composition of flowering plant communities than to the composition of pollinator communities. Further, the flowering plant community was strongly linked to the pollinator community suggesting a mediating role between land use and pollinators. When separating the pollinator community into taxonomic groups, we found the same result for hoverflies, but wild bees were linked to both environmental factors and flowering plants.\n\nWe further explored these links with structural equation models using the response-effect trait framework as a guiding principle. We found strong evidence that land-use composition and configuration influence the trait distribution and functional diversity of the pollinator community via plant community composition.\n\nThese findings suggest that the indirect effect of land use on pollinators via flowering plants should be considered in informing the design of pollinator friendly landscapes and in future research of the effects of land use and management on wild pollinators.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/09/20/flowering-plant-types-influence-how-land-management-impacts-insect-pollinators/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Mark A.
