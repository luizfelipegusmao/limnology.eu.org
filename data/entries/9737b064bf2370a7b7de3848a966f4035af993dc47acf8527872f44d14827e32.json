Despite evidence that support faith-based organizationsâ€™ (FBOs) partnerships with public health agencies (PHAs) to increase vaccine confidence, reviews on the scope and efforts to ensure equitable vaccination delivery for ethnoracially minoritized populations are scarce. We aimed to understand how public health agencies collaborate with FBOs or faith communities to improve vaccine confidence among minoritized communities in high-, low- and middle- income countries. We conducted a scoping review by searching OVID MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), SCOPUS, and PROQUEST from 2011 to 2023. We included case studies, news reports, observational studies, experimental, and quasi-experimental studies and multimedia content that describes PHA-FBO partnerships that created vaccine initiatives for marginalized and minoritized communities. The data was extracted, summarized, and results were described narratively. We included 167 initiatives reported in 160 publications; 83.8% of the included articles were published between 2019 to 2023. The interventions carried out by PHA-FBO partnerships attempted to increase vaccine uptake using any or all the following methods. First, the initiatives provided digital and in-person platforms for interfaith learning and established training programs to empower faith leaders to become vaccine ambassadors. Second, the initiatives designed and disseminated education and awareness materials that aimed to be sensitive to religious and gender norms. Third, PHA-FBO partnered to apply equity and faith-based frameworks and provided wrap-around support to enable equitable vaccine access. Majority of the initiatives reported that PHA-FBO partnerships improved vaccine confidence and uptake (71.3%). About 22.2% of the initiatives reported quantitative outcomes post-intervention. PHA-FBO initiatives over the past decade increased vaccine uptake and acceptance among diverse ethnoracially minoritized populations. Reporting of faith-based initiatives are subject to publication bias and can be strengthened by examining more evaluation studies and establishment of key outcome indicators to critically appraise intervention outcomes.","author":"Melodie Yunju Song","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"9737b064bf2370a7b7de3848a966f4035af993dc47acf8527872f44d14827e32","category":"Environment"}
