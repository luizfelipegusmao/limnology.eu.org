{"title":"Tricetin suppresses the cell migration and BMP‐6 expression through p38 signaling pathways in human retinal pigment epithelium cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24294?af=R","date":1713934420000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a visual-threatening disease, which cause from the migration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Tricetin, a family of flavonoids, can inhibit the metastasis of several cancers. Herein, we aim to evaluate the possible effect of tricetin on inhibiting ARPE-19 cells migration. The Boyden chamber assay, wound healing assay, RNA sequencing, and Western blot analysis were applied in our experiment. The results revealed that tricetin inhibited the cell migration abilities of ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, using RNA sequencing technology, we revealed that tricetin repressed bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) gene expressions in ARPE-19 cells. Overexpression of BMP-6 resulted in significant restoration of cell migration capabilities of tricetin-treated ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, tricetin suppressed the phosphorylation of the p38 signaling pathway. Moreover, blocking the p38 pathway also inhibits BMP-6 expression and migration in the ARPE-19 cells. In conclusion, this study revealed that tricetin inhibits the ARPE-19 cell migration mainly via the suppression of BMP-6 expression and p38 signaling pathway.</p>","author":"Hsiang‐Wen Chien, \nChih‐Chun Chuang, \nYi‐Hsien Hsieh, \nChia‐Yi Lee, \nNuo‐Yi Yu, \nShun‐Fa Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"f2b358f239b85d5fec4edcfe93103037536f0d9febe9d60f9715765d56fa6395","category":"Environment"}
