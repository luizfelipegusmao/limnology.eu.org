{"title":"How Does Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSM 34246 var. boulardii Supplementation Impact the Well-Being of Healthy Adult Dogs?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1640/v1","date":1729583524000,"content":"Background: a supplement containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSM 34246 (Canobios-BL) var. boulardii was tested to demonstrate its efficacy as a gut flora stabilizer in two breed of dogs, West Highland White Terrier (WT) and German Shepherd (GS). Methods: a total of 53 healthy adult dogs, 28 WT and 25 GS, were included in the study. The animals were randomly assigned to a control group (CTR: WT 14/28, GS 12/25) and to a treated group (SACC; WT 14/28, GS 13/25). The CTR Group was fed with dry commercial food, while the SACC one was fed with the same food but supplemented with the feed additive S. boulardii at the concentration of 5 X 109 CFU/kg. The study lasted 35 days and included six evaluation time points (T0-T5). Body Weight (BW), Body Condition Score (BCS), Fecal Score (FS), FS measured with a penetrometer (FSp), Fecal Dry matter (DM), Fecal Humidity (UM) and Fecal IgA (IgA) were measured at each time point. Results: a significant improvement (p&lt;0.05) in BCS, FS, FSp, MCS, DM, UM and IgA of the treated group with respect to the control one for both WT and GS were reported. Conclusions: the positive effect of S. boulardii supplementation on the improvement of the fecal parameters and on the maintenance of good physiological as well as biological conditions in healthy adult dogs in breeding conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d8e3aeaab6e5ac02f59194ed17362ee528171d908e4eab30a9005fdc18ca5bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
