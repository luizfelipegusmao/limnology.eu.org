{"title":"Harnessing artificial intelligence‐driven industrial robotics for sustainability: Insights from leading green economies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12492?af=R","date":1715929506000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In 2023, global temperatures witnessed an alarming escalation, reaching an unprecedented 1.46°C above preindustrial levels, marking it as the hottest year on record. Simultaneously, atmospheric carbon dioxide surpassed 420 ppm, exceeding a stability maintained for over 6000 years by more than double. This troubling surge in CO<sub>2</sub> intensifies global warming, leading to an increased frequency of extreme weather events and contributing to 24% of global deaths attributed to environmental concerns. These alarming environmental challenges demand urgent attention and the implementation of innovative policies. Responding to this imperative, the study examines the impact of artificial intelligence-based industrial robotics (AIIR) and other control variables such as green energy, green finance, and green energy investment on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in economies supporting green initiatives, including Canada, Denmark, China, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Using monthly data from 2008 to 2021 and a novel nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag approach, the results indicate that AIIR significantly reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the sample economies. Additionally, green energy, green finance, and green energy investment also significantly decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The study's outcomes bear policy implications for decision-makers in the sampled economies, offering tangible insights for effective environmental management.</p>","author":"Lingli Qing, \nMuhammad Shahbaz, \nMuhammad Saeed Meo, \nYasir Jamshed, \nLikun Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"0ce75913dab3b9b367f7a4aacd0ec2d8357429b6e07fb46e938faa372e8e3bd5","category":"Environment"}
