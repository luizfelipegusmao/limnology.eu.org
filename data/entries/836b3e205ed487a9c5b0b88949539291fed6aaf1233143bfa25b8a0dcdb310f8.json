{"title":"OXIDOSQUALENE CYCLASE 1 and 2 influence triterpene biosynthesis and defense in Nicotiana attenuata","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2580/7474661?rss=1","date":1702598400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Triterpenes are a class of bioactive compounds with diverse biological functions, playing pivotal roles in plant defense against biotic stressors. Oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) serve as gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of triterpenes. In this study, we utilized a <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> heterologous expression system to characterize NaOSC1 from <span>Nicotiana attenuata</span> as a multifunctional enzyme capable of synthesizing lupeol, dammarenediol II, 3-alpha,20-lupanediol, and 7 other triterpene scaffolds. We also demonstrated that NaOSC2 is, in contrast, a selective enzyme, producing only the Î²-amyrin scaffold. Through virus-induced gene silencing and in vitro toxicity assays, we elucidated the roles of NaOSC1 and NaOSC2 in the defense of <span>N. attenuata</span> against <span>Manduca sexta</span> larvae. Metabolomic and feature-based molecular network analyses of leaves with silenced <span>NaOSC1</span> and <span>NaOSC2</span> unveiled 3 potential triterpene glycoside metabolite clusters. Interestingly, features identified as triterpenes within these clusters displayed a significant negative correlation with larval mass. Our study highlights the pivotal roles of NaOSC1 and NaOSC2 from <span>N. attenuata</span> in the initial steps of triterpene biosynthesis, subsequently influencing defense against <span>M. sexta</span> through the modulation of downstream triterpene glycoside compounds.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"836b3e205ed487a9c5b0b88949539291fed6aaf1233143bfa25b8a0dcdb310f8","category":"Environment"}
