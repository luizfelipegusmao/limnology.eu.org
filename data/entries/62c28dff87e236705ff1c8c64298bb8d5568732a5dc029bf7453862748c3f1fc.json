{"title":"Exploring Pattern of Relapse in Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant Using Machine Learning Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1116/v1","date":1715872694000,"content":"In this report, we present a study demonstrating how machine learning methods can reveal the interaction of different risk factors of post-transplant leukemic relapse and obtain robust predictions even with a modest clinical dataset. Using a cohort of 63 pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 46 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent stem cell transplant at a single institution, we built predictive models of leukemic relapse with both pretransplant and posttransplant patient variables (specifically lineage-specific chimerism) using the random forest classifier. The random forest classifier revealed different important predictive factors between ALL and AML in our relapse models consistent with previous knowledge.  Furthermore, it also distinguished donor CD34 chimerism as most impactful in relapse prediction compare to donor chimerism of other cellular lineages in our dataset for ALL but CD3 for AML.  Our models greatly improved sensitivity and specificity at predicting relapses in cross validation compared to a reference model based on our own institutional incidence of relapse and inferential statistical principles.  Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, an interpretable machine learning tool, confirmed our Random Forest Classification result and provided an intuitive explanation of how our machine learning models made the relapse prediction for each individual patient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62c28dff87e236705ff1c8c64298bb8d5568732a5dc029bf7453862748c3f1fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
