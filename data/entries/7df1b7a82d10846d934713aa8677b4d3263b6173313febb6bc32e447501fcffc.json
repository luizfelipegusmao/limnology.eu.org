{"title":"BSMV-Mediated Assays for Oat Functional Genomics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1442/v1","date":1721316517000,"content":"Herbicide-resistant weed populations in numerous cropping systems pose a significant threat to global food security by reducing crop yields and increasing production costs. Multiple herbicide-resistant (MHR) Avena fatua L. (wild oat) plants with non-target site resistance (NTSR) mechanisms can express resistance to herbicides without previous exposure and are thus particularly troubling. Although precise molecular mechanisms for resistance to five different mechanisms of action are not clear, numerous transcription factors and stress-related proteins are preferentially subjected to constitutive post-translational modifications (PTMs) in MHR plants. Transient assays to quickly assess if changes to specific genes can change the MHR response will facilitate the development of new strategies to manage MHR weeds. Our study showed that the Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV) mediated system can be an option for A sa-tiva (cultivated oat) and A. fatua (wild oat) functional analysis. The inoculation efficiency of this system ranged from 48% to 100%. Its efficacy was demonstrated by successfully knocking down phy-toene desaturase (PDS) expression and overexpressing green fluo-rescent protein (GFP), suggesting its potential for oat functional genomics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7df1b7a82d10846d934713aa8677b4d3263b6173313febb6bc32e447501fcffc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
