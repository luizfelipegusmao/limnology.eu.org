{"title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Gallium(III) Compounds: Pathogen-Dependent Targeting of Multiple Iron/Heme-Dependent Biological Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0001/v1","date":1722472839000,"content":"Metals play vital roles in biological systems, with iron/heme being essential for cellular and metabolic functions necessary for survival and/or virulence in many bacterial pathogens. Given the rise of bacterial resistance to current antibiotics, there is an urgent need for the development of non-toxic and novel antibiotics that do not contribute to resistance to other antibiotics. Gallium, which mimics iron, has emerged as a promising antimicrobial agent, offering a novel approach to combat bacterial infections. Gallium does not have any known functions in biological systems. Gallium exerts its effects primarily by replacing iron in redox enzymes, effectively inhibiting bacterial growth by targeting multiple iron/heme-dependent biological processes and suppressing the development of drug resistance. The aim of this review is to highlight recent findings on the mechanisms of action of gallium and provide further insights into the development of gallium-based compounds. Understanding the mechanisms underlying galliumâ€™s biological activities will enhance its therapeutic application across various medical fields, offering promising avenues for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, and inflammatory conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4d13aa6fcfe2bb036e416acd3c247e40d2c199f64dfa257eaa9aee577c447ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
