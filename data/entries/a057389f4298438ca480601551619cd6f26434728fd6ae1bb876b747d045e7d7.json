{"title":"Differential Diagnosis of Solid Pancreatic Lesions Using Detective Flow Imaging Endoscopic Ultrasonography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1795/v1","date":1711685857000,"content":"Differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) using B-mode endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is challenging. Detective flow imaging (DFI) offers the potential for detecting low-flow vessels in the pancreas, thus enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This study aimed to investigate DFI-EUS findings of SPLs and analyze their differential diagnostic accuracy for pancreatic cancer. This retrospective study included patients with pathologically confirmed SPLs who underwent EUS between April 2021 and June 2023. Expert endosonographers, blinded to the patientsâ€™ clinical data, evaluated images obtained through B-mode, eFLOW, and DFI-EUS. Frame rate and vessel detection sensitivity between eFLOW and DFI were compared, and diagnostic criteria for pancreatic cancer were established. This study included 104 patients, most diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. DFI-EUS demonstrated a significantly higher vessel visualization rate (96%) in SPLs compared to eFLOW (27%). Additionally, DFI showed a superior frame rate, sensitivity (99%), and accuracy (88%) in detecting pancreatic cancer, although with a modest specificity (43%). On DFI-EUS, characteristics such as hypovascular, peritumoral, or spotty vessel findings were suggestive of pancreatic cancer. DFI-EUS significantly improved the visualization of vascular structures within the SPLs, highlighting its efficacy as a diagnostic modality for pancreatic cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a057389f4298438ca480601551619cd6f26434728fd6ae1bb876b747d045e7d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
