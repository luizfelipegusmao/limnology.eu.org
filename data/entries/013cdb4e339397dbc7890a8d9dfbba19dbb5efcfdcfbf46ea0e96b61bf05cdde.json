{"title":"Therapeutic Effects of Plant Anthocyanin Against Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Modulate Gut Health, Short-Chain Fatty Acids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1532/v1","date":1713885661000,"content":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and neurogenerative diseases (NDDs), which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The number of AD patients is over 55 million according to 2020 Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI) and the number is increasing drastically without any effective cure. In this review, we discuss and analyze the potential role of anthocyanins (ACNs) against AD with understanding the molecular mechanisms. ACNs have been reported as having neuroprotective effects by mitigating cognitive impairments, apoptotic markers, neuroinflammation, aberrant amyloidogenesis, and tauopathy.  Taken together, ACNs could be the therapeutic agent for combating or delaying the onset of AD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"013cdb4e339397dbc7890a8d9dfbba19dbb5efcfdcfbf46ea0e96b61bf05cdde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
