{"title":"Dalbergia odorifera undergoes massive molecular shifts in response to waterlogging combined with salinity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2301/7458365?rss=1","date":1701648000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Field and greenhouse studies attempting to describe the molecular responses of plant species under waterlogging (WL) combined with salinity (ST) are almost nonexistent. We integrated transcriptional, metabolic, and physiological responses involving several crucial transcripts and common differentially expressed genes and metabolites in fragrant rosewood (<span>Dalbergia odorifera</span>) leaflets to dissect plant-specific molecular responses and patterns under WL combined with ST (SWL). We discovered that the synergistic pattern of the transcriptional response of fragrant rosewood under SWL was exclusively characterized by the number of regulated transcripts. The response patterns under SWL based on transcriptome and metabolome regulation statuses revealed different patterns (additive, dominant, neutral, minor, unilateral, and antagonistic) of transcripts or metabolites that were commonly regulated or expressed uniquely under SWL. Under SWL, the synergistic transcriptional response of several functional gene subsets was positively associated with several metabolomic and physiological responses related to the shutdown of the photosynthetic apparatus and the extensive degradation of starch into saccharides through α-amylase, β-amylase, and α-glucosidase or plastoglobuli accumulation. The dissimilarity between the regulation status and number of transcripts in plants under combined stresses led to nonsynergistic responses in several physiological and phytohormonal traits. As inferred from the impressive synergistic transcriptional response to morpho-physiological changes, combined stresses exhibited a gradually decreasing effect on the changes observed at the molecular level compared to those in the morphological one. Here, by characterizing the molecular responses and patterns of plant species under SWL, our study considerably improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying combined stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"49bc99a9bcc31e4c3d6abe4d410bc8fedd95d98d3087ec95e8d992c08591c13d","category":"Environment"}
