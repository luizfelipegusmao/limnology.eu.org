{"title":"Abortion Incidence among Young Women in Urban Slums and Non-Slums in Kinshasa, DR Congo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0229/v1","date":1717589099000,"content":"Background: Worldwide, around 73 million induced abortions take place every year. Of these, 45% are unsafe and can lead to complications. The evolution of the legal and practical landscape of abortion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) over the last few years necessitates a re-examination of the experience of induced abortion, leading this study to measure the incidence of abortion among young women (15 to 29 years of age), as well as the heterogeneity of this problem according to the residence of these young women (slum vs. non-slum areas). Methodology: We used representative survey data on women aged 15–49 in Kinshasa, collected from December 2021 to April 2022. The survey included questions about the respondents’ and their closest confidants’ experience of induced abortion, including the methods and sources used. We estimated abortion incidence and heterogeneity over one year based on residence in the city of Kinshasa according to sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The incidence rate of induced abortion among the confidants (close friends) in 2021 was 131.5 per 1000 (95% CI: IQR 99.4–163.6). These rates were significantly higher than the corresponding estimates of those surveyed. The incidence of induced abortion was 24.4 per 1000 (95% CI: 15.8–32.9) abortions per 1000 women among the respondents. The incidence rates of induced abortion were much higher among the respondents residing in slums than among those residing in non-slums (29.2 vs. 13.0 per 1000; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: More precise estimates of the incidence of abortion indicate that the incidence rate of abortion was higher among young women residing in slums, who were unmarried and had no children. These incidences were higher among confidants than among respondents. There is still a lot of work to be done to fulfill the obligations outlined in the Maputo Protocol. This includes establishing easily accessible services that offer complete abortion care with a focus on women's needs, particularly in slum areas. The aim is to decrease the occurrence of unsafe abortions and their associated effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d3928e5580eb1af204f882c72a8c8e33c283f2983507ff9a0b52f43fbaaf210","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
