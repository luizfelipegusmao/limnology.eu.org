{"title":"Predictors and experiences of seeking abortion services from pharmacies in Nepal","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003144","date":1715263200000,"content":"<p>by Leila Harrison, Mahesh Puri, Diana Greene Foster, Sunita Karkia, Nadia G. Diamond-Smith</p>\r\n\r\nAbortion was legalized in Nepal in 2002; however, despite evidence of safety and quality provision of medical abortion (MA) pills by pharmacies in Nepal and elsewhere, it is still not legal for pharmacists to provide medication abortion in Nepal. However, pharmacies often do provide MA, but little is known about who seeks abortions from pharmacies and their experiences and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to understand the experiences of women seeking MA from a pharmacy, abortion complications experienced, and predictors for denial of MA. Data was collected from women seeking MA from four pharmacies in two districts of Nepal in 2021â€“2022. Data was collected at baseline (N = 153) and 6 weeks later (N = 138). Using descriptive results and multi-variable regression models, we explore differences between women who received and did not receive MA and predictors of denial of services. Most women requesting such pills received MA (78%), with those who were denied most commonly reporting denial due to the provider saying they were too far along. There were few socio-demographic differences between groups, with the exception of education and gestational age. Women reported receiving information on how to take pills and what to do about side effects. Just under half (45%) of women who took pills reported no adverse symptoms after taking them and only 13% sought care. Most women seeking MA from pharmacists in Nepal are receiving services, information, and having few post-abortion symptoms. This study expands the previous limited research on pharmacy provision of MA in Nepal using a unique dataset that recruits women at the time of abortion seeking and follows them over time, overcoming potential biases present in other study designs. This suggests that expansion of the law to allow pharmacy distribution would increase accessibility and reflect current practice.","author":"Leila Harrison","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"7336f6cec2380d9e23d614ab676e6ca4293b1a6e36fc9ee591dc24f994409e41","category":"Environment"}
