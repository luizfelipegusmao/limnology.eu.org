{"title":"The Computational Universe: EPR Paradox and Pre-Measure Reality, Actual Time in Spacetime, Free Will and the Classical Limit Problem in Quantum Loop Gravity, Causal Dynamical Triangulation and Holographic Principle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0785/v1","date":1710335354000,"content":"The Simulation analogy presented in this work enhances the accessibility of abstract quantum theories, specifically the stochastic hydrodyanimc model (SQHM), by relating them to our daily experiences. The SQHM incorporates the influence of fluctuating gravitational background, resembling dark energy, into quantum equations. This model successfully addresses key aspects of Objective-Collapse Theories, including resolving the 'tails' problem through the definition of quantum potential length in addition to the De Broglie length, beyond which coherent Schr√∂dinger quantum behavior and wavefunction tails cannot be maintained. The SQHM emphasizes that an external environment is unnecessary, asserting that the quantum stochastic behavior leading to wave-function collapse can be an inherent property of a system in a spacetime with fluctuating metrics. Embedded in relativistic quantum mechanics, the theory establishes a coherent link between the uncertainty principle and the constancy of light speed, aligning seamlessly with finite information transmission speed. Within a fluctuating quantum system, the SQHM derives the indeterminacy relation between energy and time, offering insights into measurement processes impossible within a finite time interval in a truly quantum global system. Experimental validation is found in confirming the Lindemann constant for solid lattice melting points and the   transition from fluid to superfluid states. The SQHM's self-consistency lies in its ability to describe wavefunction collapse and the measure process. Additionally, the theory resolves the Pre-existing Reality problem by showing that large-scale systems naturally decay into decoherent states stable in time. Continuing, the paper demonstrates that the physical dynamics of SQHM can be analogized to a computer simulation employing optimization procedures for realization. This perspective elucidates the concept of time in contemporary reality and enriches our comprehension of free will. The overall framework introduces an irreversible process impacting the manifestation of macroscopic reality at the present time, asserting that the multiverse exists solely in future states, with the past comprising the formed universe after the current moment. Decoherence at the present time functions as a reduction of the multiverse to a single universe. The macroscopic reality, characterized by fractal consistency where microscopic domains with quantum properties coexist, provides insights into how our consciousness apprehends dynamic reality, the spontaneous emergence of gravity in discrete spacetime evolution, and the attainment of the classical General Relativity limit in Quantum Loop Gravity and Causal Dynamical Triangulation. The Simulation Analogy highlights a strategy focused on minimizing information processing, facilitating the universal simulation in solving its predetermined problem. From within, reality becomes the manifestation of specific physical laws emerging from the inherent structure of the simulation devised to address its particular issue. In this context, the reality simulation appears to employ an entropic optimization strategy, minimizing information loss while efficiently compressing data in line with the simulation's intended purpose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fa3031fc6474909cf365a7a29d3e1ba9d1aca3277c58d18fc6f41973843e0c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
