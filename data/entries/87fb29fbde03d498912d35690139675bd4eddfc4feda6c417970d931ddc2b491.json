{"title":"Progress in culture technology and active substance research on Nostoc sphaeroides Kützing","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13749?af=R","date":1722502126000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Nostoc sphaeroides</i> Kützing is a freshwater edible cyanobacterium that is rich in active substances such as polysaccharides, proteins and lipids; it has a variety of pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and cholesterol-lowering effects; and is often used as a traditional Chinese medicine with many potential applications in food, cosmetics, medical diagnostics and disease treatment. However, to meet the needs of different fields, such as medicine, there is an urgent need for basic research and technological innovation in culture technology, extraction and preparation of active substances, and the pharmacological mechanism of <i>N. sphaeroides</i>. This paper reviews the pharmacological effects of <i>N. sphaeroides</i> active substances, discusses current culture techniques and methods for extracting active components, and outlines the challenges encountered in cultivating and industrializing <i>N. sphaeroides</i> while discussing future development trends. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fengcheng Li, \nRunze Liu, \nSong Qin, \nZhongyang Deng, \nWenjun Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"87fb29fbde03d498912d35690139675bd4eddfc4feda6c417970d931ddc2b491","category":"Environment"}
