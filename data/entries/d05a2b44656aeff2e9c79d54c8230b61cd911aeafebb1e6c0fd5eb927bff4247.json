{"title":"The Controversial Role of Ubiquitin-Conjugatin Enzyme E2 O (UBE2O) in Human Leukemias and Solid Tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0916/v1","date":1720666340000,"content":"Protein degradation is a biological phenomena essential for cellular homeostasis and survivor. Selective protein degradation is performed by the ubiquitination system which selectively target proteins that need to be eliminated and lead them to proteasome degradation. In this review, we focus on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 O (UBE2O) and highlight the role of UBE2O in many biological and physiological process. We further discuss the UBE2O implications in various human diseases, particularly in leukemias and solid cancers and suggest how UBE2O targeting could be novel strategy in the treatment of different human neoplasia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d05a2b44656aeff2e9c79d54c8230b61cd911aeafebb1e6c0fd5eb927bff4247","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
