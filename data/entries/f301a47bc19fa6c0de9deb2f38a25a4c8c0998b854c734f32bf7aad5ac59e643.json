{"title":"Enhancing Facial Expression Recognition through Light Field Cameras","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0486/v1","date":1723014661000,"content":"In this paper, we study facial expression recognition (FER) using three modalities obtained from the Light Field camera; sub-aperture (SA), depth map, and all-in-focus (AiF) images. Our objective is to construct a more comprehensive and effective FER system by investigating multimodal fusion strategies. For this purpose, we employ EfficientNetV2-S, pre-trained on AffectNet, as our primary convolutional neural network. This model, combined with a BiGRU, is used to process SA images. We evaluate various fusion techniques at both decision and feature levels to assess their effectiveness in enhancing FER accuracy. Our findings show that the model using SA images surpasses state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.13% ± 7.42% accuracy under the subject-specific evaluation protocol and 91.88% ± 3.25% under the subject-independent evaluation protocol. These results highlight our model's potential in enhancing FER accuracy and robustness, outperforming existing methods.\nFurthermore, our multimodal fusion approach, integrating SA, AiF and depth images, demonstrates substantial improvements over unimodal models. The decision-level fusion strategy, particularly using average weights, proved most effective, achieving 90.13% ± 4.95% accuracy under the subject-specific evaluation protocol and 93.33% ± 4.92% under the subject-independent evaluation protocol. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of each modality, resulting in a more comprehensive and accurate FER system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f301a47bc19fa6c0de9deb2f38a25a4c8c0998b854c734f32bf7aad5ac59e643","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
