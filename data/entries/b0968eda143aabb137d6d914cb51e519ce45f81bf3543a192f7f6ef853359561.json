{"title":"Preparation and Properties of a Novel Nylon 6 Co-polymerized by &epsilon;-Caprolactam and &alpha;-Amino-&epsilon;-Caprolactam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1185/v1","date":1713435804000,"content":"In this study, we successfully synthesized a novel branched polyamide 6 with ε-caprolactam(CPL) and α-Amino-ε-caprolactam(ACL) through hydrolytic ring-open co-polymerization. The NMR characterization and rheological test result proved the existence of branched chain structure additionally. The branched chain structure caused a remarkable enhancement in the rheological properties. The met index(MFR),zero shear rate viscosity and storage modulus at low frequency region had a remarkable increase.The shear thinning phenomenon became more obvious. The thermal properties test determined by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) showed that the melting point and crystallinity of co-polymers decreased with the increase of ACL addition.However, the crystal structure of the samples remained unchanged. The appropriate addition amount of ACL can improve the tensile mechanical properties of the co-polymers. When the amount of ACL was 1%, the tensile strength and fracture elongation rate of the co-polymers had the most significant increase.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0968eda143aabb137d6d914cb51e519ce45f81bf3543a192f7f6ef853359561","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
