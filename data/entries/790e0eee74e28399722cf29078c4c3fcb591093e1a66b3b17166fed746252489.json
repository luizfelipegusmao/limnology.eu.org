This soil undergoes significant changes in performance under cyclic loading and freeze-thaw cycles. To effectively design and construct highways in these regions, it is crucial to understand the impact of various factors on the deformation characteristics and mechanical properties of subgrade soil. This study aims to investigate the influence of freeze-thaw cycles, water content, confining pressure, and loading rate on the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of subgrade soil under cyclic loading conditions. Experimental tests were conducted to analyze the deformation characteristics and mechanical properties of the subgrade soil. The test results revealed the following: 1) Dynamic loading leads to a noticeable decrease in the strength of subgrade soil, resulting in a softening effect on the stress-strain curve. The cumulative strain of the soil is positively correlated with the number of freeze-thaw cycles and water content, while negatively correlated with confining pressure. The final cumulative strain remains below 1%. 2) The failure stress of subgrade soil decreases exponentially with an increase in freeze-thaw cycles, dropping from 224.52 kPa to 196.76 kPa. 3) An increase in water content linearly decreases the failure stress of subgrade soil, ranging from 377.1 kPa to 151.5 kPa. 4) Confining pressure exhibits a linearly increasing relationship with the failure stress of subgrade soil, ranging from 151.6 kPa to 274.5 kPa. 5) The failure stress of subgrade soil demonstrates a linear increase with the loading rate, ranging from 200.46 kPa to 210.62 kPa. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and construction of highways in seasonal frozen areas. They also offer guidance for preventing and mitigating subgrade freeze-thaw issues in the future.","author":"Dongwei Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"790e0eee74e28399722cf29078c4c3fcb591093e1a66b3b17166fed746252489","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
