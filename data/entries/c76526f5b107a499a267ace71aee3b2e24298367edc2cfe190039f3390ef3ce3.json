{"title":"Records of Wild Mammals Run Over on a Road in Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2293/v1","date":1727588872000,"content":"No data on wild mammals run over along the roads in Osijek-Baranja County, in the north-eastern part of Croatia, have been available so far. Mammals run over from 2016 to 2024 on the Zmajevac-Osijek road, 33.4-km long, were recorded using the road sampling method while travelling back and forth from Zmajevac to Osijek. A total of 86 run-over specimens of wild mammals, classified into eight species and one subspecies, were recorded. The northern white-breasted hedgehog, Erinaceus roumanicus, topped the list with 38 individuals, followed by the European badger, Meles meles, with 23 individuals. Together, these two species amounted to 70.93% of the run-over mammal fauna. Other species and subspecies were recorded in lower numbers. The number of wild mammals run over per kilometer of the observed road section was on the rise from 0.09 to 0.20 in the period from 2016 to 2022, while in 2023 it increased to 0.77 and in 2024 to 0.86. The high proportion of run over wildlife per kilometer is likely due to the high volume of traffic, which disrupts wildlife activities during both day and night.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c76526f5b107a499a267ace71aee3b2e24298367edc2cfe190039f3390ef3ce3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
