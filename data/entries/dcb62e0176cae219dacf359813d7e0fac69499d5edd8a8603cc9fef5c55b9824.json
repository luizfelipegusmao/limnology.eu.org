{"title":"Analysis of Intensity Limits for Light Emitting Diodes Used in Toys and Consequences for Children's Visual Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0170/v2","date":1710341653000,"content":"The analysis of the current safety standards for electric toys showed that the normative intensity limits for visible light emitted by LEDs integrated in toys are overestimated. These limits were originally set in a scientific article published in 2012 that was adapted into the international safety standard published in 2017, and into the subsequent European and national standards, all published in 2020. The overestimation of the intensity limits results from several errors made in the original article. Accordingly, the current normative intensity limits for visible light used in toys do not protect the childrenâ€™s eyes against adverse effects of exposure to high intensity LEDs which may compromise their visual health. Updating the safety standards for electric toys using a method based on robust scientific data is recommended to protect children's visual health and ensure their long-term well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcb62e0176cae219dacf359813d7e0fac69499d5edd8a8603cc9fef5c55b9824","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
