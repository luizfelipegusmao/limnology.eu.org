However, during harvesting, the root is inevitably damaged. The wounding triggers an oxidative burst and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which leads to deterioration of the root (<a href=\"#kiae294-B6\">Zainuddin et al. 2018</a>). Such postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) limits the consumption of cassava. Understanding the PPD mechanism will help develop strategies to increase the shelf life of cassava storage root after harvesting.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b4421333f936e1820ec3201486ae77f5ac577a76b31234346fbc3a998cc58515","category":"Environment"}
