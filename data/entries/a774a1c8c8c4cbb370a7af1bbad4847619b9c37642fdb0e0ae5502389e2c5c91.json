{"title":"A Systematic Review of AI-Driven Prediction of Fabric Properties and Handfeel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1549/v1","date":1726754090000,"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the textile industry by improving the prediction of fabric properties and handfeel, which are essential for assessing textile quality and performance. However, the practical application and translation of AI-predicted results into real-world textile production remain unclear, posing challenges for widespread adoption. This paper systematically reviews AI-driven techniques for predicting these characteristics by focusing on model mechanisms, dataset diversity, and prediction accuracy. Among 811 papers initially identified, 26 were selected for in-depth analysis through both bibliometric and content analysis. The review categorizes and evaluates various AI approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid models, across different types of fabric. Despite significant advances, challenges remain, such as ensuring model generalization and managing complex fabric behavior. Future research should focus on developing more robust models, integrating sustainability, and refining feature extraction techniques. This review highlights the critical gaps in the literature and provides practical insights to enhance AI-driven prediction of fabric properties, thus guiding future textile innovations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a774a1c8c8c4cbb370a7af1bbad4847619b9c37642fdb0e0ae5502389e2c5c91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
