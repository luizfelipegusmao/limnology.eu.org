{"title":"Etonogestrel-releasing subdermal contraceptive implant: Budget impact analysis based on the Brazilian private healthcare system","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301207","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Agnaldo Lopes da Silva Filho, Ricardo Luis Pereira Bueno, Yohanna Ramires, Lara Marina Cruz Lino</p>\r\n\r\nHigh rates of unplanned pregnancies persist despite pharmacological developments and advancements in contraceptive methods. Here, we demonstrate that the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal contraceptive implant (IMP-ETN) may be an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs) for women in Brazil. For our pharmacoeconomic analysis, we reviewed the literature on IMP-ETN regarding its acceptance, eligibility criteria, choice, relations with age, adverse events and, finally, the unmet need in the fee-for-service private healthcare sector. We considered qualitative observations in combination with quantitative analysis and performed a deterministic sensitivity analysis to investigate whether this technology can be self-sustainable over a period of five years. The target population for this analysis comprised 158,696 women. Compared with the continued use of LNG-IUSs, adopting the IMP-ETN can result in a cost avoidance of $ 7.640.804,02 in the first year and $ 82,455,254.43 in five years. Disseminating information among physicians will promote this change and strengthen the potential cost avoided by private health system payers. These savings can be used to improve other healthcare programs and strategies. Moreover, the principles of care can be promoted by improving and adapting healthcare systems and expanding treatment and follow-up strategies. This would also provide support to womenâ€™s reproductive rights and improve their quality of life. Our results suggest that the IMP-ETN has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile. Given all its advantages and negative incremental cost impact over a period of five years, the IMP-ETN may be a more favorable alternative to LNG-IUSs. Therefore, it should be offered to beneficiaries with a private healthcare plan. This analysis overcomes previous barriers to the use of cost-benefit models, and our results may help balance decision-making by policymakers, technical consultants, and researchers.","author":"Agnaldo Lopes da Silva Filho","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"edae859c294271bdb4fbcd305c8587e1027b5e183ddd9908d2d0e9312c144bfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
