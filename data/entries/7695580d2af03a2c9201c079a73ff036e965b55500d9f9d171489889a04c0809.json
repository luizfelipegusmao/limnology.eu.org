It is a serious complication occurring in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients which increases morbidity and mortality rate. Sarcopenia is diagnosed when loss of both compartments - muscle strength and skeletal muscle quality or quantity are present. However, there are still numerous patients, also with CKD, diagnosed as pre-sarcopenic individuals with low muscle strength and normal skeletal muscle quality or quantity and conversely, with correct muscle strength and decreased skeletal muscle mass, who are prone to develop sarcopenia in future life. It is crucial to examine numerous variables possibly associated with changes of skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength in terms of preventing the development of sarcopenia. The aim of the study was to investigate anthropometric and clinical correlates and sources of variation in both skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength in advanced stages of CKD. Methods The study sample consisted of 84 non-dialysis dependent patients of both sexes (including 45.2% of women) with eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73m2: 26.2% with eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, 65.5% with eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 8.3% with eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. Muscle strength was estimated by measuring hand grip strength (HGS) with the use of handheld hydraulic dynamometer. Muscle quantity was measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy using Body Composition Monitor. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was calculated according to Linâ€™s formula. Serum creatinine, urea, uric acid and albumin were measured. Results In bivariate analysis we found that ASM significantly and positively correlated with anthropometric variables such as body mass (r=0.903, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7695580d2af03a2c9201c079a73ff036e965b55500d9f9d171489889a04c0809","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
