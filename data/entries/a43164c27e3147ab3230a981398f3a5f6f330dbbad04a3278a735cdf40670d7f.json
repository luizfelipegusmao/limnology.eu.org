{"title":"A progressive approach to multi-criteria group decision-making: <i>N</i>-bipolar hypersoft topology perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304016","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Sagvan Y. Musa, Baravan A. Asaad</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates <i>N</i>-bipolar hypersoft topology (<i>N</i>-BHST), a novel extension of both the well-established <i>N</i>-hypersoft topology (<i>N</i>-HST) and hypersoft topology (HST). Deviating significantly from its precursor, the <i>N</i>-bipolar hypersoft (<i>N</i>-BHS) set, <i>N</i>-BHST introduces a multi-opinion approach to decision-making, augmenting robustness and adaptability. This innovative framework addresses identified limitations in <i>N</i>-bipolar soft topology (<i>N</i>-BST), especially in managing multi-argument approximate functions. The study analyzes various operators (closure, interior, exterior, and boundary) within the <i>N</i>-BHST framework, elucidating their interrelationships. Additionally, an examination is carried out on the enhancement of multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) using <i>N</i>-BHST, setting it apart from existing models. A numerical example is presented to illustrate its application in real-world decision scenarios.","author":"Sagvan Y.
