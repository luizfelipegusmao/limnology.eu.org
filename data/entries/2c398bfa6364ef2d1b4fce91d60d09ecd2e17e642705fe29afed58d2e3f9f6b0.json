{"title":"Optimizing sediment control by adjusting the relative spacing between trusses/beams in an open-type check dam","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10346-024-02369-8","date":1728259200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Open-type check dams are effective in mitigating sediment-related disasters in mountain regions. Unlike closed-type dams, they do not interrupt sediment transport or ecological continuity. This work reports on flume experiments that explored sediment trapping by truss and beam check dams, focusing on the impact of the relative spacing between the trusses or beams on sediment capture. We assessed the ability of adjustable check dams to preserve a dynamic sediment equilibrium by modifying the truss or beam spacing. Experiments with various gravel sizes and truss or beam spacings revealed that a smaller spacing results in a significant reduction in the proportion of sediment passing through the dam, whereas a larger spacing facilitates sediment transport through the dam. The two dam types showed different behaviors. Beams were more effective than trusses in trapping sediment, particularly at relative spacings of between 1.5 and 2.3, with the difference in sediment retention between the two types of dam reaching 43%. A practical case study of an adjustable beam check dam on Dongzhuang Stream in southern Taiwan illustrated the applicability of our research, where sediment management was notably enhanced following adjustments to the dam structure. The flexible operation of open-type, adjustable beam check dams presents a promising approach for sustainable sediment control in fluvial systems, enabling a balance between disaster mitigation and ecological conservation.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"2c398bfa6364ef2d1b4fce91d60d09ecd2e17e642705fe29afed58d2e3f9f6b0","category":"Environment"}
