{"title":"The prophylaxis functions of Lactobacillus fermentum GLF‐217 and Lactobacillus plantarum FLP‐215 on ulcerative colitis via modulating gut microbiota of mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13410?af=R","date":1709901546000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The strong connection between gut microbes and human health has been confirmed by an increasing number of studies. Although probiotics have been found to relieve ulcerative colitis, the mechanism varies by the species involved. In this study, the physiological, immune and pathological factors of mice were measured and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted to investigate the potential mechanisms in preventing ulcerative colitis.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results demonstrated that ingestion of <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> GLF-217 and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> FLP-215 significantly alleviated ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), as evidenced by the increase in body weight, food intake, water intake and colon length as well as the decrease in disease activity index, histopathological score and inflammatory factor. Both strains not only improved intestinal mucosa by increasing mucin-2 and zonula occludens-1, but also improved the immune system response by elevating interleukin-10 levels and decreasing the levels of interleukin-1<i>β</i>, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-<i>α</i> and interferon-<i>γ</i>. Moreover, <i>L. fermentum</i> GLF-217 and <i>L. plantarum</i> FLP-215 play a role in preventing DSS-induced colitis by regulating the structure of gut microbiota and promoting the formation of short-chain fatty acids.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>This study may provide a reference for the prevention strategy of ulcerative colitis. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ao Li, \nAijie Liu, \nJun Wang, \nHainan Song, \nPengfei Luo, \nMeng Zhan, \nXiaoli Zhou, \nLihao Chen, \nLin Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"81fa84f603d34160d64877aa55f01478a4a8a2ffde09625124bbad2b23fedfac","category":"Environment"}
