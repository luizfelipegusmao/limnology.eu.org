{"title":"Pre-service Science Teachers&rsquo; Conceptions about Creativity at School: A Study in the Hispanic Context","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1893/v1","date":1719439224000,"content":"The present study examines the views of prospective science teachers in Colombia on creativity, employing a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative and quantitative techniques. This approach adapted and used an instrument previously developed by Diakidoy and Kanari [1] to explore student teachers' beliefs about creativity. The sample consisted of 152 science education students from two leading Colombian universities in representative cities. The findings align with previous international studies involving both practicing and trainee professionals, although subtle differences, likely due to cultural variations in the university settings, were observed. It emerged that future science teachers predominantly view creativity as an innate ability present in everyone and capable of development. Additionally, the study underscores the role of the classroom environment in fostering creativity, noting that effective creative expression also requires certain level of prior knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6d3a7c7f89c5404437326980456955fadc5d52caa33287d2f5a21ec0c743129","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
