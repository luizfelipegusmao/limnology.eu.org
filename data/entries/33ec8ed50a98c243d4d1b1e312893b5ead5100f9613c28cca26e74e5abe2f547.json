{"title":"Conventional and Advanced Treatment Technologies for Microplastics in Water Treatment Facilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0075/v1","date":1717460638000,"content":"Researchers are increasingly concerned about microplastics (MPs) since they have proven to be detrimental to the environment and humans. They not only contribute to the accumulation of plastics in the environment, but they can also help spread micropollutants through absorption. MPs have entered the environment through a variety of channels, including direct discharge through human activities, the textile industry, and wastewater treatment systems. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are seen as the final line of defense, forming a barrier between MPs and the environment. The most common MPs found in wastewater are polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene. The purpose of this study is to investigate and measure the efficacy of conventional and advanced technologies in removing microplastic. The fate of MPs in WWTPs and their impact on various wastewater treatment processes will be thoroughly examined. Both conventional and advanced methods of treatment will be discussed. Conventional methods include coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Advanced treatment methods that will be discussed include membrane bioreactors, rapid sand filtration, electrocoagulation, and photocatalytic degradation. Despite the high removal of MPs, WWTPs remain an important entry point into aquatic and terrestrial systems due to the large volumes involved and the quantity of sludge reused through land application. Also, the complex interactions between MPs and other environmental pollutants may broaden MPs' effects on wastewater treatment processes, which have yet to be fully researched. Furthermore, potential issues with MP removal from treatment procedures and microplastic remediation techniques in drinking water was discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33ec8ed50a98c243d4d1b1e312893b5ead5100f9613c28cca26e74e5abe2f547","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
