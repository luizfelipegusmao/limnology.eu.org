{"title":"Shock responsiveness of the Philippine social protection system: Three case studies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12445?af=R","date":1710495415000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Philippine households face large-scale risks, like natural disasters and inflation, which can threaten their financial stability and push them into poverty. To manage these risks, the Philippine government needs a shock-responsive social protection system. Several components of such a system already exist, as proven by the country's responses to Typhoon Haiyan, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent food and energy crisis. However, these events also exposed gaps in the Philippine social protection system, particularly in reaching out to unregistered individuals swiftly. The resolution lies in updating and harmonizing social registries, making verification processes interoperable, enhancing delivery platforms (both digital and physical), and ensuring efficient grievance redress systems.</p>","author":"Fernando T.
