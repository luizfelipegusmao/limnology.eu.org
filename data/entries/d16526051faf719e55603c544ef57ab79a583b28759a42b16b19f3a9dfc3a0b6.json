{"title":"Resolution of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in a Patient with Goiter after Thyroidectomy: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1847/v1","date":1711705475000,"content":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be linked to various factors that narrow the upper airways, such as obesity, adenotonsillar hypertrophy and craniofacial abnormalities. Hypothyroidism has also been described as a risk factor for OSA. However, the implication of goiter independently of thyroid function in the occurrence of OSA remains unclear. We present the case of a 66-year-old patient, with a large compressive multinodular goiter for whom total thyroidectomy was indicated. During the preoperative assessment, the patient showed a body mass index (BMI) of 37.8 kg/m2 with symptoms of OSA. Respiratory polygraphy confirmed the diagnosis of severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index: AHI=32) and treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was initiated prior to thyroid surgery. Surprisingly, after total thyroidectomy, OSA symptoms disappeared and the patient abandoned CPAP therapy. Subsequent respiratory polygraphy after thyroidectomy showed a decrease in AHI to a normal value (AHI &lt; 5). Interestingly, there was no change in BMI or other factors explaining the resolution of OSA, except for thyroidectomy. This case report suggests that goiter can be considered a risk factor for OSA. However, prospective studies are needed to accurately assess the effects of goiter on occurrence of OSA according to its dimensions and local extension.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d16526051faf719e55603c544ef57ab79a583b28759a42b16b19f3a9dfc3a0b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
