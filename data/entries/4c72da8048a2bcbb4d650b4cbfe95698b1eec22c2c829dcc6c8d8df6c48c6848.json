{"title":"The Extended Mind &amp; Body in Extended Realities: A Scoping Review of XR Applications and Risks in the Metaverse","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0857/v2","date":1726297120000,"content":"This scoping review explores the intersection of Extended Mind Theory and Extended Reality (XR) technologies, focusing on how Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality reshape human cognition and interaction. XR enables users to offload cognitive tasks and engage in embodied experiences, extending cognition beyond the brain into digital environments. The review highlights a wide range of XR applications, from immersive learning in STEM education and medical training, neuropsychological assessment to therapeutic interventions, arts and entertainment, professional skills development, retail and e-commerce, remote work, sports training, architecture and urban planning, and cultural heritage preservation. XR's integration with modalities like haptics, eye-tracking, face- and body-tracking, and brain-computer interfaces further enhances cognitive extension and user engagement. However, alongside these advancements come significant ethical, psychological, and societal challenges, such as data privacy concerns, the psychological effects of prolonged immersion, and social inequality arising from disparate access to XR technologies. This review emphasizes the need for robust ethical frameworks that address these challenges, ensuring that XR technologies enhance human development while maintaining autonomy, privacy, and mental well-being. As XR continues to evolve and integrate with artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, its role in expanding human cognition will depend on responsible implementation and governance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c72da8048a2bcbb4d650b4cbfe95698b1eec22c2c829dcc6c8d8df6c48c6848","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
