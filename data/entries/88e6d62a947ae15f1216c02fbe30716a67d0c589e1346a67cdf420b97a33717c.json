{"title":"Enhanced optical performance of solar cell using hydrophobic SnO2/TEOS/MTMS antireflection coating","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14436?af=R","date":1718183984000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Anti-reflection coatings have potential usage in photovoltaic solar cells, sensors, and display devices to reduce reflectance, glare and enhance light transmission. ARC was developed to increase more efficiency of solar cell cover glasses, by depositing SnO<sub>2</sub>/TEOS/MTMS coating using the sol–gel spin coating technique. The coating showed a maximum transmittance of 92.70% at 399 nm wavelength with an average refractive index of 1.42. The transmittance of the antireflective film was increased by 2.29% than the bare glass substrate. The surface morphology of the coatings was investigated using FESEM analysis. The mechanical stability of the coating was evaluated using ASTM standard D 3363–05 pencil scratch test, and it demonstrated good performance against 3H hardness pencil. The efficiency of solar cells has been increased by 1.56% after depositing with single layer SnO<sub>2</sub>/TEOS/MTMS film. Moreover, the coating maintains the solar cell's performance even during dust exposure, because of its self-cleaning ability with water contact angle of 94°. Thus, the Anti-reflection coating can be applied to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic system.</p>","author":"N. R. Chandralekha, \nJ. Shanthi, \nR. Swathi, \nK. K.
