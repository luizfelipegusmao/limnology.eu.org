{"title":"A Novel de Novo Missense Mutation in KIF1A Associated with Young-Onset Upper-Limb Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0355/v1","date":1720013244000,"content":"Objectives: To investigate the etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in an adult female patient. Methods: We conducted trio genome sequencing on a 35-year-old woman with progressive weakness in her left upper limb, as well as on her parents. Prior to sequencing, we performed a comprehensive neurological work-up on the patient, including neurological exam, electrophysiology, biomarker assessment, and brain and spinal cord MRI. Results : The propositus experienced weakness and atrophy in her left hand 6 months before the evaluation. This was associated with brisk reflexes and Hoffman sign in the same arm. Electroneuromyography revealed lower motor neuron involvement in three body regions. Neurofilament light chains were elevated in her cerebrospinal fluid. Brain imaging showed asymmetrical T2 hyperintensity of the corticospinal tracts and T2 linear hypointensity of the precentral gyri. Genome trio sequencing identified a likely pathogenic de novo variant in the propositusâ€™s KIF1A gene (NM_001244008.2): c.574A&amp;gt;G, p.(Ile192Val). Discussion: Pathogenic variants in the KIF1A gene have been associated with a wide range of neurological manifestations called KIF1A-associated neurological diseases (KAND). The present report describe a likely pathogenic de novo variant in KIF1A associated with ALS, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of KAND and our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb109d7ebaa6192a152d919fa9ada6d38a2c64da26472a23ce7d6bf640a3b2e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
