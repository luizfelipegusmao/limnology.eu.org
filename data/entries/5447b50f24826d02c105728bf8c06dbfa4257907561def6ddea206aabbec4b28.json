{"title":"The crucial correlation between flavor formation and microbial community dynamics during the fermentation of Zhacai","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13447?af=R","date":1709820840000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Zhacai, a pickled vegetable with unique flavors, is produced by fermenting fresh mustard tubers. In this study, the main physicochemical indices and volatile flavor compounds were determined in three fermentation periods. Additionally, the bacterial and fungal communities in the three fermentation periods of Zhacai were monitored using high-throughput sequencing. Key microbial communities were identified based on significant correlations with flavor substances.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p><i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Proteobacteria</i> were the main bacterial phyla found within the three fermentation periods. Lactic acid bacteria, namely <i>Lactobacillus,</i> was the predominant bacteria found at the genus levels. <i>Ascomycetes</i> and <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> were the major fungal phyla of the three fermentation periods. Yeast, namely <i>Debaryomyces,</i> was the predominant fungus found at the genus levels. A total of 42 bacterial genera were negatively correlated with volatile flavor substances of Zhacai, and 37 bacterial genera were positively correlated. Meanwhile, a total of 47 genera of fungi were negatively correlated with the volatile flavor substances of Zhacai, while 50 genera were positively correlated. Several microbial genera were significantly correlated with volatile flavor compounds, including <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Halomonas</i>, <i>Rhodococcus</i>, and <i>Debaryomyces</i>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study identified the microbial classes that positively regulate the flavor of Zhacai which could provide valuable help for flavor modulation in Zhacai production.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
