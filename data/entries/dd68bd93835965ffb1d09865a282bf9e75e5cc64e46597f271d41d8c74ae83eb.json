{"title":"Floral morph variation mediated by clonal growth and pollinator functional groups of Limonium otolepis in a heterostylous fragmented population","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae020/7636164?rss=1","date":1711497600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><strong>Abstract</strong>. Heterostyly, a genetic style polymorphism, is linked to symmetric pollen transfer, vital for its maintenance. Clonal growth typically impacts sexual reproduction by influencing pollen transfer. However, the floral morph variation remains poorly understood under the combined effects of pollinators and clonal growth in heterostyly characterized by negative frequency-dependent selection and disassortative mating. We estimated morph ratios, ramets per genet and heterostylous syndrome and quantified legitimate pollen transfer via clonal growth, pollinators and reciprocal herkogamy between floral morphs in <span>Limonium otolepis</span>, a fragmented population composed of five subpopulations in the desert environment of northwestern China, with small flower and large floral morph variation. All subpopulations but one exhibited pollen-stigma morphology dimorphism. The compatibility between mating types with different pollen-stigma morphologies remained consistent regardless of reciprocal herkogamy. Biased ratios and ramets per genet of the two mating types with distinct pollen-stigma morphologies caused asymmetric pollen flow and varying fruit sets in all subpopulations. Short-tongued insects were the primary pollinators due to small flower sizes. However, pollen-feeding <span>Syrphidae</span> sp. triggered asymmetry in pollen flow between high and low sex organs, with short-styled morphs having lower stigma pollen depositions and greater variation. Clonal growth amplified this variation by reducing intermorph pollen transfer. All in all, pollinators and clonal growth jointly drive floral morph variation. H-morphs with the same stigma-anther position and self-incompatibility, which mitigate the disadvantages of sunken low sex organs with differing from the classical homostyly, might arise from long- and short-styled morphs through a ‘relaxed selection’. This study is the first to uncover the occurrence of the H-morph and its associated influencing factors in a distylous plant featuring clonal growth, small flowers and a fragmented population.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"dd68bd93835965ffb1d09865a282bf9e75e5cc64e46597f271d41d8c74ae83eb","category":"Environment"}
