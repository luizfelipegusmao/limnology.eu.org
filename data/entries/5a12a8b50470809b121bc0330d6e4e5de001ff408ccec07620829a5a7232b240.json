{"title":"Topological Representation of Sample Size Calculation: The 4D Nature of Variables and 3D Nature of Surfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0445/v2","date":1712649388000,"content":"Sample size using prevalence has been one of the most important medical research methodologies and has been used in original articles more often than any other statistical tool available. The simple formula consists of variables interdependent and it is as important to understand how they influence each other as it is to learn to use the formula to calculate the sample size. With the choice of different amounts of precision and levels of confidence available to a medical researcher, it should be of paramount importance to understand what a slight change in choosing the parameter would mean at the end of the research. Understanding of different Z values, Levels of precision, and ranging Prevalence is required to understand the effect on the sample size and subsequently on the research. Topological representation using parameter ranges can be used to demonstrate this relationship.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a12a8b50470809b121bc0330d6e4e5de001ff408ccec07620829a5a7232b240","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
