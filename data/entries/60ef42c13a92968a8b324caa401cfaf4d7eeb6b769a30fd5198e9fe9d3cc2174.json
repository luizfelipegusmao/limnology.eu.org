Lifespan estimates for yellowfin (YFT) and bigeye (BET) tuna (<span>Thunnus albacares</span> and <span>T. obesus</span>) were validated up to 16–18 years in the western North Atlantic Ocean using bomb <sup>14</sup>C dating and the current study extends the approach to YFT and BET of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). Archived otoliths from young-of-the-year (YOY) tuna caught in the WCPO were analysed for <sup>14</sup>C to establish a reference chronology covering 30 years (1989–2019). This YOY <sup>14</sup>C time series exhibited strong concordance with existing coral-otolith <sup>14</sup>C references for the tropical-subtropical Pacific Ocean and was combined as a single chronology. Otolith cores from YFT aged 1–14 years and BET aged 1–13 years from presumed annual counts were analysed for <sup>14</sup>C. These measurements aligned with the reference chronology for the calculated hatch years for both species. These findings provide strong evidence that growth zones in thin-sectioned otoliths are deposited annually for YFT and BET of the WCPO and that age interpretation is correct using the current age reading protocol with little to no bias.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"60ef42c13a92968a8b324caa401cfaf4d7eeb6b769a30fd5198e9fe9d3cc2174","category":"Environment"}
