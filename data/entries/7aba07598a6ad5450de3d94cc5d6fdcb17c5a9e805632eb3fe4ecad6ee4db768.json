{"title":"Association between family income to poverty ratio and nocturia in adults aged 20 years and older: A study from NHANES 2005–2010","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303927","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Yangtao Jia, Jiacheng Ca, Fangzheng Yang, Xinke Dong, Libin Zhou, Huimin Long</p>\r\nBackground <p>Nocturia, the most common lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS), significantly impacts socioeconomic factors and individuals’ quality of life and is closely related to many diseases. This study utilized data from NHANES 2005–2010 to explore the relationship between family income to poverty ratio (PIR) and the presence of nocturia symptoms in adults aged 20 or older in the United States.</p> Methods <p>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2005–2010, including 6,662 adults aged 20 or older, were utilized for this cross-sectional study. The baseline data was used to display the distribution of each characteristic visually. Multiple linear regression and smooth curve fitting were used to study the linear and non-linear correlations between PIR and nocturia. Subgroup analysis and interaction tests were conducted to examine the stability of intergroup relationships.</p> Results <p>Out of the 6,662 adult participants aged 20 or older, 1,300 households were categorized as living in poverty, 3,671 households had a moderate income, and 1,691 households were classified as affluent. Among these participants, 3,139 individuals experienced nocturia, representing 47.12% of the total, while 3,523 individuals were nocturia-free, constituting 52.88% of the total population. After adjusting for all other covariates, it was found that PIR was significantly negatively correlated with nocturia (OR: 0.875, 95%CI: 0.836–0.916 P&lt;0.0001). This trend persisted when PIR was divided into three groups (PIR &lt;1, PIR 1–4, PIR &gt; 4) or quartiles. There was a non-linear negative correlation between PIR and nocturia.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings indicated that lower PlR was associated with a higher risk of nocturia in adults aged 20 or older in the United States. These findings highlight the importance of considering socioeconomic factors in preventing and managing nocturia. Nonetheless, further exploration of the causal nexus between these factors was precluded due to the constraints of a cross-sectional design.</p>","author":"Yangtao Jia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7aba07598a6ad5450de3d94cc5d6fdcb17c5a9e805632eb3fe4ecad6ee4db768","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
