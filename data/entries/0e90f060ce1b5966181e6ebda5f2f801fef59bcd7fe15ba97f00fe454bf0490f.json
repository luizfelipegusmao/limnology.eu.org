{"title":"Application of 2D Modification of Hjorth Descriptors to Distinguish Defined Classes of Bee Pollen Images","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0762/v1","date":1723442362000,"content":"Adulteration of food products, including honey, is a serious problem in todayâ€™s economy. Honey has become the third most counterfeited food product in the world, which requires effective authentication methods. This article presents considerations regarding the development of meteorology to test the quality of honey based on the analysis of bee pollen. The justification for conducting such analyses is the relatively high need for the authentication of honey and its derivatives. It turns out that the honey market and honey itself are the third products in the world in which undesirable, inappropriate, and quality-reducing components may appear, affecting the final quality of a product such as honey. The analyses mentioned above thus come down to issues related to the analysis and processing of images. A certain novelty of the approach to this analysis is an attempt to parameterize them using the so-called Hjorth descriptors, which have been a tool known for almost 50 years from the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In this paper, after an introduction to the issues related to testing honey, the issues related to the method of obtaining bee pollen images, improving their quality by applying appropriate filtration, performing normalization, and finally calculating Hjorth distributors such as: Activity, Mobility, and Complexity will be discussed. In the next stage described in this article, the authors perform a detailed statistical analysis leading to the initial construction of a simple classifier that distinguishes defined gropus of bee pollen images.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e90f060ce1b5966181e6ebda5f2f801fef59bcd7fe15ba97f00fe454bf0490f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
