{"title":"Production of Polyhydroxyalkanotes by an Extreme Halophilic Bacterium Halomonas gomseomensis Using Different Carbon Sources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0692/v1","date":1710228337000,"content":"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are natural polyesters consisting of various chains of hydroxyalkanoates (HAs) produced by microorganisms; this polyestres has attention due environmentally friendly compounds from renewable sources as a substitute to conventional petroleum-based plastics. The objective of this study consisted in evaluating the Genotypic characterization and production of polimer of a halobacterium isolated from hypersaline ponds located at Las Coloradas (Yucatan, Mexico). Characterization of polymer produced by this strain was also performed. We concluded that, the analyzes obtained from this work demonstrated that the JCCOL25.2 strain has a 99% similarity with Halomonas gomseomensis, and is capable of using different carbon sources to synthesize PHAs. The physicochemical analyzes allowed the identification of the biopolymer produced and classifying it as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), because the characteristics of this biopolymer have been reported for similar polymers. PHB has various applications in the pharmaceutical, medical, food and agronomy areas. Likewise, PHB has interesting properties for use in food packaging, due to its characteristics such as biodegradability, optical activity and good barrier properties. Finally, the significance and impact of our study, there is only one study published on the biosynthesis of PHAâ€™s by H. gomseomensis strains, although the characterization of the obtained polymer was not report.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0364b0357f19e33e923f3b63ca17ef8634dd7adc469c26bb1eedb9f31f8d7e1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
