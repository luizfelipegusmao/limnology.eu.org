{"title":"Camel Milk Processing Opportunities: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0410/v1","date":1715118371000,"content":"Camel milk occupies a pivotal and essential position in the dietary customs of individuals residing in semi-arid and arid areas. Historically, the promotion and distribution of camel milk have been negligible, primarily due to the absence of processing facilities in areas where camels are raised. Consequently, the consumption of untreated camel milk has been predominantly limited to nomadic households. However, owing to its exceptional medicinal properties and health-enhancing effects, a substantial surge in the global demand for camel milk and its derivatives has been observed over the past two decades. This growing demand has prompted the dairy sector to introduce a diverse range of camel milk products, which are distinguished by their enhanced nutritional and functional properties. In contrast to products derived from bovine milk, the current market offers only a limited selection of food items sourced from camel milk. \nRecent advances in food processing technologies have enabled the production of an array of both dairy and non-dairy products derived from camel milk. This includes a variety of items such as powdered milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream. Moreover, in certain regions, camel milk is incorporated into customary cuisine, serving as a key ingredient in local culinary practices like fermented milk, camel milk tea, or as a fundamental component in various meals. This review underscores the possibility of transforming camel milk into a range of dairy products by addressing its intrinsic functional constraints. This objective can be realized by adjusting the processing parameters and modifying its chemical composition through enrichment techniques. Furthermore, further research avenues may focus on enhancing product quality and exploring innovative processing techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41b448190b63be0fdab495034ae8590d99deb542088a02ed7e7ca0d87a949115","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
