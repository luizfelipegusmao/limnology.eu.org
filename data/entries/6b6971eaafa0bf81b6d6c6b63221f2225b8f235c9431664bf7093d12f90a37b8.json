Aim 1, conducted during the formative phase, was to modify the original Couples Health CoOp (CHC) intervention to include antiretroviral therapy/pre-exposure prophylaxis (ART/PrEP), called the Couples Health CoOp Plus (CHC+), with review from our Community Collaborative Board and a Peer Advisory Board. Aim 1 has been completed for staging the trial. Aim 2 is to evaluate the impact of a stigma awareness and education workshop on community members’ attitudes and behaviors toward young women and men who use AODs and people in their community seeking HIV services (testing/ART/PrEP) and other health services in their local clinics. Aim 3 is to test the efficacy of the CHC+ to increase both partners’ PrEP/ART initiation and adherence (at 3 and 6 months) and to reduce alcohol and other drug use, sexual risk and gender-based violence, and to enhance positive gender norms and communication relative to HIV testing services (n = 480 couples). Aim 4 seeks to examine through mixed methods the interaction of the stigma awareness workshop and the CHC+ on increased PrEP and ART initiation, retention, and adherence among young women and their primary partners. Ongoing collaborations with community peer leaders and local outreach staff from these communities are essential for reaching the project’s aims. Additionally, a manualized field protocol with regular training, fidelity checks, and quality assurance are critical components of this multilevel community trial for successful ongoing data collection.\r\nTrial registration.
