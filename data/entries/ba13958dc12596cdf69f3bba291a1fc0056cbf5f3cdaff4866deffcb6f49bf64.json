{"title":"Photoinactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis by Near-Infrared Radiation Using a Trehalose-Conjugated Heptamethine Cyanine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1175/v1","date":1718692063000,"content":"The spread of multidrug-resistant mycobacterium strains requires the development of new approaches to combat diseases caused by these pathogens. For that, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising approach. In this study, a tricarbocyanine (TCC) is used for the first time as a near-infrared (740 nm) activatable PDI photosensitizer to kill mycobacteria with deeper light penetration. For better targeting, a novel tricarbocyanine dye functionalized with two trehalose units (TCC2Tre) is developed. The photodynamic effect of the conjugate against mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is evaluated. Under irradiation, TCC2Tre causes more effective killing of mycobacteria compared to the photosensitizer without trehalose conjugation, with 99.99% dead vegetative cells of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. In addition, effective photoinactivation of dormant forms of M. smegmatis is observed after incubation with TCC2Tre. Mycobacteria treated with TCC2Tre are more sensitive to 740 nm light than the Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. For the first time, this study demonstrates the possibility of in vitro PDI of mycobacteria including the fast-growing M. smegmatis and the slow-growing M. tuberculosis using near-infrared activatable photosensitizers. These findings are useful for the development of new efficient alternatives to antibiotic therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba13958dc12596cdf69f3bba291a1fc0056cbf5f3cdaff4866deffcb6f49bf64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
