{"title":"Rapid analysis of wheat gluten composition using a triple ELISA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13521?af=R","date":1713854636000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Gluten composition is an important quality parameter of wheat flour. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is a state-of-the-art method for its analysis. As this is a very labour-intensive and time-consuming procedure, alternative faster methods are desirable. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a high-throughput method often used for the analysis of gluten traces in gluten-free products. In this proof-of-principle study, we introduce an experimental triple ELISA for the relative quantitation of gliadins, high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) of one wheat flour extract.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results of 80 common wheat flour samples obtained from the triple ELISA and RP-HPLC were correlated. The results for gliadins (<i>r</i> = 0.69) and HMW-GS (<i>r</i> = 0.81) showed a medium and high correlation, respectively. Only a very weak correlation of ELISA and RP-HPLC results was observed for LMW-GS (<i>r</i> = 0.49). Results for glutenins (<i>r</i> = 0.69) and gluten (<i>r</i> = 0.72) had a medium correlation. The gliadin/glutenin ratio (<i>r</i> = 0.47) and LMW-GS/HMW-GS ratio (<i>r</i> = 0.40) showed a weak or no correlation. The gliadin, LMW-GS and gluten contents were lower and the HMW-GS content was higher in the ELISA measurement compared to RP-HPLC.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The quantitation of gliadins and HMW-GS by the experimental triple ELISA showed comparable results to RP-HPLC, whereas no strong correlation between the results from the two methods was found for LMW-GS. Overall, the experimental triple ELISA is suitable for relative gluten quantitation, especially for the analysis of large sample sets. Further work will focus on improving the experimental procedure of the ELISA. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Clemens Schuster, \nJulien Huen, \nThomas Weiss, \nKatharina Anne Scherf","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c3411781d2ba71e31816d4b845c1b6680a3a333ca5c929ad8b8a25ac488dd569","category":"Environment"}
