{"title":"Rapid analysis of wheat gluten composition using a triple ELISA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13521?af=R","date":1712659994000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The gluten composition is an important quality parameter of wheat flour. RP-HPLC is state-of-the-art for its analysis. As this is a very labour-intensive and time-consuming procedure, alternative faster methods are desirable. ELISA is a high-throughput method often used for the analysis of gluten traces in gluten-free products. In this proof-of-principle study, we introduce an experimental triple ELISA for the relative quantitation of gliadins, high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) out of one wheat flour extract.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results of 80 common wheat flour samples obtained from the triple ELISA and RP-HPLC were correlated. The results for gliadins (r = 0.69) and HMW-GS (r = 0.81) showed a medium and high correlation, respectively. Only a very weak correlation of ELISA and RP-HPLC results was observed for LMW-GS (r = 0.49). Results for glutenins (r = 0.69) and gluten (r = 0.72) had a medium correlation. The gliadin/glutenin ratio (r = 0.47) and LMW-GS/HMW-GS ratio (r = 0.40) showed a weak or no correlation. The gliadin, LMW-GS and gluten contents were lower and the HMW-GS content was higher in the ELISA measurement compared to RP-HPLC.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The quantitation of gliadins and HMW-GS by the experimental triple ELISA showed comparable results to RP-HPLC, whereas no strong correlation between the results from the two methods was found for LMW-GS. Overall, the experimental triple ELISA is suitable for relative gluten quantitation, especially for the analysis of large sample sets. Further work will focus on improving the experimental procedure of the ELISA.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
