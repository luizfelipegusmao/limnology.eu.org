{"title":"Analyzing Managerial Skills for Employability in Graduate Students in Economics, Administration and Accounting Sciences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0703/v1","date":1720501229000,"content":"The study analyzes how graduate students in economics, administration and accounting perceive their managerial skills for employability. It focuses on the importance of developing transferable skills that meet current and future job demands. To measure the perception of skills, a structured and duly validated questionnaire (Employability Skills 2000+) was used, answered by 225 graduate students in Economics, Administrative and Accounting Sciences in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The data obtained from the application were analyzed using the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) method with the FACTOR software. The CFA generated an adaptation of the original scale with 21 variables. The resulting scale determined three predominant factors: Personal Management Skills, Fundamental Skills and Teamwork Skills, which presented good consistency and validity, allowing us to conclude regarding employability skills in the context studied. The findings show the existence of a correlation between fundamental skills and variables such as work experience, employment status and gender, as well as a high correlation between teamwork skills and work experience and employability conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55a28451296a5064ff416585779d086c2b23d72662b6c56f449696ff2d8bc588","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
