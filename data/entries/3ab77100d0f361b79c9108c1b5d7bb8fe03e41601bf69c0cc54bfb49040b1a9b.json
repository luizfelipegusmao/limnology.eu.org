{"title":"No Planet‐B Attitudes: The Current Environmental Paradigm and Its Role on Willingness to Pay for Sustainable Tourism Destinations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2111/v1","date":1727346186000,"content":"With consumers increasingly aware of the effects of human activity on the environment, tourism products and destinations are increasingly marketed as sustainable and socially responsible. As most sustainable practices lead to additional costs, and tourists’ decisions tend to be price sensitive, achieving sustainability goals necessarily involves understanding how much tourists are willing to pay extra for sustainable practices, as well as the antecedents of such Willingness to Pay (WTP). The present study aims to advance knowledge on the antecedents of WTP for Sustainable Destinations (WTP-4-SD), for which it builds on previous studies employing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP). In this context, a theoretical model involving Ecotourism Attitudes, Environmental Beliefs, Climate Change-Related Risk Perceptions (CC-RRP), Environmental Concern During trip (ECDT), and Sustainable Consumption Behavior (SCB) as antecedents of WTP-4-SD is proposed. The model was tested based on data collected through an online survey, form a sample of 1,545 Spanish and Portuguese tourists, and analyzed through Structural Equations Modelling (SEM). The findings suggest that a cohesive set of attitudes and beliefs regarding the man-nature relationship, the risks of climate change and the role of tourism – which have been labelled “No Planet-B Attitudes” – is the main driver of WTP-4-SD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ab77100d0f361b79c9108c1b5d7bb8fe03e41601bf69c0cc54bfb49040b1a9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
