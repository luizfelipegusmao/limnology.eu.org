{"title":"Quantifying Traditional Wisdom: A Study of Indigenous Medicinal Plants in Suhelwa Wildlife Sanctuary, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0507/v1","date":1715168864000,"content":"India, a megadiverse nation, harbors significant biodiversity, particularly in tropical moist deciduous forests. However, these forests and valuable medicinal plants face habitat loss and overexploitation threats.  While indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants exists, a comprehensive ethnomedicinal study still needs to be included, especially for Uttar Pradesh's Terai region. This study focuses on the Suhelwa Wildlife Sanctuary, a haven for medicinal plants within the Terai.  We aim to document the knowledge of local healers regarding wild medicinal plants used in phytotherapy.  We will employ quantitative indices and compare our findings with data from other regions to identify novel medicinal plant uses. This enriched database can serve as a springboard for future pharmacological research.  Suhelwa's diverse geography and climate contribute to its rich medicinal flora, making it a prime candidate for exploring the potential of traditional knowledge for drug discovery and sustainable income generation for local communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24c469ca597d64373353615103b76a0599cd9346a32761007c80bfe90f4c259e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
