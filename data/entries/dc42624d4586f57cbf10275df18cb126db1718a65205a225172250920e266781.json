{"title":"Application of Polysaccharide‐Based Columns for the Separation of Racemic Mixtures Obtained Based on (R,S)‐2‐Octanol by Reversed‐Phase Chiral Liquid Chromatography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0796/v1","date":1710399690000,"content":"The polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phase (CSP) columns for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were applied in the separation of liquid crystalline racemic mixtures obtained based on (R,S)-2-octanol and were found to be highly effective in recognizing isomers of minor structural differences. The mobile phase (MP), which consists of acetonitrile (ACN)/water (H2O) at different volume ratios, was used. All measurements were made at room temperature. The order of the elution was also determined. The chromatographic parameters such as resolution - (Rs), selectivity - (α), and the number of theoretical plates, i.e., column efficiency - (N), were determined. The polysaccharide-based CSP columns have unique advantages in separation technology, and this study has shown the potential usefulness of the CSP columns in separating liquid crystalline racemic mixtures belonging to the same homologous series.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc42624d4586f57cbf10275df18cb126db1718a65205a225172250920e266781","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
