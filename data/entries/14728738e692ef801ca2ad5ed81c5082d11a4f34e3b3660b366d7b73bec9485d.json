{"title":"Generating Renewable Energy Based on a Circuit Approach (Part 2)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1690/v1","date":1724397448000,"content":"The world is currently facing an energy crisis. To solve the problem, many countries have been exploring renewable energy sources. However, the existing renewable energy sources are highly dependent on weather changes, necessitating the utilization of significantly expensive and large storage batteries.As a solution, we propose a system for generating renewable energy. The proposed system comprises a current source and a voltage source connected in series. With appropriate adjustments, the current source supplies current without voltage and the voltage source provides voltage without current. Considering that electric power is a product of current and voltage, electric power is generated from the interaction between the current source and voltage source. In our previous study, the same result was obtained; however, the output voltage was low, which resulted in a low amount of generated energy. In this study, by introducing some ingenuities, we successfully increased the output voltage. Consequently, we succeeded in powering a light-emitting diode and charging a super-condenser to the standard voltage. Using this system, we generated a relatively large amount of energy in the right place and at the right time, validating our systemsâ€™ robustness to changes in weather. The large-scale adoption of our system could contribute to solving the global energy crisis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14728738e692ef801ca2ad5ed81c5082d11a4f34e3b3660b366d7b73bec9485d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
