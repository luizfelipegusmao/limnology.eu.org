However, when we obtain images for structural analysis especially at low doses, such as electron-beam sensitive materials or high-speed STEM imaging, a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio is inevitable. Therefore, a denoising method for STEM imaging is necessary for precise structural analyses. Recently, Kawahara et al. applied a total variation (TV) algorithm to STEM images and showed its high noise removal performance [<a href=\"#ozae044.214-B1\">1</a>]. However, the problem is that their algorithm requires many iterative computations in both denoising and hyperparameter optimization. In fact, the algorithm takes a few minutes to denoise an image of 512 × 512 pixels, and hence, real-time denoising is impossible. In this study, we improved the TV algorithm on the basis of Bayesian statistics and proposed an extremely fast denoising algorithm. The previous algorithm performs denoising by minimizing a loss function, and we found that the minimization process is equivalent to the maximum <span>a posteriori</span> (MAP) estimation in the Markov Random Field (MRF) model, which is one of the probabilistic models based on Bayesian statistics. By deriving the MAP solution analytically [<a href=\"#ozae044.214-B2\">2–4</a>], we perform denoising without iterative computations. Furthermore, we can optimize the hyperparameters by computing the Bayesian free energy, which is analytically computable in the MRF model [<a href=\"#ozae044.214-B2\">2–4</a>]. Therefore, iterative computations are unnecessary in hyperparameter optimization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c42e5af985e78b18c244c35dae21a88b6d0da9472c29b6b5d2916c392c6446d9","category":"Environment"}
