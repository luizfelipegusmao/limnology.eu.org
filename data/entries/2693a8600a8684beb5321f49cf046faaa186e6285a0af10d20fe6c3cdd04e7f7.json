Preoxygenation is performed before introducing the tube to increase the safe apnea time. Oxygenation is monitored by pulse oximeter measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). However, SpO<sub>2</sub> is unreliable at the high oxygenation levels produced by preoxygenation and, in the event of desaturation, may not decrease sufficiently early to allow preventive measures. The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a dimensionless parameter that can also be measured continuously by a fingertip monitor and reflects oxygenation in the moderate hyperoxia range. The ORI ranges from 0 to 1 when arterial oxygen saturation (PaO<sub>2</sub>) varies between 100 to 200 mmHg, as occurs during preoxygenation. No trial has assessed the potential effects of ORI monitoring to guide preoxygenation for ETI in unstable patients. We designed a multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized, superiority, open trial in 950 critically ill adults requiring ETI. The intervention consists in monitoring ORI values and using an ORI target for preoxygenation of at least 0.6 for at least 1 minute. In the control group, preoxygenation is guided by SpO<sub>2</sub> values recorded by a standard pulse oximeter, according to the standard of care, the goal being to obtain 100% SpO<sub>2</sub> during preoxygenation, which lasts at least 3 minutes. The standard-of-care ETI technique is used in both arms. Baseline parameters, rapid-sequence induction medications, ETI devices, and physiological data are recorded. The primary outcome is the lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> value from laryngoscopy to 2 minutes after successful ETI. Secondary outcomes include cognitive function on day 28. Assuming a 10% standard deviation for the lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> value in the control group, no missing data, and crossover of 5% of patients, with the bilateral alpha risk set at 0.05, including 950 patients will provide 85% power for detecting a 2% between-group absolute difference in the lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> value. Should ORI monitoring with a target of ≥0.6 be found to increase the lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> value during ETI, then this trial may change current practice regarding preoxygenation for ETI.\r\nTrial registration: Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05867875) on April 27, 2023.","author":"Hugo Hille","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2693a8600a8684beb5321f49cf046faaa186e6285a0af10d20fe6c3cdd04e7f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
