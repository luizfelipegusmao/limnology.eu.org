{"title":"The influence of habitat heterogeneity on Nematoda communities in Posidonia oceanica meadows","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05495-5","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Nematodes typically comprise the most abundant phylum in meiofaunal communities. We aim to characterize the specific ecological conditions that influence Nematoda communities in <em>Posidonia oceanica</em> grasslands focusing on three habitats: leaves, matte, and unvegetated adjacent sediment. We hypothesized that the constant flux of nutrients under the canopy would result in a higher concentration of metazoans compared to the unvegetated sediment outside; however, the hypothesis was not confirmed by the obtained results. The habitat heterogeneity played an important role in shaping the community, yielding a greater richness in the matte. The resource specificity of the leaves (microepiphytes) was also expected to shape the community by favoring nematodes capable of exploiting this resource (epistratum feeders with scraping-like structures), such as the family Chromadoridae that dominated this habitat. In addition, the high light exposure of the leaves explains the higher concentration of ocellated nematodes in this habitat. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents had an impact on the Nematoda community composition, meanwhile average grain size only affected the abundance of nematodes with elongated/filiform tails.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"11fd2fd5f7e23b1d7b252be74b055f7f37905ef64cff67a1475e8ee99696ba9e","category":"Environment"}
