And with the advent of moiré superlattice systems, formed by stacking two or more van der Waals materials, new devices with unique electronic and optical properties are now being created routinely [<a href=\"#ozae044.774-B1\">1</a>]. However, theoretical predictions of moiré potentials – the energy landscapes induced by moiré superlattices – in these systems can underestimate the values obtained from experiment by as much as an order of magnitude [<a href=\"#ozae044.774-B2\">2</a>], exposing a hole in our understanding of the behavior of these systems. Furthermore, inhomogeneous strain and twist relaxation typically make moiré patterns unpredictable and nonuniform (Fig. 1), which can affect device-scale behavior and confuse the experimental picture. Correlating electronic and optical properties with direct high resolution imaging would be immensely helpful in gaining an understanding of these devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cb21b0795c4a6fc32ea16548a348c573f27ca650fec635f9f3bc5386aa684aa7","category":"Environment"}
