{"title":"Association between various physical activity domains and overall cancer risk, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2018","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308099","date":1722261600000,"content":"<p>by Yanxue Lian, Pincheng Luo</p>\r\nPurpose <p>There are very few studies concurrently evaluating the association between multiple physical activity (PA) domains and cancer prevalence. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by investigating the link between multiple PA subdomains [occupational PA (OPA), transportation-related PA (TPA), leisure-time PA (LTPA), and total PA] and the likelihood of cancer.</p> Method <p>The data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018 were used in this study. Cancers are the primary outcome variable of interest in this study. PA was self- or proxy-reported using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Multivariable logistic regression models were used, adjusted for covariates.</p> Results <p>The trend analysis revealed that the prevalence of cancer statistically decreased with the increase in total PA amount. The participants achieving twice the minimum recommended PA guidelines (≥300 minutes) for total PA were 32% [0.68 (0.54, 0.86)] less likely to have cancer. However, significant associations between three PA subdomains (OPA, TPA, and LTPA) and cancers were not found in this study.</p> Conclusion <p>There is no significant association between any of these three single PA subdomains and cancer prevalence other than total PA. Therefore, this study recommends clinical practice should prioritize promoting comprehensive PA that integrates OPA, TPA, and LTPA to achieve at least 150 minutes per week (i.e. per seven days) initially and progressing towards 300 minutes for optimal cancer prevention.</p>","author":"Yanxue Lian","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4f51ac7107a8dfea18a54bfc9925c6a48341d0f704bc8c68215458fcba91b04a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
