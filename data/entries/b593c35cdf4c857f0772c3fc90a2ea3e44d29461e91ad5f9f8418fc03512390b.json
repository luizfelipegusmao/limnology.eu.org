However, it severely impacts the environment because of untreated wastewater discharge. High treatment costs, reliant on expensive imported chemicals, worsen the issue. The Environmental Conservation Rules (ECR) 2023 of Bangladesh requires textile wastewater discharge to have a colour of less than 150 Pt-Co, which current systems struggle to meet affordably. A pilot project tested a sustainable solution using chemical oxidation with calcium hypochlorite and sand filtration with blast furnace iron slag. This method effectively removed colour, and the treated water showed total dissolved solids (TDS) levels of 157 ± 4 mg/L, total suspended solids (TSS) levels of 8 ± 2 mg/L and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of 9 ± 3 mg/L, with reductions of 92%, 87% and 94%, respectively, making it a viable solution for resource-limited economies.</p>","author":"Md Sahil Rafiq, \nMohammad Shakhawat Hosen Apurba, \nNadim Reza Khandaker","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"b593c35cdf4c857f0772c3fc90a2ea3e44d29461e91ad5f9f8418fc03512390b","category":"Environment"}
