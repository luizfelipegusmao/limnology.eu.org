{"title":"LncRNA MRAK052509 competitively adsorbs miR‐204‐3p to regulate silica dust‐induced EMT process","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24218?af=R","date":1710574730000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Silicosis is a systemic disease caused by long-term inhalation of free SiO<sub>2</sub> and retention in the lungs. At present, it is still the most important occupational health hazard disease in the world. Existing studies have shown that non-coding RNA can also participate in complex fibrosis regulatory networks. However, its role in regulating silicotic fibrosis is still unclear. In this study, we constructed a NR8383/RLE-6TN co-culture system to simulate the pathogenesis of silicosis in vitro. Design of miR-204-3p mimics and inhibitors to overexpress or downregulate miR-204-3p in RLE-6TN cells. Design of short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA) to downregulate MRAK052509 in RLE-6TN cells. The regulatory mechanism of miR-204-3p and LncRNA MRAK052509 on EMT process was studied by Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, Immunofluorescence and Cell scratch test. The results revealed that miR-204-3p affects the occurrence of silica dust-induced cellular EMT process mainly through regulating TGF-βRΙ, a key molecule of TGF-β signaling pathway. In contrast, Lnc MRAK052509 promotes the EMT process in epithelial cells by competitively adsorbing miR-204-3p and reducing its inhibitory effect on the target gene TGF-βRΙ, which may influence the development of silicosis fibrosis. This study perfects the targeted regulation relationship between LncRNA MRAK052509, miR-204-3p and TGF-βRΙ, and may provide a new strategy for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of silicosis.</p>","author":"Liu Xuan, \nJiao Zi‐ming, \nTian Xue‐yan, \nHu Wen‐xuan, \nWang Fa‐xuan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"36b84891d95e8b0fa11a92f82f2d4f6a64951c97b959e8dbd1c76c61c6d2c950","category":"Environment"}
