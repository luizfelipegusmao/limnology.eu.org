{"title":"Understanding Dislocation and Deformation Structure In Monoclinic Ultrawide Bandgap Semiconductor β-Ga2O3 Under High-Stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.069/7719477?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Beta gallium oxide (β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor that is of interest due to its 4.8 eV band gap, tunable carrier concentration, and low-cost native substrates with relatively low defect densities [<a href=\"#ozae044.069-B1\">1</a>]. Demonstrating tolerance to ionizing radiation and an 8 MV/cm theoretical breakdown field, its properties indicate promise in optoelectronics and power electronics, especially in operation under extreme environments [<a href=\"#ozae044.069-B2\">2</a>]. Device failure in high power electronics typically can occur due to pre-existing defects in the crystals which are exacerbated while under extreme environments, i.e., high temperature and electric potential. Thus, a detailed knowledge of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>’s defect structure is the key to incorporate it into industrial use. Scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) has been applied to the atomic-scale study of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, for example identifying defective γ-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase inclusions, the coordination of aluminum interstitial atoms near a β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/β-(Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interface, band gap variation across heterostructures, and the formation of divacancy-interstitial complexes [<a href=\"#ozae044.069-B3\">3-7</a>]. Study of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>’s dislocations, however, has been limited and focuses on formation mechanisms during growth [<a href=\"#ozae044.069-B8\">8</a>]. As attempts to scale up epitaxial wafer growth continue, knowledge of dislocations is vital. These are often referred to as “device-killing” defects in silicon carbide and gallium nitride. Recently, dislocation glide and dislocation bundles in β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with a Burgers vector of b || [010] were observed in a Schottky barrier diode using synchrotron X-ray topography [<a href=\"#ozae044.069-B9\">9</a>]. This technique was also previously used to study dislocations in a β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> single crystal (010)-oriented sample [<a href=\"#ozae044.069-B10\">10</a>]. However, these did not examine the impact of failure on the dislocation structure, nor provide the direct defect visualization S/TEM is capable of.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5b7ba1a8a58c44cf1b37fe93a74124dde49a4a1d055a03807b705b1b8ad6d4f0","category":"Environment"}
