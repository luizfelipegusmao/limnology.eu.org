{"title":"Magnetic Prospecting as a Tool for the Characterization of Mining Dams in the La Carolina Mining District (South of Spain)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0959/v1","date":1710752030000,"content":"In the former mining district of La Carolina (southern Spain), waste materials were accumulated without first waterproofing the substrate. Additionally, these mining dams were abandoned without any type of restoration, conditions that present a significant risk of contaminating the surrounding soils and waters. Prior to carry out the necessary works for isolating these residues, morphological characterization of the contact with the base substrate is needed. For that purpose, in recent years, different indirect study techniques have been used, among which electrical to-mography stands out. In this work, a less common geophysical technique, magnetometry, both in its magnetic and gra-diometric modalities, is used as an alternative method to analyse the geometry and structure of a mining dam. The results obtained with this methodology are compared with the results provided by electrical techniques, as well as with direct data from mechanical surveys and aerial photo-graphs prior to waste deposition. The magnetic anomaly curves obtained with geometric models generated with the Mag2dc program were also analysed. This comparative study shows the use-fulness of magnetic prospecting in characterizing the base geometry of these mining structures and therefore the interest in its application to environmental characterization studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c1cafb6b12f8b8945eab7afbecd19598503422a8e19565176e20e48ff5c5d07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
