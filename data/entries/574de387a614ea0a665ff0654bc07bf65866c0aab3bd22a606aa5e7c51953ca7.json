{"title":"473 Evaluation of hematology outcomes as indicators of liver abscess formation in beef × dairy cross steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/385/7757416?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our objective was to evaluate hematological measurements that could be indicative of liver abscesses (LA) in weaned beef × dairy cross steers. Beef × dairy cross steers [n = 40; initial body weight (BW) = 120 ± 12 kg] were sourced from a local dairy calf ranch and transported 166 km to the USDA-ARS Livestock Issues Research Unit Liberty Farm near Lubbock, TX (d -16). Calves were initially housed outside in soil-surfaced pens for 16 d with ad libitum access to water and high-forage receiving diet before being moved into individual pens within an environmentally controlled barn (d 0). While housed in the barn, calves were cycled between a high-forage diet (2 d) and a high-concentrate finishing diet (3 d) for 3 cycles. Additionally, calves were administered <span>Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum</span> (4.25 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU in 100 mL) and <span>Salmonella enterica serotype Lubbock</span> (1.29 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU in 100 mL) intraruminally on d 0, 5, and 10. Following the last inoculation on d 10, calves were fed the high concentrate finishing diet for the remainder of the study. Whole blood samples for measurement of complete blood counts were collected via jugular venipuncture on d 0, 10, 21 and 30. On d 31, calves were harvested to determine LA prevalence. Fifty percent of calves developed at least one LA. Complete blood count analysis revealed day effects (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.03) for all variables, with the exception of basophil percentage (<span>P</span> = 0.06; Table 1). Prevalence of a liver abscess was associated with increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) neutrophil count, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil percentage, concomitant with decreased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04) lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte percentage. Additionally, a tendency (<span>P</span> = 0.09) was observed for decreased red blood cells in calves with a LA compared with those without. These data suggest that changes in neutrophil and lymphocyte concentrations within the blood may be indicative of LA prevalence in beef × dairy steer calves and hold potential as predictive markers for LA.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"574de387a614ea0a665ff0654bc07bf65866c0aab3bd22a606aa5e7c51953ca7","category":"Environment"}
