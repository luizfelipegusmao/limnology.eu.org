{"title":"Authenticate and Verification Source Files using SHA256 and HMAC Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0075/v1","date":1719832431000,"content":"Because data authenticity and validity are becoming more and more of a concern in the digital age file security and integrity must be guaranteed. This paper investigates the application of HMAC-SHA256 which combines the Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256) with a private key for transmission-side source file authentication and verification. The study creates a prototype application to evaluate the efficacy of HMAC-SHA256 in securing file transfers by examining previous investigations on SHA and HMAC. The findings demonstrate that SHA256 produces unique file signatures which successfully guards against unwanted changes. Through the use of cryptographic hashes and secret keys to create distinct digital signatures that guarantee file authenticity HMAC improves security. The study shows that HMAC-SHA256 protects data integrity and detects tampering effectively. It does however stress how crucial it is to comprehend cryptographic concepts and apply these strategies with caution in order to prevent vulnerabilities. Overall the study finds that when properly implemented and updated HMAC-SHA256 greatly enhances file security in the digital age.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c2831a9d2a3681e41e82f53714771ea9a997ef96a065ea89584ee16b45dcac3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
