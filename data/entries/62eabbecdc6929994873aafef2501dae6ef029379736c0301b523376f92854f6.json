{"title":"Directing a colleague: LIKE EARLY STARVATION with FLOURY ENDOSPERM 6 targets isoamylase 1 to rice starch granules","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1590/7618131?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span>Starch is one of the most abundant biopolymers on Earth, constituting 80% to 90% of the rice grain endosperm weight, thereby greatly affecting crop yield and quality. In plants, starch is stored in the form of starch granules. Amylopectin and amylose polymers assemble in crystalline and amorphous regions of the starch granules. There are 3 classes of enzymes required for amylopectin biosynthesis: starch synthases, which elongate linear glucan chains; starch branching enzymes responsible for adding Î±-1,6 branch points; and the starch debranching enzymes named isoamylases (ISAs), which remove improper branch points. In addition to these enzymes, non-enzymatic proteins with starch-binding domains are emerging to be important for starch synthesis. An example is LIKE EARLY STARVATION (LESV), a widely conserved non-enzymatic protein with a C-terminal region rich in aromatic and acidic amino acid residues, originally discovered in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#koae070-B1\">Feike et al. 2016</a>). Several roles have been proposed for LESV, including a role in the assembly of amylopectin helices into starch granules (<a href=\"#koae070-B2\">Liu et al. 2023</a>) and in modifying the surface structure of starch granules to influence enzymatic activities (<a href=\"#koae070-B4\">Singh et al. 2022</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"62eabbecdc6929994873aafef2501dae6ef029379736c0301b523376f92854f6","category":"Environment"}
