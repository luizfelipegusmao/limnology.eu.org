{"title":"Neuroergonomic Attention Assessment in Safety-Critical Tasks: EEG Indices and Subjective Metrics Validation in a Novel Task-Embedded Reaction Time Paradigm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0106/v1","date":1725293182000,"content":"This study addresses the gap in methodological guidelines for Neuroergonomic attention assessment in safety-critical tasks, focusing on validating EEG indices including the Engagement Index (EI) and Beta/Alpha ratio alongside subjective ratings. A novel task-embedded reaction time paradigm was developed to evaluate the sensitivity of these metrics to dynamic attentional demands in a more naturalistic multitasking context. By manipulating attention levels through varying secondary tasks in the NASA MATB-II task while maintaining a consistent primary reaction-time task, the study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the paradigm. Results indicate that both Beta/Alpha ratio and EI are sensitive to changes in attentional demands, with Beta/Alpha being more responsive to dynamic variations in attention, and EI reflecting more the overall effort required to sustain performance, especially in conditions where maintaining attention is challenging. The potential for predicting the attention lapses through integration of performance metrics, EEG measures, and subjective assessments was demonstrated, providing a more nuanced understanding of dynamic fluctuations of attention in multitasking scenarios, mimicking those in real-world safety-critical tasks. These findings provide a foundation for advancing methods to accurately monitor attention fluctuations and mitigate risks in critical scenarios, such as train-driving or automated vehicle operation, where maintaining high attention level is crucial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"145cba797ad128419b00eee5d369f46c81056693d12b36ea0687b1a712cf9efa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
