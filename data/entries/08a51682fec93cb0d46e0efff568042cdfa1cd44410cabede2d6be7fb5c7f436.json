{"title":"Is there an Asymmetric Effect due to Oil and Natural Gas Price Shocks on the Trade Balance of the Countries of the Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1616/v1","date":1729577462000,"content":"In this study, the asymmetric effect of oil and natural gas price shocks on the trade balance of 11 CESEE countries was estimated. These countries are net importers of oil and natural gas, and price shocks are often the cause of imbalances in trade. Quarterly data for the period 1994Q1 to 2023Q4 and nonlinear ARDL model were used. In the long run, a significant asymmetric effect due to the oil price shock on the trade balance of Bulgaria, Czechia, Latvia and Slovenia was found, as well as a significant asymmetric effect due to the natural gas price shock on the trade balance of Croatia. Also in the long run, a significant asymmetric effect due to wholesale prices on the trade balance of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia was found as well as a significant asymmetric effect due to industrial production on the trade balance of Croatia, Czechia and Latvia was found, in addition to a significant asymmetric effect due to the exchange rate on the trade balance of Czechia, Poland and Romania.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08a51682fec93cb0d46e0efff568042cdfa1cd44410cabede2d6be7fb5c7f436","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
