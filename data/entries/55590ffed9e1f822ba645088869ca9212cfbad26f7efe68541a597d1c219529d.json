{"title":"Solid-State Battery Innovations: Insights from a Systematic Patent Review and a Cross-Sectional Bibliometric and Thematic Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0700/v1","date":1728475310000,"content":"Solid-state batteries (SSBs) hold the potential to revolutionize energy storage systems by offering enhanced safety, higher energy density, and longer life cycles compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, the widespread adoption of SSBs faces significant challenges, including low charge mobility, high internal resistance, mechanical degradation, and the use of unsustainable materials. These technical and manufacturing hurdles have hindered the large-scale commercialization of SSBs, which are crucial for applications such as electric vehicles, portable electronics, and renewable energy storage. This paper provides a systematic review and cross-sectional bibliometric and thematic analysis of the global patent landscape for SSB technologies. The study classifies innovations into key problem and solution areas by meticulously examining 244 patents across multiple dimensions, including geographic distribution, inventor engagement, award latency, and technological focus. Key findings reveal progress in addressing performance, safety, material sustainability, and manufacturing scalability, with significant innovations in electrolyte, electrode, architectural, and process engineering. This research contributes a comprehensive analysis of the technological landscape, offering valuable insights into ongoing advancements and providing a roadmap for future research and development. This work will benefit researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers by highlighting the most promising areas for innovation, thereby accelerating the commercialization of SSBs, and supporting the transition toward more sustainable and efficient energy storage solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55590ffed9e1f822ba645088869ca9212cfbad26f7efe68541a597d1c219529d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
