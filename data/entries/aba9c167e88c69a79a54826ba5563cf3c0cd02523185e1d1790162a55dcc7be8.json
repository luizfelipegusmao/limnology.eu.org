{"title":"Finite Time Hybrid Synchronization Control for Duplex Complex Networks via Intermittent Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0159/v1","date":1727863996000,"content":"This paper is devoted to the finite time internal and the external synchronization (hybrid synchronization) for complex networks by means of intermittent control. Different from most previous research achievements, the finite time synchronization include internal and the external synchronization, this article employs the intermittent control to drive the complex networks to achieve synchronization in finite time. To be specific, the internal and the external synchronization all achieve consistent synchronization in finite time by devise Lyapunov function. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validness of theoretical results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aba9c167e88c69a79a54826ba5563cf3c0cd02523185e1d1790162a55dcc7be8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
