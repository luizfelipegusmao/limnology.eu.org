We calculated multifunctionality of soils at days 30 and 90 of recolonization using the averaging approach.\nResults showed that organic management (O) significantly increased alpha diversity, niche width and network complexity of microbial community compared to conventional management (C). The alpha diversity, niche width and network complexity of microbial community in soils with organic soil suspension were significantly increased compared to conventional management at days 30 and 90 of recolonization. Soil multifunctionality of sterilized organic managed soil inoculated with organic soil suspension (OO) was 14.6% to 70.6% higher than that of the rest treatments. Macrogenomic analysis revealed that O significantly enriched functional pathways of ABC transporters, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, two-component and nitrogen metabolism as well as most of the functional genes for carbon degradation, carbon fixation, nitrogen cycling and phosphorus cycles compared to C. These functional pathways and genes were also significantly enriched in soils with organic soil suspension at day 30 and 90 of recolonization. Furthermore, alpha diversity, niche width, network complexity, functional pathways and functional genes of microbiome correlated positively with soil multifunctionality.\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Our results emphasize the importance of organic management induced changes in diversity, network complexity, and functionality of microbial communities for promoting recovery to soil microbial and functional losses, providing the theoretical basis for sustainable impact of organic management in agronomic production on soil microbiome and function.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/02/organic-management-improved-the-multifunctionality-in-recolonization-soil-by-increasing-microbial-diversity-and-function/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Taobing Yu, \nRuoqi Yang, \nXintian Jie, \nTengxiang Lian, \nHuadong Zang, \nZhaohai Zeng, \nYadong Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"cffac94f5436b04c64264e7c8293103e040b6a5003dbf7a849b364f29fa75f39","category":"Environment"}
