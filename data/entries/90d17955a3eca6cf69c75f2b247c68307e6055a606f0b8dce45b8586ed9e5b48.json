{"title":"The effect of sedimentation on spore settlement and recruitment of the endemic Arctic kelp, Laminaria solidungula (Phaeophyceae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13453?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Environmental changes associated with rapid climate change in the Arctic, such as the increased rates of sedimentation from climatic or anthropogenic sources, can enhance the impact of abiotic stressors on coastal ecosystems. High sedimentation rates can be detrimental to nearshore kelp abundance and distribution, possibly due to increased mortality at the spore settlement stage. Spore settlement and viability of the Arctic kelp <i>Laminaria solidungula</i> were examined through a series of lab-based sedimentation experiments. Spores were exposed to increasing sediment loads in three experimental designs simulating different sedimentation scenarios: sediment deposition above settled spores, settlement of spores on sediment-covered substrate, and simultaneous suspension of spores and sediments during settlement. Spore settlement was recorded upon completion of each experiment, and gametophyte abundance was assessed following a growth period with sediments removed to examine short-term spore viability via a gametophyte-to-settled-spore ratio. In all three types of sediment exposure, the addition of sediments caused a 30%â€“40% reduction in spore settlement relative to a no-sediment control. Spore settlement decreased significantly between the low and high sediment treatments when spores were settled onto sediment-covered substrates. In all experiments, increasing amounts of sediment had no significant effect on spore viability, indicating that spores that had settled under different short-term sediment conditions were viable. Our results indicate that depending on spore-sediment interaction type, higher rates of sedimentation resulting from increased sediment loading could affect <i>L. solidungula</i> spore settlement success with potential impacts on the long-term persistence of a diverse and productive benthic habitat.</p>","author":"Jaide Phelps, \nKenneth Dunton, \nBrenda Konar, \nSchery Umanzor, \nArley Muth, \nKatrin Iken","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"90d17955a3eca6cf69c75f2b247c68307e6055a606f0b8dce45b8586ed9e5b48","category":"Environment"}
