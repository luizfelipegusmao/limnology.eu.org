To investigate post-settlement growth and mortality, juveniles were sampled in Tango Bay (Japan) weekly throughout the settlement period in 2007 and 2008. Otolith (lapillus) microstructure analysis enabled the categorization of juveniles into six biweekly cohorts each year. Later cohorts exhibited higher growth rates possibly because of higher water temperatures. A key observation was the direct relationship between high mortality and high density in mid-season cohorts in both years, pointing to density-dependent mortality. This increased mortality may be attributed to predation, including cannibalism by earlier cohorts. Furthermore, growth-selective mortality was evident soon after settlement, underscoring the vulnerability of slow growers to predation during the early juvenile stage. Although earlier and later cohorts were less abundant but showed promising recruitment potential, the prospective contribution of mid-season cohorts to the adult population remained uncertain. The results clearly highlight the importance of density-dependent mortality in population regulation in post-settlement Japanese flounder.</p>","author":"Chaitanya K. Bhandare, \nKeita W.
