{"title":"Role of β‐glucan on finfish and shellfish health and well‐being: A systematic review and meta‐analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12944?af=R","date":1719375532000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the inclusion of β-glucan in aquaculture animal diets and its impact on their health outcomes. Relevant studies were identified from Scopus and Web of Science databases. A total of 82 primary studies published between 1996 and 2024 were reviewed, of which 70 were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that the application of β-glucan to aquaculture animal's diets significantly enhanced specific growth rate (SGR; mean effect, <i>g</i> = 2.71; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), feed conversion ratio (FCR; <i>g</i> = −3.88; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and lowered mortality after exposure to pathogens. Likewise, β-glucan had a positive influence (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) on innate immune parameters (lysozyme and phagocyte activity, NBT, ACH50, and IgM). The study found that the effects of β-glucans varied among marine and freshwater fish where freshwater fishes (<i>g</i> = 2.05–6.57) exhibit better performance. This study also found a negative correlation between fish's innate immune response and trophic level, suggesting that fish with higher trophic levels may be less efficient at absorbing this bio-stimulant. Even though there were high heterogeneity (<i>I</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 73%–97%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) due to the diversity of tested organisms and publication bias, our model and findings are valid. The findings suggest that the dietary application of β-glucans can have beneficial effects on growth and immune responses especially for freshwater species. The validity of these observations needs to be confirmed by further prospective studies.</p>","author":"Hien Van Doan, \nMd Afsar Ahmed Sumon, \nHung Quang Tran, \nChinh Xuan Le, \nEman Y.
