{"title":"Analysis of the Kerr-Newman Diagram. Unravelling the Interior of a Black Hole","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0101/v1","date":1722593619000,"content":"Here we will explain the correlation between the Kerr-Newman diagram and the theory: RLC electrical modelling of a black hole and the early universe. We will develop a black hole model that describes and explains both theories. In the development of our analysis, we will emphasize the following conditions: M² &gt; Q² + a², M² = Q² + a² and M² &lt; Q² + a² and we will also analyse the condition in which the mass of a black hole reaches its critical mass M = Mc. We will demonstrate that the interpretation of the Kerr-Newman diagram is equivalent to the interpretation of the theory: RLC electrical modelling of a black hole and the early universe. Finally, we will generalize the proposed model for a black hole and propose a black hole model formed by negative particles, neutroniumd, which after reaching critical conditions of mass, pressure, volume, temperature, density, etc.; decays into a positively charged black hole, protoniu. Let us remember that both models are formed by charged particles of matter (they do not contain antimatter), but their vector configuration means that the net charges of both proposed black holes are zero.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73f456973c0fa286f15b8d9499b6111ab248accb8124896c7e19ef8cdb3e8fd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
