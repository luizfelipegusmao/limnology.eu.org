{"title":"Earthquake-Induced Landslides in Italy: Evaluation of the Triggering Potential Based on Seismic Hazard","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0570/v1","date":1710175666000,"content":"In this study, we define screening maps for Italy that classify sites based on their potential for triggering landslides. To this end, we analyze seismic hazard maps and hazard disaggregation results on a national scale considering four spectral periods (0.01s, 0.2s, 0.5s, and 1.0s) and three return periods (475, 975, and 2475 years). First, joint distributions of magnitude (M) and distance (R) from hazard disaggregation are analyzed by means of an innovative approach based on image processing techniques to find all modal scenarios contributing to the hazard. In order to obtain the M-R scenarios controlling the triggering of earthquake-induced landslides at any computation node, mean and modal M-R pairs are compared to empirical curves defining the M-R bounds associated with landslide triggering. Three types of landslides are considered (i.e., disrupted slides and falls, coherent slides, and lateral spreads and flows). As a result, screening maps for all of Italy showing the potential for triggering landslides based on the level of seismic hazard are obtained. The maps and the related data are freely accessible at the following web address: https://distav.unige.it/rsni/slideq.php.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ded809c8fc1452fb526ffc0567c75f2a94cd2ee4ce73ecc89d1a016bc82d39b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
