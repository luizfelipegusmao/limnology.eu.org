However, this waste can be transformed into a valuable resource through innovative methods. This process not only reduces environmental pollution but also generates additional useful products. This study aims to screen novel high-efficiency cellulose-degrading bacteria from cow dung, forest soil, brewery waste, and agro-industrial waste in the Debre Berhan area for the treatment of cellulose-rich agricultural waste. The serial dilution and pour plate method was used to screen for cellulolytic bacteria and further characterized using morphological and biochemical methods. From eleven isolates cow dung 1 (CD1), cow dung 6 (CD6) and cow dung (CD3) which produced the largest cellulolytic index (3.1, 2.9 and 2.87) were selected. Samples from forest soil, and spent grain didnâ€™t form a zone of clearance, and effluent treatment and industrial waste (IW9) shows the smallest cellulolytic index. Three potential isolates were then tested for cellulolytic activity, with cow dung 1 (CD1) displaying promising cellulase activity. These bacterial isolates were then identified as Bacillus species, which were isolated from cow dung 1 (CD1) with maximum cellulase production. Cow dung waste is a rich source of cellulase-producing bacteria, which can be valuable and innovative enzymes for converting lignocellulosic waste.","author":"Mulugeta Samuel Demissie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fcf5d20e9976f7ed36748fc7881a0f6d83aaa111524e318805da6cc5e7fe25dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
