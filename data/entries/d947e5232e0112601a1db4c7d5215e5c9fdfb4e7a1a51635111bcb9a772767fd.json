Bacteria can fix new nitrogen in these nitrogen-limited areas. We found that warming did not change nitrogen fixation much in common moss species, while more rain increased it. Surprisingly, warming reduced nitrogen fixation in dry mosses in rainier places. Wet Sphagnum moss colonies had the highest nitrogen fixation rates, but drier feather mosses added more nitrogen overall because they cover more ground. Therefore, the type and amount of moss will influence how much nitrogen is added to tundra under future climate change.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change in high latitude regions leads to both higher temperatures and more precipitation but their combined effects on terrestrial ecosystem processes are poorly understood. In nitrogen (N) limited and often moss-dominated tundra and boreal ecosystems, moss-associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation is an important process that provides new N. We tested whether high mean annual precipitation enhanced experimental warming effects on growing season N<sub>2</sub> fixation in three common arctic-boreal moss species adapted to different moisture conditions and evaluated their N contribution to the landscape level. We measured in situ N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates in <i>Hylocomium splendens</i>, <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i> and <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. from June to September in subarctic tundra in Sweden. We exposed mosses occurring along a natural precipitation gradient (mean annual precipitation: 571–1155 mm) to 8 years of experimental summer warming using open-top chambers before our measurements. We modelled species-specific seasonal N input to the ecosystem at the colony and landscape level. Higher mean annual precipitation clearly increased N<sub>2</sub> fixation, especially during peak growing season and in feather mosses. For <i>Sphagnum-</i>associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation, high mean annual precipitation reversed a small negative warming response. By contrast, in the dry-adapted feather moss species higher mean annual precipitation led to negative warming effects<i>.</i> Modelled total growing season N inputs for <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. colonies were two to three times that of feather mosses at an area basis. However, at the landscape level where feather mosses were more abundant, they contributed 50% more N than <i>Sphagnum</i>. The discrepancy between modelled estimates of species-specific N input via N<sub>2</sub> fixation at the moss core versus ecosystem scale, exemplify how moss cover is essential for evaluating impact of altered N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Importantly, combined effects of warming and higher mean annual precipitation may not lead to similar responses across moss species, which could affect moss fitness and their abilities to buffer environmental changes.</p>","author":"Signe Lett, \nCasper T.
