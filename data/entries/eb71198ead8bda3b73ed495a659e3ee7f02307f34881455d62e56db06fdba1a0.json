{"title":"Costs in conservation: Common costly mistakes and how to avoid them","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002676","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Vanessa M. Adams</p>\r\n\r\nThere has been an increasingly prevalent message that data regarding costs must be included in conservation planning activities to make cost-efficient decisions. Despite the growing acceptance that socioeconomic context is critical to conservation success, the approaches to embedded economic and financial considerations into planning have not significantly evolved. Inappropriate cost data is frequently included in decisions, with the potential of compromising biodiversity and social outcomes. For each conservation planning step, this essay details common mistakes made when considering costs, proposing solutions to enable conservation managers to know when and how to include costs. Appropriate use of high-quality cost data obtained at the right scale will improve decision-making and ultimately avoid costly mistakes.","author":"Vanessa M.
