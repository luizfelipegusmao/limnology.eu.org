{"title":"Supervision of Biomedical Master&rsquo;s Students in Norway","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0173/v1","date":1722827549000,"content":"Working as a researcher, associate professor, or full professor in the field of biomedicine in Norway involves supervising students preparing for various degrees, such as Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, and MD. Additionally, there are visiting students from other departments and institutions in Norway, as well as from abroad, including various types of exchange students. Departments and Faculties provide guidelines and regulations on what is expected from students and their communication with supervisors throughout the study course. However, these guidelines are often too general, allowing for significant flexibility and varied interpretations from both the students' and supervisors' perspectives. This article focuses on personal experiences supervising biomedical Master's students in Norway. It covers several aspects, including student recruitment, initial instructions, routine work, graduation, and post-graduation interaction. The focus is on the supervisor's point of view, while the students' perspectives on this topic are reserved for further research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7a37a4a18ff9a40338cdc3251edf6d167b59d7d8b4cba56052783ab29ac51a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
