{"title":"Stomatal CO2 responses at sub- and above-ambient CO2 levels employ different pathways in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/608/7687702?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Stomatal pores that control plant CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and water loss affect global carbon and water cycles. In the era of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), it is essential to understand how these stimuli affect stomatal behavior. Whether stomatal responses to sub-ambient and above-ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels are governed by the same regulators and depend on VPD remains unknown. We studied stomatal conductance responses in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) stomatal signaling mutants under conditions where CO<sub>2</sub> levels were either increased from sub-ambient to ambient (400â€…ppm) or from ambient to above-ambient levels under normal or elevated VPD. We found that guard cell signaling components involved in CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure have different roles in the sub-ambient and above-ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The CO<sub>2</sub>-specific regulators prominently affected sub-ambient CO<sub>2</sub> responses, whereas the lack of guard cell slow-type anion channel SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1) more strongly affected the speed of above-ambient CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure. Elevated VPD caused lower stomatal conductance in all studied genotypes and CO<sub>2</sub> transitions, as well as faster CO<sub>2</sub>-responsiveness in some studied genotypes and CO<sub>2</sub> transitions. Our results highlight the importance of experimental setups in interpreting stomatal CO<sub>2</sub>-responsiveness, as stomatal movements under different CO<sub>2</sub> concentration ranges are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and VPD responses may also interact. Hence, multi-factor treatments are needed to understand how plants integrate different environmental signals and translate them into stomatal responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a15ce9310b47c60200ac0b094dfb69062fe56a1387d7e645faefce3744f93a9a","category":"Environment"}
