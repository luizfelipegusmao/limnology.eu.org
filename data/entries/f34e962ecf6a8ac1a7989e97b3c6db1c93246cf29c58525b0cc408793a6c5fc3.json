{"title":"Evaluating the effect of optimal zinc amino-acid complex supplementation in laying pullets on performance and zinc retention","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311813","date":1729173600000,"content":"<p>by Gabriela Duarte Silva, Carlos Bôa-Viagem Rabello, Jamille Sheila da Silva Wanderley, Katariny Lima de Abreu, Lilian Francisco Arantes de Sousa, Rafael Victor Nunes Lima, Fabiano Séllos Costa, Miriam Nogueira Teixeira, Marcos José Batista dos Santos, Alba K. Fireman</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigated the optimal dietary intake of zinc amino acid complex (Zn-AAC) for white-layer pullets, focusing on their productive performance, biochemical profile, organ biometry, and body zinc retention. The study involved 360 Dekalb White pullets (average weight: 433 ± 4.42 g) aged from 6 to 16 weeks and distributed into 6 treatments with 6 replications each. The Zn-AAC inclusion levels ranged from 5 to 75 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Zinc intake was modeled using a nonlinear equation, Y = ∝ *1- e<sup>-βX</sup>, where α is the maximum response, β is the rate at which the response approaches the maximum (P &lt; 0.05). The Zn-AAC supplementation had significant effects on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed convention ratio (FCR) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Optimal intake levels of Zn-AAC were estimated at 0.234, 0.340, and 0.315 mg bird<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> (5.42, 7.87, and 7.30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) for ADG, ADFI, and FCR, respectively. The Zn-AAC supplementation affected the Zn body retention in pullets <i>(P</i> &lt; 0.01), with an optimal ingestion at 1.86 mg bird <sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to a dietary supplementation of 43.10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, supplementation affected alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity <i>(P</i> &lt; 0.01) without significant changes in aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, and globulin levels. The optimal Zn-AAC intake level for ALP activity was 1.45 mg bird <sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to dietary supplementation of 33.60 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Based on Zn body retention, we recommend up to 1.86 mg bird <sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> of Zn-AAC, which is equivalent to 43.10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.","author":"Gabriela Duarte Silva","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f34e962ecf6a8ac1a7989e97b3c6db1c93246cf29c58525b0cc408793a6c5fc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
