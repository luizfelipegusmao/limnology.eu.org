{"title":"Supplementary Dam Site Selection Using GIS-Remote Sensing Approach: A Case Study of Wivenhoe Dam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0244/v1","date":1712135213000,"content":"Flooding, exacerbated by climate change, poses a significant threat to certain areas, increasing in frequency and severity. In response, the construction of supplementary dams has emerged as a reliable solution for flood management. This study employs a Remote Sensing (RS) approach integrated with GIS to assess the feasibility of constructing a supplementary dam near Linville, Brisbane, Australia, with the aim of mit-igating floods and preventing overtopping failure at the Wivenhoe Dam. Using QGIS software and a 25-meter resolution DEM from the Queensland Spatial Catalogue ‘QSpatial’ website, four potential dam sites were analysed, considering cross-sections, watershed characteristics, and water volume calculations. Systematic selection criteria were applied to identify the most optimal option based on dam wall di-mensions, volume-to-area, and volume-to-cost ratios. The selected option was further assessed against predefined criteria, yielding one optimal choice. The study provides insights into the feasibility and ef-fectiveness of supplementary dam construction for flood mitigation in the region, with recommendations for future research and implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f518849e5306ff0355b168b6d9a1dea1bd674474162826c2f768deacecd3b76f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
