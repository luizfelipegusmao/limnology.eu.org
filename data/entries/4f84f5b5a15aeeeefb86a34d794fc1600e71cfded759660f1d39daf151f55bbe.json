{"title":"Integration of Laban Movement System’s Effort Theory in Biomechanical Analysis of Golf Swing: A Focus on the Initiation of the Downswing and Hip Turn Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0806/v1","date":1715579779000,"content":"This study explores the application of the Laban/Bartenieff Movement System (® LBMS), particularly its Effort component, to analyze the biomechanical dynamics of the golf swing. Focusing on the initiation of the downswing, this paper investigates how the instantaneous screw axis (ISA) with rotational and linear motions contributes to subsequent movements, such as the hip turn. We propose that the physical forces generated by the golf club, characterized by mass moment inertia, extend beyond the body's boundaries, such as through the hand grip. A skilled golfer’s ability to 'allow' these forces to influence body dynamics without opposing them is analyzed through the lens of LBMS's Free Flow Effort, suggesting an indulgent and expansive use of movement energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f84f5b5a15aeeeefb86a34d794fc1600e71cfded759660f1d39daf151f55bbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
