Because of the high rate of mutagenesis in SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult to develop a sustainable approach for prevention and treatment. The Envelope (E) protein is highly conserved among human coronaviruses. Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-1 E deficiency reduced viral propagation, suggesting that E inhibition might be an effective therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report inhibitory peptides against SARS-CoV-2 E protein named iPep-SARS2-E. Leveraging E-induced alterations in proton homeostasis and NFAT/AP-1 pathway in mammalian cells, we developed screening platforms to design and optimize the peptides that bind and inhibit E protein. Using Vero-E6 cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived branching lung organoid and mouse models with SARS-CoV-2, we found that iPep-SARS2-E significantly inhibits virus egress and reduces viral cytotoxicity and propagation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the peptide can be customizable for E protein of other human coronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The results indicate that E protein can be a potential therapeutic target for human coronaviruses.","author":"Ramsey Bekdash","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"fc7bf8c896280c2bcafb9a56c5447cce35526a63f5e7095c776679470714e394","category":"Environment"}
