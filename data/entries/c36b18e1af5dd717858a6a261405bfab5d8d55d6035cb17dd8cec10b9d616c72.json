{"title":"Research on parameterized modeling and mechanical characteristics of shearer cables","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304007","date":1717077600000,"content":"<p>by Lijuan Zhao, Haining Zhang, Feng Gao, Shijie Yang</p>\r\n\r\nShearer cables, subjected to large deformations and exposed to harsh working conditions during frequent back-and-forth movements, pose difficulties in achieving comprehensive mechanical performance and extended fatigue life. This study addresses parametric modeling challenges related to determining tangency within and between layers, recursively generating spiral curves from the (n-1)-th level to the n-th level, and constructing irregular surfaces for insulation and sheath. Investigating tensile and bending properties, the research explores the impact of varying pitch diameter ratios at different stranding levels, stranding directions, and monofilaments on mechanical performance across scales. The results reveal a nonlinear increase in stress in power and control conductors with growing pitch diameter ratios. The optimal combination is determined as a pitch diameter ratio of 6 for cabling, 5 for the control conductor, and 14 for the power conductor. The predicted fatigue life of the improved cable by Ncode aligns with bending test results, demonstrating functionality up to 15.12e<sup>4</sup> cycles. Stress distribution in parallel stranding is lower and more even, tending to scatter. Conversely, counter stranding experiences relatively higher stress, ensuring a more stable structure. While maintaining a constant effective conductor cross-sectional area, finer monofilaments result in higher cross-sectional filling ratios, enhancing tensile and bending performance.","author":"Lijuan Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c36b18e1af5dd717858a6a261405bfab5d8d55d6035cb17dd8cec10b9d616c72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
