{"title":"ZNF671 Silencing Affects Signalling Pathways in Head and Neck Cancer via Activation of Oncogenic Non-Coding RNAs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1654/v1","date":1724337195000,"content":"Novel ZNF proteins such as ZNF671 that are located on chromosome 19q13 are known to be hypermethylated at a high frequency in HNSCC as well as in other epithelial solid tumors. Their function is largely unknown. Here, we show that ZNF671 is epigenetically silenced in HNSCC primary tumors compared to matched adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, low expression of ZNF671 is significantly associated with decreased survival in HNSCC patients. Over-expression of ZNF671 in UM-SCC-1 oral cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in tumor cell mobility and invasion compared to the empty-vector control cells. Transcriptomic analysis showed that ZNF671 re-expression resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of a major oncogenic long non-coding RNA LINC00665. Together, these results suggest that epigenetic silencing of ZNF671 may activate multiple oncogenic signaling pathways via the resulting up-regulation of LINC00665.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fd7106f4316e6b66105df73df68f6fc9e844cf86c5212fbacedc2c6ee58054d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
