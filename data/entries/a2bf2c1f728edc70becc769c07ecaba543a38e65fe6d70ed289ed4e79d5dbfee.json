{"title":"The Impact of the Pdcd4, a Translation Inhibitor, on Drug Resistance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1669/v1","date":1727085216000,"content":"Programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) is a tumor suppressor, which has been demonstrated to efficiently suppress tumorigenesis. Biochemically, Pdcd4 binds with translation initiation factor 4A and represses protein translation. Beyond its role in tumor suppression, increasing evidence indicates that Pdcd4 enhances the chemosensitivity of several chemotherapeutic drugs. To date, several translational targets of Pdcd4 have been identified. These targets govern important signal transduction pathways, and their attenuation may enhance chemosensitivity or overcome drug resistance. This review will discuss the signal transduction pathways regulated by Pdcd4 and the potential mechanisms through which Pdcd4 enhances chemosensitivity or counteracts drug resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2bf2c1f728edc70becc769c07ecaba543a38e65fe6d70ed289ed4e79d5dbfee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
