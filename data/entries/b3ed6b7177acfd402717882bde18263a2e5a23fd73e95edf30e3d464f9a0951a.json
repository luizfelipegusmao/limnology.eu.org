{"title":"The structural basis for light harvesting in organisms producing phycobiliproteins","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4036/7656880?rss=1","date":1713830400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptophytes produce 2 classes of proteins for light harvesting: water-soluble phycobiliproteins (PBP) and membrane-intrinsic proteins that bind chlorophylls (Chls) and carotenoids. In cyanobacteria, red algae, and glaucophytes, phycobilisomes (PBS) are complexes of brightly colored PBP and linker (assembly) proteins. To date, 6 structural classes of PBS have been described: hemiellipsoidal, block-shaped, hemidiscoidal, bundle-shaped, paddle-shaped, and far-red-light bicylindrical. Two additional antenna complexes containing single types of PBP have also been described. Since 2017, structures have been reported for examples of all of these complexes except bundle-shaped PBS by cryogenic electron microscopy. PBS range in size from about 4.6 to 18 <span>m</span>Da and can include ∼900 polypeptides and bind &gt;2000 chromophores. Cyanobacteria additionally produce membrane-associated proteins of the PsbC/CP43 superfamily of Chl <span>a</span>/<span>b</span>/<span>d</span>-binding proteins, including the iron-stress protein IsiA and other paralogous Chl-binding proteins (CBP) that can form antenna complexes with Photosystem I (PSI) and/or Photosystem II (PSII). Red and cryptophyte algae also produce CBP associated with PSI but which belong to the Chl <span>a/b-</span>binding protein superfamily and which are unrelated to the CBP of cyanobacteria. This review describes recent progress in structure determination for PBS and the Chl proteins of cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptophytan algae.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"b3ed6b7177acfd402717882bde18263a2e5a23fd73e95edf30e3d464f9a0951a","category":"Environment"}
