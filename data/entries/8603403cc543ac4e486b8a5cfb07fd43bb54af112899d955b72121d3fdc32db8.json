The Merlin readout system for the Medipix3 chips was first designed for synchrotron applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.1084-B1\">1</a>] and offered various ways of integration through hardware and software means. This property helped with the integrability of the system and it is one of the reasons it has been widely accepted for direct electron detection in the transmission electron microscopy community.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8603403cc543ac4e486b8a5cfb07fd43bb54af112899d955b72121d3fdc32db8","category":"Environment"}
