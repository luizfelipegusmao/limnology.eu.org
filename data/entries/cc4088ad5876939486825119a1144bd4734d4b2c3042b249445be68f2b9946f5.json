{"title":"Improving Lightweight Structural Tuff Concrete Composition Using Three-Factor Experimental Planning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0738/v1","date":1718175807000,"content":"Research into lightweight structural concrete using volcanic tuff is of great importance to the construction industry. These materials have excellent thermal insulation properties, which helps improve the energy efficiency of buildings. A three-factor experimental design was used to build the statistical model. The test methods used were methods for determining the crushability of volcanic tuff, determining the average density, compressive strength and thermal conductivity of lightweight structural concrete. The influence of basalt fiber on the properties of lightweight structural concrete has been determined. The optimal compositions of lightweight structural concrete using tuff have been selected. The compressive strength of lightweight structural concrete reached 32.0 MPa. The average density range is 1754.6-2114.0 kg/m3. Good thermal conductivity values ​​were obtained in the range of 0.653-0.818 W/m·K. The article obtained the optimal compositions of lightweight structural concrete using volcanic tuff as a filler.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc4088ad5876939486825119a1144bd4734d4b2c3042b249445be68f2b9946f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
