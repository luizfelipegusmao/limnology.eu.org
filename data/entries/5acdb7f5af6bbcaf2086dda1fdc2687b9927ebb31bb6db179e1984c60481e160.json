{"title":"The Influence of Supply Chain Risk Management on Marketing Strategies During Economic Uncertainty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1694/v1","date":1719303096000,"content":"The qualitative research on the influence of supply chain risk management (SCRM) on marketing strategies during economic uncertainty explores the complex interplay between these two critical areas. Conducted through in-depth interviews with industry professionals across various sectors, the study examines how organizations manage supply chain risks and adapt their marketing strategies in response to challenges such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, economic downturns, and pandemics. The findings reveal that these risks significantly impact marketing efforts by causing supply shortages, delays, increased costs, and demand fluctuations, necessitating rapid adjustments in promotional activities, pricing strategies, and communication with customers. Key strategies for integrating SCRM with marketing include leveraging technology for real-time supply chain monitoring, building strong supplier relationships, diversifying supply sources, and enhancing communication and collaboration between supply chain and marketing teams. These practices enable organizations to enhance their resilience and responsiveness, ensuring that marketing strategies are aligned with the evolving realities of the supply chain. The study also identifies challenges such as organizational silos, lack of cross-functional collaboration, resistance to change, and limited technological capabilities, which can hinder effective integration. Addressing these barriers through fostering collaboration, investing in technology, and promoting change management is essential for achieving successful integration. The outcomes of this integration include improved supply chain resilience, enhanced customer satisfaction, increased marketing agility, and a stronger competitive position. The research underscores the importance of a holistic and adaptive approach to integrating SCRM with marketing strategies, providing valuable insights for organizations seeking to navigate economic uncertainty and sustain their growth in a rapidly changing environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5acdb7f5af6bbcaf2086dda1fdc2687b9927ebb31bb6db179e1984c60481e160","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
