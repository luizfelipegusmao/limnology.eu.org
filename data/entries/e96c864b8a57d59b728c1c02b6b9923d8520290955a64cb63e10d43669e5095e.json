{"title":"Association between gait speed deterioration and EEG abnormalities","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305074","date":1717509600000,"content":"<p>by Daysi García-Agustin, Valia Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Rosa Ma Morgade-Fonte, María A. Bobes, Lídice Galán-García</p>\r\n\r\nPhysical and cognitive decline at an older age is preceded by changes that accumulate over time until they become clinically evident difficulties. These changes, frequently overlooked by patients and health professionals, may respond better than fully established conditions to strategies designed to prevent disabilities and dependence in later life. The objective of this study was twofold; to provide further support for the need to screen for early functional changes in older adults and to look for an early association between decline in mobility and cognition. A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted on 95 active functionally independent community-dwelling older adults in Havana, Cuba. We measured their gait speed at the usual pace and the cognitive status using the MMSE. A value of 0.8 m/s was used as the cut-off point to decide whether they presented a decline in gait speed. A quantitative analysis of their EEG at rest was also performed to look for an associated subclinical decline in brain function. Results show that 70% of the sample had a gait speed deterioration (i.e., lower than 0.8 m/s), of which 80% also had an abnormal EEG frequency composition for their age. While there was no statistically significant difference in the MMSE score between participants with a gait speed above and below the selected cut-off, individuals with MMSE scores below 25 also had a gait speed&lt;0.8 m/s and an abnormal EEG frequency composition. Our results provide further evidence of early decline in older adults–even if still independent and active—and point to the need for clinical pathways that incorporate screening and early intervention targeted at early deterioration to prolong the years of functional life in older age.","author":"Daysi García-Agustin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e96c864b8a57d59b728c1c02b6b9923d8520290955a64cb63e10d43669e5095e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
