{"title":"Hotels Recreational Water Safety: Lessons from COVID-19 Pandemic and Way Forward for a Safe Aquatic Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0582/v1","date":1728389014000,"content":"The recreational waters of hotels are widely used by locals and travelers all around the world and this impacts public health. In this regard, WHO frequently offers recommendations - especially in the COVID-19 era - so operators and managers of public pools, hot tubs or splash pads should continue to follow. This study aims to evaluate the microbiological results of COVID-19 sanitation protocols in recreational waters in hotels during the summer periods of post-COVID-19 (2020–2022) and compare them with those of pre-COVID-19 (2019). We found positive samples for different parameters in the period of 2019: 11.5 % for total coliforms (18/157), 12.2% for common aerobic bacteria (19/156), 2.9% for E. coli (5/170), and 18.2% for P. aeruginosa (27/148). For the pandemic years, the percentages of positive samples were: 8.1% for total coliforms (40/493), 1.3% for common aerobic bacteria (7/526), 1.3% for E. coli (7/526), and 18.4% for P. aeruginosa (83/450). The study found that the relative risk (RR) from the presence of P. aeruginosa in recreational waters with chlorination 25°C. Although non-compliance decreased at the beginning of the pandemic due to strict health protocols, this gradually stopped.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34ed180d8ff5a6f33b6b7b38f314cfd36d65c87affd64a33b6ee9cc911a6c351","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
