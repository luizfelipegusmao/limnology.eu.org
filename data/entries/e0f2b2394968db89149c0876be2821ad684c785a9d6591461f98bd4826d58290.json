{"title":"Solubility/Insolubility: A Possible Option for Recycling Polystyrene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1983/v1","date":1721859199000,"content":"This work proposes a conceptual design for a process for recovering Polystyrene (PS) using solvents of agro-industrial origin. The literature describes the dilution of Expanded Polyestyrene (EPS) in limonene, followed by its insolubilization with alcohols for recovery. However, there is no information on the solubility limit for the PS + limonene + alcohol system, which is critical for the process design. To determine the solubility limit, we diluted the waste EPS in D-limonene, mixed it with ethanol to form a precipitate, and used a gravimetric method to measure the mass of the compounds. These results allowed for the conceptual design of an EPS recycling process using a chemical process simulator, which includes a separator, a distillation column, and auxiliary equipment such as heaters, coolers, and pumps. An empirical correlation was obtained for the solubility limit, which enabled the design of a process for the treatment of 52 kg/s of PS using 0.75 kg /s of ethanol and 2.4 kg / s of D-limonene once the stationary state had been reached. The distillation column is six-stage, with a reflux ratio of 1.5 and duties of 30 000 kW and -25 847 kW for the condenser and reboiler, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0f2b2394968db89149c0876be2821ad684c785a9d6591461f98bd4826d58290","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
