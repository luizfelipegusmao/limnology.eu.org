{"title":"Building Effective Social Media Strategies for Business: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0379/v1","date":1728279387000,"content":"This study examines the development of effective social media strategies for businesses, focusing on how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can leverage these strategies to boost revenue and sustain growth. In the context of a dynamic digital environment, SMEs face challenges in maximizing the benefits of social media platforms due to limited resources and expertise. Using the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this study analyzed sixty-nine research papers to identify key strategies that contribute to successful social media marketing. The review considered factors such as content quality, engagement techniques, platform selection, and targeted advertising. The findings suggest that tailored strategies that align with business objectives and audience needs, coupled with consistent engagement and content relevance, lead to more significant revenue growth and customer retention. However, the lack of data on long-term impacts and industry-specific insights limits the generalizability of these findings. This study provides a foundation for SMEs to develop strategic social media marketing plans, but further research is needed to explore long-term effects and industry-specific variations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dae408061b3c1874bb465652668eee84b1e8660720dde6d9b291531547caaf66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
