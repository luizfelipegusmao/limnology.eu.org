{"title":"An Experience Report on Designing and Delivering of a Software Engineering Education Module to Enhance Employability Skills","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1690/v1","date":1729595192000,"content":"Software Engineering education has grown during the past couple of decades as a specialized branch of computer science education to address employment demands.  Software Engineering education is constantly evolving because of its dynamic nature. However, there are still some gaps between the skills being taught in the universities and skills required for employment.   In this paper, we present our experience of designing and delivering a new module to enhance skills for employment. We have taken a structured approach to analyze the gap through literature review and our personal experiences of engaging with employers of our students. Based on the analysis, we arrived at a set of gaps between what we teach and what the employers of our students need.  We prioritized the gaps and envisaged a new module ‘Contemporary Software Engineering’ to address the gaps and subsequently help our students for an easy transition to job. As part of our experience, we present the background, design and delivery of the module and reflect on our journey of delivering the module for a few years.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07e1d4390a0c5d3c6284463cb47412b96d9dc8bbbd1888cfb5163bc3718e6a88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
