{"title":"Estimation of winter wheat LAI based on color indices and texture features of RGB images taken by UAV","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13817?af=R","date":1723801173000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator for assessing plant growth and development, and is also closely related to photosynthesis in plants. The realization of rapid accurate estimation of crop LAI plays an important role in guiding farmland production. In study, the UAV-RGB technology was used to estimate LAI based on 65 winter wheat varieties at different fertility periods, the wheat varieties including farm varieties, main cultivars, new lines, core germplasm and foreign varieties. Color indices (CIs) and texture features were extracted from RGB images to determine their quantitative link to LAI.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results revealed that among the extracted image features, LAI exhibited a significant positive correlation with CIs (<i>r</i> = 0.801), whereas there was a significant negative correlation with texture features (<i>r</i> = −0.783). Furthermore, the visible atmospheric resistance index, the green–red vegetation index, the modified green–red vegetation index in the CIs, and the mean in the texture features demonstrated a strong correlation with the LAI with <i>r</i> &gt; 0.8. With reference to the model input variables, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model of LAI based on the CIs and texture features (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.730, RMSE = 0.691, RPD = 1.927) outperformed other models constructed by individual variables.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study offers a theoretical basis and technical reference for precise monitor on winter wheat LAI based on consumer-level UAVs. The BPNN model, incorporating CIs and texture features, proved to be superior in estimating LAI, and offered a reliable method for monitoring the growth of winter wheat. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hao Li, \nXiaobin Yan, \nPengyan Su, \nYiming Su, \nJunfeng Li, \nZixin Xu, \nChunrui Gao, \nYu Zhao, \nMeichen Feng, \nFahad Shafiq, \nLujie Xiao, \nWude Yang, \nXingxing Qiao, \nChao Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c30e52621669ee3eb819f31dd38bf4318d350f9349341373eb8c300842143c71","category":"Environment"}
