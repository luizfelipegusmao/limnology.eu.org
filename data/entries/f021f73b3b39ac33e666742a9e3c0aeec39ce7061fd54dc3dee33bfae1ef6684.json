Subsequent steps involve the analysis of various regions and objects, such as grains and phases. Historically, these steps relied heavily on manual intervention. However, AI-driven automation has revolutionized these microscopy workflows, leading to increased throughput and high reproducibility.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f021f73b3b39ac33e666742a9e3c0aeec39ce7061fd54dc3dee33bfae1ef6684","category":"Environment"}
