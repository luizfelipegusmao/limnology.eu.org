Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known geneticâ€“ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the <i>p</i>-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.","author":"Nhung Hoang","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"de6bb22431ebaee9ae8080cc108b4a31d2dacf06f2c7935ac97d5acdc9b88f36","category":"Environment"}
