{"title":"Univariate Outlier Detection: Precision-Driven Algorithm for Single-Cluster Scenarios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2008/v1","date":1714473260000,"content":"This study introduces a novel algorithm tailored for the precise detection of lower outliers in univariate datasets, particularly suited for scenarios with a single cluster. The approach leverages a combination of transformative techniques and advanced filtration methods to efficiently segregate anomalies from normal values. Notably, the algorithm emphasizes high precision, ensuring minimal false positives, and requires only a few parameters for configuration. Its unsupervised nature enables robust anomaly filtering without the need for extensive manual intervention. To validate its efficacy, the algorithm is rigorously tested using real-world data obtained from photovoltaic (PV) module strings with similar DC capacities, containing various anomalies. Results demonstrate the algorithm's capability to accurately identify lower outliers while maintaining computational efficiency and reliability in practical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77639137684202c284eb671dc3d2aeffd51a161c2ae4b23ede98f8b982c31d30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
