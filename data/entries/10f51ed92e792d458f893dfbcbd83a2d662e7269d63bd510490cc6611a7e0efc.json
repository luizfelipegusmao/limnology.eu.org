{"title":"Modelling of Texture Development during Metal Forming Using FE-VPSC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0456/v1","date":1715175763000,"content":"In directional forming processes such as rolling and extrusion, the microstructure is strongly elongated in the forming direction. This results in a preferred alignment of the crystal orientations of the initially randomly oriented grains. These preferred orientations – the texture – and elongations of the grains are the cause of the material anisotropy. This anisotropy leads to phenomena such as earing, which occur during further forming processes, e.g., during deep drawing of sheet metal. Considering anisotropic properties in numerical simulations allows to investigate the effects of texture-dependent defects in forming processes and the development of possible solutions. Purely phenomenological models for modelling anisotropy work by fitting material parameters or applying measured R-values in experiments which are applied to all elements of the part and remain constant over the duration of the simulation. In contrast, methods such as the Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (VPSC) model, which has been used in this work, provide a deeper insight into the development of the material microstructure. By experimentally measuring the initial texture and using it as an initial condition for the simulations, it is possible to predict the evolution of the microstructure and the resulting effect on the mechanical properties during forming operations. The results of the simulations with VPSC show good qualitative agreement with tests typically used for rolled stock.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10f51ed92e792d458f893dfbcbd83a2d662e7269d63bd510490cc6611a7e0efc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
