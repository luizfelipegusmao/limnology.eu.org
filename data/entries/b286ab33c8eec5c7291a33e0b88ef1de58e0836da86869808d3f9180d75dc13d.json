{"title":"Progress of research on aroma absorption mechanism and aroma fixation pathway of jasmine green tea","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13656?af=R","date":1718439552000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This overview summarizes the latest research progress on the aroma absorption mechanism and aroma fixation pathway of jasmine green tea, and discusses in depth the aroma absorption mechanism of green tea, the aroma release mechanism of jasmine flowers, as well as the absorption and fixation mechanism of the aroma components of jasmine green tea in the process of scenting, to provide a theoretical basis for the improvement of the quality of jasmine green tea and the innovation of processing technology. It was found that the aroma absorption mechanism of jasmine green tea is mainly associated with both physical and chemical adsorption, aroma release in jasmine involves the phenylpropanoid/benzoin biosynthetic pathway, β-glycosidase enzymes interpreting putative glycosidic groups, and heat shock proteins (HSPs) as molecular chaperones to prevent stress damage in postharvest flowers due to high temperatures and to promote the release of aroma components, and so forth. The preparation of aroma-protein nano-complexes, heat stress microcapsules, and the spraying of polymeric substances – β-cyclodextrin are three examples of aroma-fixing pathways. This overview also summarizes the problems and future development trends of the current research and proposes the method of loading benzyl acetate, the main aroma component of jasmine, through konjac glucomannan (KGM)-based gel to solve the problem of volatile aroma and difficult-to-fix aroma, which provides a reference for the sustainable development of the jasmine green tea industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yueguang Wang, \nZifeng Huang, \nTaoyi Zhou, \nCharlie Li, \nYilan Sun, \nJie Pang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b286ab33c8eec5c7291a33e0b88ef1de58e0836da86869808d3f9180d75dc13d","category":"Environment"}
