{"title":"Effects of medicine food homologous materials on food allergy‐associated factors: intestinal oxidative stress, intestinal inflammation and Th2 immune response","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13276?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Food allergies could be regulated via Th1/Th2 balance, intestinal oxidative stress and inflammation, which were considered as food allergy-associated factors. Medicine-food homologous materials (MFHM) were considered as a significant factor with respect to preventing human diseases. To evaluate the associations between MFHM and food allergy-associated factors, two types of MFHM with the remarkable function of anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation, <i>Gardeniae fructus</i> (Gar) and <i>Sophorae glos</i> (Sop), were chosen.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>By constructing an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress model of Caco-2 cells and an intestinal inflammatory cell model of Caco-2 cells with tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-13, the contents of anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD and GSH), inflammatory factor (IL-8) and tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, occludin and claudin-1) in Caco-2 cells were determined. Moreover, the anti-allergic effects of digestive Sop and Gar were evaluated by measuring the levels of Th1/Th2/Treg cytokines in the spleen cells of sensitized mice. The results showed that the SOD and GSH were obviously increased and the gene and protein expression of IL-8 and claudin-1 were improved with the incubation of digested Sop. Th2 cytokine was reduced and Th1/Th2 balance was promoted on coincubation with ovalbumin (OVA) and digested Sop in the splenocytes. However, the digested Gar had no effect.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The digested Sop not only had suppressive effects on intestinal oxidative stress and inflammation, but also had regulative effects on Th1/Th2 balance. This finding demonstrated that not all of the MFHM with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects have anti-allergic activities. The present study may be contributing toward establishing a screening model to identify the anti-allergic MFHM. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiaoqian Xu, \nQian Wang, \nPing Tong, \nXin Li, \nXuanyi Meng, \nYong Wu, \nJuanli Yuan, \nHongbing Chen, \nJinyan Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3d2a70bcde0c99d6e1a4b32d5e1a882bb6c823088d352d459b20d89ea23dd597","category":"Environment"}
