{"title":"The Healing Power of Plants: Herbal Compounds as Guardians against Antiretroviral and Antitubercular Drugs-Induced Hepatotoxicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0039/v1","date":1711961964000,"content":"Drugs are known to cause substantial liver injury, with hepatotoxicity ranging from asymptomatic increase of liver enzymes to hepatic failure. HIV/AIDS patients, with compromised immune systems, are especially vulnerable to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Patients with co-infection frequently get combined antiretroviral (ART) and antitubercular (ATD) regimens, which can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity has been linked to commonly administered antiretroviral drug regimens as well as first-line antitubercular agents such isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, which are required for the treatment of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis. As a result, there is an urgent need to investigate treatments based from traditional herbs known for their hepatoprotective abilities against ART and ATD-induced liver injury. Many researchers have investigated the effectiveness of medicinal plants in treating chemically caused hepatotoxicity. Medicinal plants are high in phytochemicals and secondary metabolites, both of which have a variety of medicinal benefits. Currently, there is a lack of specific therapeutic regimens to address this adverse effect, and management often relies on symptomatic treatment or therapy withdrawal. Traditional medicinal plants may have the potential to restore normal liver function, enzyme activity, and cellular structure in response to ART and ATD-induced hepatotoxicity. This review aims to examine the scientific evidence supporting the use of medicinal plants as hepatoprotective agents against liver damage induced by ART and ATDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e4be2f6cd5a5bd83ea749f8848e1790a93dc7250592489a1d3deb18f5a5fef0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
