There is cause for concern amongst growers who are facing pressure from wireworms because there are a decreasing number of effective pesticides that can be used for wireworm management. Most research on pest elaterids has focused on the wireworm stage, which is the damage causing life stage. Recently, the focus in elaterid research has shifted to the adult click beetle stage, including identification of semiochemicals and development of effective traps. However, there is still a lot to be discovered about the basic biology of click beetles, including their feeding ecology. In an effort to understand the feeding ecology of click beetles, we investigated the presence of plant DNA in the digestive tracts of <span>Limonius californicus</span> (Mann.), <span>L. canus</span> (LeConte), and <span>L. infuscatus</span> (Mots.) beetles collected in 3 different locations within central Washington. To examine dietary histories of beetles and wireworms, specimens were collected from natural habitats and high-throughput sequencing of the plant genes trnF and ITS was used to identify their dietary history. Results revealed that click beetles do feed on a large variety of plants, which included a large quantity of brassicaceous plants commonly found in areas surrounding wireworm infested plots. The identification of the dietary history of the click beetles allowed us to infer their landscape-scale movements thus providing a means to better understand their behavior.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"34bfc24305a71356ea855bf1a7a32d86df62fe1f8124a38c69931976c7912118","category":"Environment"}
