{"title":"Solid State Fermentation of Cereal Waste Improves the Bioavailability and Yield of Bacterial Cellulose Production by a Novel Novacetimonas sp. Isolate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0839/v1","date":1720608868000,"content":"Cereal wastes such as rice bran and cereal dust are valuable yet underutilised by-products of grain processing. This study aimed to bio-convert these wastes into bacterial cellulose (BC), an emerging sustainable and renewable biomaterial, via an inexpensive solid-state fermentation (SSF) pre-treatment using three mould isolates. Medium substitution by directly using untreated rice bran or cereal dust did not significantly increase the yield of bacterial cellulose produced by a novel Novacetimonas sp. isolate (NCBI accession number PP421219) compared to the standard Hestrin-Schramm (HS) medium. In contrast, rice bran fermented with Rhizopus oligosporus yielded the highest bacterial cellulose (1.55 ± 0.6 g/L dry weight) compared to the untreated control (0.45 ± 0.1 g/L dry weight), demonstrating up to 22 % increase in yield. Using the SSF process, the media production costs were reduced by up to 90% compared to standard HS medium. Physicochemical characterisation using SEM, EDS, FTIR, XPS, XRD, and TGA were performed to gain insights into the internal structure, morphology, and chemical bonding of different produced BC, which revealed comparable biopolymer properties between BC produced in standard and waste-based media. Hence, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of fungal SSF for transforming abundant cereal waste into BC, providing a circular economy solution to reduce waste and convert them into by-products to enhance the sustainability of the cereal industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8692b8f83b51ec32cb9e29c7faff739bb612bbaa9a6da1c29c7725e931072b7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
