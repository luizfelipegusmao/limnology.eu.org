When epitaxially grown on a substrate material, lattice mismatch induces stress at the interface, leading to localized lattice deformations known as strain. Knowledge of both the alloy concentrations and the resulting strain is essential feedback in the device manufacturing process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6ed375fc178b51c51009b1219a243887c1bdb5200da61dbfa93941361948d94c","category":"Environment"}
