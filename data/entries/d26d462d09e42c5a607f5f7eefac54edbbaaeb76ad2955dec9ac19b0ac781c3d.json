In that respect, transition metal (TM) oxides, for which the partially filled <span>d</span> shell of the TM element leads to a wide range of unusual properties, are of particular interest. Their properties could in principle be tuned with the controlled interplay of several degrees of freedom like lattice, orbital, charge, and spin. Among the plethora of candidate compounds under investigation, nickel oxide (NiO) has become a major focus since the experimental evidence of excitonic excitations involving Ni <span>d</span> electrons [<a href=\"#ozae044.753-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.753-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d26d462d09e42c5a607f5f7eefac54edbbaaeb76ad2955dec9ac19b0ac781c3d","category":"Environment"}
