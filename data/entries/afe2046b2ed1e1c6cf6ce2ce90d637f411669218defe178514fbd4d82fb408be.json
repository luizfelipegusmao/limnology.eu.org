{"title":"The Finite&ndash;Time Turnpike Property in Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1283/v1","date":1724122969000,"content":"The finite-time turnpike property describes the situation in an optimal control problem where an optimal trajectory reaches the  desired state before the  end of the time interval and remains there.\n\nWe consider a machine learning problem with a  neural ordinary differential equation that can be seen as a homogenization of  a deep ResNet.\n\nWe show that with appropriate scaling  of the quadratic control cost and the non-smooth  tracking term the optimal control problem  has the finite-time turnpike property, that is the desired  state is reached in the interior of the time interval and the optimal state remains there until the terminal time $T$.\n\nThis property is useful to achieve a compromise between the depth of the network and the size of the optimal system parameters which we hope will be useful to determine optimal depths for neural network architectures in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afe2046b2ed1e1c6cf6ce2ce90d637f411669218defe178514fbd4d82fb408be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
