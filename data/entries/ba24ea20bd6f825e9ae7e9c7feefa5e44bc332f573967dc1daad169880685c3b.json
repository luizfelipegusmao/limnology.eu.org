{"title":"Repetition increases belief in climate-skeptical claims, even for climate science endorsers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307294","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Yangxueqing Jiang, Norbert Schwarz, Katherine J. Reynolds, Eryn J. Newman</p>\r\n\r\nDoes repeated exposure to climate-skeptic claims influence their acceptance as true, even among climate science endorsers? Research with general knowledge claims shows that repeated exposure to a claim increases its perceived truth when it is encountered again. However, motivated cognition research suggests that people primarily endorse what they already believe. Across two experiments, climate science endorsers were more likely to believe claims that were consistent with their prior beliefs, but repeated exposure increased perceptions of truth for climate-science and climate-skeptic claims to a similar extent. Even counter-attitudinal claims benefit from previous exposure, highlighting the insidious effect of repetition.","author":"Yangxueqing Jiang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ba24ea20bd6f825e9ae7e9c7feefa5e44bc332f573967dc1daad169880685c3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
