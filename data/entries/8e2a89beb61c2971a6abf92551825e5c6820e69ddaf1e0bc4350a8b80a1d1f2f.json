{"title":"China&rsquo;s Financial Market Infrastructures: An Updated Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1893/v1","date":1729763343000,"content":"Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) are crucial for the efficient operation of financial markets. However, studies focusing on Chinese FMIs are limited. Following the release of a draft regulation on Chinese FMIs in December 2022, this study, building on Zhang and Yin (2023), provides an updated analysis. It introduces non-central bank affiliated FMIs with the latest data, explores the evolution of regulatory reforms, and examines the newly-released regulations. In particular, it offers a critical review of specific regulations and their implications for China's recent policy shift towards prioritizing security and establishing financial dominance. Finally, the study outlines a research agenda for future investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e2a89beb61c2971a6abf92551825e5c6820e69ddaf1e0bc4350a8b80a1d1f2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
