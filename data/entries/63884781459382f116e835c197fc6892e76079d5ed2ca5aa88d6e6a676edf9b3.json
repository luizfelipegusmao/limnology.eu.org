{"title":"Impact of Board Committee Characteristics on Social Sustainability Reporting in Sub-Saharan Africa: Moderating Role of Institutional Ownership","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0957/v1","date":1718355459000,"content":"The corporate strategic planning of businesses in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) largely focuses on immediate financial performances with minimal credence to social sustainability. Thus, studies on the linkage between corporate governance and sustainability reporting have focused on developed economies. This study therefore investigated the role of institutional ownership in the impact of board committee characteristics on social sustainability reporting. The study involved strongly balanced panel data with 1,969 observations of 275 publicly listed non-financial firms in SSA within the timeframe of 2012 to 2021. Data was analyzed using STATA 14.1. The hypotheses were tested using the two-step system of the generalized method of moment (GMM) using the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel-data estimation method. The rate of social sustainability reporting was 39.4%. Relatively, Mauritius and South African firms had the most effective board committee characteristics and higher levels of social sustainability reporting. Institutional ownership had no significant effect on social sustainability reporting. Institutional ownership moderated the effect of sustainability committee independence and sustainability committee gender diversity on social sustainability reporting negatively. The paper presents a new perspective on corporate governance and social sustainability literature by examining the effect of institutional ownership on board committee characteristics and social sustainability reporting in SSA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63884781459382f116e835c197fc6892e76079d5ed2ca5aa88d6e6a676edf9b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
