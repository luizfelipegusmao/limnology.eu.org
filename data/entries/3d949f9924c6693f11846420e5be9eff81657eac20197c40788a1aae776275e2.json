Here, we propose a multi-proxy approach based on tree rings and tree-ring isotopes to assess the acclimation processes of the long-term Pfynwald irrigation experiment. After 10 years of irrigation, our results showed that irrigated and control trees were acclimated to the ecosystem capacity, functioning at an equilibrium state adjusted to the prevailing environmental conditions. Meanwhile, trees that stopped receiving irrigation after 10 years functioned in a physiological imbalance, thus not yet adjusted to the new conditions. This approach provides insights into complex acclimation dynamics, essential for detecting ecosystem imbalances and forest decline.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) is a common European tree species, and understanding its acclimation to the rapidly changing climate through physiological, biochemical or structural adjustments is vital for predicting future growth. We investigated a long-term irrigation experiment at a naturally dry forest in Switzerland, comparing Scots pine trees that have been continuously irrigated for 17 years (<i>irrigated</i>) with those for which irrigation was interrupted after 10 years (<i>stop</i>) and non-irrigated trees (<i>control</i>), using tree growth, xylogenesis, wood anatomy, and carbon, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope measurements in the water, sugars and cellulose of plant tissues. The dendrochronological analyses highlighted three distinct acclimation phases to the treatments: irrigated trees experienced (i) a significant growth increase in the first 4 years of treatment, (ii) high growth rates but with a declining trend in the following 8 years and finally (iii) a regression to pre-irrigation growth rates, suggesting the development of a new growth limitation (i.e. acclimation). The introduction of the stop treatment resulted in further growth reductions to below-control levels during the third phase. Irrigated trees showed longer growth periods and lower tree-ring δ<sup>13</sup>C values, reflecting lower stomatal restrictions than control trees. Their strong tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H (O–H) relationship reflected the hydrological signature similarly to the control. On the contrary, the stop trees had lower growth rates, conservative wood anatomical traits, and a weak O–H relationship, indicating a physiological imbalance. Tree vitality (identified by crown transparency) significantly modulated growth, wood anatomical traits and tree-ring δ<sup>13</sup>C, with low-vitality trees of all treatments performing similarly regardless of water availability. We thus provide quantitative indicators for assessing physiological imbalance and tree acclimation after environmental stresses. We also show that tree vitality is crucial in shaping such responses. These findings are fundamental for the early assessment of ecosystem imbalances and decline under climate change.</p>","author":"Valentina Vitali, \nPhilipp Schuler, \nMeisha Holloway‐Phillips, \nPetra D'Odorico, \nClaudia Guidi, \nStefan Klesse, \nMarco M.
