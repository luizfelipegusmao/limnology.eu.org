This study also proposes an enhanced Field Oriented Control scheme that accounts for the inverter voltage drop enabling efficient drive at very low motor-speeds. Experimental results are provided to verify the theoretical study and the proposed control scheme.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5145a947610b34fdbeef448e6be716c39035a92efdde7a436a3b4f7427122e29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
