{"title":"Governance Arrangements for Local Sustainable Business Models: The Case of Local Energy Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1879/v1","date":1729757316000,"content":"Despite extensive research on sustainable business models and the development of various tools to facilitate their implementation, barriers persist particularly concerning the governance of a local ecosystem of actors. In this paper, we bridge the literature on sustainable business models with a literature stream on governance arrangements. We analyze these governance arrangements through a qualitative study focusing on the development of two local energy systems –anaerobic digestion and district heating– by a global energy company. Our study shows the importance of securing collaboration to govern interdependencies in the ecosystem. We identify that a facilitating public policy framework combined with internal institutional, strategic and operational drivers linked to the governance of local ecosystems is crucial for the implementation of local sustainable business models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f63193bbd58001fd97d3e72af3a7ff0efe9936125977a75483d3389d3435a1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
