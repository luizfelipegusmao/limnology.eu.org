{"title":"Minimum Isolation Distance to Prevent Cross Pollination between Grain Amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) and Wild Relatives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2057/v1","date":1719612454000,"content":"The increase in the frequency of droughts in Africa has increased the interest in crops with drought escape mechanisms like grain Amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus). However, the white-seeded grain Amaranth is easily cross-pollinated by its black seeded wild relatives such as smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus). A study to investigate a minimum isolation distance enough to prevent seed contamination study was carried out at three sites namely Gweru and Bindura (2020/2021 rainy season) and Shamva (2021/2022 rainy season). Smooth pigweed was planted at distances of 3 to 150 m from pure grain Amaranth. Close monitoring of phenology and measurement of meteorological conditions such as temperature, wind speed and direction were done during the anthesis period. Cross-pollination in grain Amaranth was influenced by distance from the pollen source. A maximum of 12.9 % contamination rate was measured within the 10 m radius from the pollen donor plot and a minimum outcrossing rate of 0.45 % was recorded at the widest distance of 150 m. It can be concluded that complete removal of wild relatives of grain Amaranth is important within the field at as far as 150 m from the crop.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21cc0274939d34ea78a28556bc353584cd28da07d767031b7bde3a27b52ab647","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
