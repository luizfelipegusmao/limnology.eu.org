{"title":"Relationship of Body Condition Score, Body Parameters and Body Carcass Fat in Coopworth Breeding Ewes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0438/v1","date":1712312019000,"content":"The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between body condition score (BCS) and body carcass fat (BCF) of ewes at two key stages of the production cycle. Data were collected from 88 Coopworth ewes including BCS measurements manually evaluated by the farm manager, BCF measurements determined by computerized tomography (CT) and body parameter measurements automatically determined by an image processing application. Artificial neural network (ANN) statistical analysis method was used to develop a relationship between the body parameters and the BCF with an r2=0.96 and RMSE=1.01 using all top and side variables.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bc913235df6fd1657d31143e4bf1e85e768f04ebf270fbc16471ce4f16bfdb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
