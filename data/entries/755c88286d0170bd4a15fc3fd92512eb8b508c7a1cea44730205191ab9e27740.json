{"title":"A neural network approach to predict opioid misuse among previously hospitalized patients using electronic health records","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309424","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Lucas Vega, Winslow Conneen, Michael A. Veronin, Robert P. Schumaker</p>\r\n\r\nCan Electronic Health Records (EHR) predict opioid misuse in general patient populations? This research trained three backpropagation neural networks to explore EHR predictors using existing patient data. Model 1 used patient diagnosis codes and was 75.5% accurate. Model 2 used patient prescriptions and was 64.9% accurate. Model 3 used both patient diagnosis codes and patient prescriptions and was 74.5% accurate. This suggests patient diagnosis codes are best able to predict opioid misuse. Opioid misusers have higher rates of drug abuse/mental health disorders than the general population, which could explain the performance of diagnosis predictors. In additional testing, Model 1 misclassified only 1.9% of negative cases (non-abusers), demonstrating a low type II error rate. This suggests further clinical implementation is viable. We hope to motivate future research to explore additional methods for universal opioid misuse screening.","author":"Lucas Vega","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"755c88286d0170bd4a15fc3fd92512eb8b508c7a1cea44730205191ab9e27740","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
