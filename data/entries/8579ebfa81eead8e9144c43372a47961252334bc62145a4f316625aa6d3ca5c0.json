{"title":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2568/v1","date":1722420083000,"content":"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are at a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, advancements in endoscopic imaging techniques, integrated surveillance programs, and improved medical therapies have led to a decrease in the incidence of CRC among IBD patients. Currently, the management of patients with IBD who have a history of or ongoing active malignancy is an unmet need. This involves balancing the risk of cancer recurrence/progression with the potential exacerbation of IBD if the medications are discontinued. The objective of this review is to provide an updated summary of the epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and surveillance approaches for CRC in individuals with IBD, and to offer practical guidance on managing IBD patients with history of previous or active cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8579ebfa81eead8e9144c43372a47961252334bc62145a4f316625aa6d3ca5c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
