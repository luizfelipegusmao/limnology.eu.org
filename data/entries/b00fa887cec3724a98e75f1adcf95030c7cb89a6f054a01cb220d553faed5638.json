{"title":"Batch To Continuous: From Laboratory Recycle Trickle Bed Test Reactor Data to Full Scale Plant Preliminary Design&mdash;A Case Study Based on the Hydrogenation of Resorcinol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1781/v1","date":1711634405000,"content":"The fine chemical and pharmaceutical sectors are starting to advocate the use of flow chemistry due to reasons such as EHS, environmental, efficiency, cost saving and regulatory compliance. The use of trickle bed or fixed bed system could replace a batch autoclave typically used for hydrogenation reactions. However, there are few studies which detail the process from laboratory proof of concept through design to commercial realization. This study, using the production of 1,3-cyclohexanedione from catalytic hydrogenation of resorcinol as a case study demonstrates how the laboratory-scale recycle trickle bed can be used for catalyst screening and selection. Further, design data are generated by operation over a range of design superficial velocities and operating pressure that are used to derive a design correlation that is then used to specify a single stream plant at a level of definition consistent with a Preliminary Design for capital cost estimation. Finally, the further actions required in terms of data generation to increase the level of definition and confidence to a Sanction Grade or Final Design are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b00fa887cec3724a98e75f1adcf95030c7cb89a6f054a01cb220d553faed5638","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
