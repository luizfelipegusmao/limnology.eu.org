{"title":"Biparental graph strategy to represent and analyze hybrid plant genomes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1284/7712422?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hybrid plants are found extensively in the wild, and they often demonstrate superior performance of complex traits over their parents and other selfing plants. This phenomenon, known as heterosis, has been extensively applied in plant breeding for decades. However, the process of decoding hybrid plant genomes has seriously lagged due to the challenges associated with genome assembly and the lack of appropriate methodologies for their subsequent representation and analysis. Here, we present the assembly and analysis of 2 hybrids, an intraspecific hybrid between 2 maize (<span>Zea mays</span> ssp. <span>mays</span>) inbred lines and an interspecific hybrid between maize and its wild relative teosinte (<span>Z. mays</span> ssp. <span>parviglumis</span>), utilizing a combination of PacBio High Fidelity sequencing and chromatin conformation capture sequencing data. The haplotypic assemblies are well phased at chromosomal scale, successfully resolving the complex loci with extensive parental structural variations (SVs). By integrating into a biparental genome graph, the haplotypic assemblies can facilitate downstream short-readâ€“based SV calling and allele-specific gene expression analysis, demonstrating outstanding advantages over a single linear genome. Our work offers a comprehensive workflow that aims to facilitate the decoding of numerous hybrid plant genomes, particularly those with unknown or inaccessible parentage, thereby enhancing our understanding of genome evolution and heterosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7d0384d1913d5302fe0ce7ddff448f2046f72844ff9af8121e53c5954f1b87c0","category":"Environment"}
