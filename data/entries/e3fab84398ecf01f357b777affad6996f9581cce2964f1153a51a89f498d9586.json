{"title":"Signal-Injection-Based Topology Identification for Low-Voltage Distribution Networks Considering Missing Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0181/v1","date":1712055316000,"content":"With the widespread use of new equipment such as distributed photovoltaics, distributed energy storage, electric vehicles, and distributed wind power, the control of low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) has become increasingly complex. Acquiring the most recent topological structure is essential for conducting accurate analysis and real-time control of LVDNs. The signal-injection-based topology identification algorithm is favored for its speed and efficiency. This study proposes a new signal-injection-based topology identification algorithm aimed at solving the issues of reduced completeness and correctness of identification caused by missing feature signal records (FSRs). By analyzing the correlations between FSRs of different positions, the algorithm employs vertical and horizontal completion methods to effectively address missing data, combined with inclusion detection algorithms, to identify the topology of LVDNs. Based on the study of actual LVDN data, the results indicate that the algorithm not only significantly improves the completeness and correctness of topology identification for LVDNs but can also increase the number of devices in operation by evaluating the status of topological equipment, further enhancing the topology identification performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3fab84398ecf01f357b777affad6996f9581cce2964f1153a51a89f498d9586","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
