Analysis of locomotion thus provides a comprehensive and sensitive readout of nervous system function and dysfunction. Tardigrades, the smallest known walking animals, coordinate movement of their eight legs with a relatively simple nervous system, and are a promising model for neuronal control of limb-driven locomotion. Here, we developed open-source tools for automated tracking of tardigrade locomotion in an unconstrained two-dimensional environment, for measuring multiple parameters of individual leg movements, and for quantifying interleg coordination. We used these tools to analyze &gt;13,000 complete strides in &gt;100 tardigrades, and identified preferred walking speeds and distinct step coordination patterns associated with those speeds. In addition, the rear legs of tardigrades, although they have distinct anatomy and step kinematics, were nonetheless incorporated into overall patterns of interleg coordination. Finally, comparisons of tardigrade locomotion across lifespan, between species, and upon disulfiram treatment suggested that neuronal regulation of high-level aspects of walking (e.g. speed, turns, walking bout initiation) operate independently from circuits controlling individual leg movements and interleg coordination.","author":"Emma M.
