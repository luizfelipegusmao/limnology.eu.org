This study thoroughly explored the spatiotemporal variations in stream nitrogen concentrations in a typical headwater watershed in South China. Spatially distributed measurements were conducted during 2020–2022, and mathematical modeling was implemented based on incorporating these data. More than 4,400 data points were collected for water temperature and concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>-N), dissolved total nitrogen (DTN), total nitrogen (TN), and dissolved oxygen. Results showed that NO<sub>x</sub>-N was the largest component of TN, with average concentrations of 1.20 and 1.66 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The stream N<sub>2</sub>O concentration could be predicted using NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>x</sub>-N concentrations via the Michaelis-Menten equation. Significant downstream decreases in NH<sub>4</sub>-N, NO<sub>x</sub>-N, DTN, and TN concentrations were identified in the largest river in the watershed, and clear spatial differences in these nitrogen concentrations existed among the three main rivers. Clear seasonal and annual variations in stream nitrogen concentrations were observed. NH<sub>4</sub>-N, NO<sub>x</sub>-N, DTN, and TN concentrations correlated with cumulative precipitation from the preceding 8–12 days, while stream N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations correlated over 13–20 days. Stream N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations and emissions averaged 12.77 nmol L<sup>−1</sup> and 1.12 nmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and were lower in summer than in other seasons. Upstream tea plantations, villages, and adjacent agricultural lands significantly affected nitrogen concentrations, while overflow dams did not. These findings highlight nitrogen cycle's complexity and the need for high-resolution data to guide effective watershed management.</p>","author":"Congsheng Fu, \nHaixia Zhang, \nHuawu Wu, \nHaohao Wu, \nYang Cao, \nYe Xia, \nZichun Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"82a2ed1be9c56acc8d781cf5f7d7e3aa882e27671cf9959e480c0dc23f2d4191","category":"Environment"}
