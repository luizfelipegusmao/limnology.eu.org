{"title":"Sustainable Intensification of the Montado Ecosystem: Evaluation of Sheep Grazing Systems and Soil Amendment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1294/v1","date":1711091742000,"content":"The objective of this study was to determine how application with dolomitic limestone and grazing type (continuous or deferred) affect sheep grazing location and feed preference when the pasture growth rate is maximum. A 4ha field was divided into 4 plots: P1 and P2- without application of dolomitic limestone, continuous (CG) and deferred grazing (DG), respectively; P3 and P4- with application of dolomitic limestone, DG (1AUE), and CG (2.4 AUE), respectively. In DG, animals were placed and removed from the plots depending on the height of the pasture. In each plot, 12 georeferenced sampling points were identified. Throughout the pasture's vegetative cycle (autumn, winter, spring, and early summer) several measurements of pasture height and cut were carried out. From the beginning of March to the beginning of June, animal behavior was observed, by trained observers, through binoculars on six dates. Animals' activity grazing and location was recorded. The results show that: (i) the application of dolomitic limestone combined with CG provided higher values of pasture height; (ii) there were no significant differences in pasture quality between treatments; (iii) Deferred grazing led to 50% more sheep grazing days than continuous grazing; (iv) there were no significant differences in soil compaction between CG and DG; (v) the type of grazing and the treatment with dolomitic limestone did not seem to change the grazing pattern between treatments. This work contributes to understanding the relationships between different types of grazing in dryland pastures, with and without application of dolomitic limestone, and preferred grazing locations for sheep. This work could help agricultural managers make more informed decisions with the aim of promoting the sustainable intensification of livestock production in the Montado ecosystem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5b6e3e3c22bd9fc77e8db338e196e3d9cec014fad2fb68408896e137f6cc6b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
