{"title":"Exploration of hypoglycemic peptides from porcine collagen based on network pharmacology and molecular docking","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298674","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Fating Zhou, Di Li, Yakun Hou, Zhihui Cong, Kaifeng Li, Xin Gu, Guosheng Xiao</p>\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the extraction of hypoglycemic peptides from food proteins has gained increasing attention. Neuropeptides, hormone peptides, antimicrobial peptides, immune peptides, antioxidant peptides, hypoglycemic peptides and antihypertensive peptides have become research hotspots. In this study, bioinformatic methods were used to screen and predict the properties of pig collagen-derived hypoglycemic peptides, and their inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase were determined <i>in vitro</i>. Two peptides (RL and NWYR) were found to exhibit good water solubility, adequate ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity) properties, potentially high biological activity, and non-toxic. After synthesizing these peptides, NWYR showed the best inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase with IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.200±0.040 mg/mL, and it can regulate a variety of biological processes, play a variety of molecular functions in different cellular components, and play a hypoglycemic role by participating in diabetic cardiomyopathy and IL-17 signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that NWYR had the best binding effect with the core target DPP4 (4n8d), with binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol. NWYR mainly bonded with the target protein through hydrogen bonding, and bound with various amino acid residues such as Asp-729, Gln-731, Leu-765, etc., thus affecting the role of the target in each pathway. It is the best core target for adjuvant treatment of T2DM. In short, NWYR has the potential to reduce type 2 diabetes, providing a basis for further research or food applications as well as improved utilization of pig by-products. However, in subsequent studies, it is necessary to further verify the hypoglycemic ability of porcine collagen active peptide (NWYR), and explore the hypoglycemic mechanism of NWYR from multiple perspectives such as key target genes, protein expression levels and differences in metabolites in animal models of hyperglycemia, which will provide further theoretical support for its improvement in the treatment of T2DM.","author":"Fating Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4bbcf4b6eedbac9f0e602007edd1cb810178e0c13d31c56c394ffe62b9510f13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
