Data were collected between 2017 and 2022 from two artisanal fishery communities in southern Brazil. Batoid’s stomach contents were identified, separated into categories, and weighed. We calculated the Levins, Pianka’s, and Prey-specific index of relative dietary importance (PSIRI) and performed a similarity test using PERMANOVA and the similarity percentage (SIMPER) for niche analysis. We analyzed 229 stomachs of four batoid species, 187 containing foods. All species showed a narrow food niche. The most important diet items for each species were <em>Leptochaela serratorbita</em> and Onuphidae for <em>Dasyatis hypostigma</em>; Nematoda for <em>Pseudobatos horkelii</em>; <em>L. serratorbita</em>, <em>Sicyonia dorsalis</em> and Portunidae for <em>Rioraja agassizii</em> and <em>Achelous spinicarpus</em> and fish for <em>Sympterygia bonapartii</em>. The analyses showed dissimilarity among the species’ diets without significant niche overlap. Our results detected the absence of significant niche overlap among batoid species, suggesting other types of niche partitioning and spatiotemporal habitat variation. This information could be considered for local management plans.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"f9905014d0e664f1680fa36733ee1c4aec1939ad9920dcf723556ee618eb7b8a","category":"Environment"}
