Studies have uncovered associations between pubertal timing and neurodevelopment. This review discusses the overlap between the brain circuitry controlling puberty and behavior, highlights neurodevelopmental conditions with associated disordered puberty, and explores the possibility of dual treatment with hormone therapies. A better understanding of the molecular pathways controlling both conditions will enable improved diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Figure created in BioRender. Read, J.

Neuronal development is a vital element of these processes, and multiple conditions of disordered puberty and reproduction have their etiology in abnormal neuronal migration or function. Although there are numerous documented cases across multiple conditions wherein patients have both neurodevelopmental disorders and pubertal abnormalities, this has mostly been described ad hoc and the associations are not clearly documented. In this review, we aim to describe the overlap between these two groups of conditions and to increase awareness to ensure that puberty and reproductive function are carefully monitored in patients with neurodevelopmental conditions, and vice versa. Moreover, this commonality can be explored for clues about the disease mechanisms in these patient groups and provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions for affected individuals.</p>","author":"Jordan E.
