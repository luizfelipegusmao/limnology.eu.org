{"title":"Seed traits and recruitment interact with habitats to generate patterns of local adaptation in a perennial grass","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/3111/7611975?rss=1","date":1708473600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A fundamental challenge in the field of ecology involves understanding the adaptive traits and life history stages regulating the population dynamics of species across diverse habitats. Seed traits and early seedling vigor are thought to be key functional traits in plants, with important consequences for recruitment, establishment, and population persistence. However, little is known about how diverse seed traits interact with seed and microsite availability to impact plant populations. Here, we performed a factorial experiment involving seed addition and surface soil disturbance to explore the combined effects of seed and site availability using genotypes characterized by varying seed mass and dormancy traits. Additionally, we included hybrids that exhibited recombined seed trait relationships compared with natural genotypes, allowing us to assess the impact of specific seed traits on establishment across different sites. We detected a significant three-way interaction between seed addition, site conditions, and soil surface disturbance, influencing both seedling establishment and adult recruitment in <span>Panicum hallii</span>, a perennial grass found in coastal mesic (lowland) and inland xeric (upland) habitats. This establishment/recruitment pattern suggests that mesic and xeric establishment at foreign sites is constrained by the interplay of seed and site limitations. Notably, soil surface disturbance facilitated establishment and recruitment of the xeric genotype while limiting the mesic genotype across all sites. Our results highlight the importance of seed size and dormancy as key factors impacting seedling establishment and adult recruitment, suggesting a potential interactive relationship between these traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"72d752aeb4d777ce0374bf4f920a008034a25c54211ba33328c385a71595b75e","category":"Environment"}
