However, since structure characterization and property measurement are typically conducted on separate samples with varying dimensions, establishing a precise structure-property relationship is often challenging. In this study, we show a direct correlation between formation of structural domains and transport properties measured on same TEM samples of lacunar spinel multiferroic GaV<sub>4</sub>S<sub>8</sub> crystal. In the inverse spinel structure, the V<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> tetrahedral clusters with triply degenerate occupied orbitals are Jahn-Teller active, driving a symmetry-lowering cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion around 42 K [<a href=\"#ozae044.730-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"343ae55884da8facfa64c0f238c697b0d86acb54a882f02b1c828667b9251a0e","category":"Environment"}
