{"title":"A Study on the Influence of Social Media on Forming the Social Skills among Adolescents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1997/v1","date":1727260507000,"content":"This study examined the connection between teenage social skill development and social media use, with an emphasis on both male and female participants. Data were gathered from 101 teenagers using a snowball sampling technique in descriptive survey research. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between social skill development and social media usage, as well as the frequency and intensity of social media use. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference (ꭕ2 =1.983, p &lt; .05, .01) in the amount of time male and female teenagers spent on social media. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences (t=1.29, p &gt; α) in the impact of social media on the development of social skills between genders. Gender did not appear to be a significant impact (ꭕ2 =1.143, p &gt; α) in the way social media affected the development of social skills, even though a higher number of females saw more significant advances in social skills, especially at higher levels of influence. The study also revealed a stronger correlation between increased social skill improvement and moderate social media use, especially in the \"more than one hour\" category. Excessive use, such as spending the entire day online, did not, however, considerably aid in the development of social skills. Overall, the results indicate that, when used moderately, social media can typically improve teenage social skills, with little variation in the effects observed between boys and females.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"daa1fd549c988c046c3c1ff6ff7272b83f9b0f590e7f5c9ace7489974f6394c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
