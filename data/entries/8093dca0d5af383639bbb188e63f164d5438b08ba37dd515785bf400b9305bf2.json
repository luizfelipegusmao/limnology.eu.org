{"title":"Transforming User Experience (UX) Through Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Interactive Media Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0168/v1","date":1725356367000,"content":"This paper discusses the application and advantages of artificial intelligence technology in digital media interactive product design. Firstly, the development background of artificial intelligence technology and its promoting effect on design innovation is introduced, and the application of new technologies, such as generative adversarial networks in art creation and design personalization, is definitely analyzed. It then explores in detail the ability of AI to break traditional constraints in interactive design, innovate design, and optimize user experience, especially in digital media. Finally, the case study of Microsoft Cortana shows the method of classifying and processing user queries by machine learning system and its experimental results. The research of this paper provides the theoretical basis and empirical support for the application of artificial intelligence technology in the future interactive design of digital media and has important academic and practical significance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8093dca0d5af383639bbb188e63f164d5438b08ba37dd515785bf400b9305bf2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
