{"title":"The use of complex adaptive system’s emulation and principles in planning and managing a biophilic systems transition in Singapore","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jue/article/doi/10.1093/jue/juae013/7699926?rss=1","date":1719360000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cities have been described as complex adaptive systems (CAS). A key aspect of both natural and social CAS is that they are scaler and hierarchical. The research reported in this article looked at the purposeful adoption of CAS principles within the governance structures, socioecological and sociotechnical subsystems of the city state of Singapore in order to deliver urban ecological services. The major objective of the research was to evaluate the degree to which complex adaptive systems restoration, rehabilitation, and emulation and/or principles are holistically being applied across sectors, departments, and agencies to deliver urban ecological services that reach normative goals. The research first analysed the Singapore government’s intersectoral and sectoral ‘Big P’ policy documents. It then analysed whether policies within these are subsequently being incorporated into the ‘small p’ regulatory standards and guidelines as well as projects of relevant departments. The research found the most ‘Big P’ policy documents and to a lesser extent ‘small p’ standards and projects have purposely adopted nature-based solutions in order to deliver intersectoral urban ecological services. However, adoption is often voluntary, as a result, it is largely progressing via pilot schemes and <span>ad hoc</span> projects in places of least resistance. As such, it is not yet being undertaken as a holistic coordinated city-wide transition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Urban Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"b2629340d80db12a388ca36fcbfe9116474ee0004e4144e67708fd2b8d69c975","entryHash":"2b0eb74d501820c5d89a41218721c3f97a849ff89aa3dd1ae66950e1e62c1999","category":"Environment"}
