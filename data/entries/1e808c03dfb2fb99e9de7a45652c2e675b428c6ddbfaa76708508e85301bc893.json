Diaz, Tara Gaire, Noelle Noyes</p>\r\n\r\nThe insectivorous Northern Pitcher Plant, <i>Sarracenia purpurea</i>, recruits a dynamic biotic community in the rainwater collected by its pitcher-shaped leaves. Insect capture and degradation within the pitcher fluid (phytotelma) has been well documented as a mechanism for supplementing the plant’s nitrogen, phosphorous, and micronutrient requirements. Metagenomic studies have shown a diverse microbiome in this phytotelm environment, including taxa that contribute metabolically to prey digestion. In this investigation, we used high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing and bioinformatics to analyze the <i>S</i>. <i>purpurea</i> phytotelm bacteriome as it changes through the growing season (May–September) in plants from the north-central region of the species’ native range. Additionally, we used molecular techniques to detect and quantify bacterial nitrogenase genes (nifH) in all phytotelm samples to explore the hypothesis that diazotrophy is an additional mechanism of supplying biologically available nitrogen to <i>S</i>. <i>purpurea</i>. The results of this study indicate that while prokaryote diversity remains relatively stable in plants at different locations within our region, diversity changes significantly as the growing season progresses. Furthermore, nifH genes were detected at biologically significant concentrations in one hundred percent of samples, suggesting that nitrogen fixation may be an important contributor to the <i>S</i>. <i>purpurea</i> nutrient budget.","author":"Paul P.
