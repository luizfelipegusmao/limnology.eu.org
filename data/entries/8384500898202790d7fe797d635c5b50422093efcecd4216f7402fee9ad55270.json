This research focuses on the examination of a dental implant sample fabricated using the SLM method. The investigation encompasses multiple aspects, including hardness, dimensional accuracy, strength, and surface properties. The results demonstrate that the hardness of the SLM sample is comparable to that of machined samples, establishing it as a viable alternative to traditional production methods. Dimensional tests reveal that the SLM sample adheres to the required acceptance limits for critical dimensions. The strength of the sample, with a value of 700â€‰MPa, proves to be acceptable for medical applications. The presence of surface porosity and holes in the SLM sample highlights its potential for enhanced bone ossification. However, challenges associated with thread construction in the SLM process require further attention. Overall, this research showcases the promising aspects of the SLM method for dental implant production, while also identifying areas for future investigation and improvement.</p>","author":"Mohammad Rezayat, \nOmid Ashkani, \nRaheleh Fadaei","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"8384500898202790d7fe797d635c5b50422093efcecd4216f7402fee9ad55270","category":"Environment"}
