{"title":"Protective Efficacy of Live-Attenuated ASFV Vaccine Strains against the Emerging Recombinant ASFV Genotype I/II Strain in Vietnam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1438/v1","date":1724153046000,"content":"African swine fever virus (ASFV) continues to spread globally causing severe economic losses to the pig farmers. Vietnam licensed two live attenuated vaccines based on the ASFV strains ASFV-G-ΔI177L and ASFV-G-ΔMGF, to control the ongoing ASF outbreaks. In 2023, newly emerging highly virulent recombinant ASFV viruses containing genetic elements from both ASFV p72 genotype I and II (rASFV I/II) strains were reported from Northern Vietnam. This study evaluated if the two vaccine strains were able to protect the pigs against the emerging rASFV I/II strain VNUA/rASFV/TN1/23. Pigs vaccinated with ASFV-G-ΔMGF or ASFV-G-ΔI177L, when challenged with rASFV I/II, succumbed to the infection, or developed signs of chronic ASF. The findings from this study show that both vaccine strains that are licensed and used in Vietnam, are unlikely to protect pigs from the emerging highly virulent rASFV I/II strains. This complicates the ongoing efforts to control ASF in Asia and globally and emphasizes the urgent need for a novel vaccine that can effectively protect pigs from the rASFV I/II strains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6981af40dd7610f7b12322a4c97381e000a18f186af8b5e7490342e6f8eb070","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
