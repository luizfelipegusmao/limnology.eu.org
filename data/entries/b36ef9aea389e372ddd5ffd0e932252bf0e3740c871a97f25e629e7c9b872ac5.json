{"title":"The land of homesickness: The impact of homesteads on the social integration of rural migrants","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307605","date":1721916000000,"content":"<p>by Yanbo Wu, Minghao Xu, Shichen Li, Hongwei Wang, Qi Dong</p>\r\n\r\nPromoting the social integration of rural migrants is key to improving the mechanism of rural-urban integration and development. This study utilizes the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey and matched urban macro data to systematically explore the impact of homesteads on the social integration of rural migrants. Research has shown that social integration of rural migrants will be inhibited if they own homesteads. Simultaneously, the degree of inhibition varies according to the individual characteristics of rural migrants, the region to which they belong, and other factors. Specifically, when rural migrants aged 18 to 50 own homesteads, their degree of social integration into the cities they move into will be low. At the same time, for rural migrants in the central region, homestead ownership will not affect their degree of social integration. In addition, the mechanism analysis shows that increased housing expenditure inhibits rural migrants’ willingness to integrate. Meanwhile, owning contracted land and owning a house in the city also affect the degree of social integration of rural migrants to a certain extent. The findings of this study can broaden research on the effects of land on the free movement of population factors. In the meantime, it provides theoretical references for improving the level of social integration of migrants, enhancing people’s well-being, and improving the mechanism of urban-rural integration and development.","author":"Yanbo Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b36ef9aea389e372ddd5ffd0e932252bf0e3740c871a97f25e629e7c9b872ac5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
