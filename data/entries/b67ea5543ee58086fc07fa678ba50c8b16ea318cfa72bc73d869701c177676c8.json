{"title":"Evaluation and modeling of PLA photodegradation under UV irradiation: Bio-based polyester photolysis mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0591/v1","date":1710149542000,"content":"In our study we investigated the accelerated aging process of PLA under 253.7 nm UV-C irradiation with the use of GPC, NMR, FTIR, DSC methods and formal kinetic analysis. The results of GPC and DSC indicated a significant degree of destructive changes in PLA macromol-ecules, while spectroscopic methods NMR and FTIR showed maintenance of PLA main structural elements even after a long time of UV exposure. In addition to that, the GPC method displayed the formation of a high-molecular fraction starting from 24 hours of irradiation, and an increase in its content after 144 hours of experiment. It has been showed for the first time that a distinctive feature of prolonged UV exposure is the occurrence of intra- and intermolecular radical recom-bination reactions, leading to the formation of a high-molecular fraction of PLA decomposition products. This causes the observed slowdown of the photolysis process. It was concluded that photolysis of PLA is a complex of physicochemical processes, the mechanism of which depends on morphological changes in a solid phase of the polymer under UV radiation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b67ea5543ee58086fc07fa678ba50c8b16ea318cfa72bc73d869701c177676c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
