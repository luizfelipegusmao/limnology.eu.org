{"title":"A Brief Review of Incretin Mimetics Intended for the Management of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1369/v1","date":1716288901000,"content":"Abstract Incretin mimetics, also known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes by mimicking the actions of incretin hormones in the body. These hormones are responsible for promoting insulin release from the pancreas in response to nutrient intake, as well as decreasing glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. By imitating these actions, incretin mimetics help to regulate blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes and glucose intolerance. One of the key benefits of incretin mimetics is its ability to lower blood sugar levels without causing hypoglycemia. This is especially important for individuals with diabetes who may experience dangerous drops in blood sugar levels when using other medications. Additionally, incretin mimetics have been shown to promote weight loss in some individuals, making them a valuable option for those struggling with obesity in addition to diabetes. Incretin mimetics are administered by injection, once or twice daily, depending on the specific medication. They are often combined with other diabetes medications, such as metformin or insulin, for optimal blood sugar control. These medications are generally well-tolerated, with common side effects including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which usually diminish over time as the body adjusts to the medication. Studies have shown that incretin mimetics can help improve cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes, including reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This is particularly significant given the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes. Incretin mimetics also have been shown to preserve pancreatic beta-cell function, which is responsible for producing insulin. This can help slow the progression of diabetes and reduce the need for higher insulin doses over time. Despite their many benefits, incretin mimetics are not without limitations. They can be expensive compared to other diabetes medications, which may make them less accessible for some individuals. Additionally, there have been concerns about the potential risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer associated with the use of these medications. However, more research is needed to fully understand these risks. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully assess each individual's unique needs and medical history when considering the use of incretin mimetics. They may not be appropriate for everyone, particularly those with a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Patients should also be educated about these medications' proper administration and potential side effects to ensure their safety and efficacy. Overall, incretin mimetics have emerged as an important therapeutic option for individuals with type 2 diabetes, offering a unique mechanism of action that can help improve blood sugar control, promote weight loss, and reduce cardiovascular risk. With ongoing research and development in this field, incretin mimetics continue to show promise as valuable tools in managing diabetes and its associated complications and comorbidities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a33a1eaa2924c5fd71e436105287f25bb42d732d81b9900699a2a5dc4fa9cb3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
