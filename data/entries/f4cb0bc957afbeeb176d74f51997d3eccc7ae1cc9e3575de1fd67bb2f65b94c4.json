{"title":"The &lsquo;Radiant Effect&rsquo;: Recent Sonographic Image-Enhancing Technique and Its Impact on Nuchal Translucency Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0761/v1","date":1715595317000,"content":"Background: This study assesses the effects of the ‘Radiant’ image enhancement technique on fetal nuchal translucency (NT) measurements during first trimester sonographic ex-ams.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis of 263 ultrasound images of first trimester midsagittal sections was conducted. NT measurements were obtained using a semi-automatic tool. Statistical methods were applied to compare NT measurements with and without ‘Radi-ant’ enhancement. An in-vitro setup with predefined line distances provided additional data.\n\nResults:  Incremental increases in NT measurements were observed with varying levels of ‘Radiant’ application: An average increase of 0.19 mm with ‘Radiant min’, 0.24 mm with ‘Radiant mid’ and 0.30 mm with ‘Radiant max.’ The in-vitro results supported these findings, showing consistent effects on line thickness and measurement accuracy, with the smallest mean deviation occurring at the ‘Radiant mid’ setting.\n\nConclusions: ‘Radiant’ image enhancement leads to significant increases in NT measure-ments. To avoid systematic biases in clinical assessments, it is advisable to disable ‘Radi-ant’ during NT measurement procedures. Further studies are necessary to corroborate these findings and to consider updates to the NT reference tables based on this technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4cb0bc957afbeeb176d74f51997d3eccc7ae1cc9e3575de1fd67bb2f65b94c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
