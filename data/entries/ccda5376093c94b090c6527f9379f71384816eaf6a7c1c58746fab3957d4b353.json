{"title":"Sex-Specific Orthopaedic Trends in Mortality, Years of Life Lost, and Incidence of Pedestrian Road Injuries in Georgia and the Human Development Index, 1990-2021: Insights from the Global Burden of Disease Study and the United Nations Development Program","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0298/v1","date":1722911009000,"content":"Introduction\nPedestrian road injuries are a significant public health issue in Georgia, Syria, and Tajikistan. This study investigates the trends in mortality, Years of Life Lost (YLLs), and incidence rates of pedestrian road injuries from 1990 to 2021, with a focus on sex-specific differences, using age-standardized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database.\n\nMethods\nThe data for this analysis were obtained from the GBD database, emphasizing age-standardized rates of mortality, YLLs, and incidence of pedestrian-related road injuries in Georgia, Syria, and Tajikistan. The population was divided into male and female cohorts for comparison. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and effect size calculations to evaluate the differences between sexes. Temporal trends were analyzed to observe changes over the study period.\n\nResults\nMortality\nThe analysis revealed that males had a significantly higher mean mortality rate (7.18, SD = 2.94) compared to females (2.26, SD = 0.78). The independent samples t-test confirmed a significant difference (t(62) = 9.141, p &lt; 0.001). The effect sizes were substantial, with Cohen's d at 2.285, Hedges' g at 2.257, and Glass's Δ at 6.281. Over time, the mortality rates exhibited peaks in the early 1990s and mid-2000s, with a general decline afterward. Males consistently showed higher mortality rates than females throughout the period.\n\nYLLs (Years of Life Lost)\nFor YLLs, males had a significantly higher mean rate (332.59, SD = 132.31) compared to females (103.35, SD = 32.57), with the t-test indicating a significant difference (t(62) = 9.515, p &lt; 0.001). Effect sizes supported the significance of this difference, with Cohen's d at 2.379, Hedges' g at 2.350, and Glass's Δ at 7.308. The YLL rates showed notable peaks in the early 1990s and mid-2000s, followed by a decline, with males maintaining higher rates than females.\n\nIncidence\nRegarding incidence, males had a higher mean rate (235.90, SD = 36.09) compared to females (89.53, SD = 15.29). The t-test results (t(62) = 21.125, p &lt; 0.001) and effect sizes (Cohen's d = 5.281, Hedges' g = 5.217, and Glass's Δ = 9.574) confirmed a significant difference between the sexes. Incidence rates demonstrated a significant decline from 1990 to 2000, followed by fluctuations, with males consistently experiencing higher rates than females.\n\nConclusion\nThis study underscores significant sex differences in mortality, YLLs, and incidence rates due to pedestrian road injuries in Georgia from 1990 to 2021, with males consistently showing higher rates. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address the specific vulnerabilities of male pedestrians in Georgia. The data and analysis were facilitated through collaboration with the Global Burden of Disease Study, whose contributions were invaluable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccda5376093c94b090c6527f9379f71384816eaf6a7c1c58746fab3957d4b353","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
