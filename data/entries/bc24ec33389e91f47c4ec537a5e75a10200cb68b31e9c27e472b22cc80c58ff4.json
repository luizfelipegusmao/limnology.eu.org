{"title":"The Potential Impact of Rising Sea Levels and Subsidence on Coastal Flooding Along the Northern Coast of Saint-Louis, Senegal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1468/v1","date":1711361948000,"content":"In today's context of rising sea levels and subsiding land topography, coastal flooding is a major concern for coastal areas, both nationally, regionally, and internationally. A detailed understanding of these two phenomena is a prerequisite for effective coastal flood management. The main objective of the present study is to contribute to the understanding of the impact of subsidence and sea-level rise on coastal flooding in Saint-Louis, and in particular the Langue de Barbarie, by producing a vulnerability map of submerged surfaces. To this end, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry technique is used to process a time series of Sentinel-1 images and estimate land subsidence in the Saint-Louis and Langue de Barbarie area. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements are merged with RCP 2.6 sea-level rise scenarios to identify predicted flooded areas and provide a flood vulnerability map. At the Langue de Barbarie, topographic subsidence is estimated at between -6.4 and -0.4mm/year. In this study, we show that local land subsidence may increase vulnerability to flooding caused by sea-level rise based on 2100 projections. This may represent an increase in the flood zone in the study area. Based on the RCP 2.6 scenario and the subsidence rates obtained, a significant part of the St. Louis coastline and city would be subject to coastal and fluvial flooding for the years 2040 and 2100. For these dates, 29 to and 36 Km2 of the studied area would be occupied by water. Given this situation, research in Saint-Louis needs to focus on adaptation scenarios to coastal risks, to protect coastal communities and safeguard the city's historical heritage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc24ec33389e91f47c4ec537a5e75a10200cb68b31e9c27e472b22cc80c58ff4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
