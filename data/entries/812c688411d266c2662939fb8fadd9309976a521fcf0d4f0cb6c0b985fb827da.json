{"title":"Temperature-Regulated Flowering Locus T–Like Gene Coordinates the Spike Initiation in Phalaenopsis Orchid","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/3/405/7503247?rss=1","date":1703721600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Phalaenopsis aphrodite</span> can be induced to initiate spike growth and flowering by exposure to low ambient temperatures. However, the factors and mechanisms responsible for spike initiation in <span>P. aphrodite</span> remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that a repressor <span>Flowing Locus T-like (FTL)</span> gene, <span>FTL</span>, can act as a negative regulator of spike initiation in <span>P. aphrodite</span>. The mRNA transcripts of <span>PaFTL</span> are consistently high during high ambient temperature, thereby preventing premature spike initiation. However, during low ambient temperature, <span>PaFTL</span> expression falls while FT expression increases, allowing for spike initiation. Knock-down of <span>PaFTL</span> expression through virus-inducing gene silencing promoted spike initiation at 30/28°C. Moreover, PaFTL interacts with FLOWERING LOCUS D in a similar manner to FT to regulate downstream flowering initiation genes. Transgenic <span>P. aphrodite</span> plants exhibiting high expression of <span>PaFTL</span> do not undergo spike initiation, even when exposed to low ambient temperatures. These findings shed light on the flowering mechanisms in <span>Phalaenopsis</span> and provide new insights into how perennial plants govern spike initiation in response to temperature cues.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"812c688411d266c2662939fb8fadd9309976a521fcf0d4f0cb6c0b985fb827da","category":"Environment"}
