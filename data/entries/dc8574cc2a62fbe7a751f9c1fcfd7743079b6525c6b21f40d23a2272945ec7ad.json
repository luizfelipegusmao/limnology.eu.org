{"title":"Assessment and Optimization of Electrophoretic Deposition Assisted Polishing on Metals and Ceramics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0564/v1","date":1720420327000,"content":"Nano surface finishing can be achieved from the recently developed electrophoretic deposition-assisted polishing (EPDAP) process. This state-of-art work presents a comparison of the effect of surface roughness and material removal rate on the grit size, axial load, rotational speed, polishing time, etc. for SS304, SS316L and alumina ceramics. The EPDAP process can assess the surface's characteristics' quantity, and quality on different materials which have been tried on SS316L, SS304, inner bore of SS304, and Al2O3 in our laboratory. Uniform dispersion of homogeneous micro-sized abrasive grains was accomplished by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to create the polishing tool employed in this process. Polishing time, axial loading, grit size, and speed of rotation of the polishing tool was selected as the control parameters. The polishing tool undergoes erosion of blunt-edged-abrasive grains due to abrasion during the EPDAP process. Therefore, the polishing tool was continuously revitalized by adding fresh abrasives. The analysis of the experiments is conducted using ANOVA and the evolutionary algorithm teaching-learning method. EPDAP process revealed improved surface reflection as well as improvement in surface finish. Thus, optimization of the polishing parameters was conducted for the experiments. The surface roughness achieved from the experiments is 0.04557 microns for SS316L, 0.038 microns for SS304, and 0.404 microns for Al2O3. Therefore, 93.92%, 97.64 %, and 73.75 % of improvement in the surface finish were achieved in SS316L, SS304, and Al2O3, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc8574cc2a62fbe7a751f9c1fcfd7743079b6525c6b21f40d23a2272945ec7ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
