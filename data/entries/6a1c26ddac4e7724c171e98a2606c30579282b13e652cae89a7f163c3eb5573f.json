{"title":"337 Awardee Talk: What’s the focus of your teaching lens?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/418/7757328?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Throughout a career, the intersection of research and teaching unveils a profound realization - greatest contributions emerge when the teaching lenses are student-focused. A passion for teaching, rooted in early experiences with agriscience courses, evolved into aspirations to pursue a Master Teacher capacity. Embodied in a metaphor of evolving software, teaching continually updates to ‘version 9.0,’ emphasizing adaptability and a commitment to student-centered learning and their ‘becoming’. As an active co-participant in learning processes, I have honed teaching to my personality, aligning with a lens for the diverse needs of students and their growth. Most impactful teaching arises from attentive listening and a lens of deep understanding of students. One key to success lies in creating compelling, coherent learning environments and involving students in collaborative discussions about their educational goals - educating to elevate and empower mindsets. My courses initiate with a “Begin with the End in Mind” session, engaging students in dialogue about the value they seek from the term, collaboratively planning the path to their educational objectives while creating a ‘safe holding environment.’ Over time, a teaching philosophy emerged, centered around constructing courses with achievable high expectations, involving students in logistical decisions, and clarifying benchmarks to keep learning outcomes on track. Pedagogical goals are to be an “Orchestrator of Discovery,” fostering self-directed learning. Science courses are challenging, yet balanced with fairness, sincerity, and a lens of student-centeredness - pursuing student feedback. Continually seeking innovative teaching enhancements combat stagnation by testing alternative teaching approaches, striving for perfection while acknowledging that improvement becomes a constant journey. Experiments include various activities catering to diverse learning styles, integrating digital tools or high-impact experiences. Instilling intellectual passion by expressing excitement for the material fosters an atmosphere where students recognize the lens of relevance of the subject matter and self-learning. Success is witnessing students express excitement and genuine interest. A ‘teaching transcends the classroom’ lens is about making a lasting impact on students’ lives. A graduate expressing gratitude for something learned is an ultimate reward for pedagogical rectitude. Advancing long-term goals of becoming a better teacher occurs by participating in campus teaching programs, subscribing to teaching-publications, and engaging in scholarship of teaching and learning. Regular assessments and feedback mechanisms inform the practice, ensuring that we stay attuned to students’ needs by delivering impactful instruction. Another lens is to actively seek funding for the teaching program, collaborating to adopt innovative practices. In conclusion, teaching lenses are rooted in reflection, adaptability, student-centeredness, a heavy leadership development/growth thread and a commitment to foster a love of learning in others. As we navigate the dynamic landscape of education, may we be driven by a lens of belief that teaching is not just a profession - it is a calling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"6a1c26ddac4e7724c171e98a2606c30579282b13e652cae89a7f163c3eb5573f","category":"Environment"}
