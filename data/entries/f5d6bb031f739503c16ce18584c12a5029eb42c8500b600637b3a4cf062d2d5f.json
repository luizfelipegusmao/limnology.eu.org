{"title":"Optimizing Planting Methods for Sustainable Pomegranate Cultivation in the Shallow Gravelly Land of Central Deccan Plateau Region, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0405/v1","date":1712301690000,"content":"To enhance pomegranate production on marginal gravelly lands, our study evaluated standardized planting techniques in an 8-year-old orchard. We employed trenching, wider pit excavation, pit digging, and auger digs with dimensions of 1 and 2 meters. Utilizing native soil from barren land, with or without spent wash, and mixing it with black soil up to 1 meter deep, we assessed growth parameters, leaf nutrients, and fruit yield. The trench and wider pit methods outperformed others, yielding greater above-ground biomass (&gt;7.03 t tree-1), root biomass (2.5 t tree-1), and cross-sectional area (3.3 m² tree-1). Additionally, trench planting enhanced leaf phosphorus (0.28%) and potassium (1.8%) levels, fruit juice content (48.5%), total soluble solids (16.05°), and fruit yield (&gt;9.3 t ha-1). The trench method also fostered longer roots at 90–150 cm radial distance and deeper roots at 40–60 cm depth. In summary, the trench and wider pit methods, combined with a soil mixture, are recommended for sustainable, high-quality fruit production in shallow gravelly terrains, thereby improving food security and the livelihoods of farmers in arid regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5d6bb031f739503c16ce18584c12a5029eb42c8500b600637b3a4cf062d2d5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
