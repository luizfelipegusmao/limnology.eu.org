{"title":"68 Serological comparisons of IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV- Mannheimia haemolytica toxoid vaccines","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/44/7665003?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to compare serological responses in low-risk calves vaccinated with various IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV-<span>Mannheimia haemolytica</span> toxoid vaccines. Bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) and <span>M. haemolytica</span> (MH) leukotoxin titers were analyzed to investigate any potential BHV-1 antigen interference to MH leukotoxin levels when administering multi-valent vaccines. Serology responses of BVD, BRSV, and PI3 were not within the scope of this study. Before enrolling in the study, weaned calves born to dams at two University of Arkansas beef cattle research stations that were not previously vaccinated with MH toxoid or BHV-1 were bled and sera harvested. Crossbred steer and heifer calves [n = 364; steers = 168, heifers = 196; body weight (BW) = 187.9 ± 2.8 kg] were used for this study at the two locations. Calves were stratified by MH titers, BHV-1 titers, and sex, and allotted to 1 of 5 treatments: 1) “BS GOLD” = IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV-MH (Bovi-Shield GOLD One Shot, 2 mL/SQ; Zoetis); 2) “P5 + PRE” = IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV-MH (Pyramid 5 + Presponse SQ, 2 mL/SQ; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health); 3) “BV Once” = IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV-MH-PM (Bovilis Vista Once SQ, 2 mL/SQ; Merck Animal Health); 4) “IF3 + One Shot” = IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV (Inforce 3, 2 mL/intranasal; Zoetis) and BVD-MH (One Shot BVD, 2 mL/SQ; Zoetis); and 5) “BN + BV” = IBR-BVD-PI3-BRSV (Bovilis Nasalgen 3-PMH, 2 mL/intranasal; Merck Animal Health) and BVD (Bovilis Vista BVD CFP, 2 mL/SQ; Merck Animal Health). Cattle were weighed on d 0, 7, 14, and 28 and blood samples were taken for MH leukotoxin titers. Serum samples were collected on d 0 and 28 for BHV-1 titers. For statistical analyses, data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS. Statistical significance was determined at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05, with tendencies at 0.05 &lt; <span>P</span> ≤ 0.1. There was an overall treatment effect for MH serum antibody titers with BV Once and BN + BV vaccinated calves exhibiting decreased MH serum titers compared with calves vaccinated with BS GOLD, P5 + PRE, and IF3 + One Shot (<span>P</span> = 0.0457). There was a treatment by day interaction for BHV-1 titers (<span>P</span> = 0.0336). On d 28, BHV-1 serum titers were greatest in BS GOLD and BN + BV vaccinated calves, least in calves that received IF3 + One Shot vaccines, and intermediate for BV Once vaccinated calves. Morbidity and average daily gain did not differ between treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.27) throughout the 28-d study period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"a3bb69ff682ed93f9accf955b3bbff8b3c8b1173105d7aeebbf1129ee605e617","category":"Environment"}
