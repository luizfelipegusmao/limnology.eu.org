{"title":"Network analysis of toxic endpoints of fungicides in zebrafish","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae087/7687861?rss=1","date":1717545600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Zebrafish being the best animal model to study, every attempt has been made to decipher the toxic mechanism of every fungicide of usage and interest. It is important to understand the multiple targets of a toxicant to estimate the toxic potential in its totality. A total of 22 fungicides of different classes like amisulbrom, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, carboxin, chlorothalonil, difenoconazole, etridiazole, flusilazole, fluxapyroxad, hexaconazole, kresoxim methyl, mancozeb, myclobutanil, prochloraz, propiconazole, propineb, pyraclostrobin, tebuconazole, thiophanate-methyl, thiram, trifloxystrobin and ziram were reviewed and analyzed for their multiple explored targets in zebrafish. Toxic end points in zebrafish are highly informative when it comes to network analysis. They provide a window into the molecular and cellular pathways that are affected by a certain toxin. This can then be used to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and to draw conclusions on the potential of a particular compound to induce toxicity. This knowledge can then be used to inform decisions about drug development, environmental regulation, and other areas of research. In addition, the use of zebrafish toxic end points can also be used to better understand the effects of environmental pollutants on ecosystems. By understanding the pathways affected by a given toxin, researchers can determine how pollutants may interact with the environment and how this could lead to health or environmental impacts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"d7d96f9b75c9b2b56046dd38baf0da3c0626e4e09d5f177e9f0c879f393e5744","category":"Environment"}
