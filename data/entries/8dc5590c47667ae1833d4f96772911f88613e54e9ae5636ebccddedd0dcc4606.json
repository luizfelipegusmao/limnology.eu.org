{"title":"Population genomics of the endangered freshwater mussel, Arcidens wheeleri (Unionoidea: Unionidae: Anodontini), in the Little River, Arkansas, USA","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyae029/7732618?rss=1","date":1723507200000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>North America is a hotspot of freshwater mussel diversity. However, over the last century, many anthropogenic stressors have led to substantial declines in freshwater mussels of the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae in North America. Conserving the remaining mussel fauna is a priority, as they play an integral role in freshwater ecosystems. The Little River in Arkansas is home to one of the last remaining populations of the federally endangered freshwater mussel, <span>Arcidens wheeleri</span> (Unionidae: Anodontini). Population dynamics information is lacking for <span>A. wheeleri</span>, and no population genetics study has been conducted on this species. A greater understanding of the genetic diversity within a population can serve as a benchmark for developing an effective management plan. We sampled <span>A. wheeleri</span> from three locations in the Little River. Genomic data were generated with a single-enzyme restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing approach to assess genetic diversity and structure of <span>A. wheeleri</span> in the Little River. Genetic structure analyses indicated one genetic population among the three locations, with limited, fine-scale subpopulation structure. Observed heterozygosity values were considerably lower than expected heterozygosity values, with <span>H</span><sub>o</sub> = 0.14 and <span>H</span><sub>e</sub> = 0.22, likely indicating a genetic bottleneck. Demographic analysis of the Little River population of <span>A. wheeleri</span> also suggests a historical bottleneck. Furthermore, a high inbreeding coefficient (<span>F</span><sub>IS</sub> = 0.33) indicates <span>A. wheeleri</span> in the Little River is losing genetic diversity. Data generated indicate considerable risk of extirpation for <span>A. wheeleri</span> from the Little River and should serve as a baseline for future monitoring. Given its high risk of extinction, we recommend increased study of <span>A. wheeleri</span> across its range and on-the-ground conservation actions that include habitat protection and restoration, which are the only options until a successful host fish and protocols are identified for propagation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"8dc5590c47667ae1833d4f96772911f88613e54e9ae5636ebccddedd0dcc4606","category":"Environment"}
