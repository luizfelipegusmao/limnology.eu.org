{"title":"Reducing Genotype-Environment Interaction Effects in a Genetic Improvement for Liptopenaeus vannamei","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1938/v1","date":1727225993000,"content":"The genotype by environment interaction (G×E) might have crucial impacts on the performance and fitness of agricultural species, such as Pacific white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). This study explores how enhancements in management practices can counteract G×E effects on growth traits. We analysed a selectively bred population of white leg shrimp spanning the latest two generations, encompassing 259 full-sib and half-sib families with 40,862 individual shrimp measured for body weight and total length. Our analysis revealed moderate genetic correlations (0.60 – 0.65) between trait expressions in pond and tank environments, a significant improvement compared to earlier generations. Employing the average information-restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach in mixed model analysis showed significant differences in heritability (h2) estimates between the two environments; however, the extent of these differences varied by trait (h2 = 0.68 in pond vs. 0.37 in tank for weight, and 0.41 vs. 0.67 for length). Our results indicate that G×E effects on growth traits in this population of L. vannamei were moderate but biologically significant. Consistent with our previous estimates in this population, genetic correlations between body weight and total length remained high (close to one) in pond and tank environments. Our findings collectively demonstrate that management improvements targeting stocking density, aeration, water quality, feeds, and feeding regimes mitigated the G×E effects on two economically significant traits in this population of white leg shrimp.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d42590edcaeb0123b8f604fbeb2bdbfca7dc70fe1324d4a475636e4a50f59489","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
