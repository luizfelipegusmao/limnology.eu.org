Two approaches are presented. The first approach uses oscillatory parameters measured under normoxia conditions, expressed as flowmotion (FM), vasomotion (VM), and the normoxia oscillatory index (NOI). These parameters have been used for identification of impaired microcirculatory oscillations associated with intense physical exercise, post-COVID syndrome, psychological stress, and erectile dysfunction. The second approach involves characterization of the microcirculatory response to hypoxia based on the measurement of hypoxia sensitivity (HS). The HS parameter is used to characterize microvascular complications in diabetes, such as diabetic kidney disease and diabetic foot ulcers. Based on research conducted by the authors of this review, the FMSF parameter ranges characterizing microvascular function are presented. The diagnostic approach to assessing microvascular function based on flowmotion monitored by the FMSF technique has a wide range of applications and potential to be integrated into widespread medical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a99e524efce5767d5ea73b08d9800fcf44e27702b4e0237e24a79ad964a9d999","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
