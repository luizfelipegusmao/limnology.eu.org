{"title":"The Cardiac Pulsed Wave Doppler Pattern of the Common Femoral Vein in the Diagnosis of the Likelihood of Severe Pulmonary Hypertension: Results from a Prospective, Multicen-Tric Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0017/v1","date":1717462378000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a clinical condition with high mortality rates, particularly in patients over 65. Current guidelines recommend assessing the Probability of Pulmonary Hypertension (PHP) using advanced echocardiography, before pro-ceeding to right heart catheterization. This study proposes using the common femoral vein (CFV), an accessible vein that reflects right atrial pressure, as an alternative method to assess the like-lihood of severe PHP. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study included 175 emergency patients from three hospitals. Ultrasound assessed the Pulsed Wave Doppler (PW-Doppler) morphology of the CFV. This diagnostic yield for high PHP was evaluated along-side traditional ultrasound parameters (right-to-left ventricular basal diameter ratio greater than 1 (RV&gt;LV), septal flattening, right ventricular outflow acceleration time of less than 105 ms and/or mesosystolic notching, pulmonary artery diameter greater than the aortic root diameter or over 25 mm, early pulmonary regurgitation maximum velocity &gt;2.2 m/s, TAPSE/PASP less than 0.55, in-ferior vena cava (IVC) diameter over 21 mm with decreased inspiratory collapse, and right atrial (RA) area over 18 cmÂ²). Results: The CFV's PW-Doppler cardiac pattern correlated strongly with high PHP, showing a sensitivity (Sn) of 72% and a specificity (Sp) of 96%. RA dilation and TAPSE/PASP &lt; 0.55 also played significant diagnostic roles. Conclusions: The CFV's PW-Doppler cardiac pattern is an effective indicator of high PHP, allowing reliable exclusion of this condition when absent. This approach could simplify initial PHP evaluation in emergency settings or where echocardiographic resources are limited.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"799811885b65e714326959a31032fb446e938307ce0ea2e2b2b5cebe5243cbb3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
