{"title":"Advancing towards Higher Contrast, Energy‐Efficient Screens with Advanced Anti‐Glare Manufacturing Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0886/v1","date":1728645691000,"content":"The pervasive use of screens, averaging nearly 7 hours per day globally across mobile phones, computers, notebooks and TVs, has sparked a growing desire to minimize reflections from ambient lighting and enhance readability in harsh lighting conditions, without the need to increase screen brightness. This demand highlights a significant need for advanced anti-glare (AG) technologies, to increase comfort and eventually reduce energy consumption of the devices. Currently used production technologies are limited in their texture designs, which can lead to suboptimal performance of the anti-glare texture. To overcome this design limitation and improve performance of the anti-glare feature, this work reports a new, cost-effective high-volume production method that enables the much needed design freedom on a large area. This is achieved by combining mastering via large-area Laser Beam Lithography (LBL) and replication by Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) processes. The environmental impact of the production method, such as material consumption, are considered and the full cycle from design to final imprint is discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43eff378bd5a26e88ef874211d7a70a65d9ca00873ccdd90bfd8826017ce1d48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
