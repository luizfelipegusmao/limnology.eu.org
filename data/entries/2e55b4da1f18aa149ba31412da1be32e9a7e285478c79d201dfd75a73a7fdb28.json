{"title":"Exploring Dengue Infection in a Vaccinated Individual: Preliminary Molecular Diagnosis and Sequencing Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1137/v1","date":1726307172000,"content":"This study examines a case involving a 7-year-old child who developed dengue symptoms following Qdenga vaccination. Despite initial negative diagnostic results, molecular analysis confirmed an infection with DENV4. Next-generation sequencing detected viral RNA from both DENV2 and DENV4 serotypes, which were identified as vaccine-derived strains using specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that these sequences belonged to the Qdenga vaccine rather than circulating wild-type viruses. This case underscores the critical need for precise diagnostic interpretation in vaccinated individuals to avoid misdiagnosis and to strengthen public health surveillance. A comprehensive understanding of vaccine-induced viremia is essential for refining dengue surveillance, improving diagnostic accuracy, and informing public health strategies in endemic regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e55b4da1f18aa149ba31412da1be32e9a7e285478c79d201dfd75a73a7fdb28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
