{"title":"Blood plasma lipidomic profile in atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic arteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1174/v1","date":1713357406000,"content":"According to the World Health Organisation ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world. More frequent it is caused by brachiocephalic arteries (BCA) atherosclerosis. Timely detection of the atherosclerosis and it`s unstable course can allow a timely response to potentially dangerous changes and reduce the risk of vascular complications. Omics technologies allow us to identify new biomarkers that we can use in diagnosing diseases. The research included 90 blood plasma samples. The first group - 52 patients with severe atherosclerotic lesions, second group - 38 patients with no BCA atherosclerosis. Targeted and panoramic lipidomic profiling of blood plasma was carried out. There is a statistically significant difference (Ñ€","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f924a824e8548ba61337a6d074232b2e61bb6315d9031305226338d385fd329b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
