{"title":"Effect of Laser Scan Speed on the Defects and Texture Development of Pure Chromium Metal Fabricated by Powder Bed Fusion-Laser Beam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1823/v1","date":1711702992000,"content":"Chromium (Cr) metal has garnered significant attention in alloy systems owing to its exceptional properties, such as high melting point, low density, and superior oxidation and corrosion resistance. However, its processing capabilities are hindered by the high Ductile-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Recently, powder bed fusion-laser beam for metals (PBF-LB/M) has emerged as a promising technique, offering the fabrication of net shapes and precise control over crystallographic texture. Nevertheless, research investigating the mechanism underlying crystallographic texture development in pure Cr via PBF-LB/M still needs to be conducted. This study explores the impact of scan speed on relative density and crystallographic texture. At the optimal scan speed, an increase in grain size attributed to epitaxial growth was observed, resulting in the formation of  cubic texture. Consequently, a reduction in High Angle Grain Boundaries (HAGB) was achieved, suppressing defects such as cracks and enhancing relative density up to 98.1%. Furthermore, with increasing densification, Vickers hardness also exhibited a corresponding increase. These findings underscore the efficacy of PBF-LB/M for processing metals with high DBTT properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10c31559a9acf52084d2e682f7a44ef201c8e19c968ad16c69e03f5e6224b827","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
