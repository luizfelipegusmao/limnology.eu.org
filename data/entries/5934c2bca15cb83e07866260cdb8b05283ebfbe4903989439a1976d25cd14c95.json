Direct effects of land-use change and climate and their interaction, together with changes in soil environmental variables, were the main determinants of the land-use change-induced changes in the diversity of soil bacterial or fungal FGs. The land-use change-induced decrease in multifunctionality was mainly associated with the direct effect of forest conversion, soil fertility and diversity of fungal FGs. Furthermore, climate also regulated the effects of land-use change on multifunctionality by affecting soil fertility and fungal FGs diversity along the Yangtze River.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Taken together, our findings highlight the important effects of land-use change, climate and their interactions on microbial diversity and multifunctionality and suggest that effective land-use management and climate change mitigation strategies should be adopted to protect biodiversity and ecosystem function in the Yangtze River Basin.\n</p>","author":"Xuan Zhou, \nJinshan Cai, \nJingwen Xu, \nShengen Liu, \nBing Wang, \nHuiling Zhang, \nLinyan Yue, \nLiji Wu, \nYing Wu, \nDima Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"5934c2bca15cb83e07866260cdb8b05283ebfbe4903989439a1976d25cd14c95","category":"Environment"}
