{"title":"Commercial Silver-based Dressings: In vitro and Clinical Studies in Treatment of Chronic and Burn Wounds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1013/v1","date":1723603235000,"content":"Chronic wounds are a major health problem because of delayed healing and cause hardships for the patient. The infection present in these wounds plays a role in delayed wound healing. Silver wound dressings have been used for decades, beginning in the 1960s with silver sulfadiazine for infection prevention for burn wounds. Since that time, there has been a large number of commercial silver dressings that have cleared FDA approval. In this review, we examine the literature involving in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies with commercial silver dressings and attempt to glean the important characteristics of these dressings in treating infected wounds. The primary presentation of the literature is in the form of detailed tables. The narrative part of the review focuses on the different types of silver dressings, including the supporting matrix, the release characteristics of the silver into the surroundings, and their toxicity. Though there are many clinical studies of chronic and burn wounds using silver dressings that we discuss, it is difficult to compare the performances of the dressings directly because of the differences in the study protocols. We conclude that silver dressings can assist in wound healing, though it is difficult to provide general treatment guidelines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d69b54539e88f919987b79627bfc3692c856fea35028139b113dae88ce0c51ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
