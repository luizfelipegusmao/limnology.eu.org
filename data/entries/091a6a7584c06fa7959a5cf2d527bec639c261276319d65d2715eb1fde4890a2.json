{"title":"In vitro and in vivo metabolic study of three new psychoactive β-keto-arylcyclohexylamines","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/4/217/7645850?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Since the 2000s, an increasing number of new psychoactive substances have appeared on the illicit drug market. β-Keto-arylcyclohexylamine compounds play important pharmacological roles in anesthesia; however, because these new psychoactive substances have rapidly increasing illicit recreational use, the lack of detailed toxicity data are of particular concern. Therefore, analysis of their metabolites can help forensic personnel provide references and suggestions on whether a suspect has taken an illicit new psychoactive β-keto-arylcyclohexylamine. The present study investigated the <span>in vitro</span> and <span>in vivo</span> metabolism and metabolites of three β-keto-arylcyclohexylamines: deschloro-<span>N</span>-ethyl-ketamine, fluoro-<span>N</span>-ethyl-ketamine and bromoketamine. <span>In vitro</span> and <span>in vivo</span> models were established using zebrafish and human liver microsomes for analysis of Phase I and Phase II metabolites by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Altogether, 49 metabolites were identified. The results were applied for the subject urine samples of known fluoro-<span>N</span>-ethyl-ketamine consumer screen analysis in forensic cases. Hydroxy-deschloro-<span>N</span>-ethyl-ketamine, hydroxy-fluoro-<span>N</span>-ethyl-ketamine and hydroxy-bromoketamine were recommended as potential biomarkers for documenting intake in clinical and forensic cases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"091a6a7584c06fa7959a5cf2d527bec639c261276319d65d2715eb1fde4890a2","category":"Environment"}
