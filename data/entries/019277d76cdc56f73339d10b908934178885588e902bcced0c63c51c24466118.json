{"title":"Surprising renewable energy boom in war‐ravaged Syria: Evidence from structural break analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12550?af=R","date":1723783785000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This paper casts light on Syria's relentless war, which has caused the collapse of national electricity grids and led to recurrent power outages. The main findings indicate that the 2012 war and enduring conflicts that put Syrians in front of a “fait accompli” and forced them to adapt to new, uncongenial, and arduous circumstances unexpectedly encourage renewable energy production and surprisingly expand access to electricity. An increase of 1% in conflicts causes renewable energy production to increase by 9.71% and 5.93% in war-ravaged Syria in the short and long run, respectively. As a matter of fact, off-grid renewable solutions proved to be effective in reducing the suffering of Syrians, whose lives were ruined by conflicts and the 2012 war. The results also illustrate that foreign aid can play an undeniably crucial role in making renewable-generated electricity more accessible and affordable for Syrians. As an inevitable consequence of the US and EU sanctions imposed on the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria is unable to access the foreign aid and international funding it needs to restore its destroyed energy sector, rebuild its damaged electricity infrastructure, and embark on its renewable energy plans.</p>","author":"Siham Matallah, \nAmal Matallah, \nSuleman Sarwar, \nWalid Abdmoulah","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"019277d76cdc56f73339d10b908934178885588e902bcced0c63c51c24466118","category":"Environment"}
