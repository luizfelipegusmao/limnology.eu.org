{"title":"A Turing Machine for the Life Sciences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1471/v1","date":1716425764000,"content":"During the development of new medicines mutually exclusive specificity appears to be required but hitherto is most often included at the late clinical trial stage. Here, I describe the use of Hedgehog signalling in Drosophila as a model to represent a mutually exclusive relationship within the context and report the identification of CG43658, a putative Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor and orthologue of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease associated gene ARHGEF10. Furthermore, a Computer that is able to consider the whole and describe the sum of everything in it absolutely in unambiguous terms is a useful tool. Here I describe such a computer with a suggestion for an application to examine any component in the context where a medicine is sought. Taken, together I would like to propose this method as a fundamental necessity and improvement upon current existing methods related not only to Hedgehog signalling but plausibly to life science research and the search for medicines in general.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0851066d65869866940063fb74418b353a540f25543665717b08d690a3c8385","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
