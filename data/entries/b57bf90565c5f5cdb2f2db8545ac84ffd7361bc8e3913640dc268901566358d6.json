{"title":"Eco-Physiological and Genetic Basis of Drought Response Index in Rice &ndash; Integration Using a Temperate Japonica Mapping Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0354/v1","date":1722928221000,"content":"The drought response index (DRI) is an indicator of drought tolerance after adjustment for variation in flowering date and potential yield under well-watered conditions. Using a temperate japonica mapping population of 97 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between Otomemochi (OTM) and Yumenohatamochi (YHM), we evaluated DRI during the reproductive stage under very severe drought in one year and under severe drought in the next year. DRI under very severe drought (−6.4 to 15.9) and severe drought (−3.9 to 8.3) positively correlated with grain dry weight under drought. Three QTLs for DRI were identified: RM3703–RM6911–RM6379 and RM6733–RM3850 both on chromosome 2 in both years combined;. and RM8120–RM2615–RM7023 on chromosome 6 in the second year. The latter collocated with putative genes for signaling and defense mechanisms (e.g., PIN1B, BZIP46) revealed by database analysis. Top-DRI lines retained root dry weight and had bigger steles. QTL-by-environment interaction had a greater relative contribution than the main effects of QTLs. Comparison with three previous studies revealed that the QTLs for DRI were unique to each experiment and/or population; most of them closely colocalized with reported drought-yield QTLs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b57bf90565c5f5cdb2f2db8545ac84ffd7361bc8e3913640dc268901566358d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
