{"title":"On Induced Topologies by Ideal, Primal, Filter and Grill","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0390/v2","date":1723180003000,"content":"In this paper the one-to-one correspondences and equivalences between ideals, primals, filters and grills are introduced. It is shown the local functions and the topological spaces induced by them are the same. From this point of view, the topological properties with respect to one topology can be derived from topological properties valid in the corresponding topology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bcf438bf5701056d06839e218fde8e25d15f397f727784a2f37844412376b08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
