{"title":"Cell death in bryophytes: emerging models to study core regulatory modules and conserved pathways","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/3/367/7702627?rss=1","date":1724284800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This review summarizes recent progress in our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cell death pathways in bryophytes, focusing on conserved pathways and particularities in comparison to angiosperms. Regulated cell death (RCD) plays key roles during essential processes along the plant life cycle. It is part of specific developmental programmes and maintains homeostasis of the organism in response to unfavourable environments. Bryophytes could provide valuable models to study developmental RCD processes as well as those triggered by biotic and abiotic stresses. Some pathways analogous to those present in angiosperms occur in the gametophytic haploid generation of bryophytes, allowing direct genetic studies. In this review, we focus on such RCD programmes, identifying core conserved mechanisms and raising new key questions to analyse RCD from an evolutionary perspective.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"aaa1b76ed8a143b0d8d80c55ecabd6d1092cd393ac558585df3a587cab99f776","category":"Environment"}
