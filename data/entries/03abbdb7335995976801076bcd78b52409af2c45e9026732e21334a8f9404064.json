{"title":"Design and Performance of High-Capacity Magnesium-Air Battery for Power Generator System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1404/v1","date":1729231377000,"content":"Efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, which aims to reduce the net carbon emissions to zero by decreasing carbon emissions from human activities and increasing carbon absorption, are actively underway. Additionally, the search for clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels has become a global research trend. This paper presents research on metal-air batteries, focusing on the development of energy supply technologies that do not generate carbon emissions during power generation and require less space for power generation compared to existing renewable energy sources. The proposed Mg-Air Battery (MAB) in this study uses magnesium as the metal anode and theoretically offers a maximum open-circuit voltage of 3.1V and a high energy density of 6.8kWh/kg. While previous research has primarily focused on designing small-capacity cells and maximizing the performance of metal anodes, this study differentiates itself by designing a large-capacity MAB cell and optimizing its electrical performance. For the large-capacity cell design, the weight, shape, and size of the anode were designed based on MAB performance factors, and research was conducted on manufacturing methods to optimize the performance of the air cathode. Furthermore, to enhance usability and extend the lifespan of the MAB cell, it was designed to allow electrolyte circulation, and the electrolyte circulation performance was verified through simulations of fluid flow within the cell. Based on the study of the power performance of the newly designed large-capacity MAB cell, the feasibility of con-structing a kW-class system using multiple Mg-Air battery cell stacks was confirmed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03abbdb7335995976801076bcd78b52409af2c45e9026732e21334a8f9404064","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
