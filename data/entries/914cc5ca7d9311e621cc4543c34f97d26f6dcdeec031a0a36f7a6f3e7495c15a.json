It is the most severe and debilitating form of childhood TB with high mortality, and children who survive TBM often suffer lifelong physical and neuro-disability resulting in emotional, social, and economic burdens for families. In the early stages the symptoms may be non-specific and so the diagnosis is often made late when the patient already has significant brain injury. To facilitate earlier diagnosis, it is important to understand how patients are evaluated. This study aimed to chart health systems for paediatric TBM care at both primary healthcare (PHC) and hospital level in Cape Town, South Africa. We conducted fourteen in-depth interviews and eight days of semi-structured observations of patient flow across eight healthcare facilities. We found that children with TBM navigate multiple levels of care categorised into pre-admission and primary care, hospital admission and inpatient care, and post-discharge follow-up care. Healthcare workers identified the following health system barriers along the TBM care pathway for children: limited post-training and mentorship opportunities to manage TBM, overburdened facilities, time constraints, lack of recognition of TBM symptoms, delays in referral between PHC and hospital, lack of standardized diagnostic algorithms, limited diagnostic tests and a lack of child-friendly, easy-to-administer treatment. Regular and compulsory training on TB and TBM in children, including continuous mentoring and support to healthcare workers working in child health and TB services in high TB-burden settings, can facilitate early recognition of symptoms and rapid referral for diagnosis. Algorithms outlining referral criteria for patients with possible TBM at both PHC facilities and district level hospitals can guide healthcare providers and facilitate timely referral between different levels of healthcare services. An integrated data system and alert functions could flag multiple healthcare visits and improve communication between different healthcare facilities during diagnosis and treatment. Children and families affected by TBM are an especially vulnerable sub-population requiring high priority attention and support.","author":"Dzunisani Patience Baloyi","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"914cc5ca7d9311e621cc4543c34f97d26f6dcdeec031a0a36f7a6f3e7495c15a","category":"Environment"}
