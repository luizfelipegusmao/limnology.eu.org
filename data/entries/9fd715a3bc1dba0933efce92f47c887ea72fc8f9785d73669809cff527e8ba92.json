{"title":"445 Effects of feed restriction on growth, blood chemistry and reproductive performance in replacement gilts","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/254/7757386?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The practical application of embryo transfer in pigs could benefit from using embryo donors for multiple cycles. Thus, raising the need to investigate feeding strategies for donors which will not be required to recover body condition lost during previous lactation. The objective was to evaluate the effects of temporary feed restriction, from d 6 to 14 of the estrous cycle, on growth, blood variables and reproductive performance in replacement gilts. Replacement gilts (n = 20; TN70, Topigs Norsvin, Oak Bluff, Canada) were assigned equally across 2 feeding regimens following a randomized complete block design where the block was backfat thickness. The feeding regimens were based on the first day of the estrous cycle: CON, recommended feeding levels from d 0 to 14 and a flush feeding (25% above recommended levels) from d 15 until d 21; or RES, CON but with restricted feeding (25% below recommended levels) from d 6 to 14. The CON treatment was based on the recommendations of the Feed Manual TN70 (Topigs Norsvin, 2015). On d 0, 5, 14 and 20 of the cycle, body weight and backfat thickness were measured. On d 21 (detected estrus), gilts were inseminated and on d 27 they were euthanized to collect embryos, ovaries and uterus. The uterus and ovaries were weighed whereas corpora lutea were counted and weighed. Blood serum was collected on d 14, and 20 for chemical analyses. Data were analyzed using the mixed procedure of SAS where each gilt was the experimental unit. Feeding regimens were considered as the fixed effect and backfat block as the random effect. Means were obtained with the LSMEANS statement. No differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) were observed on growth performance among feeding regimens. However, when comparing the average daily gain (ADG) within feeding regimens between feeding periods, no differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) were observed among gilts fed CON whereas gilts fed RES showed a decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) ADG during d 6 to 14 compared with d 0 to 5 and d 15 to 21. Regarding blood serum variables, gilts fed RES had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) total protein and potassium but less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) sodium-to-potassium ratio than gilts fed CON on d 14. On d 20, Gilts fed RES had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) cholesterol values than gilts fed CON. No differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) were observed on the number of corpora lutea, number of embryos collected or on collection efficiency. Similarly, no differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) were observed on the weight of reproductive organs or on measurements of ovaries among feeding regimens. In conclusion, restricting feed intake of replacement gilts by 25% of the recommendation from d 6 to 14 of the estrous cycle reduced ADG without compromising their reproductive performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"9fd715a3bc1dba0933efce92f47c887ea72fc8f9785d73669809cff527e8ba92","category":"Environment"}
