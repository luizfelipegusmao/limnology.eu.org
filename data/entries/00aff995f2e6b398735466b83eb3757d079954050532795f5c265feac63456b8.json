Unlike traditional imaging modes, a 4-D STEM experiment can be constructed to simultaneously acquire various combinations of image types, revealing both light and heavy atomic species within one dataset. These imaging modes include the use of virtual detectors (analogous to fixed, monolithic detectors), differential phase contrast to determine projected electrical properties, and ptychography [<a href=\"#ozae044.933-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"00aff995f2e6b398735466b83eb3757d079954050532795f5c265feac63456b8","category":"Environment"}
