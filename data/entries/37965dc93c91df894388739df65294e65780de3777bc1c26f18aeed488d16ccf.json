{"title":"Analysis of the Thermal and Catalytic Pyrolysis Process in the Regions of the Municipality of Belém Based on Socio-economic Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1553/v1","date":1729499190000,"content":"This work aims to evaluate the by-products obtained by thermal and catalytic pyroly-sis of the fraction (organic matter and paper) of municipal solid waste (MSW), in dif-ferent socioeconomic regions, through the yields of reaction products (bio-oil, bio-char, H2O and gas), acid value and chemical composition of bio-oils, and characteriza-tion of biochar, on a laboratory scale. The organic matter and paper segregated from the gravimetric composition of the total waste sample were subjected to drying, crushing and sieving pre-treatment. The experiments were carried out at 450 °C and 1.0 atmosphere, and at 400 °C and 475 °C and 1.0 atmosphere, using 10.0% (by mass) of the basic catalyst Ca(OH)2, in discontinuous mode. The bio-oil was characterized by acidity value and the chemical functions present in the bio-oil identified by FT-IR, NMR and composition by GC-MS. The biochar was characterized by SEM/EDS and XRD. The bio-oil yield increased with the addition of catalyst and the pyrolysis tem-perature. For catalytic pyrolysis, bio-char and gas yields increased slightly with Ca(OH)2 content, while bio-oil and H2O phase remained constant. GC-MS of the liquid reaction products identified the presence of hydrocarbons and oxygenates, as well as nitrogen-containing compounds, including amides and amines. The acidity of the bio-oil decreased with the addition of the basic catalyst in the process. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil appeared with the addition of the catalyst in the catalyt-ic pyrolysis process as catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acid molecules occurs, through decarboxylation/decarbonylation, producing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, in-troducing the basic catalyst into the thermal process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37965dc93c91df894388739df65294e65780de3777bc1c26f18aeed488d16ccf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
