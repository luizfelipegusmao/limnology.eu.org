{"title":"Impact of pretreatment with dielectric barrier discharge plasma on the drying characteristics and bioactive compounds of jackfruit slices","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13250?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Hot-air drying is a popular method for preserving the production of jackfruit, but heat treatment damages its nutritional qualities. Cold plasma is one of the pretreatment methods used to preserve quality attributes of fruits before drying. In the present work, we studied the effect of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma on the drying characteristics, microstructure, and bioactive compounds of jackfruit slices with different pretreatment times (15, 30, 45, and 60 s), followed by hot-air drying at 50, 60, and 70 °C. A homemade DBD device was operated via three neon transformers.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Optical emission spectrophotometry revealed the emitted spectra of the reactive species in DBD plasma, including the N<sub>2</sub> second positive system, N<sub>2</sub> first negative system, nitrogen ion, and hydroxyl radical. The results showed that the DBD plasma promoted moisture transfer and enhanced the drying rate, related to the changes in the surface microstructure of samples damaged by DBD plasma. The modified Overhults model was recommended for describing the drying characteristics of jackfruit slices. The contents of ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids, total polysaccharides, and antioxidant activity in pretreated jackfruit slices were improved by 9.64%, 42.59%, 25.77%, 27.00%, and 23.13%, respectively. However, the levels of color and carotenoids were reduced.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Thus, the bioactive compounds in dried jackfruit slices can be improved using the DBD plasma technique as a potential pretreatment method for the drying process. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Weerasak Seelarat, \nSujarinee Sangwanna, \nTawan Chaiwon, \nTeerapap Panklai, \nNatthaphon Chaosuan, \nAtipong Bootchanont, \nChakkaphan Wattanawikkam, \nPorramain Porjai, \nWongvisarut Khuangsatung, \nDheerawan Boonyawan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"190543e2f202dff3ade548b9eef54a2e881d3a878a1dc6b2d2f50a3b91750617","category":"Environment"}
