{"title":"From theory to practice: An integrated TTF-UTAUT study on electric vehicle adoption behavior","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297890","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Ayed Alwadain, Suliman Mohamed Fati, Kashif Ali, Rao Faizan Ali</p>\r\n\r\nIn Industry 4.0, the adoption of new technology has played a major role in the transportation sector, especially in the electric vehicles (EVs) domain. Nevertheless, consumer attitudes towards EVs have been difficult to gauge but researchers have tried to solve this puzzle. The prior literature indicates that individual attitudes and technology factors are vital to understanding users’ adoption of EVs. Thus, the main aim is to meticulously investigate the unexplored realm of EV adoption within nations traditionally reliant on oil, exemplified by Saudia Arabia. By integrating the “task technology fit” (TTF) model and the “unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology” (UTAUT), this research develops and empirically validates the framework. A cross-section survey approach is adopted to collect 273 valid questionnaires from customers through convincing sampling. The empirical findings confirm that the integration of TTF and UTAUT positively promotes users’ adoption of EVs. Surprisingly, the direct effect of TTF on behavioral intentions is insignificant, but UTAUT constructs play a significant role in establishing a significant relationship. Moreover, the UTAUT social influence factor has no impact on the EVs adoption. This groundbreaking research offers a comprehensive and holistic methodology for unravelling the complexities of EV adoption, achieved through the harmonious integration of two well-regarded theoretical frameworks. The nascent of this research lies in the skilful blending of technological and behavioral factors in the transportation sector.","author":"Ayed Alwadain","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"229f9ffdfc4b2d76e317d6a82c9ffccc05116017865b854fce1edff603daf92a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
