{"title":"Simulation and experimental study of a cold atmospheric pressure plasma and comparison of efficiency in boosting recombinant Endoglucanase II production in <i>Pichia pastoris</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303795","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Zeinab Kabarkouhi, Saeed Hasanpour Tadi, Hadi Mahmoodi, Seyed Omid Ranaei Siadat, Sareh Arjmand, Babak Shokri</p>\r\n\r\nRecombinant proteins are essential in various industries, and scientists employ genetic engineering and synthetic biology to enhance the host cell’s protein production capacity. Stress response pathways have been found effective in augmenting protein secretion. Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) can induce oxidative stress and enhance protein production. Previous studies have confirmed the applicability of CAP jets on Phytase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) production in <i>Pichia pastoris</i> hosts. This study investigates the effect of CAP treatment on another valuable recombinant protein, Endoglucanase II (EgII), integrated into the <i>Pichia pastoris</i> genome. The results demonstrated that plasma induction via two different ignition modes: sinusoidal alternating current (AC) and pulsed direct current (DC) for 120, 180, and 240 s has boosted protein secretion without affecting cell growth and viability. The AC-driven jet exhibited a higher percentage increase in secretion, up to 45%. Simulation of plasma function using COMSOL software provided a pattern of electron temperature (T<sub>e</sub>) and density distribution, which determine the plasma cocktail’s chemistry and reactive species production. Furthermore, electron density (n<sub>e</sub>) and temperature were estimated from the recorded optical spectrum. The difference in electron properties may explain the moderately different impressions on expression capability. However, cell engineering to improve secretion often remains a trial-and-error approach, and improvements are, at least partially, specific to the protein produced.","author":"Zeinab Kabarkouhi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5b57fdb04aa58fad255248fd9917c6f4dc37f646967ce5252974af22a78fc543","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
