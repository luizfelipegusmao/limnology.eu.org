Background: Injury of the spinal cord causes motor and sensory dysfunction, and pathological reflexes, leading to paraplegia or tetraplegia. The sequelae of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a significant burden and impact on healthcare systems. Despite constant progress in medicine, traumatic SCI still remains irreversible. Till now, no satisfying treatment that can enable neuronal regeneration and recovery of function at the damaged level has been found. Hundreds of experiments have been conducted on various possibilities of influencing spinal regeneration, some of them have yielded promising results, but unfortunately, the successes obtained in experimental animals have not translated into humans. \nMethods: This narrative review article presents the application of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (eSWT) in Spinal Cord Injury. The article has been divided into parts: 1. Use of extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy for regeneration of the spinal cord after traumatic Spinal Cord Injury. 2. Application of extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy in spasticity after Spinal Cord Injury. In both cases, the hypotheses of possible mechanisms of action will be described. Results and conclusions: A small number of clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of eSWT to influence the regeneration of the spine, as an innovative, safe, and cost-effective treatment option for patients with SCI. Some reports have shown that eSWT can improve spasticity, walking ability, urological function, quality of life, and independence in daily life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08669b0d1310e3c6d833acb16d46381e16e136f2255d140edb6d0f1c426d2d8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
