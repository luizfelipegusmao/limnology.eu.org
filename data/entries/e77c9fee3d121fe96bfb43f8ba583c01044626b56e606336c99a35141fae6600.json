{"title":"Activity Identification and Classification of On‚ÄêCourt Wheelchair Locomotion Tasks for Wheelchair Sport Analysis: A Method Proposal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1968/v1","date":1721901287000,"content":"Background: Monitoring the mobility of players during wheelchair sports is essential to support coaches in their understanding of the activity and in their training programming. However, the amount of information available from the monitoring tools, combined with a general approach to processing and a poor presentation of the data to the coaches, is not effective and remains unused. Thus, this study aimed to propose a simple and efficient algorithm for identifying locomotor tasks (static, forward/backward propulsion, pivot/tight/wide rotation) during wheelchair movements based on wheelchair kinematic data. Methods: A total of 36 wheelchair tennis and badminton players participated, completing at least one of three proposed tests: the star test, the figure-of-eight test, and the forward-backward test. Locomotor tasks were identified using a five steps procedure including data reduction, symbolic approximation and pattern logical search. Results: Using this method, 99% of locomotor tasks were properly identified for the star test, 95% for the figure-of-eight test and 100% for the forward-backward test. Conclusion: This method appears to be a valuable tool for a simple and clear identification and representation of locomotor tasks over extended periods of time. Future research should aim at applying this method to multiple wheelchair court sports matches or daily life declination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e77c9fee3d121fe96bfb43f8ba583c01044626b56e606336c99a35141fae6600","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
