{"title":"Evaluation of Population Pharmacokinetic Models of Micafungin: Implications for Dosing Regimen Optimization in Critically Ill Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0830/v1","date":1720599478000,"content":"Not occasional phamracokinetic variability and suboptimal exposure have been reported for micafungin in the intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients. This study aims to evaluate the quality of population pharmacokinetic models and provide rational using recommendation of this drug in clinical practice. Monte Carlo simulations were implemented to compare pharmakinetic parameters and probability of target attainment (PTA) towards various Candida species. Body weight, liver function, and SOFA score were the most frequent covariates in the final 16 included studies. micafungin clearance for ICU adults (SOFA≥10 or &amp;lt;10) was 39%–52% and 43%–57% higher, respectively, than non-ICU adults. For Candida infections with MICs &amp;lt;0.016 mg/L, the ICU group had lower proportions achieving PTA &amp;gt; 90% compared to the non-ICU group (2/6 (33%) vs. 4/7 (57%)), and for non-ICU and ICU adults, micafungin dosages of 100 and 150 mg were recommended, respectively. While for C. tropicalis and C. glabrata, 200 and 250 mg were recommended respectively. However, for C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, it failed to reach assumed PTA at MICs of 0.125-0.25 mg/L and 0.125-2 mg/L, respectively. Adjusting micafungin dosage in ICU patients may be necessary. Both ICU and non-ICU adults should modify their dosage regimens based on the Candida species and their respective MICs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c097091bd992d54b92ffdc9bda9484ac6c391a972fd9ab43d2791c5a2c204ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
