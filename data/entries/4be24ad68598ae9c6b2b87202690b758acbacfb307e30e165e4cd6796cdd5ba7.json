{"title":"Fabrication of a PLA Matrix Composite Reinforced with Exfoliated Graphite Produced by a Green Route","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.634/7719611?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Petroleum-based polymers are essential materials in sectors like packaging, construction, automotive, electronics, medicine, and sports due to their low costs and diverse properties such as low maintenance, extended lifetime, and manufacturing diversity [<a href=\"#ozae044.634-B1\">1</a>]. However, their intensified use has led to severe environmental problems like microplastic accumulation in marine and terrestrial ecosystems, aggravated by excessive greenhouse gas emissions during production. Despite all the ecological advantages that some biopolymers like polylactic acid (PLA) can provide, their mechanical and thermal properties still require some improvement. Incorporating fillers into the polymeric matrix is one of the most promising ways to solve this problem. Carbon-based molecules can be used as potential fillers because of their high availability, reduced cost, and low ecological impact. One of these materials, exfoliated graphite (EG), has an excellent chemical affinity for polymers because of its unique structure, which improves superficial adhesion for organic molecules due to functional groups with active electrostatic forces. In the present study, we investigated the influence of the incorporation of EG produced by an eco-friendly route on the tensile strength, Young’s modulus and thermal stability of PLA-graphite composites. Synthesizing the EG reinforcement particles includes mechanical milling and green leaching processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.634-B2\">2</a>]. The composites were reinforced with 1% (in weight) of two types of materials: exfoliated (EG) and untreated natural (NG) graphite. The composites were produced by the solvent casting method, which includes the PLA dissolution in an organic solvent (chloroform), followed by the incorporation of the reinforcements (NG and EG) using magnetic stirring and tip sonicating. Then, the mixture was cast in a metallic container and dried. The mechanical testing showed that the increase in Young's modulus is similar in both composites, with the one reinforced with NG slightly higher. On the other hand, the increase in the tensile strength is higher in the case of EG, obtaining an increase of 22 and 15%, respectively (compared to pure PLA). The initial degradation temperature of both composites was higher by 17 and 14°C for the composite reinforced with EG and NG, respectively. In addition, the final degradation temperature was higher for the composite reinforced with EG, as seen in Table 1. Fig. 1a shows an SEM micrograph of the PLA-EG composite; it can be seen that there is a hole with a flake form, where the reinforcement was pulled out of the matrix, leaving the hole behind. Since there are few of these holes, it can be said that a satisfactory filler/matrix interface exists. In Fig. 1b, the image of the PLA-NG composite shows several holes between the matrix and the reinforcement particle, showing a lack of filler/matrix interaction. As can be seen, the EG synthesis process demonstrated its efficiency in generating a good degree of exfoliation, which increased the contact area of the reinforcement, inducing an increase in the mechanical performance and thermal stability of the prepared PLA-EG composite.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4be24ad68598ae9c6b2b87202690b758acbacfb307e30e165e4cd6796cdd5ba7","category":"Environment"}
