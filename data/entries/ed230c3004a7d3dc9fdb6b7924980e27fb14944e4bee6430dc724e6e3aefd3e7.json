{"title":"The Need for an Interdisciplinary Approach to Marfan Syndrome: Future Direction from the Results of a Network Analysis of Marfan Syndrome Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2404/v1","date":1727688068000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to explore the collaborative networks in Marfan Syndrome (MFS) research by analyzing co-authorship patterns from 2000 to 2023. The objective is to identify key researchers, trends in collaboration, and the extent of interdisciplinary cooperation within the global MFS research community. Understanding these dynamics will inform the future direction of research in this field, emphasizing the need for a more integrated, interdisciplinary approach. Method: This study utilized network analysis techniques to evaluate 6,657 publications related to MFS research indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection between 2000 and 2023. The analysis was conducted using Python (Version 3.10.5) in the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3). The co-authorship networks were assessed using macro-level indicators such as network density (the ratio of actual to possible connections), clustering coefficient (degree of node clustering), number of components (distinct connected subgroups), and average path length (average distance between nodes). Micro-level indicators including degree centrality (importance based on the number of connections), closeness centrality (proximity to other nodes), and betweenness centrality (frequency of a node on the shortest paths between others) were also analyzed. Result: The network analysis revealed a persistent fragmentation within the MFS research community over the past two decades. While network density slightly increased from 0.0012 in the 2000–2009 period to 0.0016 in 2020–2023, the network remained disjointed with numerous disconnected components. Key contributors, such as Harry C. Dietz, Guillaume Jondeau, and Julie De Backer, demonstrated high centrality values, playing pivotal roles in shaping collaboration. The clustering coefficient remained high across all periods, indicating strong intra-group collaboration, yet underscoring the need for broader interdisciplinary partnerships.Conclusion: This study highlights the need for more integrated and cross-disciplinary collaboration in MFS research. Despite the significant contributions of central researchers, the overall fragmentation limits potential advancements. Fostering a more interconnected global network and encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation will be crucial to addressing the complex, multi-systemic nature of Marfan Syndrome and improving patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed230c3004a7d3dc9fdb6b7924980e27fb14944e4bee6430dc724e6e3aefd3e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
