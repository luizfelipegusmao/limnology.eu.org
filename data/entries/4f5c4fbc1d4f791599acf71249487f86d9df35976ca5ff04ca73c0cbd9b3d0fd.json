The paper begins by defining sustainability and highlights the importance of biotechnology in establishing sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture is an approach that prioritizes meeting current food and fiber production needs while conserving and enhancing natural resources for future generations. To achieve agricultural sustainability, it is necessary to strike a balance between economic viability, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. This can be difficult, especially in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses such as pests, diseases, climate change, soil degradation, and water depletion. The prevalence of pests and diseases that can significantly diminish crop yields and quality is one of the greatest obstacles to sustainable agriculture. Biotechnology can be used to create crops that are resistant to pests and diseases to address these issues. Soil nutrient deficiency is another obstacle to sustainable agriculture, as it can reduce crop yields and plant health. Biotechnology has the potential to play a significant role in developing more productive and nutritious crops. However, at the same time, it is essential to ensure that these technologies are developed in a responsible manner and that their benefits are distributed equitably across communities and regions.","author":"Saurav Das","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"4f5c4fbc1d4f791599acf71249487f86d9df35976ca5ff04ca73c0cbd9b3d0fd","category":"Environment"}
