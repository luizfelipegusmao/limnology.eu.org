As an important benchmark for both research and ecological management, there is still a lack of knowledge about the swimming ability of fishes in the Yarlung Zangbo River. The induced flow velocity (<i>U</i>\n<sub>ind</sub>), critical swimming speed (<i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub>), and burst swimming speed (<i>U</i>\n<sub>burst</sub>) of five <i>Schizothoracinae</i> species were tested in this study. Relative swimming ability related to body length and body shape was calculated. The results indicated that the average absolute swimming speeds (<i>U</i>\n<sub>ind-a</sub>, <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit-a</sub>, and <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst-a</sub>) of all the experimental fish were 10.20 ± 0.01, 57.58 ± 3.28, and 69.54 ± 2.94 cm/s, respectively, and the corresponding relative <i>U</i>\n<sub>ind</sub>, <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub>, and <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst</sub> related to body length (<i>U</i>\n<sub>ind-l</sub>, <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit-l</sub>, <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst-l</sub>) were 1.15 ± 0.07, 5.04 ± 0.26, and 7.23 ± 0.28 BL/s, respectively. Moreover, relative <i>U</i>\n<sub>ind</sub>, <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub>, and <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst</sub> related to body shape (<i>U</i>\n<sub>ind-s</sub>, <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit-s</sub>, and <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst-s</sub>) were 0.80 ± 0.13, 2.49 ± 0.51, and 4.32 ± 0.57 cm<sup>−2</sup>/s, respectively. No significantly differences in relative swimming speeds existed among five species. Only <i>Oxygymnocypris stewartii</i> was significantly weaker in <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst-s</sub> than <i>Schizothorax o'connori</i>. The body shape showed a stronger relationship with swimming speed than the body length did. <i>Schizothoracinae</i> fish in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin are less sensitive to the water flow and performed weaker <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> and <i>U</i>\n<sub>burst</sub> compared to those in the Yangtze River basin, indicating that <i>Schizothoracinae</i> fish in the Yarlung Zangbo River may be more susceptible to threats from environmental changes. The paper enriched the research on the swimming ability of <i>Schizothoracinae</i> fishes and provided efficient data for the fish conservation in the Yarlung Zangbo River.</p>","author":"Hongtao Wang, \nXutao Jiang, \nKejia Liu, \nXunchi Pu, \nYuanming Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"551cd036731db48894c1503509cedfa08d111c23eefa0512cb5a297b1aed54aa","category":"Environment"}
