{"title":"Technical-Economical Study on the Optimization of FDM Parameters for the Manufacture of PETG and ASA Parts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0877/v1","date":1720667942000,"content":"The article presents the results of the technical-economical study regarding the optimization of the FDM parameters (Lh – the height of the layer deposited in one pass and Id – the filling percentage) for the manufacture of PETG and ASA parts. To carry out the technical-economical study, we used the fundamental principle of value analysis, which consists in maximizing the ratio between Vi/Cp, where Vi - represents the mechanical characteristic, and Cp - represents the production cost. The results of the study show that for the tensile specimens made of PETG, the parameter that significantly influences the results of the Vi/Cp ratios is Lh, and in the case of the compression specimens made of PETG, the parameter that significantly influences the results of the Vi/Cp ratios is Id. In the case of specimens manufactured by FDM from ASA, the parameter that decisively influences the results of the Vi/Cp ratios of the tensile and compression specimens is Id – the filling percentage. By performing optimization of the process parameters with multiple responses, we identified the optimal parameters for FDM manufacturing of parts from PETG and ASA: Lh = 0.20 mm and Id = 100%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c29d5b7aed63a3a37902f5b05e58cbf156d83b0c6c87c747d690144bbacf017c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
