{"title":"Retinal ganglion cell topography and spatial resolving power in the pajama cardinalfish Sphaeramia nematoptera (Bleeker, 1856)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15680?af=R","date":1706942099000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We studied the topography of retinal ganglion cells (GCs) and estimated spatial resolving power (SRP) in the pajama cardinalfish <i>Sphaeramia nematoptera</i> (Bleeker, 1856), a relatively small brightly colored fish inhabiting coral reefs and lagoons in the Western Pacific. <i>S. nematoptera</i> is an active night predator feeding on near-bottom animal plankton and benthos. DAPI staining was used to label nuclei of GCs and non-GCs in the inner plexiform and ganglion cell layers. Non-GCs were distinguished from GCs in Nissl-stained retinal wholemounts based on cell size, shape, and staining intensity. The proportion of displaced amacrine cells (DACs) varied from 15.46 ± 1.12 (visual streak [VS]) to 17.99 ± 1.06% (dorsal periphery) (mean ± <span>S.E.M.</span>, <i>N</i> = 5); the respective proportions of glial cells were 6.61 ± 0.84 and 5.89 ± 0.76%. Thus, 76%–78% of cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer were GCs. The minimum spatial coverage of GCs (3600–4600 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) was detected in the dorsal and ventral periphery. It gradually increased toward the central retina to form a moderate VS. The maximum GC density (11,400–12,400 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) was registered in the central portion of the VS. No pronounced concentric retinal specializations were found. The total number of GCs ranged within 595.2–635.9 × 10<sup>3</sup>. The anatomical spatial resolving power was minimum in the ventral periphery (4.91–5.53 cpd) and maximum in the central portion of the VS (8.47–9.07 cpd). The respective minimum separable angles were 0.18–0.20° and 0.11–0.12°. The relatively high spatial resolving power and presence of the VS in the pajama cardinalfish are in line with its highly visual behavior.</p>","author":"Igor Pushchin, \nNaig Aleskerov","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"30ed456ef22a65f40e2270ca696069be16d6413a14c1d08d2c6e86b1517eea23","category":"Environment"}
