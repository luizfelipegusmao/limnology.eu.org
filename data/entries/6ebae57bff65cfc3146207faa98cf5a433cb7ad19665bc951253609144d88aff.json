{"title":"Effects of COVID-19 vaccine safety framing on parental reactions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302233","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Hao Tan, Jiayan Liu, Yingli Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nAs a major concern shared by parents globally, COVID-19 vaccine safety is typically being messaged to the public in a negative frame in many countries. However, whether the COVID-19 vaccine safety framing have an effect on parents when vaccinating their children is unclear. Here we implement an online survey with a convenience sample of 3,861 parents living in mainland China, all over 18 years old and with at least one child under 18. The parents were randomly assigned to receive information about COVID-19 vaccine safety in either a negative frame (incidence of side effects) or a positive frame (the inverse incidence of side effects), to compare parental reactions to a range of questions about communication, risk perception, trust, involvement and behavioral intention. We found that parents were more likely to regard vaccine safety as relevant to policy support and as a higher priority for government when receiving positively framed information (p = 0.002). For some specific subgroups, parents in positive framing group showed lower risk perception and higher trust (p&lt;0.05). This suggests that positive framing of COVID-19 vaccine safety messages show more effective performance than negative framing in terms of involvement, as well as trust and risk perception in specific subgroups, which may lead to a reflection on whether to adjust the current widespread use of negative framing. Our findings inform how governments and health care workers strategically choose the framing design of COVID-19 vaccine safety information, and have important implications for promoting COVID-19 vaccination in children in the future.","author":"Hao Tan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6ebae57bff65cfc3146207faa98cf5a433cb7ad19665bc951253609144d88aff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
