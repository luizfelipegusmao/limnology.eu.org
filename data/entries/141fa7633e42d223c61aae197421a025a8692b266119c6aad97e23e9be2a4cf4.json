{"title":"Elucidating the Causal Link Between Hearing and Chronic Kidney Disease Through Mendelian Randomization and Development of Predictive Machine Learning Models Based on NHANES Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0167/v1","date":1722588990000,"content":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health issue with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Traditional diagnostics, with about 70% accuracy, often delay CKD detection, highlighting the need for more efficient methods. Recent studies indicate a potential link between CKD and auditory health, yet this relationship remains underexplored due to methodological challenges and the complexity of establishing causality. Our research utilizes data spanning from 2000 to 2020 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), covering 12,392 participants, including 2,060 diagnosed with CKD. Through meticulous analysis employing logistic regression and Mendelian randomization, we have unearthed novel insights into the bi-directional associations between hearing impairment and CKD. Furthermore, we developed and validated a machine learning model that surpasses traditional diagnostic approaches in terms of accuracy and predictive power. These findings highlight the innovative integration of auditory examinations with demographic data to enhance CKD detection. Our approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning in transforming diagnostic methodologies, thus offering a significant advancement in the field of nephrology and public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"141fa7633e42d223c61aae197421a025a8692b266119c6aad97e23e9be2a4cf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
