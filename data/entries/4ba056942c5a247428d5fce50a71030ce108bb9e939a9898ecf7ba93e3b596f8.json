{"title":"Predicting Shot Accuracy in Badminton Using Quiet Eye Metrics and \nNeural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1908/v1","date":1727171876000,"content":"This paper presents a novel approach to predicting shot accuracy in badminton by analyzing Quiet Eye (QE) metrics such as QE duration, fixation points, and gaze dynamics. We develop a neural network model that combines visual data from eye-tracking devices with biomechanical data such as body posture and shuttlecock trajectory. Our model is designed to predict shot accuracy, providing insights into the role of QE in performance. The study involved 30 badminton players of varying skill levels from the Singapore Swimming Club. Using a combination of eye-tracking technology and motion capture systems, we collected data on QE metrics and biomechanical factors during a series of badminton shots.\n\nKey results include:\n1. The neural network model achieved 85% accuracy in predicting shot outcomes, demonstrating the potential of integrating QE metrics with biomechanical data.\n2. QE duration and onset were identified as the most significant predictors of shot accuracy, followed by racket speed and wrist angle at impact.\n3. Elite players exhibited significantly longer QE durations (M = 289.5 ms) compared to intermediate (M = 213.7 ms) and novice players (M = 168.3 ms).\n4. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.72) was found between QE duration and shot accuracy across all skill levels.\n\nThese findings have important implications for badminton training and performance evaluation. The study suggests that QE-based training programs could significantly enhance players' shot accuracy. Furthermore, the predictive model developed in this study offers a framework for real-time performance analysis and personalized training regimens in badminton.\n\nBy bridging cognitive neuroscience and sports performance through advanced data analytics, this research paves the way for more sophisticated, individualized training approaches in badminton and potentially other fast-paced sports. Future research directions include exploring the temporal dynamics of QE during matches and developing real-time feedback systems based on QE metrics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ba056942c5a247428d5fce50a71030ce108bb9e939a9898ecf7ba93e3b596f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
