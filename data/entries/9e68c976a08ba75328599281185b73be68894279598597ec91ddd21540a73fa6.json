This research explored the relationships between family factors, food consumption behaviors, and the nutritional status of Muslim school-age children in Thasala District, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Thailand. This descriptive research was conducted among 228 children aged 9-12 years. Data were collected using demographic data, nutritional status, and food consumption behaviors assessment. Data were analyzed using descriptive, chi-square, and binary logistic regression statistics. The results revealed that most samples reported having moderately healthy food consumption behaviors (M = 2.01, SD = 0.56). The samples had a normal weight (72.4%), while 15.8%  were classified as overweight and obese. The number of siblings and food consumption behaviors had a significant relationship with nutritional status (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Confirmation with binary logistic regression results also revealed that the likelihood of normal nutritional status was 2.40 times higher in children who had 3 or 4 siblings compared to those with 1 or 2 siblings (AOR = 2.40; 95% CI: 1.299-4.459). Additionally, children with healthy food consumption behaviors were 2.34 times more likely to have normal nutritional status compared to those with unhealthy dietary consumption (AOR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.183-4.631). Conclusion: Since the number of siblings and healthy food consumption behaviors were associated with nutritional status, healthcare providers must consider these 2 factors when establishing health education and behavior modification care plans to promote healthy food consumption and nutritional status among this group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e68c976a08ba75328599281185b73be68894279598597ec91ddd21540a73fa6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
