{"title":"The Change in Maintenance Strategy on the Efficiency and Quality of the Production System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1203/v1","date":1721092642000,"content":"The present paper deals with research on maintenance strategy and maintenance process improvement procedures to increase the efficiency and quality of the production system. It includes the design of maintenance performance indicators relevant to today's manufacturing systems to track improvements in the sustainable development of the manufacturing system. There are also the basic principles of maintenance strategy with linkages to the manufacturing system and selecting the strategy for the organization. The paper emphasizes maintenance management auditing and quality implementation in maintenance. Further, there is the process of changing the maintenance strategy described. This process includes reassessing the criticality of machines and equipment and their design units, then resource and capacity planning and input for maintenance management. It describes the impact of changing the maintenance management organization and maintenance capacity considering the change of strategy and the evaluation of maintenance choice alternatives, together with an analysis of the optimization procedure, which has an impact on social implication. The paper concludes by presenting the achieved impacts of maintenance strategy are: (1) increase in production efficiency (10%), (2) quality improvement in production (20%), (3) performance improvement (30%), (4) reduction of maintenance process costs (35%).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3017f8bfcc8160fd4bf6529815c3fa33dc4071232147cd8675418953f20f50ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
