{"title":"The impact of aerobics on mental health and stress levels: A visualization analysis of the CiteSpace map","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300677","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Jianxin Zhao, Yabing Bai, Yongjing Yang, Xiaolei Li</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aims to integrate research in the field of aerobics and mental health through the visualization analysis method of the CiteSpace map, to clarify the impact of aerobics on mental health and stress levels. Firstly, based on the literature method, pieces of literature related to aerobics and mental health are searched and collected. Secondly, the visualization analysis method of the CiteSpace map is employed to summarize and analyze the contents of the literature, involving statistical analysis of the annual number of publications, analysis of author characteristics, and analysis of publishing institution characteristics. In addition, keyword co-occurrence analysis and keyword cluster analysis are also conducted in related research fields. Among them, the Log-Likelihood Ratio is used in keyword cluster analysis. Finally, the results are analyzed using the visualization analysis method of the CiteSpace map and the statistics-based comprehensive results. The results demonstrate that in the recent 20 years, the average annual number of articles in related fields exceeds 190. The high-yield authors are distributed in economically developed areas, and the cooperation among authors is scattered. In the keyword clustering results, a total of 77 cluster labels are obtained. The Q value of the clustering module is 0.89, and the average clustering profile silhouette (S) value is 0.92, indicating that the clustering structure is significant and the results are reasonable. The aerobics cluster contains the most closely related keywords, covering mental health and stress levels. Data analysis based on existing studies reveals that aerobics has a significant impact on mental health and stress levels. Individuals participating in aerobics show obvious improvement in mental health inventory (MHI) scores (t(100) = 4.32, p&lt;0.05). Individuals participating in aerobics present a remarkable reduction in the questionnaire evaluation of stress levels (t(100) = -3.91, p&lt;0.05). This study’s results support aerobics’ positive effects on mental health and stress levels.","author":"Jianxin Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ea91fc8a49aa7e42063d1a7085ed496d14c290ef68e547244f85883f77c4214b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
