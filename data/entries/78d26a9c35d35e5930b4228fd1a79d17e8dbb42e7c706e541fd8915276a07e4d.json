{"title":"Quantitative Assessment of Ailia coila (Hamilton, 1822) Fish Population in Kaptai Lake: A Length‐Based Approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lre.12460?af=R","date":1721792380000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The <i>Ailia coila</i>, a small indigenous freshwater fish species in Kaptai Lake, plays a crucial role in providing employment, food, and financial security for the local people. With a high market demand, the average production of this species over the last 5 years reached about 112.27 metric tons. However, there has been a notable decline in <i>Ailia coila</i> fish production in Kaptai Lake in recent years. Therefore, to understand the current stock status of this species, this study employed a length-based stock assessment method the “length-based spawning potential ratio (LB-SPR)”. Between August 2022 and March 2023, a total of 1219 individuals were collected through fortnightly sampling from two fish landing centers (BFDC fishery ghat and Kaptai boat ghat) and two local markets (Banarupa Bazar and Reserve Bazar). The maximum length of <i>Ailia coila</i> was recorded at 15.7 cm in total length, with an average length of 11.1 (±4) cm. The length-weight relationship was estimated as <i>W</i> = 0.01084 <i>L</i>\n<sup>2.599</sup> (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.75). The value of shape parameter ‘<i>b</i>’ is smaller than three which indicate a negative allometric growth pattern. The estimated asymptotic length (<i>L</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>∞</i>\n</sub>\n<i>)</i> and length at first maturity (<i>L</i>\n<sub>50%</sub>) were found to be 16.84 and 10.54 cm, respectively. The LB-SPR revealed that the fishery is currently experiencing overfishing, with the spawning biomass (SPR = 32%) below the target reference point. The mean estimate of fishing mortality relative to natural mortality (F/M) was 3.07, more than three times the threshold F/M = 1, indicating extreme fishing mortality in this fishery. The estimated length at first capture (SL<sub>50%</sub>) was significantly higher than the length at first maturity (<i>L</i>\n<sub>50%</sub>), suggesting that the fishing is predominantly targeting mature fishes. To enhance the spawning biomass and ensure the sustainability of the fishery, it is imperative to reduce the current fishing pressure and implement appropriate management measures.</p>","author":"Abdur Rahim Mia, \nMitu Ranjan Sarker, \nMohammed Shahidul Alam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Lakes & Reservoirs: Science, Policy and Management for Sustainable Use: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0c37a2f8fab2f38bae7a8df98c682fefad0ef1d621f3013d69fd39589935ccea","entryHash":"78d26a9c35d35e5930b4228fd1a79d17e8dbb42e7c706e541fd8915276a07e4d","category":"Environment"}
