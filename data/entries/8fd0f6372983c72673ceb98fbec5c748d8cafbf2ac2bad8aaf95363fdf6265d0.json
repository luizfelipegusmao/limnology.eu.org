{"title":"Inheritance ofÂ environment-induced phenotypic changes through epigenetic mechanisms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/eep/article/doi/10.1093/eep/dvad008/7440031?rss=1","date":1700611200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic changes through various parental environmental factors alter the phenotypes of descendants in various organisms. Environmental factors, including exposure to chemicals, stress and abnormal nutrition, affect the epigenome in parental germ cells by different epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification as well as small RNAs via metabolites. Some current remaining questions are the causal relationship between environment-induced epigenetic changes in germ cells and altered phenotypes of descendants, and the molecular basis of how the abnormal epigenetic changes escape reprogramming in germ cells. In this review, we introduce representative examples of intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic changes through parental environmental factors and the accompanied epigenetic and metabolic changes, with a focus on animal species. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms of epigenomic inheritance and their possible biological significance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Epigenetics Current Issue","siteHash":"5549213f473d96cee0cf7ca1db1da1a69239cc267977bfd813fd34781f2cddbb","entryHash":"8fd0f6372983c72673ceb98fbec5c748d8cafbf2ac2bad8aaf95363fdf6265d0","category":"Environment"}
