{"title":"The association between alcohol consumption and herpes simplex virus type 2: A cross-sectional study from national health and nutrition examination survey 2009–2016","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307702","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Yushan Shi, Jiafeng Zhang, Zhantong Wang, Feng Shan</p>\r\nBackground <p>The current prevalence of Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is notably high, with individuals afflicted by HSV-2 facing recurrent outbreaks, challenges in achieving remission, and an elevated risk of HIV infection. This study aims to investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and HSV-2 infection.</p> Methods <p>The data for this study were sourced from 7257 participants who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2009 to 2016. The target population consisted of adults with reliable HSV-2 plasma results, and alcohol consumption was assessed using self-report methods. We evaluated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between alcohol consumption and HSV-2 infection. These estimations were derived from a logistic regression model that was adjusted for key confounding factors. Subgroup analysis specifically focused on alcohol consumption, and the interaction between HSV-2 infection, alcohol consumption, and other variables was assessed through stratified analysis.</p> Results <p>Among the 7,257 participants included, 89.8% (6,518/7,257) reported varying levels of alcohol consumption history. Compared to individuals who never drinkers, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for former drinkers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers were 1.79 (95% CI: 1.34–2.4, p &lt; 0.001), 1.38 (95% CI: 1.07–1.77, p = 0.012), 1.49 (95% CI: 1.15–1.94, p = 0.003), and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.14–1.9, p = 0.003), respectively. The results remained stable in subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.</p> Conclusion <p>Current research indicates that individuals with a history of alcohol consumption exhibit a higher risk of HSV-2 infection compared to those who have never drinkers.</p>","author":"Yushan Shi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"daf9ec05da76d0dcc65d2221f6013a4eb0b33de1d16b6a93e9d2e110474a70ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
