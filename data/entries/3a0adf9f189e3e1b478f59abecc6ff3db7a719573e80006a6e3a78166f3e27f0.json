{"title":"Immune Disorders Connecting Type2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Complications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1951/v1","date":1716977680000,"content":"Type2 diabetes(T2D) is a pervasive modern disease, classified as a metabolic disorder marked by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and life-long threatening cardiovascular morbidities. Subclinical inflammation stands as the primary pathogenetic factor propelling T2D progression, correlated with heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Immune cells serve as the prominent sources of cytokine production, and under diabetic conditions, they tend toward a proinflammatory phenotype, fostering chronic inflammation. This review zeroes in on the disrupted homeostasis characteristic of diabetic conditions, encompassing cytokines, hormones, and their interplay with altered immune function, all contributing to the onset of diabetic cardiovascular complications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a0adf9f189e3e1b478f59abecc6ff3db7a719573e80006a6e3a78166f3e27f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
