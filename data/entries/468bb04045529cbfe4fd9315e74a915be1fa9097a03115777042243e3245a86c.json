They find that while genetic background influences the rate of phenotypic evolution, it does not alter the evolutionary outcome. Their findings contribute to a growing body of work that connects genetic background to future evolvability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"468bb04045529cbfe4fd9315e74a915be1fa9097a03115777042243e3245a86c","category":"Environment"}
