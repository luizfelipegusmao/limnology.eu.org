These operators create an approximate topological space known as optimistic multiple-granulation supratopological spaces. OMG-supra-open and OMG-supra-closed approximation sets are also defined, followed by OMG-supra-continuous approximation and OMG-irresolute approximation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"763de2a884824fe150ba7a2622b16e3758d6541164576186f62405618bb7b09e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
