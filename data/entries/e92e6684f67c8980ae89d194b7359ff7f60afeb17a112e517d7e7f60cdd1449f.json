{"title":"Overcoming Waste Management Challenges in Costa Rica: Evaluating Practices, Government Initiatives, and Future Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0274/v4","date":1724207754000,"content":"Costa Rica, renowned for its environmental sustainability, faces a pressing waste management crisis that endangers its ecological and public health achievements. This study provides a detailed analysis of Costa Rica's waste management challenges, particularly in urban areas like San Jos√©, where nearly half of the nation's waste is produced. Major issues include insufficient landfill capacity, a low recycling rate of 9.6%, and significant regional disparities in waste practices. Using a hybrid modeling approach with Linear Regression and ARIMA models, the study forecasts waste minimization trends from 2024 to 2050, emphasizing the critical role of public participation in recycling efforts.The findings reveal limited success in government initiatives like the Environmental Health Route and the National Circular Economy Strategy, especially in rural areas. The study underscores the need for improved infrastructure, targeted public education, and the adoption of innovative technologies like AI and blockchain to achieve sustainable waste management. Strategic recommendations are provided to help Costa Rica align its waste management practices with global standards, enhancing its environmental sustainability and addressing the ongoing crisis effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e92e6684f67c8980ae89d194b7359ff7f60afeb17a112e517d7e7f60cdd1449f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
