{"title":"Sildenafil Citrate Oral Suspension: A Systematic Review and Expert Opinion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1976/v1","date":1721823443000,"content":"The management of erectile dysfunction (ED) shows several grey zones, especially in terms of patient satisfaction and adherence to the treatment. The main and first-line treatment for ED is drug therapy, mainly phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5is) but the adherence to the therapy is not optimal due to the low patient satisfaction reported in several cases. To address this issue, different administration routes and PDE-5is pharmacological formulations have been introduced in the pharmacological market. The pharmaceutical market has recently seen the introduction of a novel sildenafil oral suspension. This device offers access to all therapeutic regimens in one device, releasing 0.5 mL of suspension containing 12.5 mg of sildenafil with each pulse. This formulation enables tailored dosing based on clinical requirements and the demands of ED patients. Here, we aim to give a brief narrative review of the management of this new oral suspension in order to provide the readers with some suggestions to use in everyday clinical practice, on the basis of the recent evidence, by using an easy and rapid-to-consult questions and answers form. Also included are the conclusions of a board meeting of experienced andrologists regarding the most recent developments in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"432c2582c594858f9a0078253cb027ec1e958d1f1125df14b9524ba7162defe4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
