{"title":"Clinical Correlation of Transcription Factor SOX3 in Cancer: Unveiling Its Role in Tumorigenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1199/v1","date":1713440539000,"content":"Members of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors are crucial for embryonic development and cell fate determination. This review investigates the role of SOX3 in cancer, as aberrations in SOX3 expression have been implicated in several cancers, including osteosarcoma, breast, esophageal, endometrial, ovarian, gastric, hepatocellular carcinomas, glioblastoma, and leukemia. These dysregulations modulate key cancer outcomes such as apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, migration, cell cycle, and proliferation, contributing to cancer development. SOX3 exhibits varied expression patterns correlated with clinicopathological parameters in diverse tumor types. This review aims to elucidate the nuanced role of SOX3 in tumorigenesis, correlating its expression with clinical and pathological characteristics in cancer patients and cellular models. By providing a comprehensive exploration of SOX3 involvement in cancer, this review underscores the multifaceted role of SOX3 across distinct tumor types. The complexity uncovered in SOX3 function emphasizes the need for further research to unravel its full potential in cancer therapeutics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd57bd79383f3bfae468a88f58e0125376ecc3a78cedd971dc738a5bc0edaf67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
