{"title":"Urban Land Use Characteristics and Heat Islands: A Spatial Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1569/v1","date":1724245576000,"content":"The continuous expansion of urban areas has significantly increased the coverage of impervious paved surfaces, leading to heightened heat absorption and the formation of urban heat islands (UHIs). This research centres on environmental footprint accounting and management to address the escalating UHI risks in the City of Salisbury, Adelaide, South Australia. To comprehend the extent of land use change over time, the study employs the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in conjunction with Landsat satellite maps. The satellite maps were also analysed for the historical land surface temperatures, exploring the correlation between land use change and land surface temperatures. This approach allows for exploring the correlation between land use transformations and UHI intensity. The research cross-referenced the satellite data with meteorological station records for verification, which led to identifying possible factors associated with the temperature change in the city. Furthermore, the research extends its scope by analysing aerial photography images of the city, enabling a comprehensive investigation of land cover contribution to UHI effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21f32e41f21260958a87703786d37775927b2a119ae8e03acd1d08f5b5393260","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
