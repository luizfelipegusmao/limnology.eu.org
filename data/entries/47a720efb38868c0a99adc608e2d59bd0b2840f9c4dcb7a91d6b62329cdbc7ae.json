In grasslands, large grazing animals such as cattle and sheep have been shown to affect foliar fungal pathogens. However, theory and empirical studies have come to conflicting conclusions because grazers can directly and indirectly impact pathogens through a wide variety of mechanisms and various grazers may impact pathogens in different ways. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which grazers impact pathogens is important for a fundamental understanding of herbivore pathogen interactions and also to optimise grazing managements to reduce pathogen outbreaks.\n\nHere, we investigate multiple mechanisms by which livestock grazing impacts foliar fungal pathogens in grasslands. We integrate a large-scale grazing experiment, with a removal experiment manipulating plant density and litter biomass, to identify direct and indirect effects of two herbivores on pathogens with different life histories (biotrophs and necrotrophs), in a temperate grassland in northeast China.\n\nWe found that grazing by cattle and sheep had contrasting impacts: cattle grazing significantly reduced pathogen load, of both biotrophs and necrotrophs, whereas sheep grazing increased biotrophic pathogen load, but did not affect the necrotrophs. The grazing effects were mostly indirect and mediated by different impacts of the herbivores on plant community structure. Cattle grazing reduced pathogen load because it reduced the abundance of susceptible, fast-growing plants, and the overall density of plants, while sheep grazing increased pathogen infection because it reduced the abundance of resistant plant species. Plant diversity also reduced pathogen infection but these effects were independent of the herbivores.\n\nOur results show that different herbivores can have contrasting impacts on pathogen infection through contrasting impacts on host community competence. This suggests the importance of considering multiple mechanisms simultaneously to evaluate the impact of herbivores on host-pathogen interactions.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/02/09/large-herbivore-grazing-affects-plant-diseases-in-meadow-steppes/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Tianyun Li, \nEric Allan, \nSihan Yang, \nYiming Liu, \nMoshe Inbar, \nDeli Wang, \nZhiwei Zhong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"47a720efb38868c0a99adc608e2d59bd0b2840f9c4dcb7a91d6b62329cdbc7ae","category":"Environment"}
