The specificity (i.e. the similarity of the interacting partners) of plant–frugivore interactions could also change latitudinally given that differences in resource availability could favour species to become more or less specific in their interactions across latitudes.\n\nSpecies occurring in the tropics could be more taxonomically, phylogenetically and functionally specific in their interactions because of a wide range of resources that are constantly available in these regions that would allow these species to become more specialized in their resource usage.\n\nWe used a data set on plant–avian frugivore interactions spanning a wide latitudinal range to examine these predictions, and we evaluated the relationship between latitude and taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional specificity of plant and frugivore interactions. These relationships were assessed using data on population interactions (population level), species means (species level) and community means (community level).\n\nWe found that the specificity of plant–frugivore interactions is generally not different from null models. Although statistically significant relationships were often observed between latitude and the specificity of plant–frugivore interactions, the direction of these relationships was variable and they also were generally weak and had low explanatory power. These results were consistent across the three specificity measures and levels of organization, suggesting that there might be an interplay between different mechanisms driving the interactions between plants and frugivores across latitudes.\n</p>","author":"Cleber Ten Caten, \nTad Dallas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"44ef9a48ab2f58b715d493b761871e8e3b316a9dad2a70dc968927aa6c9340b8","category":"Environment"}
