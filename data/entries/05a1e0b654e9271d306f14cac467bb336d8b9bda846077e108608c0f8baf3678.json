{"title":"Frailty and Loneliness in Elderly People: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0515/v1","date":1720165819000,"content":"(1) Background: In a society with an advancing aging rate, medical systems are coming under pressure due to an increasing flow of elderly patients with multiple somatic diseases, exacerbated by their fragile psychological and sociological backgrounds. We aimed to investigate the relationship be-tween frailty and loneliness in elderly people. Our research question was “Is there a link between the loneliness and frailty in elderly people?” (2) Methods: To assess the link between loneliness and frailty, we conducted a search accessing Index Medicus and PubMed; the timeframe of our research was from 2013 till 2023. Data regarding the study population, as well as loneliness and fragility assessments and approaches, were extracted. (3) Results: A positive relationship between loneliness and the appearance and progression of frailty in elderly people is argued for. (4) Conclusions: Maintaining a balance in the body’s functionality for as long as possible requires the diagnosis and periodic assessment of health status at any age and, due to the various socio-financial and emotional implications, is particularly imperative for elderly patients. Frailty can be prevented, and it appears that it could even be reversed if early diagnosis and appropriate interventions are made. Therefore, knowledge of relevant risk factors—most likely including loneliness—is an absolute necessity to slow down, stop, and even reverse the frailty process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05a1e0b654e9271d306f14cac467bb336d8b9bda846077e108608c0f8baf3678","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
