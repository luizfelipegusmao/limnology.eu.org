{"title":"Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Oleyl-WRH Peptides for siRNA Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0833/v1","date":1720601460000,"content":"Delivering nucleic acid therapeutics across cell membranes is a significant challenge. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) containing arginine (R), tryptophan (W), and histidine (H) show promise for siRNA delivery. To improve siRNA delivery and silencing a model STAT3 gene, we hypothesized that oleyl acylation to CPPs, specifically (WRH)n, would enhance STAT3 silencing efficiency in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Using Fmoc/tBu solid-phase peptide chemistry, we synthesized, purified, and characterized the oleyl-conjugated (WRH)n (n = 1-4) peptides. The peptide:siRNA complexes were non-cytotoxic at N/P 40 (~20 μM) against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, SK-OV-3, and HEK-293 cells after 72 h incubation. All peptide:siRNA complexes showed serum stability at N/P ≥40. The synthesized conjugates, with a diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, formed nano complexes with siRNA and exhibited stable range of zeta potential values (13-18 mV at N/P 40). Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis provided qualitative and quantitative evidence of successful cellular internalization of siRNA. Peptides oleyl-(WRH)3 and oleyl-(WRH)4 showed ~60% and ~75% cellular uptake of siRNA, respectively, in both MDA-MB-231 and SK-OV-3 cells. Western blot analysis of oleyl-(WRH)4 demonstrated effective silencing of the STAT-3 gene, with ~75% silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells and ~45% in SK-OV-3 cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5fbb5ef02f24f8dd56cbf3af32150643743caecf370e447cb9e694b568cffe7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
