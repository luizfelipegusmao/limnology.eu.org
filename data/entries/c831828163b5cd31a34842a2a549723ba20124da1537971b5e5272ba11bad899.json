{"title":"Unveiling Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability in the Renewable Energy Sector: Challenges and Opportunities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0150/v1","date":1717497356000,"content":"This research investigates the challenges and opportunities associated with supply chain transparency and traceability in the renewable energy sector. Using a qualitative methodology, the study involved semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including industry experts, supply chain managers, regulatory officials, and NGO representatives. The findings reveal that the complexity and global span of renewable energy supply chains pose significant hurdles for ensuring transparency and traceability. Variability in the maturity of traceability systems across companies further complicates the landscape, with some companies benefiting from advanced systems while others struggle with cost and technical barriers. Technological advancements, especially blockchain, offer promising solutions but require standardization and scalability to be effective. Regulatory frameworks play a crucial role, yet inconsistencies across jurisdictions create compliance challenges, underscoring the need for harmonized standards. Collaboration and partnerships are essential, providing platforms for sharing best practices and developing common standards. Enhanced transparency can lead to operational efficiencies, improved consumer trust, and stronger market positioning. Integrating sustainability into supply chain practices is fundamental, aligning with the increasing emphasis on ESG criteria among investors and stakeholders. Education and capacity-building, particularly for suppliers in developing countries, are vital for promoting transparency. Leadership and corporate culture are critical in driving these efforts, with strong commitment from the top necessary to implement effective practices. This study contributes valuable insights for stakeholders in the renewable energy sector, offering a foundation for future research and policy development aimed at advancing sustainable and ethical supply chain practices. The findings highlight the need for a holistic approach that integrates transparency and traceability into broader sustainability and business strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c831828163b5cd31a34842a2a549723ba20124da1537971b5e5272ba11bad899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
