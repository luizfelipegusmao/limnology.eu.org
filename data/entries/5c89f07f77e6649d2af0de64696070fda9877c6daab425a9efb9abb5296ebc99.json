{"title":"Metabolism of Fluorinated Topolin Cytokinins in Micro Propagated Phalaenopsis amabilis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0078/v1","date":1717636909000,"content":"Fluorinated cytokinins have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional cytokinins in plant tissue culture, offering enhanced stability and bioactivity. However, their metabolic fate and impact on endogenous cytokinin profiles remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the cytokinin metabolism of Phalaenopsis orchids under varying exogenous cytokinin treatments (BA, FmT, FmTR) and culture conditions (open vs. closed containers). The results reveal distinct metabolic profiles associated with each treatment, highlighting the complex interplay between exogenous and endogenous cytokinin levels. Additionally, we proposed an alternative inactivation pathway involving the conversion of FmTR and BA to pT and pTR. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate relationship between cytokinin metabolism and plant growth under in vitro conditions, with implications for optimizing micropropagation protocols","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c89f07f77e6649d2af0de64696070fda9877c6daab425a9efb9abb5296ebc99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
