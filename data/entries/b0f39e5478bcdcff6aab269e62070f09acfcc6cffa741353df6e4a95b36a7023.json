Current methods for this exploration exist for robust analysis at micron length scales; however new approaches and methods are needed at the few nanometer and atomic length scales. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and low-magnification or field (LM or LF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are uniquely positioned to both qualitatively and quantitatively image magnetic spin textures when coupled with advanced phase reconstruction techniques to recover the materials underlying magnetic induction. Use of a Lorentz lens or “low-magnification” modes in magnetic characterization via TEM and STEM is of paramount importance since this enables advanced imaging capabilities in a field-free or near-field-free region, without the presence of the large magnetic field from the objective lens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b0f39e5478bcdcff6aab269e62070f09acfcc6cffa741353df6e4a95b36a7023","category":"Environment"}
