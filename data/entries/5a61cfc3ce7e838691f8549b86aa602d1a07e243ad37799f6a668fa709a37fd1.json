{"title":"Phylogenetic and phylogeographic insights into Sri Lankan killifishes (Teleostei: Aplocheilidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15792?af=R","date":1721274433000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Three nominal species of the killifish genus <i>Aplocheilus</i> are reported from the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Two of these, <i>Aplocheilus dayi</i> and <i>Aplocheilus werneri</i>, are considered endemic to the island, whereas <i>Aplocheilus parvus</i> is reported from both Sri Lanka and Peninsular India. Here, based on a collection from 28 locations in Sri Lanka, also including a dataset of Asian <i>Aplocheilus</i> downloaded from GenBank, we present a phylogeny constructed from the mitochondrial cytochrome b (<i>cytb</i>), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (<i>cox1</i>), and nuclear recombination activating protein 1 (<i>rag1</i>), and investigate the interrelationships of the species of <i>Aplocheilus</i> in Sri Lanka. The endemic Sri Lankan aplocheilid clade comprising <i>A. dayi</i> and <i>A. werneri</i> is recovered as the sister group to the clade comprising <i>A. parvus</i> from Sri Lanka and <i>Aplocheilus blockii</i> from Peninsular India. The reciprocal monophyly of <i>A. dayi</i> and <i>A. werneri</i> is not supported in our molecular phylogeny. <i>A. dayi</i> and <i>A. werneri</i> display strong sexual dimorphism, but species-level differences are subtle, explained mostly by pigmentation patterns. Their phenotypes exhibit a parapatric distribution and may represent locally adapted forms of a single species. Alternatively, the present study does not rule out the possibility that <i>A. dayi</i> and <i>A. werneri</i> may represent an incipient species pair or that they have undergone introgression or hybridization in their contact zones. We provide evidence that the Nilwala-Gin region of southwestern Sri Lanka may have acted as a drought refugium for these fishes.</p>","author":"Hiranya Sudasinghe, \nTharindu Ranasinghe, \nKumudu Wijesooriya, \nLukas RÃ¼ber, \nMadhava Meegaskumbura","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"5a61cfc3ce7e838691f8549b86aa602d1a07e243ad37799f6a668fa709a37fd1","category":"Environment"}
