{"title":"Bioactive Compounds in Olive Oils of Autochthonous Slovenian Olive Varieties &lsquo;Buga&rsquo;, &lsquo;Črnica&rsquo; and &lsquo;Drobnica&rsquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0534/v1","date":1715262059000,"content":"The fatty acid composition, biophenol, tocopherol, sterol and triterpenic dialcohol content and composition of the autochthonous Slovenian olive varieties 'Buga', 'Črnica' and 'Drobnica' were studied during a three-year period with the aim to valorise the characteristics of the three olive varieties. Standardized and accredited analytical methods were applied. The results of the investigation showed that the highest average amount of oleic acid (75.75%) was determined in oils of the variety 'Črnica', followed by 'Drobnica' (72.06%) and 'Buga' (68.73%). All the three varieties are a good source of total biophenols ('Buga' 616 mg/kg, 'Drobnica' 569 mg/kg and 'Črnica' 427 mg/kg) and α-tocopherol ('Buga' 378 mg/kg, 'Drobnica' 279 mg/kg and 'Črnica' 243 mg/kg). 'Buga' and 'Drobnica' are characterised by high amounts of total sterols, 2468 mg/kg and 2391 mg/kg, respectively, 'Črnica' oils, in comparison, showed a lower average value of total sterols (1351 mg/kg). The acquired data of the autochthonous Slovenian olive varieties 'Buga', 'Črnica' and 'Drobnica' are very important to valorise the characteristics of the produced oils. The studied varieties showed a great potential for further cultivation and valorisation of the traditional olive oil production of the region and are important for preserving the biodiversity and tradition of the territory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddef2eb4263e7489905fe72505b0e8c4ffa09ab8b469fc563686ba7c0befc3a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
