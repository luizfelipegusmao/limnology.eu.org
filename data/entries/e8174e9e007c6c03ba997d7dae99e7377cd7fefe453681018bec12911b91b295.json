{"title":"Assessing heavy metals, agricultural pesticides and petroleum hydrocarbons in the sediment cores of Anzali Wetland","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-024-05511-0","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Efficient investigation of sediment core samples is crucial for understanding the extent and sources of pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Accordingly, Anzali Wetland, located southwest of the Caspian Sea, is one of the most important and unique ecosystems in Iran. This paper evaluated the accumulation of metals, agricultural pesticides, and petroleum hydrocarbons in the core sample of sediment in the central area of Anzali Wetland. For this purpose, 180 cm core sediment was extracted. Then, accurate concentrations of metals, agricultural pesticides, and petroleum hydrocarbons were determined utilizing two general digestion and four-step chemical separation method, Gas Chromatography and Spectrofluorophotometer. Using cluster analysis, obtained data were analyzed and then discussed according to the standard indices, including the enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (<em>I</em>geo), pollution load index (PLI), index of pollution (<em>I</em>poll), and Risk Assessment (RI). The results indicated that the sediment of this wetland has low to moderate pollution. However, the amounts of cadmium and mercury as toxic metals were high in some parts of the sediment, indicating that the impact of anthropogenic pollution was significant. The sedimentation rate was 6.7 mm per year, and Darzban (chlorpyrifos) was more than other agricultural toxins. Moreover, oil pollution was not detected in Central Anzali Wetland, while hydrocarbon pollution caused by vascular plants and the entry of vegetable oils into municipal wastewater was detected. The highest agricultural pesticide was 74 mg/kg. Besides, 14% increase was observed in the amount of organic matter which was attributed to the inflow of wastewater and the growth of Azolla.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"e8174e9e007c6c03ba997d7dae99e7377cd7fefe453681018bec12911b91b295","category":"Environment"}
