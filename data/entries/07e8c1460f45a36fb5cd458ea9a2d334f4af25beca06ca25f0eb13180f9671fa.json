{"title":"Utilizing Insects as Bioindicators: An Approximation for Conservation in Urban Lentic Ecosystems from Central Chile","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1086/v1","date":1723772526000,"content":"Regulations and guidelines on water quality are used according to physicochemical but scarcely biological variables to protect ecosystems and control water use. This study innovates using in-sects as bioindicators to establish the health status of an aquatic ecosystem in the Latin American's lentic bodies. Water quality in urban lentic bodies in the Metropolitan Region, Chile, was evaluated from of aquatic insect assemblages and physicochemical variables for conserving aquatic life. Evaluations were carried out in parallel in four sampling stations in three water bodies, two seasons, and 2â€“3-year series, with three replicates. Aquatic insects were randomly sampled and identified by families; abundance, and richness differences were compared with non-parametric tests. Family Biotic Indices (FBI) were calculated. Physicochemical variables were measured using portable multiparametric and laboratory chemical analysis to determine water quality. A new physicochemical variable (total suspended solids) was established, which had a greater incidence with the results obtained for the FBI. Based on the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the water bodies, all of them were eutrophics. Given the ecosystem diversity and complexity, studies should delve deeper into wetlands to establish methods that contribute to determining water quality, using insects as bioindicators and physicochemical variables.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07e8c1460f45a36fb5cd458ea9a2d334f4af25beca06ca25f0eb13180f9671fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
