Alongside the rapid growth of aquaculture in China, aquafeed production continues to expand swiftly. This review attempts to establish an overview of the history and achievements in aquaculture nutrition research and feed industry in China. The development of scientific concept and methodology, especially the advanced molecular biology technology guarantees the shift from traditional nutrition to molecular nutrition, and subsequently to precision nutrition in aquaculture nutrition research. This evolution has facilitated the formulation of effective strategies to enhance the growth, health and product quality of aquatic animals. The advancements of aquaculture nutrition research and feed industry have also been propelled by innovative research concepts rooted in principles such as the health and safety of aquatic animals, the quality of aquatic products, resource conservation and environmental friendliness, and the advancements in key processing technologies within the aquafeed industry. The future perspectives of the aquaculture nutrition research and feed industry in China are also proposed. The present work aims to provide a reference for promoting the development of aquaculture nutrition research and feed industry in China.</p>","author":"Xianyong Bu, \nYueru Li, \nWencong Lai, \nChuanwei Yao, \nYongtao Liu, \nZhen Wang, \nZengqi Zhao, \nShangzhe Han, \nJianlong Du, \nXin Yao, \nKangsen Mai, \nQinghui Ai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"da9dc5def924b453d47b2412dc9b234f19545f7d813adf43f3b2c4cebe8b9849","category":"Environment"}
