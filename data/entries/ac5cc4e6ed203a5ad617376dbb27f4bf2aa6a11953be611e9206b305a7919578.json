{"title":"In Memoriam of Lena Kourkoutis: The Development of Cryo EXLO","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1068/7720314?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Co-author LAG originally met graduate student Lena Kourkoutis at Cornell during focused ion beam (FIB) training of an FEI Strata 400S in ∼ 2007. During training, we used one of Lena’s samples and were able to make a low energy polished FIB specimen which she immediately inserted into the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). It was instantly apparent to LAG that in addition to Lena’s bright and happy disposition, she possessed extraordinary technical skills confirmed by a subsequent Nature publication [<a href=\"#ozae044.1068-B1\">1</a>]. While Lena’s interest grew in cryo microscopy, LAG sought her guidance and referral letters for grant proposals. EXpressLO received a DOE grant in early 2020 as COVID-19 was shutting everything down which changed our initial proposed plans. LAG placed a call to Lena, and she graciously provided access to her lab and personnel for our equipment and team. This development work would not have been realized without Lena’s friendship and generosity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ac5cc4e6ed203a5ad617376dbb27f4bf2aa6a11953be611e9206b305a7919578","category":"Environment"}
