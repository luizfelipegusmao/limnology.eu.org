However, traditional analysis methods struggle to handle the influx of big data. While signal processing methods combined with deep learning have found widespread use in various process analyses and state identification, effective feature extraction using progressive fusion technology still faces challenges in the field of intelligent rock type identification. To address this issue, our study proposes a novel framework for rock type identification based on AE and introduces a new signal identification model called 3CTNet. This model integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer encoder, intelligently identifying AE of different rock fractures by establishing dependencies between adjacent positions within the data and gradually extracting advanced features. Furthermore, we experimentally compare five oversampling methods, ultimately selecting the adaptive synthetic sampling method (ADASYN) to balance the dataset and enhance the modelâ€™s robustness and generalization ability. Comparison of the internal structure of our model with a series of time series processing models demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model structure. Experimental results showcase the high identification accuracy of the intelligent rock type identification model based on 3CTNet, with an overall identification accuracy reaching 98.780%. Our proposed method lays a solid foundation for the efficient and accurate identification of formation rock types in geological exploration and oil and gas development endeavors.","author":"Tingting Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"90fdad4e00773a67906c91d4dafe3b718ba5508349fb7469cfa7a6c79c456132","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
