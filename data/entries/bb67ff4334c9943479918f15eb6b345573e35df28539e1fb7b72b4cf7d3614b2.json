{"title":"Supramolecular Assemblies in Mn(II) and Zn(II) Metal-Organic Compounds Involving Phenanthroline and Benzoate: Experimental and Theoretical Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1039/v1","date":1713257692000,"content":"Two new Mn(II) and Zn(II) metal-organic compounds of 1,10-phenanthroline and methyl benzoates viz. [Mn(phen)2Cl2]2-ClBzH (1) and [Zn(4-MeBz)2(2-AmPy)2] (2) (where, 4-MeBz = 4-methylbenzoate, 2-AmPy = 2-aminopyridine, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ClBzH = 2-chlorobenzoic acid) have been synthesized and characterized using elemental analysis, TGA, spectroscopic (FTIR, electronic) and single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Crystal structure analysis of the compounds reveals the presence of various non-covalent interactions which provides stability to the crystal structures. Crystal structure analysis of the compound 1 reveals the formation of supramolecular dimer of 2-ClBzH enclathrated within the hexameric host cavity formed by the neighboring monomeric units. Compound 2 is a mononuclear compound of Zn(II) where flexible binding topologies of 4-CH3Bz is observed with the metal centre. Moreover various non-covalent interactions such as lp(O)-π, lp(Cl)-π, C‒H∙∙∙Cl, π-stacking interactions as well as N‒H∙∙∙O, C‒H∙∙∙O and C‒H∙∙∙π hydrogen bonding interactions are found to be involved in plateauing the molecular self-association of the compounds. The remarkable enclathration of the H-bonded 2-ClBzH dimer into a supramolecular cavity formed by two [Mn(phen)2Cl2] complexes has been further studied theoretically using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, non-covalent interaction (NCI) plot index and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) computational tools. Synergistic effects have been also analysed using molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb67ff4334c9943479918f15eb6b345573e35df28539e1fb7b72b4cf7d3614b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
