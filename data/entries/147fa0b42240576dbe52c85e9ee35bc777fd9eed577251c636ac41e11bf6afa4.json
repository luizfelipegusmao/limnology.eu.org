{"title":"Biodegradation of Polyethylene Using Bacillus tropicus Isolated from Sewage Wastewater Treatment Plant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1796/v1","date":1729677063000,"content":"One of the most pressing environmental problems contemporary civilizations confront is the ever-increasing amount of plastic waste. Because of their impact on every living thing, these wastes are seen as a major issue on a global scale. To counteract the harmful environmental effects caused by conventional disposal methods, it is critical to show that eco-friendly alternatives are viable. Biodegradation is one of the best eco-friendly methods for removing plastic waste. In this study, we aimed to identify bacteria from sewage wastewater treatment plants (SWW) that could degrade polyethylene. The bacterial strains isolated from sewerage wastewater were incubated for 120 days in 50 ml of minimal salt media (MSM) containing 60mg polyethylene. After four months, our research revealed that Bacillus tropicus (SH4) demonstrated significant potential, degrading poly-ethylene up to 21.6%. We observed the changes after biodegradation using FTIR, GC-MS, and SEM analysis. In conclusion, microorganisms extracted from sewage wastewater possess the ability to mitigate plastic contamination in aquatic ecosystems. Future proteomics and genome investiga-tions are necessary to elucidate the enzymes and metabolic processes implicated in plastic breakdown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"147fa0b42240576dbe52c85e9ee35bc777fd9eed577251c636ac41e11bf6afa4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
