{"title":"Changes in Skeletal Muscle Atrophy over Time in a Rat Model of Adenine-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1421/v1","date":1724140448000,"content":"This study evaluated changes over time in skeletal muscle atrophy, expressions of skeletal muscle anabolic and catabolic genes, and mitochondrial activity by skeletal muscle type in an adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) model. A CKD model was successfully established by feeding male Wistar rats a 0.75% adenine diet for 4 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age. Control and CKD groups were sacrificed at 12 and 20 weeks of age. Back muscles were analyzed histologically, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining was performed to evaluate mitochondrial activity. Gene expressions of myogenic determination gene number 1 and myogenin as indicators of muscle anabolism, atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1) as indicators of muscle catabolism, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1-α as a marker of mitochondrial biogenesis were assessed. Type I and type II muscle cross-sectional areas (CSAs) were decreased at 12 weeks, but type I muscle CSA recovered at 20 weeks. SDH staining was lower in CKD than control rats at 12 weeks, but no significant difference was observed at 20 weeks. Increased expressions of myogenin, atrogin-1, and MuRF-1 were observed only at 12 weeks, but no differences were observed at 20 weeks. The adenine-induced CKD rat model appears to show changes in muscle atrophy over time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60544d7614419c725080b7c81f642756e1241153dc5af68c147a41af920aa37d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
