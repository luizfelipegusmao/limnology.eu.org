{"title":"Nutrient consumption patterns of Lactobacillus acidophilus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13424?af=R","date":1710244497000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>One of the greatest challenges in using <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> as a probiotic is acid stress. The current research aimed to identify substances that help <i>L. acidophilus</i> resist acid stress; this was achieved through assessing its nutrient consumption patterns under various pH conditions.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The consumption rates of alanine, uracil, adenine, guanine, niacin, and manganese were consistently higher than 60% for <i>L. acidophilus</i> LA-5 cultured at pH 5.8, 4.9, and 4.4. The consumption rates of glutamic acid + glutamine and thiamine increased with decreasing pH and were higher than 60% at pH 4.9 and 4.4. The viable counts of <i>L. acidophilus</i> LA-5 were significantly increased under the corresponding acidic stress conditions (pH 4.9 and 4.4) through the appropriate addition of either alanine (3.37 and 2.81 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>), glutamic acid + glutamine (4.77 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>), guanine (0.13 and 0.17 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>), niacin (0.02 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>), thiamine (0.009 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>), or manganese (0.73 and 0.64 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The viable counts of <i>L. acidophilus</i> LA-5 cultured in a medium supplemented with combined nutritional factors was 1.02–1.03-fold of the counts observed in control medium under all acid conditions (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Alanine, glutamic acid + glutamine, guanine, niacin, thiamine, and manganese can improve the growth of <i>L. acidophilus</i> LA-5 in an acidic environment in the present study. The results will contribute to optimizing strategies to enhance the acid resistance of <i>L. acidophilus</i> and expand its application in the fermentation industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yali Qiao, \nBoxing Yin, \nWei Zhou, \nMengrui Wang, \nZiqing Chang, \nJunping Zhou, \nMingzhe Yue, \nJunxia Chen, \nFei Liu, \nZhen Feng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"da7f4815a418ce4097ac6c16defccc9bd2ecc21f6d3077f3fae6e3496fdf8ff2","category":"Environment"}
