Weaned (n = 36) piglets were allotted to one of four groups and given the basal diet (NC), as well as the basal diet containing 0.5% (LT), 1.0% (HT) MGM-P, and antibiotics (PC), respectively. Diarrhea, growth performance, hematology, blood biochemistry and blood amino acid concentrations were monitored during feeding. 3 piglets per group were slaughtered after the experiment to assess organ index.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2cf3cb80415646c788194f409e0a29db3a2c6a1b3e14fb9c2938b328bdce4375","category":"Environment"}
