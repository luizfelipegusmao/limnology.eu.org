{"title":"Drying Goat's Milk by Spray Dryer: Physical-Chemical Characterization of Goat's Milk in Natura, in Powder and Reconstitutedle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0429/v1","date":1725532563000,"content":"Goat milk is a nutritious food, with high levels of vitamins and minerals. In this context, there is a growing need to improve preservation techniques. Thus, the present work was developed with the aim of drying goat milk using a spray dryer. Chemical, physical, and physicochemical analyses of powdered goat milk and reconstituted goat milk were performed, as well as the characterization of raw goat milk. The statistical model used was the full factorial design 2³ + 3, observing the Pareto Diagram and Analysis of Variance to study the effect of atomization frequency (Hz), inlet temperature (°C), and peristaltic pump rotation (rpm) on the responses for the powdered and reconstituted product. The planning was executed with eleven trials, including nine different trials and three central points. For the analysis of the planning at a 95% confidence level, the Statistica 8.0 software was used. The results showed that atomization frequency and inlet temperature had the greatest effect on the powdered product and the reconstituted food, respectively. Therefore, the importance of drying this food is evident as it offers several advantages for the food industry and consumers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19ec295e7eb9b95859613d4ec57f89fe36fffe4a3af796e99a23fc69b8bdbeb9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
