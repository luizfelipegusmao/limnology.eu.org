{"title":"Form and typology: systematic review in architectural publications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0928/v1","date":1718369970000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research on form and typology in architectural publications, spanning from 1999 to 2024. Utilizing the Web of Science database and the bibliometrix package in R, the study examines trends, influential works, and thematic evolution in the field. The findings reveal a progression from foundational themes such as \"architecture,\" \"culture,\" and \"planning\" to more specialized and diverse topics, including \"sustainability,\" \"parametric design,\" and \"digital fabrication.\" Key influential works by authors like Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch, and Bill Hillier are highlighted. The study also underscores the collaborative nature of contemporary architectural research, with significant international co-authorship. While providing valuable insights into the research landscape, the study acknowledges limitations, such as database reliance and the need for qualitative analysis. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, emphasizing the exploration of emerging technologies, interdisciplinary collaborations, and regional research dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32b26d637d4590ce9ee75f9223ce745e1f0c27ca956ae6ba0b27e3af99624217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
