{"title":"Effects on patient activation of eHealth support in addition to standard care in patients after radical prostatectomy: Analysis of secondary outcome from a randomized controlled trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308555","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Camilla Wennerberg, Mirjam Ekstedt, Kristina Schildmeijer, Amanda Hellström</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Prostate cancer is often treated with radical prostatectomy, but surgery can leave patients with side effects. Patients who actively take part in their rehabilitation have been shown to achieve better clinical outcomes. eHealth support has the potential to increase patient activation, but has rarely been evaluated in long-term randomized controlled trials. Therefore, we evaluated the effects on patient activation of eHealth support (electronic Patient Activation in Treatment at Home, ePATH) based on motivational theory. The aim was to investigate the effects of eHealth support on patient activation at 6 and 12 months after radical prostatectomy, compared with standard care alone, and associations with baseline patient activation and depression.</p> Methods <p>A multicentre randomized controlled trial with two study arms was conducted. Men planned for radical prostatectomy at three county hospitals in southern Sweden were included and randomized to the intervention or control group. The effects of ePATH on the secondary outcome, patient activation, were evaluated for one year after surgery using the patient activation measure and analysed using a linear mixed model.</p> Results <p>The study included 170 men during 2018–2019. In the intervention group, 64% (53/83) used ePATH. The linear mixed model showed no significant differences between groups in patient activation [β -2.32, <i>P</i> .39; CI -7.64–3.00]. Baseline patient activation [β 0.65, <i>P</i> &lt; .001; CI 0.40–0.91] and depression [β -0.86, <i>P</i> .03; CI -1.64– -0.07] statistically impacted patient activation scores over one year.</p> Conclusions <p>ePATH had no impact on patient activation during long-term prostate cancer rehabilitation. However, patient activation at baseline and depression scores significantly influenced patient activation, underlining the need to assess these aspects in prostate cancer surgery rehabilitation.</p> Trial registration <p>ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN18055968, (07/06/2018); https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN18055968; International Registered Report Identifier: RR2-10.2196/11625.</p>","author":"Camilla Wennerberg","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"24d873ce1350cbec3696c2f4ae4e12872b6279c2a18964ca93ac6adef6d2a5f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
