{"title":"A Critical Analysis of the Quantum Nonlocality Problem: On the Polemic Assessment of What Bell Did","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202205.0015/v8","date":1716444624000,"content":"Despite their Nobel prize-winning empirical confirmation, the interpretation of the Bell inequality remains controversial. By carefully analyzing Bell's work on nonlocality, we show how the correct appreciation of Bell's rationale calls for reformulating a widespread argument on quantum nonlocality, yielding a more consistent formulation of the problem. We delve into a formal proof of quantum mechanics' violation of local causality strikingly overlooked in favor of less appropriate arguments. For completeness, we also mention a few alternatives that may rationally justify considering quantum mechanics as a local theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb064e48808670d94cbcc4dd638fdbf1b073d831b80ad2386c3b239f06b206f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
