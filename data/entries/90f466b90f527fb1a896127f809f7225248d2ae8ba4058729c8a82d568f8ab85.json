{"title":"Internal Marketing and Transformational Leadership Influence on Employee Customer Orientation: A Mediation Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1646/v1","date":1729582973000,"content":"This paper explores the effects of internal marketing practices and transformational leadership on employee customer-oriented behaviour.  It uses social exchange and broadened-and-build theories to extend the motivation-opportunity-ability framework to the internal marketing and customer-oriented behaviour literature. Basic psychological needs theory is applied to refine the conceptualisation of internal marketing practices for a more holistic view of employee needs by including spiritual needs. Survey data from 174 frontline employees from the service sector in Pakistan is analysed using PLS-SEM. Results reveal a positive influence of internal marketing practices and transformational leadership on employee customer-oriented behaviour. Specific internal marketing practices and strategies are offered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90f466b90f527fb1a896127f809f7225248d2ae8ba4058729c8a82d568f8ab85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
