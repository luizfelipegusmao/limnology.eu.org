{"title":"Mortality Risk and Urinary Proteome Changes of Acute COVID-19 Survivors in the Multinational Study CRIT-COV-U Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1355/v1","date":1724068686000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Survival prospects following SARS-CoV-2 infection may extend beyond the acute phase, influenced by various factors including age, health conditions, and infection se-verity. However, this topic has not been studied in detail. We therefore investigated mortality risk post-acute COVID-19 in the CRIT-COV-U cohort. Methods: We could retrieve survival data from 651 patients and also assess the association between urinary peptides and future death. Data spanning until December 2023 were collected from six countries, comparing mortality trends with age- and sex-matched non-infected controls. A death prediction classifier was developed and validated using pre-existing urinary peptidomics datasets. Results: Notably, 13.98% of post-COVID-19 patients succumbed during the follow-up, with mortality rates significantly higher than non-infected controls, particularly evident in younger individuals (&amp;lt;65 years). These data for the first time demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection highly significantly increases the risk of mortality not only during the acute phase of the disease, but also beyond, for a period of about one year. In our study we were further able to identify 201 Urinary peptides linked to mortality, and integrated these into a predictive classifier (DP201). Higher DP201 scores, alongside age and BMI, significantly predicted death. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the utility of urinary peptides in prognosticating post-acute COVID-19 mortality, offering insights for targeted interventions. Our data also suggest that mortality should be considered as one possible symptom or conse-quence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a fact that is currently overlooked.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbe956f341254ad32b2d4bd5fb0c3ae5ffdbb28ec01f74d6b9ddc4e89a87ef70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
