In principle, unbiased approaches to image analysis and object classification are more rigorous and comprehensive than those based on interactive segmentation by observers. Nevertheless, obstacles to achieving reproducible classifications are encountered. In cell biology, a common practice is to compute a sizable number of variables and then combine the data to reduce the dimensionality. For example, a study of signaling changes with a growth factor had âˆ¼660 variables and 143 principal components [<a href=\"#ozae044.183-B1\">1</a>]. There is a dearth of basic knowledge about the sources of variation in these experimental paradigms, and additional research on variability and quality of image-based information is needed. Questions have been raised about how the results are biased by pre-processing methods [<a href=\"#ozae044.183-B2\">2</a>]. The effects of the process of mean-centering followed by standardization, which adjusts the means of variables to zero, and divides the centered variable by its standard deviation is studied here. This method is widely used in image analysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5b1e87e547447802ff316efcd45c0a81463493830118ee11771fc247bf84d769","category":"Environment"}
