{"title":"Uncovering the function of insulin receptor substrate in termitesâ€™ immunity through active immunization","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae061/7704699?rss=1","date":1719964800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are key mediators in insulin signaling pathway. In social insect lives, IRS proteins played important roles in caste differentiation and foraging, but there function in disease defenses such as active immunization has not been reported yet. To investigate the issue, we successfully suppressed the <span>IRS</span> gene 3 days after dsRNA injection. Suppressing <span>IRS</span> gene increased the contents of glucose, trehalose, glycogen, and triglyceride and decreased the content of pyruvate in termites, and led to the metabolic disorder of glucose and lipids. <span>IRS</span> suppressing significantly enhanced grooming behaviors of nestmates of fungus-contaminated termites and hence increased the conidial load in the guts of the nestmates. Additionally, <span>IRS</span> suppressing led to significant downregulation of the immune genes <span>Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein2</span> (GNBP2) and <span>termicin</span> and upregulation of the apoptotic gene <span>caspase8</span>, and hence diminished antifungal activity of nestmates of fungus-contaminated termites. The above abnormal behavioral and physiological responses significantly decreased the survival rate of ds<span>IRS</span>-injected nestmates of the fungus-contaminated termites. These findings suggest that IRS is involved in regulation of active immunization in termites, providing a better understanding of the link between insulin signaling and the social immunity of termites.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"6a48f07201860130260cb31979054f6b901f53554648e42df5707c5489b1a527","category":"Environment"}
