{"title":"Dementia Rehabilitation Training for General Practitioners and Practice Nurses: Does It Make a Difference?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1241/v1","date":1723802278000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Rehabilitation helps reduce disability in dementia. The Australian National Dementia Action Plan identifies a gap in clear treatment pathways post-diagnosis, affecting the quality of life for those with dementia. This study assessed the impact of a one-day dementia training course and follow-up on GPs' and practice nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and confidence regarding dementia rehabilitation.\nMethods: The training, led by two experienced GPs and an academic physiotherapist, covered dementia diagnosis, allied health roles, care planning, and referrals. The follow-up involved applying the learnt material and completing a reflective task. Three longitudinal surveys (Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale - DKAS, General Practitioners’ Attitudes and Confidence towards Dementia Survey - GPACS-D, and Dementia Rehabilitation Scale) and Likert-scale statements were conducted pre-course, post-course, and at 4-month follow-up, alongside a focus group. Descriptive and regression analyses were applied to survey data, and content analysis was used for focus group data.\nResults: Seventeen participants (14 GPs, 3 nurses) completed the pre-post course survey, with eight (6 GPs, 2 nurses) participating in follow-up and focus group discussions. Post-course, DKAS scores increased by 12.1%, GPACS-D by 10.1%, and the dementia rehabilitation scale by 9.4%. Likert-scale statements improved by 8-79%. At the four-month follow-up, there was a slight, non-significant decline in most measures. Focus groups highlighted the training’s impacts, useful components, barriers, and suggestions for improvement.\nConclusion: Training GPs and practice nurses in dementia rehabilitation enhances knowledge, awareness, and confidence. Ongoing efforts are needed to sustain benefits and address referral barriers for better access to dementia rehabilitation services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1095e891c8e200bce9738a87f4f54dd94d119f0917b7f03c13828bf9d9e73664","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
