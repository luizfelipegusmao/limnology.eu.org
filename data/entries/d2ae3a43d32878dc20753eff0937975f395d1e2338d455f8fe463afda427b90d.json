{"title":"Children’s questions and teachers’ responses about COVID-19 in Türkiye and the US","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307475","date":1721656800000,"content":"<p>by Burcu Ünlütabak, Graciela Trujillo Hernandez, İlayda Velioğlu, David Menendez, Karl S. Rosengren</p>\r\n\r\nQuestion-asking is a crucial tool for acquiring information about unseen entities, such as viruses; thus, examining children’s questions within the context of COVID-19 is particularly important for understanding children’s learning about the coronavirus. The study examined 3-12-year-old children’s questions and teachers’ responses about the COVID-19 pandemic in Türkiye, a non-Western developing context, and the United States, a Western cultural context. A total of 119 teachers from Türkiye and 95 teachers from the US participated in the study. Teachers completed an online survey consisting of a demographic form and a questionnaire asking them to report three questions about COVID-19 asked by children in their classrooms and their responses to these questions. We analyzed children’s questions and teachers’ responses for their type and content and examined demographic factors associated with children’s questions and teachers’ responses. Consistent with the literature, children from Türkiye asked fewer explanation-seeking (i.e., why/how) questions than children from the United States. Children asked questions about viruses and precautions. Teachers responded to children’s questions realistically in both countries. The findings have important implications for how children gain knowledge from teachers when discussing health, disease, and virus topics in two countries.","author":"Burcu Ünlütabak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d2ae3a43d32878dc20753eff0937975f395d1e2338d455f8fe463afda427b90d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
