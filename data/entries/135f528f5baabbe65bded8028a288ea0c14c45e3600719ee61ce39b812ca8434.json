{"title":"Detecting Methotrexate in Pediatric Patients Using Artificial Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0152/v1","date":1717496505000,"content":"Methotrexate is an antimetabolic agent with proliferative and immunosuppressive activity. It has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. However, there is evidence of an association between methotrexate and toxicity risks, which influences the personalization of treatment, particularly in the case of childhood ALL. This article presents the development and implementation of an algorithm based on artificial neural networks to detect methotrexate toxicity in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The algorithm utilizes historical clinical and laboratory data, with an effectiveness of 99% in the tests performed with the patients dataset. The use of neural networks in medicine is often linked to disease diagnosis systems. However, neural networks are not only capable of recognizing examples, but also hold very important information. For this reason, one of the main areas of application of neural networks is the interpretation of medical data. In this article we diagnose with the application of neural networks in medicine with a concrete example: Detecting Methotrexate in Pediatric Patient in its early stages.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"135f528f5baabbe65bded8028a288ea0c14c45e3600719ee61ce39b812ca8434","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
