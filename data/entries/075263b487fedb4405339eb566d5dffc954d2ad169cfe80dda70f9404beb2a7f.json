{"title":"Immunohistochemistry for Insect Histology and Pathology Diagnosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1354/v1","date":1721184199000,"content":"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) helps identify different types of tissues and provides important information about the pattern, shape, and structure of cells in a tissue sample. It is a very useful tool and widely used to uncover histology and pathology diagnosis uses. The IHC is a very useful tool to conduct research in the developmental biology area. Some insects, like butterflies, bees, beetles, ants, wasps, and moths, undergo a unique life cycle called complete metamorphosis, which has four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Larvae are often wingless and have different habits and forms than adults, which are better suited for growth and development. During the metamorphosis, how does the insect legs change is a really an interesting issue.To better understand insect development, agriculture pest control, and insect pathogen interaction, here we use an insect Bombyx mori (domestic silk moth) as a model to detail how to conduct the IHC assays, such as HE staining, TUNEL to see the cell apoptosis, pH3 and BrdU staining to check cell division. The reagents can be easily found, and this step-by-step protocol is easily reproduced.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"075263b487fedb4405339eb566d5dffc954d2ad169cfe80dda70f9404beb2a7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
