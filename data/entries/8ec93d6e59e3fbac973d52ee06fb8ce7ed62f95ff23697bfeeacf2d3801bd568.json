{"title":"389 Impact of a Controlled Internal Drug Release device on circulating and local concentrations of progesterone","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/294/7757330?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Controlled Internal Drug Release (CIDR) devices have become an important component of reproductive management programs in many beef herds. When a CIDR is inserted into a cow, circulating concentrations of progesterone mimic a functional corpus luteum. Some data, however, suggest that concentration of progesterone following insertion of a CIDR might have negative consequences on fertility in <span>Bos indicus</span> animals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of a CIDR device on circulating and uterine tissue concentrations of progesterone. A blood sample and a uterine biopsy were collected from non-suckled postpartum cycling Brahman cows (n = 10; Cycling) during the midluteal stage. A blood sample and a uterine biopsy were also collected from non-suckled postpartum cycling Brahman cows (n = 9; CIDR) after a CIDR had been in place for 5 d. To collect uterine biopsies from CIDR cows, the uterine biopsy tool was placed inside a plastic covering, both were passed into the cervix of the cow before the tool was extended through the covering and into the uterus. After the biopsy was collected, the tool was carefully removed to prevent sample contamination. Blood samples were centrifuged, and serum was collected to determine concentrations of progesterone. Uterine biopsies were snap frozen until extraction. Biopsies were weighted, thawed, and homogenized in assay buffer. Samples were then extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether and resuspended in assay buffer. Serum concentrations are reported as ng/mL and uterine concentrations are reported as ng/g. Statistical analysis was performed using the GLM procedure in SAS with treatment (CIDR vs Cycling), tissue type (uterine vs serum) and their interaction included in the model. There was a significant effect of treatment (<span>P</span> = 0.0062), tissue (<span>P</span> = 0.0063) and a treatment by tissue interaction (<span>P</span> = 0.0068). Animals with a CIDR had greater concentrations of progesterone than Cycling animals (274.77 vs 4.37 ng, respectively). Uterine samples had greater concentrations of progesterone than serum samples (274.40 vs 4.74 ng, respectively). These increased concentrations of progesterone were mainly from CIDR uterine samples (543.24 ng/g) which had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) concentrations of progesterone compared with all other samples, which did not differ from each other (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.98; CIDR Serum 6.29 ng/mL, Cycling Serum 3.2 ng/mL, and Cycling Uterus 5.54 ng/g). In summary, CIDRs increased circulating concentrations of progesterone sufficient to keep animals from exhibiting estrus, and were not different from cows in the midluteal stage of their cycle. Local concentrations in uterine tissue; however, were significantly greater when a CIDR was in place compared with uterine tissue collected during the midluteal phase. The implications of these significantly greater concentrations of progesterone in uterine tissue warrant further investigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8ec93d6e59e3fbac973d52ee06fb8ce7ed62f95ff23697bfeeacf2d3801bd568","category":"Environment"}
