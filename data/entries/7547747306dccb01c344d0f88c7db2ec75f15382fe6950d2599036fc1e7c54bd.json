{"title":"A comparative study on the moderating impact of renewable energy and innovation on environmental quality","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12420?af=R","date":1708506943000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study explores the complex interactions between renewable energy production, innovation, economic growth, institutional quality, economic globalization, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in OECD countries and emerging economies from 1996 to 2021. Results from Driscollâ€“Kraay standard error and feasible generalized least square reveal distinct trends: renewable energy production leads to increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in emerging economies but significantly reduces emissions in OECD countries. Besides, residential and non-residential innovation, along with total innovation, show similar effects. Notably, technology-moderated renewable energy production effectively lowers CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in both country groups. Similarly, economic growth enhances environmental quality in both sets of countries. However, institutional quality needs improvement in emerging economies, while current levels suffice in OECD nations to maintain environmental quality. Moreover, the study emphasizes the importance of considering globalization's impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, advocating for international agreements to leverage globalization for environmental benefits. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights for shaping renewable energy policies, fostering innovation, promoting economic growth, enhancing institutional quality, and harnessing globalization efforts to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and enhance environmental quality.</p>","author":"Shreya Pal, \nMuhammed Ashiq Villanthenkodath, \nMohd Arshad Ansari","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"7547747306dccb01c344d0f88c7db2ec75f15382fe6950d2599036fc1e7c54bd","category":"Environment"}
