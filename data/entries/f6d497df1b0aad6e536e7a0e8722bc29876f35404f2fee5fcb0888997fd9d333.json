{"title":"Utility of by‐products of black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) production as feed ingredients for Pacific Whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13070?af=R","date":1712545157000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Projected growth in insect production as alternative feedstuffs will yield novel by-products that are potentially valuable for aquafeed applications. We analyzed the nutrient composition of three by-products occurring from black soldier fly larvae production (exuvia, cocoon, imago) and the bioavailability of key nutrients for Pacific Whiteleg shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>). Protein accounted for 317 g kg<sup>−1</sup> in exuviae, 433 g kg<sup>−1</sup> in cocoons, and up to 521 g kg<sup>−1</sup> in adult flies (imagines). Considerable amounts of essential amino acids were detected in imago meal, which significantly matched the ideal dietary amino acid composition for penaeid shrimp (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.0076). Exuviae and cocoons contained moderate amounts of lipids (64–140 g kg<sup>−1</sup>), while imagines comprised 356 g kg<sup>−1</sup> total lipid. Saturated fatty acids predominated in all insect materials (47%–83% of total fatty acids). Chitin concentration was highest in cocoons and exuviae (154 and 139 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) and low in imagines (51 g kg<sup>−1</sup>). A feeding trial with shrimp, <i>L vannamei,</i> revealed apparent digestibility coefficients of 20%–59% for protein, 24%–54% for energy, 25%–49% for carbon, and 27%–68% for copper. Defatting of imago meal increased the digestibility of protein, energy, and carbon by 77%, 64%, and 61%, respectively. Defatted imago meal can serve as a protein supplement for shrimp diets.</p>","author":"Enno Fricke, \nReinhard Saborowski, \nMatthew James Slater","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"f6d497df1b0aad6e536e7a0e8722bc29876f35404f2fee5fcb0888997fd9d333","category":"Environment"}
