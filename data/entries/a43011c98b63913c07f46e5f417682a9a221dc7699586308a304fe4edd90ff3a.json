{"title":"‘Was my kidney biopsy worth it?’–A qualitative phenomenological study of patient experiences and perceived barriers to kidney biopsy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310358","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Michael Toal, Megan Raynor, Clare McKeaveney, Ciaran O’Neill, Michael Quinn, Christopher Hill, Alexander Peter Maxwell</p>\r\nBackground <p>Kidney biopsy is an important investigation in nephrology and facilitates the diagnosis of many conditions. It is an invasive procedure with the risk of significant complications, which limits its usage. There is minimal literature on how patients experience a kidney biopsy. Identifying and addressing barriers to access may expand opportunities for diagnosis and treatment. We hypothesise that patients experience kidney biopsy differently, depending on each individual’s circumstances.</p> Methods <p>Ten participants, who had undergone a total of twenty-three kidney biopsies were recruited through purposive sampling. They were interviewed about how they experienced the procedure, how they felt it had impacted their own medical care and about potential barriers and facilitators to access for other patients. A descriptive phenomenological approach was utilised and thematic analysis was applied to responses.</p> Results <p>Three main themes emerged: Unforeseen health concerns discovered, resilience and re-evaluation and the need for a patient-centred approach to biopsy. The experience of pain and discomfort varied amongst patients, but there was a significant emotional and psychological toll associated with kidney biopsy. All patients felt that the procedure had a positive impact on their treatment course through increased diagnostic information for them and their healthcare team. Further information in advance and the presence of trusted healthcare staff were identified as facilitators to kidney biopsy.</p> Conclusion <p>Kidney biopsy is experienced differently by patients. Improved information in advance by trusted healthcare professionals may reduce patient-related barriers to biopsy access.</p>","author":"Michael Toal","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a43011c98b63913c07f46e5f417682a9a221dc7699586308a304fe4edd90ff3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
