{"title":"Colistin: Lights and Shadows of an Older Antibiotic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2049/v1","date":1717135490000,"content":"The emergence of antimicrobial resistance have represented a serious threats for public health and infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms represent one of the most important causes of death worldwide. The renew of old antimicrobials, such as colistin, have been proposed as valuable therapeutic alternative to the emergence of the MDR microorganisms. Although colistin is well known to presents several adverse toxic effect, its usage in clinical practice have been reconsidered due to the broad spectrum of activity to gram-negative (GN) bacteria and to the important role of “last resort” agent against MDR-GN. Despite the revolutionary prospective of treatment of this old antimicrobial molecule, many questions remain open regarding the emergence of novel phenotypic traits of resistance and the optimal usage of the colistin in clinical practice. In the last years, several forward steps have been done in the understanding of resistance determinants, clinical usage and pharmacological dosage of this molecule, however, different points regarding the role of colistin in clinical practice and the optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets are not well defined yet. In this review, we summarize the mode of action, the emerging resistance determinants and its optimal administration in the treatment of difficult-to-treat infections due to MDR Gram-negative bacteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93ea9ee19f0b0c5c85ea30d192392ec526a4d13e017120c34647985dce675ee7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
