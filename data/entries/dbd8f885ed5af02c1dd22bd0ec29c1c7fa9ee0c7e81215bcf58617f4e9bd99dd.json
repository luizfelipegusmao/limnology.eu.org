{"title":"Hedgehog pathway negatively regulated depleted uranium‐induced nephrotoxicity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24242?af=R","date":1711632270000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Depleted uranium (DU) retains the radiological toxicities, which accumulates preferentially in the kidneys. Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a critical role in tissue injury. However, the role of Hh in DU-induced nephrotoxicity was still unclear. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of <i>Gli2</i>, which was an important transcription effector of Hh signaling, on DU induced nephrotoxicity. To clarify it, CK19 positive tubular epithelial cells specific <i>Gli2</i> conditional knockout (KO) mice model was exposed to DU, and then histopathological damage and Hh signaling pathway activation was analyzed. Moreover, HEK-293 T cells were exposed to DU with Gant61 or <i>Gli2</i> overexpression, and cytotoxicity of DU as analyzed. Results showed that DU caused nephrotoxicity accompanied by activation of Hh signaling pathway. Meanwhile, genetic KO of <i>Gli2</i> reduced DU-induced nephrotoxicity by normalizing biochemical indicators and reducing Hh pathway activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of <i>Gli1</i>/2 by Gant61 reduced DU induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis, ROS formation and Hh pathway activation. However, overexpression of <i>Gli2</i> aggravated DU-induced cytotoxicity by increasing the levels of apoptosis and ROS formation. Taken together, these results revealed that Hh signaling negatively regulated DU-inducted nephrotoxicity, and that inhibition of <i>Gli2</i> might serve as a promising nephroprotective target for DU-induced kidney injury.</p>","author":"Xueying Xie, \nGuoquan Fu, \nYuxin Liu, \nCaixia Fan, \nShanshan Tan, \nHuarong Huang, \nJunyan Yan, \nLifang Jin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"dbd8f885ed5af02c1dd22bd0ec29c1c7fa9ee0c7e81215bcf58617f4e9bd99dd","category":"Environment"}
