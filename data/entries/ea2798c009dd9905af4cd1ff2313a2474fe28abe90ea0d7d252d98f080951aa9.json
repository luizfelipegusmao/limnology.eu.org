{"title":"Understanding Physicians π Journeys with Corticosteroids &ndash; Experiences, Knowledge, and the Shadows of Fears","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2499/v1","date":1722418968000,"content":"Background: Corticosteroids (CS) are crucial for managing various medical conditions, but long-term use is associated with significant risks. Balancing the therapeutic benefits and potential hazards requires careful prescription and monitoring. This study explores Jordanian physicians' knowledge, experiences, and concerns regarding CS prescriptions. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between March and August 2023, using an online link distributed using social media platforms. Results: A total of 171 physicians enrolled in the study were predominantly male, with a median age of 31 years. Two-thirds worked in central Jordan, and one-third were general practitioners. The majority (86.5%) had experience both in topical (83.1%) and injectable (81.1%) dosage forms. Physicians demonstrated high knowledge (median score 11/11) and major concerns (median fear score 3.5/5) about CS. Major worries included the risk of osteoporosis (73.7%) and hyperglycemia (66.7%). Sociodemographic factors did not significantly impact their knowledge or fears. Conclusion: Our study showed that physicians have a high knowledge level about CSs but have major concerns about CS side effects, particularly osteoporosis and hyperglycemia. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address these fears, enhancing physician confidence and improving patient management outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea2798c009dd9905af4cd1ff2313a2474fe28abe90ea0d7d252d98f080951aa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
