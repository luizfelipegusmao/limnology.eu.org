{"title":"A Deep Learning-Based Low-Overhead Beam Tracking Scheme for RIS-Aided MISO Systems with Estimated Channels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0679/v1","date":1723425852000,"content":"The next generation network requires not only ultra high data rate, global coverage and connectivity, but also reducing network deployment costs and energy consumption. The emergence of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology provides an effective way to improve efficiency and reduce cost, while the passive elements bring new challenges of channel estimation (CE) and beam tracking. For a RIS-aided multiple-input and single-output (MISO) system, in this paper, to achieve the channel state information (CSI), we propose a principle component analysis (PCA) based staged channel estimation method. Based on the estimated channel, we propose a deep learning (DL) based beam tracking scheme to realize low-complexity RIS reflection coefficient design, which effectively improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user side. Simulation results verify our proposed channel estimation scheme based on PCA and beam tracking scheme based on DNN for the semi-active RIS-aided MISO systems can obtain approximate performances with much lower computational complexity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f1ed4ba5550dea60f8a73723cce8994d8b425a30104bc3aefd52907e639728b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
