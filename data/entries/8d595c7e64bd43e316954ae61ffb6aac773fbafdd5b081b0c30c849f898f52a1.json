{"title":"An Overview for the Need and Accessibility of Palliative Care Services for Romanian Patients with Liver Cirrhosis or End Stage Liver Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1944/v1","date":1729782273000,"content":"The concept of Palliative Care (PC) is more and more known in medicine and the need for this type of approach is growing in a world with great longevity and exponentially increasing chronic diseases. More and more cases from internal medicine, gastroenterology or cardiology wards could benefit from a better care if their medical team would align with the PC concept and principles. In this sense we try to present the specifical needs for Romanian patients in accordance with the current standards of care and how they must be adapted to the reality of the medical system in which they are cared for. We consider also that for medical staff from chronic disease wards it may be necessary to recapitulate the most important principles that govern medical practice of palliation, emphasizing some important aspects of applicability in daily clinical activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d595c7e64bd43e316954ae61ffb6aac773fbafdd5b081b0c30c849f898f52a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
