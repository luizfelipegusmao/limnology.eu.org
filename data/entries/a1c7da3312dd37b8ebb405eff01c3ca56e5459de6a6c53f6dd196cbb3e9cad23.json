{"title":"A Novel Types of Fuzzy Closed Sets, Separation Axioms, and Compactness via Double Fuzzy Topologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0781/v1","date":1715596217000,"content":"In this article, we first defined a stronger form of (r,s)-generalized fuzzy semi-closed sets (briefly, (r,s)-gfsc sets) called (r,s)-g*fsc sets and investigated some of its features. Moreover, we showed that (r,s)-fsc set → (r,s)-g*fsc set → (r,s)-gfsc set, but the converse may not be true. In addition, we explored novel types of fuzzy generalized mappings between double fuzzy topological spaces (U, τ, τ*) and (V, η, η*), and the relationships between these classes of mappings were examined with the help of some illustrative examples. Thereafter, we introduced novel types of higher separation axioms called (r,s)-GFS-regular and (r,s)-GFS-normal spaces with the help of (r,s)-gfsc sets and discussed some topological properties of them. Finally, some novel types of compactness via (r,s)-gfso sets were defined and the relationships between them were introduced.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1c7da3312dd37b8ebb405eff01c3ca56e5459de6a6c53f6dd196cbb3e9cad23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
