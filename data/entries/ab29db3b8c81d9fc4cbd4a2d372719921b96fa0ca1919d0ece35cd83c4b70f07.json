{"title":"Machine learning-based methodologies for cyber-attacks and network traffic monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0029/v1","date":1719816976000,"content":"The number of connected IoT devices is increasing significantly due to their many benefits, including automation, improved efficiency and quality of life, and waste reducing. However, these devices have several vulnerabilities that have led to the rapid growth in the number of attacks. Therefore, several machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) tools have been developed to detect intrusions and suspicious activity to and from a host (HIDS - Host IDS) or, in general, within the traffic of a network (NIDS - Network IDS). The proposed work performs a comparative analysis and an ablative study among recent machine learning-based NIDS to develop a benchmark of the different proposed strategies. The proposed work compares both shallow learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine, and deep learning algorithms, such as DNN, CNN, and LSTM, whose approach is relatively new in the literature. The algorithms are evaluated on the KDD-99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and IoT-23 datasets. The results show that the NIDS tools based on deep learning approaches achieve better performance in detecting network anomalies than shallow learning approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab29db3b8c81d9fc4cbd4a2d372719921b96fa0ca1919d0ece35cd83c4b70f07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
