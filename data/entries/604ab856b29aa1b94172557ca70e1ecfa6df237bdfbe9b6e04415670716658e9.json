{"title":"Effect of chlorpyrifos‐exposure on the expression levels of CYP genes in Daphnia magna and examination of a possibility that an up‐regulated clan 3 CYP, CYP360A8, reacts with pesticides","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24224?af=R","date":1710909289000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Daphnia magna</i> is a test organism used for ecological risk assessments of pesticides, but little is known about the expression levels of <span>c</span>ytochrome P450s (CYP)s and their changes after pesticide exposure in the less than 24-h-olds used for ecotoxicity tests. In this study, <i>D. magna</i> juveniles were exposed to 0.2 μg/L of chlorpyrifos under the conditions for acute immobilization test as specified by the OECD test guideline for 24 h, and then the gene expression was compared between the control and chlorpyrifos-exposure groups by RNA-sequencing analysis, with a focus on CYP genes. Among 38 CYP genes expressed in the control group, seven were significantly up-regulated while two were significantly down-regulated in the chlorpyrifos-exposure group. Although the sublethal concentration of chlorpyrifos did not change their expression levels so drastically (0.8 &lt; fold change &lt; 2.6), <i>CY360A8</i> of <i>D. magna</i> (<i>DmCYP360A8</i>), which had been proposed to be responsible for metabolism of xenobiotics, was abundantly expressed in controls yet up-regulated by chlorpyrifos. Therefore, homology modeling of DmCYP360A8 was performed based on the amino acid sequence, and then molecular docking simulations with the insecticides that were indicated to be metabolized by CYPs in <i>D. magna</i> were conducted. The results indicated that DmCYP360A8 could contribute to the metabolism of diazinon and chlorfenapyr but not chlorpyrifos. These findings suggest that chlorpyrifos is probably detoxified by other CYP(s) including up-regulated and/or constitutively expressed one(s).</p>","author":"Shinpei Ohnuki, \nShinichi Tokishita, \nMasaki Kojima, \nShoko Fujiwara","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"604ab856b29aa1b94172557ca70e1ecfa6df237bdfbe9b6e04415670716658e9","category":"Environment"}
