{"title":"A Novel Modeling Optimization Approach for a Seven-channel Titania  Ceramic Membrane in an Oily Wastewater Filtration System Based on Experimentation, Full Factorial Design, and  Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0839/v1","date":1723499161000,"content":"This comprehensive study looks at how operational conditions affect the performance of a novel seven-channel titania ceramic ultrafiltration membrane for the treatment of produced water. A Full factorial design experiment (23) was conducted to study the effect of the cross-flow operating factors on the membrane permeate flux decline and the overall permeate volume. Eleven experimental runs were performed for three important process operating variables: Transmembrane Pressure (TMP), Crossflow Velocity (CFV), and Filtration Time (FT). Steady final membrane fluxes and permeate volumes were recorded for each experimental run. Under the optimized conditions (1.5 bar, 1 m/s, and 2 hours), the membrane performance index demonstrated an oil rejection rate of 99%, a flux of 297 liters/m2Â·hr (LMH), a 38% overall initial flux decline, and a total permeate volume of 8.14 L. The regression models used for the steady-state membrane permeate flux decline and overall permeate volume led to the highest goodness of fit to the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. A Multiple Linear Regression method and an Artificial Neural Network approach were also employed to model the experimental membrane permeate flux decline and analyze the impact of the operating conditions on membrane performance. The predictions of the Gaussian regression and the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation method were validated with a determination coefficient of 99 % and a mean square error of 0.07.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21b0cf0f5dcee6db36b5886ad478718835f232066d73c447d7670787990e8b6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
