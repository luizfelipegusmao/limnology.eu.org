{"title":"The Impact of Migraine on the Thickness of the Inner Plexiform Layer Quantifying by Optical Coherence Tomography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1613/v1","date":1713972755000,"content":"Introduction: Migraine is one of the most prominent headache disorders with a global burden of over one billion patients and presented as a disabling and painful disorder. Pathophysiological mechanism of migraine is not fully understood, but the most accepted theory suggests that migraine is caused primarily by neural dysfunction leading to secondary changes in cerebral perfusion. \n\nMethods: Authors conducted a case-control study in 175 patients; 88 of them were migraineurs and 87 health controls. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in all patients using spectral-domain OCT device in the same environmental conditions. All participants met both inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to achieve more homogeneous groups. OCT was performed to scan all retinal layers with an emphasis on the inner plexiform layer (IPL). \nResults: Among 175 examined subjects, 84% of them were women and in the group of migraineurs we found 56% without aura and 44 % with aura. After collecting tomography data authors did not find subjects in which changes of IPL were found. Nevertheless, only moderate differences in the IPL thickness in all quadrants except the central area were found in the group of migraineurs with aura using Pearsonâ€™s test.\nConclusion: According to presented results, no significant changes of the IPL thickness in migraine patients were found. Authors have to emphasize the need for further investigation of the relationship between average migraine headache days per month and the thickness of the IPL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7503103543a955bb605551094312874c2fea5627484af8f6b75975f810186354","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
