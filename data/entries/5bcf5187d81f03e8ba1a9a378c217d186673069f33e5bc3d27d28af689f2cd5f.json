{"title":"Modeling SOS traffic using a CTMC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2373/v1","date":1727693068000,"content":"This paper aims to propose a novel SOS traffic and study its impact over Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Human-to-Human (H2H) traffic in Internet of Things environments specifically during disaster events. During such events (e.g., the spread COVID-19), SOS traffic, with its predicted exponential increase, will significantly influence all mobile networks. SOS traffic tends to cause many congestion overload problems that significantly affects the performance of M2M and H2H traffic. In our project, we developed a new Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) model to analyze and measure radio access performance in terms of massive SOS traffic that influences M2M and H2H traffic. Afterwards, we validate the proposed CTMC model through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. By analyzing the traffic during an emergency case, we can spot a huge impact over the three traffic M2M, H2H, and SOS traffic. To solve the congestion problem while keeping the SOS traffic without any influence, we propose to grant the SOS traffic the highest priority over M2M and H2H traffic. However, by implementing this solution in different proposed scenarios, the system becomes able to serve all SOS requests, while only 20% of M2M and H2H traffic could be served in the worst-case scenario. Consequently, we can alleviate the expected shortage of SOS requests during critical events, which might save many humans and rescue them from being isolated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bcf5187d81f03e8ba1a9a378c217d186673069f33e5bc3d27d28af689f2cd5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
