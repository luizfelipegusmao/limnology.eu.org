{"title":"The First VHE Activity of OJ 287 and the Extragalactic Background Light","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1256/v1","date":1721097600000,"content":"The BL Lacertae (BL Lac) object OJ 287 underwent an intense X-ray activity phase, exhibiting its brightest recorded X-ray flare in 2016-2017, characterized by much softer X-ray spectra and, concurrently, its first-ever recorded very-high-energy (VHE) emission (100--560 GeV), reported by the VERITAS observatory. Broadband spectral energy distribution reveals a new jet emission component similar to high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects, thereby implying the soft X-ray spectrum for the synchrotron emission. Using the advantage of simultaneous X-ray and VHE spectral information, as well as the source being a low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object, we systematically explored the extragalactic background light (EBL) spectrum by demanding that the VHE spectrum cannot be harder than the X-ray spectrum. We used three different phenomenological forms of the EBL spectral shape (power-law, parabola, and polynomial) motivated by current constraints on the EBL with the Bayesian Monte Carlo approach to infer the credible EBL range. Our study favors an almost flat power-law spectral shape and is consistent with previous studies. The other spectral forms capable of capturing curvature though result in a better statistics value; the improvement is statistically insignificant given the additional parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"935dbc39b8441d860c02bf7dc642ec24e9e776a0304a4d4e1889419fc1b5a948","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
