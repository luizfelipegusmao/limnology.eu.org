To understand options available to affected residents, we used new and previously existing water quality data to investigate deeper aquifers as alternate drinking water supplies and compared the regulatory responses near Chemours and three other PFAS production facilities with nearby contaminated wells. Data from &gt;100 wells show that GenX concentrations decrease with increasing depth through the four aquifers in the study area: surficial, Black Creek, Upper Cape Fear, and bedrock. This illustrates the extent of vertical PFAS penetration through the aquifer sequence following roughly 40â€‰years of atmospheric emissions. Detailed data on 143 water quality parameters in nine deep wells (two Upper Cape Fear, seven bedrock) revealed only eight exceedances of drinking water standards (one each for arsenic, perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], iron, chloride, and gross alpha, and three for manganese) and nine exceedances of health advisories (all for sodium). Regulatory responses to PFAS contamination of wells in four states included mention of deeper wells as an alternate water source only for nonresidential users in NC and residential users in Vermont. The bedrock aquifer is currently used by some residents and may be a viable alternative to shallower groundwater, though arsenic treatment may be beneficial at some deep wells and long-term sustainability of the aquifer should be evaluated.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nGenX concentrations decreased with increasing depth in four aquifers near a PFAS plant.\nA few exceedances of drinking water standards and health advisories were found in deep bedrock wells.\nNew bedrock wells could be part of the response to PFAS issues in shallower wells.\nIn the long term, deep bedrock wells might be a less expensive option for some residents.\n</p>","author":"Tiffany J.
