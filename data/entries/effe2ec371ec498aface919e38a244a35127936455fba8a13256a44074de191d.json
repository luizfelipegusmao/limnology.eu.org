{"title":"Effects of genetics on odor perception: Can a quick smell test effectively screen everyone?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae025/7693756?rss=1","date":1718409600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>SCENTinel, a rapid smell test designed to screen for olfactory disorders, including anosmia (no ability to smell an odor) and parosmia (distorted sense of smell), measures 4 components of olfactory function: detection, intensity, identification, and pleasantness. Each test card contains one of 9 odorant mixtures. Some people born with genetic insensitivities to specific odorants (i.e. specific anosmia) may fail the test if they cannot smell an odorant but otherwise have a normal sense of smell. However, using odorant mixtures has largely been found to prevent this from happening. To better understand whether genetic differences affect SCENTinel test results, we asked genetically informative adult participants (twins or triplets, <span>N</span> = 630; singletons, <span>N</span> = 370) to complete the SCENTinel test. A subset of twins (<span>n</span> = 304) also provided a saliva sample for genotyping. We examined data for differences between the 9 possible SCENTinel odors; effects of age, sex, and race on SCENTinel performance, test–retest variability; and heritability using both structured equation modeling and SNP-based statistical methods. None of these strategies provided evidence for specific anosmia for any of the odors, but ratings of pleasantness were, in part, genetically determined (<span>h</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.40) and were nominally associated with alleles of odorant receptors (e.g. <span>OR2T33 and OR1G1</span>; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). These results provide evidence that using odorant mixtures protected against effects of specific anosmia for ratings of intensity but that ratings of pleasantness showed effects of inheritance, possibly informed by olfactory receptor genotypes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"effe2ec371ec498aface919e38a244a35127936455fba8a13256a44074de191d","category":"Environment"}
