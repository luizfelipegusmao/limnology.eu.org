{"title":"The Role of Supplier Diversity in Enhancing E-Commerce Operations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1094/v1","date":1720919513000,"content":"Supplier diversity has emerged as a critical strategy for enhancing e-commerce operations by fostering inclusivity and innovation within supply chains. This qualitative research explores the role of supplier diversity in e-commerce, examining its impact on organizational strategies, competitive advantage, and stakeholder perceptions. Through semi-structured interviews with procurement managers, diversity officers, and supply chain executives from diverse e-commerce platforms, this study identifies key themes related to the benefits, challenges, and strategic implications of supplier diversity initiatives. Findings indicate that supplier diversity significantly enhances innovation and creativity within supply chains by integrating diverse perspectives and expertise. This diversity not only enriches product development and market responsiveness but also strengthens corporate reputation and brand equity, demonstrating organizational commitment to ethical business practices and community engagement. However, the study reveals persistent challenges, including financial barriers, systemic biases, and scalability issues, which hinder the effective implementation and scalability of supplier diversity programs. Effective supplier relationship management emerges as critical for maximizing the benefits of supplier diversity, fostering trust, collaboration, and long-term partnerships with diverse suppliers. Looking forward, the future of supplier diversity lies in digital transformation, globalization of supplier networks, and integration of sustainable sourcing practices to enhance transparency, efficiency, and resilience in supply chain operations. This study contributes to the growing literature on supplier diversity by providing empirical insights and practical implications for organizations aiming to leverage diversity as a strategic asset in e-commerce and global supply chain management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbf3ae28d6bf20638b203c4b43978a309dfbf47490e6206b267465c7c471e7fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
