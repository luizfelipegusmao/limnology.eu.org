However, a key challenge is the incorporation of membrane proteins that allow for transport, energy transduction, compartment growth and division. Here, we have successfully incorporated the membrane protein complex SecYEG—the key bacterial translocase that is essential for the incorporation of newly synthesized membrane proteins—in GUVs. Our method consists of fusion of small unilamellar vesicles containing reconstituted SecYEG into GUVs, thereby forming SecGUVs. These are suitable for large-scale experiments while maintaining a high protein:lipid ratio. We demonstrate that incorporation of SecYEG into GUVs does not inhibit its translocation efficiency. Robust membrane protein functionalized proteo-GUVs are promising and flexible compartments for use in the formation and growth of synthetic cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Synthetic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"41b19f195cf64174f01d8c36945485e6398e3496f8a7213d6905a0e36713ba3c","entryHash":"4aaab90d50a116013e14a06794c0c6631a9e680272d30b4f9bfedfaae81e8ea9","category":"Environment"}
