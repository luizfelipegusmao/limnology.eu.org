{"title":"A Secure Cloud Service for Managing User&#039;s Crucial Data Using NLP, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1738/v1","date":1727088851000,"content":"The management of user data in the cloud is easily poised to become a giant issue for any business, with so much digital information floating around these days that open it up as an easy target when companies aren’t vigilant. In this paper, a novel cloud-based service is proposed that employs various advanced NLP and encryption methods with the use of blockchain. These techniques are combined to provide a solid solution to secure fundamental data such as credit card numbers, passports or any government identity cards etc. Using a hybrid NLP model, integrating Transformer Models and Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically catagorzing data as critical vs non-critical. Only the most important data is encrypted by a user’s cryptographic wallet before being divided into multiple chunks and stored on an exclusive cloud cluster; metadata then takes turns managing securely through blockchain to provide traceable means of retaining integrity. Smart contracts provide strict access control measures and change the cryptographic nonce if need be to prevent illegal entrance into a specific zone, thus create security. This all-inclusive strategy maintains well-known high security standards for protecting the confidentiality, availability and integrity of your sensitive data on a global scale—delivering you simple yet scalable secure world-class cloud-based data management. A proposed framework developed to fulfil the security requirements for current cloud services, which is a beneficial contribution in context of data protection and cloud Security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31270f0839e089803203dc10d58417d3a23c06842881e5bfaf474facadf48d8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
