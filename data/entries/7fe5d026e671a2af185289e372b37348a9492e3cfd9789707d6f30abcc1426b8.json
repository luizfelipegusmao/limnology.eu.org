{"title":"Nephroprotective effects of silymarin and its fabricated nanoparticles against aluminum‐induced oxidative stress, hyperlipidemia, and genotoxicity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24223?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Aluminum (Al) is a ubiquitous element with proven nephrotoxicity. Silymarin (SM) is a mixture of polyphenolic components extracted from <i>Silybum marianum</i> and exhibited protective influences. However, SM bioactivity can be enhanced by its incorporation in chitosan (CS) through the use of nanotechnology. This work proposed to assess the protective influence of SM and its loaded chitosan nanoparticles (SM-CS-NPs) on aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>)-induced nephrotoxicity.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Six groups were created randomly from 42 male Wistar rats and each one contains 7 rats (<i>n</i> = 7). Group I, acted as a control and received water. Group II received SM (15 mg/kg/day) and group III administered with SM-CS-NPs (15 mg/kg/day). Group IV received AlCl<sub>3</sub> (34 mg/kg) and groups V and VI were treated with SM and SM-CS-NPs with AlCl<sub>3</sub> respectively for 30 days.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>AlCl<sub>3</sub> administration significantly elevated TBARS, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and kidney function levels besides LDH activity. Whereas GSH, CAT, SOD, GPx, GST, and GR values were all substantially reduced along with protein content, and ALP activity. Additionally, significant alterations in lipid profile, hematological parameters, and renal architecture were observed. Moreover, TNF-α, TGF-β, and MMP9 gene expression were upregulated in kidney tissues. The administration of SM or its nanoparticles followed by AlCl<sub>3</sub> intoxication attenuated renal dysfunction replenished the antioxidant system, and downregulated TNF-α, TGF-β, and MMP9 gene expression in renal tissues compared to the AlCl<sub>3</sub> group.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>SM-CS-NPs have more pronounced appreciated protective effects than SM and have the proficiency to balance oxidant/antioxidant systems in addition to their anti-inflammatory effect against AlCl<sub>3</sub> toxicity.</p>","author":"Fatma M.
