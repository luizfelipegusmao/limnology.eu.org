{"title":"3D-Q-FISH/TRF2 Nanotechnology Identifies a Progressively Disturbed Telomere/ Shelterin/Lamin AC Complex as the Common Pathogenic, Molecular/Spatial Denominator of Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0366/v1","date":1722940518000,"content":"The bi- or multi-nucleated Reed-Sternberg cell (RS) is the diagnostic cornerstone of EBV-positive and EBV-negative classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). cHL is a germinal center (GC) derived B-cell disease. Hodgkin cells (H) are the mononuclear precursors of RS. An experimental model has to fulfill three conditions to qualify as common pathogenic denominator: i) to be of germinal center-derived B-cell origin, ii) to be EBV-negative to avoid EBV latency III expression, and iii) to support permanent LMP1 expression upon induction. These conditions are unified in the EBV-, Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) cell line BJAB-tTA-LMP1. 3D reconstuctive nanotechnology revealed spatial, quantititive and qualitative disturbance of telomere/shelterin interactions in mononuclear H-like cells, further progression during transition to RS-like cells, including progressive complexity of the karytotype with every mitotic cycle, due to BBF (breakage/bridge/fusion) events. The findings of this model were confirmed on diagnostic patient samples and correlate with clincal outcome. Moreover, in vitro signficant disturbance of the lamin AC/telomere interaction progressively occured. In summary, our research over the past three decades identifed cHL as the first lymphoid maligancy driven by a disturbed telomere/shelterin/lamin AC interaction, generating the diagnostic RS. Our findings may act as trailblazer for tailored therapies in refractory cHL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86d3a81c7e704b190c47ca8d6e289215fad2d7ed186735fa0615dba6b5a9a822","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
