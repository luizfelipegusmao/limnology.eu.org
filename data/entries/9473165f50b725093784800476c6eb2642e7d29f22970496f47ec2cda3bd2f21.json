{"title":"Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum 1792) adenocarcinoma investigation with various diagnostic imaging techniques","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13951?af=R","date":1712570374000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Diagnostic imaging techniques provide a new aspect of the <i>ante-mortem</i> and post-mortem diagnostics in fish medicine. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide more information about the internal organs and pathognomic lesions. The authors used diagnostic imaging techniques to evaluate and describe the neoplastic malformation in a 3-year-old female rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>). The fish was examined with Siemens Somatom Definition AS + CT scanner and Siemens Biograph mMR scanner. The animal was lethargic and showed anorectic signs and muscular dystrophy. During the post-mortem investigation, histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also performed allowing us to identify the neoplasms. The results showed a large soft tissue mass in the first mid-intestine segment, which proved to be an adenocarcinoma. This subsequently led to digestion problems and absorption disorders. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells of carcinoma revealed E-cadherin and pancytokeratin positivity. This is the first study to report the use of MRI and CT for studying gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma in rainbow trout.</p>","author":"Márton Hoitsy, \nGyörgy Hoitsy, \nJános Gál, \nÁrisz Ziszisz, \nTamás Tóth, \nEndre Sós, \nViktória Sós‐Koroknai, \nCsaba Jakab, \nÖrs Petneházy, \nTamás Donkó, \nTamás Molnár, \nMiklós Marosán","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"9473165f50b725093784800476c6eb2642e7d29f22970496f47ec2cda3bd2f21","category":"Environment"}
