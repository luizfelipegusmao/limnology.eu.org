This study uses a hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS) to assess the habitat suitability of the Ganga River dolphins (GRDs) in a small reach (7.5â€‰km) of the Ganga River at the upstream of Narora barrage in varying flow. We use Lidar points clouds to generate topography, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), and differential GPS (DGPS) to measure channel bathymetry and streamwise water surface slope. Further, the water level data from satellite altimeter is used to calibrate the model and discharge measured in field to validate the model output. We found that in the high flow period, the required flow depth for dolphin habitat is available throughout in the study reach. However, in the lean flow, the required flow depth and velocity are available only in some patches. The methodology developed here would be very useful in monitoring hydraulic habitat suitability of aquatic species in ungauged rivers.</p>","author":"Gaurav Kailash Sonkar, \nKumar Gaurav, \nVaibhav Kumar, \nZafar Beg","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"ba13607d53a57acdaac6938f2bf06009c27692e191ef00dffcc5157dad18f505","category":"Environment"}
