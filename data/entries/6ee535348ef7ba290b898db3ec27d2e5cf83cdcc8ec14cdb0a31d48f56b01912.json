{"title":"Network Slicing in 6G: A Strategic Framework for IoT in Smart Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0275/v1","date":1717573784000,"content":"The emergence of 6G communication technologies brings both opportunities and challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) in Smart Cities. In this paper, we introduce an advanced network slicing framework designed to meet the complex demands of 6G Smart Cities IoT deployments. The framework development follows a detailed methodology that encompasses requirement analysis, metric formulation, constraint specification, objective setting, mathematical modeling, configuration optimization, performance evaluation, parameter tuning, and validation of the final design. Our evaluations demonstrate the framework's high efficiency, evidenced by low Round-Trip Time (RTT), minimal packet loss, increased availability, and enhanced throughput. Notably, the framework scales effectively, managing multiple connections simultaneously without compromising resource efficiency. Enhanced security is achieved through robust features such as 256-bit encryption and a high rate of authentication success. The discussion elaborates on these findings, underscoring the framework's impressive performance, scalability, and security capabilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ee535348ef7ba290b898db3ec27d2e5cf83cdcc8ec14cdb0a31d48f56b01912","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
