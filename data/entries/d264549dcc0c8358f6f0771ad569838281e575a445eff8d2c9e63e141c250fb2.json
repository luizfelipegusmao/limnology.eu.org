{"title":"Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae after COVID-19 Pandemic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0603/v1","date":1723102099000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the intricate interplay between viral infections and opportunistic bacterial pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae harbors various antibiotic resistance determinants like extended-spectrum and plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases and carbapenemases. In the two years following the pandemic, carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae isolates obtained routinely in outpatient and inpatient setting demonstrated similar resistance patterns which prompted research. The aim was to compare and subsequently analyze carbapenem-resistant hospital and outpatient’s K. pneumoniae isolates’ resistance mechanisms, traits and molecular epidemiology, following the COVID-19 pandemic. Disk diffusion and broth dilution method were the methods of choice to determine antibiotic susceptibility. β-lactamases were screened by phenotypic methods and confirmed with PCR. In total 113 isolates were analysed. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ertapenem was confirmed in all strains. High resistance rates (over 90%) were observed for extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and ciprofloxacin. OKNV testing and PCR detected OXA-48 in 106, NDM in 7 and KPC in only one isolate. ESBLs accompanied carbapenemases in 103 isolates. Carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae is becoming a global problem, hence careful monitoring of its resistance traits is of utmost importance in order to combat the arising threat. OXA-48 seems to continue predominating in the turbulent period after pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d264549dcc0c8358f6f0771ad569838281e575a445eff8d2c9e63e141c250fb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
