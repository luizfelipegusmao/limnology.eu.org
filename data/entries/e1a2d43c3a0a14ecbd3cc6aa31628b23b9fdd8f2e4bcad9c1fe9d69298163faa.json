{"title":"New Toolset of Reporters Reveals That Glycogen Granules Are Neutral Substrates of Bulk Autophagy in Komagataella phaffii","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2233/v1","date":1727443852000,"content":"Glycogen, a branched polysaccharide organized into glycogen granules (GGs), is delivered from the cytoplasm to the lysosomes of hepatocytes by the STBD1-driven selective autophagy (glycophagy). Recently, we developed Komagataella phaffii yeast as a simple model of GG autophagy and found that it proceeds non-selectively under nitrogen starvation conditions. However, another group, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, found that glycogen is a non-preferred cargo of the nitrogen-starvation induced bulk autophagy. To clarify cargo characteristics of K. phaffii GGs, we used the same glycogen synthase-based reporter (Gsy1-GFP) of GG autophagy in K. phaffii, as was used in S. cerevisiae. The K. phaffii Gsy1-GFP marked GGs and reported on their autophagic degradation during nitrogen starvation, as expected. However, unlike in S. cerevisiae, glycogen synthase-marked GGs were delivered to the vacuole and degraded there with the same efficiency as a cytosolic glycogen synthase in glycogen-deficient cells suggesting that glycogen is a neutral cargo of bulk autophagy in K. phaffii. We verified our findings with a new set of reporters based on the glycogen-binding CBM20 domain of human STBD1. The GFP-CBM20 and mCherry-CBM20 fusion proteins tagged GGs, reported about autophagy of GGs and confirmed that GGs in K. phaffii are neither preferred, nor non-preferred substrates of bulk autophagy. They are its neutral substrates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1a2d43c3a0a14ecbd3cc6aa31628b23b9fdd8f2e4bcad9c1fe9d69298163faa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
