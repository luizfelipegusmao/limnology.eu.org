{"title":"Health literacy among people at risk or with type 2 diabetes in Norwegian primary care—A cross sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312485","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Silje Therese Vågenes, Marit Graue, Jannicke Igland, Beate-Christin Hope Kolltveit, Hilde Kristin Refvik Riise</p>\r\nAims <p>This study aims to describe health literacy for people at risk of type 2 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes using the HLS-EU-Q12, and further examine the association between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, well-being, overall health and quality of life, and health literacy.</p> Material and methods <p>We performed a cross-sectional study among 142 people at risk of type 2 diabetes and 75 people with type 2 diabetes from four primary care clinics in Norway. These data are baseline data from a randomized controlled trial which seeks to evaluate an interprofessional follow-up intervention. Multiple regression analysis was applied to explore associations to health literacy.</p> Results <p>Inadequate health literacy (sum score &lt;33) was found among 30.2% of people at risk of type 2 diabetes and among 25.7% of people with type 2 diabetes. For people at risk of type 2 diabetes, higher level of education was significantly associated with higher health literacy. Better well-being and quality of life was significantly associated with higher health literacy for both groups.</p> Conclusions <p>The primary health care services should pay greater attention to assessing HL, well-being, and quality of life to facilitate the identification of people at risk of type 2 diabetes with insufficient self- management strategies to prevent or delay the development of manifest disease and its complications.</p>","author":"Silje Therese Vågenes","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"228a02da97d36b23b22140e611199a68db7453d24bb67ae37117a8f5312e72d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
