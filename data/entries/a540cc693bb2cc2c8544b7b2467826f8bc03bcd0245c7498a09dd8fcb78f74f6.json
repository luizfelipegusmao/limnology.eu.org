{"title":"Chemical Profile of &ldquo;Folla Redonda&rdquo; Grape; Differentiation with Traditional Winemaking Grapes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0552/v1","date":1715238951000,"content":"The Folla Redonda grape is indigenous to the region of Rias Bajas in Galicia, Spain. This grape is distinguished by its characteristic acid flavor and pulp of remarkable coloration. Despite the wine obtained from this grape is highly valued by consumers of this region for its surprising acidic notes and thickness, it is important to note that it is not a variety of Vitis vinifera and its production is not legally regulated. In the present study, an evaluation of the physicochemical properties of the Folla Redonda grape (pH, °Brix, °Bé, density, acidity, sugar content, etc.) as well as its content in bioactive compounds (total polyphenols and anthocyanins) was carried out. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of the extracts obtained from this grape was demonstrated. This study proved the interesting organoleptic characteristics of the grape, along with a high content of compounds of interest and an important antioxidant activity comparable to that of Vitis vinifera grapes. Therefore, the grape's natural consumption and its application in different industries such as nutraceutical or pharmacological would result in an important revaluation of the grape and significant health benefits. In case that the production of wine from this variety is legalized, consumers will not only be able to enjoy a wine with a characteristic dense reddish color and important acid tones, but also with interesting concentrations of bioactive compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a540cc693bb2cc2c8544b7b2467826f8bc03bcd0245c7498a09dd8fcb78f74f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
