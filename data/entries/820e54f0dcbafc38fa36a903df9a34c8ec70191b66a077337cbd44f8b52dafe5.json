{"title":"173 Assessing the impact of fiber and antioxidant supplementation during the periparturient period on gilt constipation, piglet viability, and body condition score","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/189/7664688?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fiber supplementation during the periparturient and lactation period is increasingly recognized for its potential to improve sow and litter performance. Yucca saponins and vitamin C have been shown to improve antioxidant status, reduce hypoxia and increase farrowing performance, but their interaction with fiber remains uncharted. The experimental objective was to evaluate fiber supplementation and its combination with yucca and vitamin C during the periparturient period of gilts on constipation status, body condition score, and farrowing performance. A total of 567 gilts were allotted to a randomized complete block design distributed across six farrowing rooms to 1 of 3 dietary treatments (n = 189/treatment). A subset of gilts from one farrowing room (n = 32/treatment) were selected for fecal sample collection. Dietary treatments included a control top dress targeting a daily intake of 277 g of total dietary fiber (TDF) using ground corn (CON); a top dress consisting of wheat middlings, beet pulp, soy hulls, rice hulls, ground corn, and a stimbiotic (Signis, AB Vista) targeting an intake of 440 g of TDF per d with 40 g being soluble fiber (FIB); and FIB with 680 mg of vitamin C and 2,500 mg of yucca (PLUS). A total of 454 g of the respective top dress was provided on top of lactation diet for a minimum of 3 d pre-farrow, and throughout lactation. Litter performance was collected throughout lactation. A daily constipation score (DCS) was assessed using a five-point scale from study initiation until 3 d post farrowing: 0 = absence of feces, 1 = dry and pellet shaped, 2 = between normal and dry, 3 = normal, soft, but formed, and 4 = wet, not firm. Caliper score (CS) was measured at loading and weaning employing a four-point caliper system: 0 = very thin, 1 = thin, 2 = ideal, and 3 = over conditioned. Litter viability was evaluated at 24- and 72-h post-farrowing using a predefined scale. Categorical data was analyzed using odd logistic regression with a model considering treatment and block as fixed effects. By d 3 of supplementation, there was a greater proportion of gilts fed FIB or PLUS, who had a DCS of 2 or 3 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Overall, when DCS was categorized as either constipated (0, 1) and not constipated (2, 3, 4), there were less incidences of constipation in FIB or PLUS treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.032). Treatment did not impact litter viability (24-h <span>P</span> = 0.917; 72-h <span>P</span> = 0.882). Similarly, CS distribution pre-farrowing and at weaning did not differ among treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.52). Gilts fed FIB and PLUS tended to wean more pigs per sow (86.9%, 88.6%, and 89.8% of pigs weaned for CON, FIB, and PLUS, respectively, <span>P</span> = 0.093), associated with reduced stillborn rate (<span>P</span> = 0.09) and pre-weaning mortality (<span>P</span> = 0.03). Collectively, increasing TDF during the periparturient and lactation period may aid in alleviating constipation and improve litter performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"820e54f0dcbafc38fa36a903df9a34c8ec70191b66a077337cbd44f8b52dafe5","category":"Environment"}
