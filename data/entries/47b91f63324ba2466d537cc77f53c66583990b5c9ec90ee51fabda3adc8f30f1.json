{"title":"Lipopolysaccharide‐Induced Lysosomal Cell Death Through Reactive Oxygen Species in Rat Liver Cell Clone 9","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24377?af=R","date":1729043194000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>In sepsis, bacterial components, particularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS), trigger organ injuries such as liver dysfunction. Although sepsis induces hepatocyte damage, the mechanisms underlying sepsis-related hepatic failure remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that the LPS-treated rat hepatocyte cell line Clone 9 not only induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis but also increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3-II and p62, and decreased the expression of intact Lamp2A, a lysosomal membrane protein. Additionally, LPS increased lysosomal membrane permeability and galectin-3 puncta formation, and promoted lysosomal alkalization in Clone 9 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-8 and cathepsin D (CTSD) suppressed the activation of caspase-3 and rescued the viability of LPS-treated Clone 9 cells. Furthermore, LPS induced CTSD release associated with lysosomal leakage and contributed to caspase-8 activation. Pretreatment with the antioxidant <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC) not only diminished ROS generation and increased the cell survival rate, but also decreased the expression of activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 and increased the protein level of Lamp2A in LPS-treated Clone 9 cells. These results demonstrate that LPS-induced ROS causes lysosomal membrane permeabilization and lysosomal cell death, which may play a crucial role in hepatic failure in sepsis. Our results may facilitate the development of new strategies for sepsis management.</p>","author":"Chien‐Sheng Hsu, \nShu‐Hao Chang, \nRei‐Cheng Yang, \nCheng‐Han Lee, \nMing‐Sheng Lee, \nJun‐Kai Kao, \nJeng‐Jer Shieh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"47b91f63324ba2466d537cc77f53c66583990b5c9ec90ee51fabda3adc8f30f1","category":"Environment"}
