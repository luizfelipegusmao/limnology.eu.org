{"title":"A Theoretical Model as a Contributing to Sustainable Tourism in Protected Areas: Machalilla National Park, Ecuador","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1302/v1","date":1718793977000,"content":"The research showsThis paperstudy presents a theoretical model of sustainable tourism in protected areas based on the experiences obtained in fromthrough field work carried out in the Machalilla national park. The units of analysis that compose it and their theoreticalâ€“-methodological foundation, and as well as the indications for their practical implementation in the face of the changes imposed by future tourism are exposed. Using the deductive method, the an analysis of the problem and the general theories linked to sustainable tourism in protected areas was carried out., the This involved establishingment of the premises and the developingment of the objectives to reach conclusions on the topic studied. A qualitative investigation is presented that allowed for the integration of contributions from the analyszes carried out for the treatment and processing of information. Among the results, the systematization of theoretical models linked to tourism in protected areas and, from a practical point of view, the application of a sustainable tourism model was were achieved. The results show the relevance of the proposed theoretical model that is proposed as a contribution to the scientific development of tourism. This model highlights, the systemic nature of its components from a new perspective of analysis, which considerings the need for changes as a development factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29c6802aa28d2393e7be36561297717638d4efac544fef488babf544072caecb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
