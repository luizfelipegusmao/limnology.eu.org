{"title":"Microbial Communities Associated with the Intestinal Tract of Grey Mullets from a Mediterranean Aquatic Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1532/v1","date":1716460563000,"content":"Grey mullets comprise different species which represent the most ubiquitous teleost families in the planet coastal waters. They represent an important proportion of the Mediterranean lagoons production and have been recently considered a cultivated marine fish. This study aimed to explore the intestinal bacterial communities of 34 wild-caught grey mullets in order to study their composition and the variation during different seasons. Thirty four healthy wild-caught fish were sampled and the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA were sequenced. Sixty prokaryotic phyla were identified and the most abundant ones were: Proteobacteria (mean relative abundance 35.4%±17.9), Actinobacteriota (mean relative abundance 16.4%±9.9) and Firmicutes (mean relative abundance 10.1%±10.9). Bacteria belonging to the phylum Chloroflexi were rele-vant in autumn, Spirochaetota, Verrucomicrobiota, Fusobacteriota and Cyanobacteria were particularly abundant in winter while Bacteroidota characterized summer fish. A total of three hundred thirty-two prokaryotic families were identified and the twenty-six most abundant ones were: Rhodociclaceae (Proteobacteria), Brevinemataceae (Spirocheaetota) and Fusobacteriaceae (Fusobacteriota) and the Staphylococcaceae (Firmicutes). This study sheds light on the ecology and high variation in the complex gut microbial community structure of Mediterranean grey mullets, the potential biotechnological role for fish nutrition and health and for preserving the aquatic habitat, a prerequisite for a sustainable aquaculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"207b8c05f60ae14d3e1325b3839e30e2aa72a7df9a5957e733a7ef8285793812","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
