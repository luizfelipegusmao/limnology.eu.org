{"title":"Accelerated Formation of Melanolipofuscin-Like Organelles in Japanese Quail Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells under Exposure to Blue Light: An Electron Microscopic Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1007/v1","date":1713252567000,"content":"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of epithelial cells lying between the neural retina and the choroid and is essential for photoreceptor function and viability. Quail Coturnix japonica is a convenient experimental animal model for the study of age and pathological retina processes to an accelerated time regime. The three main types of pigment granules present in the RPE are melanin-containing melanosomes, lipofuscin-containing lipofuscin granules, and mixed melanolipofuscin granules containing both melanin and lipofuscin. Itâ€™s known that with aging and pathology in RPE cells the content of melanosomes decreases but lipofuscin and melanolipofuscin granules accumulate. We examined melanolipofuscin granules in macular areas of the quail retina by transmission electron microscopy in young, middle-aged, and old birds, and in middle-aged birds irradiated with blue LED light (450 nm, 4 J/cm2). It has been shown that during photooxidative stress caused by the action of blue light on the quail eye, active fusion of melanosomes and lipofuscin granules occurs with formation of various types, including giant, mixed melanolipofuscin-like granules. Irradiation result in almost twofold decrease in the number of lipofuscin granules and synchronous increase in the number of melanolipofuscin-like granules. Increased accumulation of melanolipofuscin-like granules was also observed in non-irradiated old birds. It is assumed that the decrease in the number of melanosomes in the RPE during aging and photo-oxidative stress is associated with their fusion with lipofuscin granules and subsequent degradation of melanin by reactive oxygen species formed in melanolipofuscin-like granules. The disappearance of melanin deprives the RPE cells of light-filtering and antioxidant protection, and significantly increases the risk of their oxidative stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4c1f0de8cf2d0d3e1e159bb3a9284d20b220a35487820f53ce4f4cae402595c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
