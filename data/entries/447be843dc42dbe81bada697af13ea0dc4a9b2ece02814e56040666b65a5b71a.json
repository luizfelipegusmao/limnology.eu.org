{"title":"Manganese and Platinum Driven Oxidative and Nitrosative Stress in Oxaliplatin‚ÄêAssociated CIPN with Special Reference to Ca4Mn(DPDP)5, MnDPDP and DPDP","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0713/v1","date":1710249023000,"content":"There is little doubt that the efficacy of MnDPDP and its therapeutic improved counterpart Ca4Mn(DPDP)5 mainly depends on their MnSOD-mimetic activity when it comes to their potential use as rescue medicines, during e.g., acute myocardial infarction. However, pharmacokinetic considerations suggest that the efficacy of MnDPDP on Pt2+-associated neurotoxicity depends on another action of this drug. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) studies have demonstrated that Pt2+ outcompetes Mn2+ and endogenous Zn2+ from binding to fodipir (DPDP), and hence suggest that the previously reported CIPN protective efficacy of MnDPDP is a result of chelation and elimination of Pt2+ by DPDP, which in turn suggests that Mn2+ is unnecessary for efficacy when it comes to oxaliplatin-associated CIPN.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"447be843dc42dbe81bada697af13ea0dc4a9b2ece02814e56040666b65a5b71a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
