{"title":"Elucidating the z-dependence of the MOND acceleration (a0) within the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1374/v1","date":1726724118000,"content":"In a recent paper: “On the time dependency of a0” the authors claim that they have tested “one of the predictions of the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) theory on MOND” by studying the dependence of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) accelera- tion at two data sets, low-z (3.2 × 10−4 ≤ z ≤ 3.2 × 10−2) and high-z (0.5 ≤ z ≤ 2.5). They claim “both samples show a dependency of a0 from z”. Here, the work men- tioned above is revisited. The explicit analytic expression for the z-dependence of the a0 within the SIV theory is given. Furthermore, the first estimates of the Ωm within SIV theory give Ωm = 0.28 ± 0.04 using the low-z data only, while a value of Ωm = 0.055 is obtained using both data sets. This much lower Ωm leaves no room for non-baryonic matter! Unlike in the mentioned paper above, the slope in the z- dependence of A0 = log10(a0) is estimated to be consistent with zero Z-slope for the two data sets. Finally, the statistics of the data are consistent with the SIV predic- tions; in particular, the possibility of change in the sign of the slopes for the two data sets is explainable within the SIV paradigm; however, the uncertainty in the data is too big for the clear demonstration of a z-dependence yet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"426ba461fea337519a28d29ff40e736e2c2de4928e580d9c974f73a8046a622c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
