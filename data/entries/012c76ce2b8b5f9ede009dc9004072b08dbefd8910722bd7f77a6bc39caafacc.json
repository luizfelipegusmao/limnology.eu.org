{"title":"Generalized Right Core Inverse in *-Banach Algebras","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1246/v1","date":1718712842000,"content":"We introduce a new generalized inverse which is a natural generalization of (pseudo) right core inverse in a Banach *-algebra. We characterize this generalized inverse by using right core and quasi-nilpotent decomposition. We then present its polar-like characterization and investigate related algebraic properties. Finally, the right core-EP inverse is characterized by certain new ways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"012c76ce2b8b5f9ede009dc9004072b08dbefd8910722bd7f77a6bc39caafacc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
