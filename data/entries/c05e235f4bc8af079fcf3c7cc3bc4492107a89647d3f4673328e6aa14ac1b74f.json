{"title":"Effect of litter management systems on incidence and severity of footpad dermatitis among broilers at finisher stage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad145/7492756?rss=1","date":1703289600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pododermatitis, or footpad dermatitis (FPD), is a welfare concern affecting broiler chickens globally. In the humid tropics, where high temperatures and humidity prevail, the impact of pododermatitis on broiler performance characteristics and behavior becomes even more significant hence this investigation. One hundred and eighty male broilers were used for this experiment out of 200 birds initially procured at day old. They were brooded and reared on deep litter and at 21 days of age, they were randomly allotted to the experimental unit. There were three treatments each with three replicates in a completely randomized design. The three litter management systems constituted the treatment groups. In the first treatment (t-A), litter materials were changed on a weekly basis and replaced with fresh ones while in the second treatment (t-B), the litter materials were turned or raked once a week, and in the third treatment (t-C), the litter materials were left untouched. The litter material used across all treatments was wood shavings and t-C served as control. The experimental birds were fed ad libitum during the trial. Data on daily feed intake, incidence and severity of paw lesions, and weekly body weights were taken while the experiment lasted 35 days. Test of mobility and aggression were carried out on the birds from each group on the last day of the experiment. The moisture content and pH of litter materials of each replicate were taken weekly from day 21 till the end of the experiment. Data were later subjected to analysis of variance statistically. The results revealed that broilers on t-A performed better (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) than those on t-B and t-C for feed intake, live weight, weight gain, and feed utilization. However, FPD was pronounced among broilers on t-C and much more severe. A positive correlation was observed between the values of litter moisture content, litter pH, and incidence and severity of FPD. Birds on t-C were dull in appearance and inactive. In conclusion, FPD has a detrimental impact on the performance characteristics and behavior of broiler chickens in the humid tropics. However, the severity depends on the management system adopted. By adopting appropriate management practices such as weekly replacement of litter with fresh ones, it is possible to alleviate the negative consequences of FPD, improve broiler welfare, and enhance the sustainability of the poultry industry in these regions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"c05e235f4bc8af079fcf3c7cc3bc4492107a89647d3f4673328e6aa14ac1b74f","category":"Environment"}
