{"title":"Laparoendoscopic Rendez-Vous: An Effective and Safe Approach in the Management of Cholecysto-Choledocholithiasis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1302/v1","date":1716210437000,"content":"Background:\n\nThe two-stage technique combining the Endoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) clearance carried out before the laparoscopic cholecystectomy represents the most common approach for CBD stones. Over time, different techniques have been proposed to manage cholecysto- choledocholithiasis (CCL) advantageously in one stage. Among these, the laparoendoscopic rendez-vous (LERV) addresses the CCL issue with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with insertion of a guide wire performed at initial stage of the procedure, followed by the clearance of the bile duct carried out by the endoscopists. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safeness of LERV procedure recording results and complications, also making a comparison between our results and current literature.\n\nMethods: \n\nWe reviewed our experience of all consecutive patients with cholecysto-choledocholithiasis managed with LERV between January 2018 and December 2023. LERV success rate, operative time, length of hospital stay, stone recurrence, incidence of endoscopic and surgical complications  were analysed.\n\nResults: \n\nA total of 120 patients underwent LERV in our facilities. We reported a 97% LERV success rate, 1.6%  conversion-to-open rate, a median intraoperative time of 122 (range 95-220) min. The median hospital stay was 4 (range 2-38) days. An overall morbidity of 15% was reported (18/120): 15 Clavien-Dindo type 1/2, 2 type 3a and one type 3b. In two cases a re-operation during the hospital stay was necessary. At a median follow-up of 14 months (3-59) five patients experienced stone recurrence requiring redo-ERCP in two cases. \n\n\nConclusion:\n\nLERV offers the significant advantage of a single stage procedure and hospitalisation along with a lower  risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis, failed CBD cannulation and complications. Our experience confirms safety and effectiveness of the technique for CCL management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"986257969f4de2c10cbca3f6ad7570101c49d8d32146f914746508455bbf2856","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
