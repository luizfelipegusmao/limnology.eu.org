However, enterprises often neglect the local environmental protection in rural areas while developing the economy to pursue profits. As the end of the national administrative system and the villagers’ autonomous organization, the village committee needs to participate in monitoring enterprises’ environmental behavior. With this in mind, this paper builds a game model of enterprises, grass-roots governments, farmers, and village committees and analyzes the impact of village committees, grass-roots governments, and farmers on enterprise environmental behavior. The conclusions are as follows: (i) it is difficult for the village committee to promote the positive environmental behavior of enterprises, which needs the supervision of the grass-roots government; (ii) Improving the coordination ability of village committees is conducive to reducing the burden of government supervision; (iii) Farmers’ awareness of environmental protection can affect the environmental behavior of enterprises through the rights protection mechanism and reputation mechanism.","author":"Xujun Zhai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dbc59c098be22332a224578d524cabc9c679e5e58bfd96a616864bdf1a4612c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
