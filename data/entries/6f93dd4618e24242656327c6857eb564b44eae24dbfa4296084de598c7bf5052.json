{"title":"Vacuum or Not to Vacuum, That is the Question","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.389/7720409?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a thriving field that has developed into a mainstream technique for structural biology. In particular, both single particle and tomography techniques are being applied to broader biological contexts to advance science. To maintain instrument performance for efficient generation of scientific data for these applications, a key factor is a continuous supply of liquid nitrogen (LN2) to preserve the specimens in the electron microscopes over the duration of the experiment. At the Simons Electron Microscopy Center we have implemented a weight scale tracking system for nine of our autoloader systems that automatically monitors the LN2 weight [<a href=\"#ozae044.389-B1\">1</a>]. The weight of the LN2 dewar is saved every minute to a database and translated into product consumption over time. From this data we noticed differences in product use since the length of the LN2 hose varies per system. A long hose size adversely contributes to increase consumption of LN2. Also, comparing the shortest to longest run it can add 10 minutes to a fill cycle of the column dewar and autoloader dewar of an electron microscope. In addition, if the microscope comes out of a bake out or cryo-cycle it can take at least 20 minutes more to cool down from room temperature to LN2 temperature. With a vacuum insulated hose, we found that it only takes three minutes to cool down both dewars and after a cryo-cycle 12 minutes to be ready for cryogenic microscope operations. We also determined that using a vacuum insulated hose compared to a standard LN2 hose covered with foam insulation reduced consumption allowing a standard LN2 dewar to last 10 days. From the tracking system, we analyzed data points form a conventional hose (past year) and vacuum hose (data points from 2024) of LN2 consumption and determine the increased price for a vacuum insulated hose will pay for itself within a year. Through our observations the vacuum insulated hose has much less ice buildup during a LN2 fill even over a long LN2 hose run.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6f93dd4618e24242656327c6857eb564b44eae24dbfa4296084de598c7bf5052","category":"Environment"}
