{"title":"A New Educational Reality: Active Methodologies Empowered by Generative AI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1933/v1","date":1724752355000,"content":"The article explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence with active methodologies in modern education, highlighting how this combination can transform pedagogical practices and promote more personalized and effective learning. The study investigates the application of tools such as ChatGPT , which enhance the personalization of teaching, providing immediate feedback and adjusting content to students' individual needs. The research is structured into three chapters: the first addresses practical strategies for applying these methodologies with AI, the second evaluates their effectiveness in learning and the third presents practical examples of integration. Adapting teaching through AI was a central element in developing a more efficient learning environment aligned with the specific needs of each student. The results point to a significant increase in student engagement, understanding and retention of content, although they highlight the need for careful and ethical implementation to avoid challenges such as superficiality in learning and data privacy issues. It is concluded that the integration of generative AI with active methodologies can significantly transform the educational environment, but must be carried out in a balanced and responsible way, complementing traditional pedagogical practices and ensuring the comprehensive training of students.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e9f379b78579e02f46b33da2eda931b1b1a3ff52a98ead67cb28eb859d31237","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
