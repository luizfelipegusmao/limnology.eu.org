{"title":"Research on Input Schemes for Polarimetric SAR Classification Using Deep Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1726/v1","date":1714281670000,"content":"This study employs the reflection symmetry decomposition (RSD) method to extract polarization scattering features from ground object images, aiming to determine the optimal data input scheme for deep learning networks in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar classification. Eight distinct polarizing feature combinations are designed, and the classification accuracy of various approaches is evaluated using the classic convolutional neural networks(CNNs) AlexNet and VGG16. The findings reveal that the commonly employed 6-parameter input scheme, favored by many researchers, lacks the comprehensive utilization of polarization information and warrants attention. Intriguingly, leveraging the complete 9-parameter input scheme based on the polarization coherence matrix results in improved classification accuracy. Furthermore, the input scheme incorporating all 21 parameters from the RSD and polarization coherence matrix notably enhances overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient compared to the other 7 schemes. This comprehensive approach maximizes the utilization of polarization scattering information from ground objects, emerging as the most effective CNN input data scheme in this study. Additionally, the classification performance using the second and third component total power values (P2 and P3) from the RSD surpasses the approach utilizing surface scattering power value (PS) and secondary scattering power value (PD) from the same decomposition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ba32b3b52001334dcd59d2eb7421dd86653ea70d822925d5fa15060ab81be40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
