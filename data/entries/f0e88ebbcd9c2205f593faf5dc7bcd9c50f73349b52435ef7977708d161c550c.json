{"title":"Phylogenetics, character evolution, and historical biogeography of the Neotropical genus Besleria (Gesneriaceae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/206/1/83/7635233?rss=1","date":1711411200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Besleria</span>, a genus of perennial herbs, shrubs, or small trees growing in the understorey of rainforests, is one of the largest genera of neotropical Gesneriaceae, with over 165 species. Despite the ecological importance and ubiquity of <span>Besleria</span> in rainforest ecosystems, taxonomic and evolutionary studies of <span>Besleria</span> are limited. Here, we generated a phylogenetic analysis of <span>Besleria</span> using four nuclear and chloroplast DNA regions (ITS, <span>mat</span>K, <span>rps</span>16, and <span>trn</span>L-<span>trn</span>F) covering more than 50% of the recognized species, along with two secondary calibration points to infer divergence times. Our results support the monophyly of <span>Besleria</span> and allowed us to revise the infrageneric classification and biogeographical history of the genus. We identified five major clades that do not correspond to sections or subsections in previous classifications. These clades are well circumscribed geographically but remain difficult to characterize using previously hypothesized morphological characters. Biogeographical reconstructions indicate an origin in the northern Andes during the Middle Miocene (ca. 15 Mya). The current distribution patterns of this plant group have been significantly shaped by geological and climatic events, particularly Andean uplift and the formation of the Panama Isthmus.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"84b5fa2619594e061395c38d918de42c13a5b0cd8ac0441f237084e35d0e4410","entryHash":"f0e88ebbcd9c2205f593faf5dc7bcd9c50f73349b52435ef7977708d161c550c","category":"Environment"}
