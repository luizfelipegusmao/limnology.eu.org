{"title":"403 Impact of lysine, methionine, and histidine deficiencies on gene expression and upstream transcriptional regulators in bovine mammary epithelial cells: An RNA-sequencing analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/326/7757181?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Essential (E) amino acids (AA) may alter bovine mammary epithelial cell functions by impacting mRNA expression of genes through their upstream transcription factors. The objective of this research was to study the impact of EAA deficiencies on gene expression and to identify upstream transcriptional factors mediating their effects in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Epithelial cells were collected from the mammary glands of lactating dairy cows and cultured in combined media of DMEM/F12 and Medium 170, differentiated for 5 d, and subsequently treated in triplicate for 60 h with a control medium containing all EAA at normal plasma concentrations for cows (CTL), or a medium with 20 μM Lys (LY), 5 μM Met (LM), or 10 μM His (LH), which are each 25% of normal concentration. RNA was isolated from the cells and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 producing 150 base pair paired-end reads with a minimum sequencing depth of 150 million reads. Reads were cleaned with ‘fastp’ (Chen et al., 2018), aligned to the bovine reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) using ‘STAR’ aligner (Dobin et al., 2013), and genes counted using ‘featureCounts’ (Liao et al., 2014). Differential expression of genes between treatment pairs was determined using the ‘DESeq2’ package (Love et al., 2014) in R. Genes with an absolute log2 fold change ≥ 1 and a false discovery rate of &lt; 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. The number of differentially expressed genes relative to CTL was 780 for LY, 383 for LH, and 536 for LM. QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified four pathways consistently affected across LY, LM, and LH: kinetochore metaphase signaling, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase, cell cycle: G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation, and interferon signaling (Figure 1-3). Notably, the kinetochore metaphase signaling pathway was identified as the most significant across all treatments, suggesting a strong link to cell proliferation and apoptosis during EAA deficiency. The interferon signaling might be related to the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Jak2/STAT5) pathway which can promote the expression of genes encoding milk proteins such as β-casein and β-lactoglobulin. Furthermore, the IPA identified upstream transcription factors related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, protein translation, endoplasmic reticulum biogenesis, and amino acid metabolism including NUPR1, FOXM1, MYC, CCND1, TP53, DDIT3, and ATF4 across all treatments. The findings suggest that AA deprivation regulates bovine mammary epithelial cell function by instigating amino acid response pathways and altering secretory cell number.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"07d0ee6530f1cad161835cc258d84dacbfc21706e758088cce32702a3b88f35d","category":"Environment"}
