{"title":"Vitamin B12: prevention of human beings from lethal diseases and its food application","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13661?af=R","date":1719220849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Vitamin B12, a water-soluble essential micronutrient, plays a pivotal role in numerous physiological processes in the human body. This review meticulously examines the structural complexity and the diverse mechanisms through which vitamin B12 exerts its preventive effects against a spectrum of health conditions, including pernicious anaemia, neurological disorders, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and complications in foetal development. The selection of articles for this review was conducted through a systematic search across multiple scientific databases, including PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Criteria for inclusion encompassed relevance to the biochemical impact of vitamin B12 on health, peer-reviewed status and publication within the last decade. Exclusion criteria were non-English articles and studies lacking empirical evidence. This stringent selection process ensured a comprehensive analysis of vitamin B12's multifaceted impact on health, covering its structure, bioavailable forms and mechanisms of action. Clinical studies highlighting its therapeutic potential, applications in food fortification and other utilizations are also discussed, underscoring the nutrient's versatility. This synthesis aims to provide a clear understanding of the integral role of vitamin B12 in maintaining human health and its potential in clinical and nutritional applications. Â© 2024 The Author(s).
