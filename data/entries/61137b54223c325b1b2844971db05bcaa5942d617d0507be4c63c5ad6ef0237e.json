{"title":"Yoga and Mindfulness: Enhancing Executive Skills in Transitional Economies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2227/v1","date":1725015722000,"content":"This study explores the potential of yoga in developing crucial executive competencies within the context of transitional economies in Eastern Europe. As public sector enterprises face increasing competition, both domestically and internationally, there is a growing need for executives to acquire new skills. Through the lens of mindfulness, this research investigates the impact of yoga on the helping behavior and cultural intelligence of business leaders in a transitional economy. The findings reveal that yoga practices significantly enhanced participants' helping behavior and cultural intelligence. The study demonstrates that approximately two-thirds of the impact on helping behavior can be attributed to increased mindfulness, with the remaining one-third stemming directly from yoga practice. In terms of cultural intelligence, the results indicate that 88% of the improvement is due to heightened mindfulness, while 12% is directly attributable to yoga practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61137b54223c325b1b2844971db05bcaa5942d617d0507be4c63c5ad6ef0237e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
