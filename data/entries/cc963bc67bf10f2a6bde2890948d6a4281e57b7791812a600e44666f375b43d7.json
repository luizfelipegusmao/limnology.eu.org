{"title":"Development and Validation of Instruments to Assess Competencies and Knowledge in Sustainability in Nutrition Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0594/v1","date":1725877927000,"content":"Objective: The article presents a methodology for the design and validation of two assessment instruments: one focused on competency development and the other on knowledge acquisition on sustainability, aimed at nutrition students from a Mexican university. Method: These instruments were adapted using the triangulation methodology and administered to a group of 45 students after receiving an intervention based on the systemic approach to nutrition. Following the intervention, an analysis of the results was carried out to validate the reliability and validity of the instruments, and to evaluate the impact of the intervention compared to a control group. Results: The findings indicated that the dimensions used in the instrument are suitable for evaluating competency development, additionally, it was found that both instruments are reliable tools for assessing competency development and knowledge in sustainability among nutrition students, concluding that they have the potential to be used for evaluating education in sustainability. Furthermore, the results reveal that the application of an intervention based on the systemic approach to nutrition has a positive impact on the development and acquisition of sustainable nutrition education. The students who received the intervention achieved significantly higher scores in all sustainability sub-competencies (W=100, p=0.019), as well as in the total percentage of sustainable knowledge (w=53, n=0.01). Conclusions: The results of this study pave the way for the operationalization of competency and knowledge dimensions in food sustainability, which can contribute to the evaluation of sustainability education and its impact on the training of nutrition students committed to sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc963bc67bf10f2a6bde2890948d6a4281e57b7791812a600e44666f375b43d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
