{"title":"Global Health Alert: Racing to Control Antimicrobial Resistant Candida auris and Waste Using UVC LED Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2129/v1","date":1721968219000,"content":"The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) Candida auris presents a formidable global health challenge, causing severe healthcare-associated infections with high mortality rates. Its ability to colonize surfaces and resist standard disinfectants undermines traditional hygiene practices, prompting an urgent need for novel strategies. Ultraviolet C (UVC) light offers a promising approach due to its rapid and broad-spectrum germicidal efficacy. This review comprehensively examines the current knowledge of UVC LED technology in combating C. auris, highlighting its effectiveness, limitations, and potential applications in healthcare hygiene. UVC light has potent activity against C. auris, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. UVC can reduce C. auris on contaminated surfaces, aiding in transmission prevention. This review explores implementation strategies, including mobile UVC systems for targeted disinfection of high-risk areas and equipment, integration into air handling units (AHUs) to continuously disinfect recirculating air, and incorporation into water treatment systems. Current limitations in our understanding of UVC safety and effectiveness necessitate further research to optimize application protocols and ensure treatment safety while maintaining efficacy against C. auris. Integrating UVC disinfection technology into infection control programs holds promise for strengthening hygiene practices that will curb the global spread of C. auris and improve patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd1b361e826a5a8dc68bbc606fe4b125fba0f1078cae334857eb09801876dccc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
