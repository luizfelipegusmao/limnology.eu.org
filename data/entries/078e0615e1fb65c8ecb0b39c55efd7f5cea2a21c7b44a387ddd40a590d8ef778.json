{"title":"Adjustment of the Nonlinear Schumacher and Hall Model in Mixed Form for Volume Estimation in Dense Ombrophilous Forest, Amazon, Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0514/v1","date":1717764820000,"content":"Volumetric models are a crucial tool for forest management. The study aimed to adjust the mixed model by Schumacher and Hall for estimating commercial volume in a dense ombrophilous forest situated in Ferreira Gomes, Amap√°, Brazil. Cubage data from 100 sample trees of 5 species were used to adjust the Schumacher and Hall model in fixed and mixed non-linear forms with the diameter class as a random effect. In addition, the same model was also adjusted for each class to verify whether good equations will be generated by stratifying by diameter class. After analysis, it was found that most of the equations by diameter class do not present all significant parameters. On the other hand, the mixed models using class as a random effect showed good results. Finally, it can be seen that mixed models are a much better alternative than stratification by diameter class for volume estimation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"078e0615e1fb65c8ecb0b39c55efd7f5cea2a21c7b44a387ddd40a590d8ef778","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
