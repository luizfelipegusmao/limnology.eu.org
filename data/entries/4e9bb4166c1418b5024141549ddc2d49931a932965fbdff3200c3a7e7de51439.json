{"title":"The Influence of Fluorine on the Forms of Lanthanide Migration in Natural and Polluted Waters of the Lovozero Massif (the Kola Peninsula)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2198/v1","date":1727430084000,"content":"A comprehensive study (monitoring, thermodynamic modeling) of natural and anthropogenically polluted waters of the Lovozero Massif has been carried out. A thermodynamic study of the weathering of the Lovozero Massif within the “water-rock-atmosphere” system at a temperature of 5°C showed that the elements contained in the rocks of the studied massif influence the formation of the chemical composition of natural waters. It has been established that an increase in the degree of “water-rock” interaction leads to an increase in the concentrations of F, Cl, SО42-, HCO3- in the solution. This affects the mobility of lanthanum, cerium and other elements due to the formation of complex compounds with them. The relatively high content of fluorine, phosphorus, HCO3- (weak and medium acids) in the solution promotes the dissolution of silicates while Si, Al, P are released into the solution. Monitoring of water from a flooded mine in which there is an increase in the degree of interaction of water with rock showed higher pH values for the concentrations of Na, HCO3-, F-, P, Al, Si, V, U, La, Ce. The conclusions are relevant in the context of groundwater extraction for drinking water supply purposes. The obtained information is useful to evaluated the health of the population of the region under study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e9bb4166c1418b5024141549ddc2d49931a932965fbdff3200c3a7e7de51439","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
