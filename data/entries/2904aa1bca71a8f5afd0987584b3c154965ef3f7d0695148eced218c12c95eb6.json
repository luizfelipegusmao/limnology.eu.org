{"title":"Innovative Alignment-Based Method for Antiviral Peptide Prediction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1476/v1","date":1721287694000,"content":"Antiviral peptides (AVPs) represent a promising strategy for addressing the global challenge of viral infections and their growing resistance to traditional drugs. Lab-based AVP discovery methods are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for efficient computational alternatives. In this study, we developed five non-trained but supervised Multi-Query Similarity Search Models (MQSSMs) integrated into the StarPep toolbox. Rigorous testing and validation across diverse AVP datasets confirmed the models' robustness and reliability. The top-performing model, M13+, demonstrated impressive results with an accuracy of 0.969 and a Matthewâ€™s correlation coeffi-cient of 0.71. To assess their competitiveness, the top five models were benchmarked against 14 publicly available machine learning and deep learning AVP predictors. The MQSSMs outper-formed these predictors, highlighting their efficiency in terms of resource demand and public ac-cessibility. Another significant achievement of this study is the creation of the most comprehensive dataset of antiviral sequences to date.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2904aa1bca71a8f5afd0987584b3c154965ef3f7d0695148eced218c12c95eb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
