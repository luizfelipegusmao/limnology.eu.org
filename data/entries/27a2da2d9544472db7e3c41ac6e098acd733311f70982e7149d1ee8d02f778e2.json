{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Environmental Conditions and Bioreactors on Microalgae Growth and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1271/v1","date":1726559795000,"content":"Microalgae and their bioproducts hold significant potential across various applications, for instance, in wastewater remediation, CO2 fixation, and the synthesis of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels. The production of these organisms heavily relies upon environmental conditions, including factors like temperature, light, and nutrient supply, which can significantly impact growth. Furthermore, the limitations in nutrients or certain extreme environments can result in productivity increases. As such, microalgae growth systems have become a critical consideration for both research and industry. Both open and closed systems, such as raceway ponds and photobioreactors, respectively, have their own advantages and drawbacks in microalgae cultivation. However, for microalgae growth, photobioreactors may address most concerns, as the system has a lower risk of contamination and can deliver specific growth factors in a controlled manner. This review will summarize the growth and incubation factors of microalgae and the uses of bioreactors in both research and industrial capacities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27a2da2d9544472db7e3c41ac6e098acd733311f70982e7149d1ee8d02f778e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
