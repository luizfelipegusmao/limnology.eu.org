{"title":"Can internet use promote farmers to adopt chemical fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technology in China?—an empirical analysis based on endogenous switching probit model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308300","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Zhifei Ma, Huan Huang, Xiangmin Zhang, Dongxue Qin, Xiaodi Li</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examines the impact of internet usage on farmer’s adoption behavior of fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technologies in China. Based on 1,295 questionnaires in Henan Province, this study constructs a counterfactual analysis framework and used endogenous switching probit model to analyze the effects and pathways of internet usage on farmer’s adoption behavior of chemical fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technologies. The results indicate that. (1) The proportion of farmers adopting chemical fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technologies is 60.15%, while the proportion of farmers not adopting these technologies is 39.85%. (2) Internet usage directly influences farmers’ adoption of fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technologies. According to counterfactual assumption analysis, if farmers who currently use the Internet were to stop using it, the probability of them adopting these technologies would decrease by 28.09%. Conversely, for farmers who do not currently use the Internet, if they were to start using it, the probability of them adopting fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technologies would increase by 40.67%. (3) Internet usage indirectly influences farmers’ adoption behavior through mediating pathways of expected benefits and risk perception. In addition, social networks negatively moderate the impact of internet usage on farmers’ behavior of chemical fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement technologies.","author":"Zhifei Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4b91cc1361e7609e119d472fa0680a78e184a545d99f4b12c22cb73a454f9f8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
