It is crucial to identify common surgical conditions in children in Pakistan to inform healthcare professionals and policymakers for effective resource allocation. This representative cross-sectional household survey conducted on children aged 5–10 years assessed existing surgical diseases and healthcare-seeking behaviors in the two largest provinces (Sindh and Punjab) of Pakistan. The data was collected through a validated cross-sectional survey tool [Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS)]. Caregivers were asked about their child’s recent and past surgical conditions in six distinct anatomical regions and pictures were taken of identified conditions after appropriate consent for further diagnosis. Health-seeking behaviors including the kind of treatment sought, the nature of care received, and the reasons for not receiving care were noted. 13.5% of children surveyed reported a surgical condition, with a similar distribution across urban (13.2%) and rural (13.7) areas and the most common cause was trauma. The greatest number of surgical conditions were found to be on the head and neck region (57.7%), while the back accounted for the least number of conditions (1.7%). Our results outline a need for organizing all entities (governmental, non-governmental, and private) involved in child health to ensure efficient resource allocation to cater to existing surgical problems.","author":"Saqib Hamid Qazi","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"b755039df71dc26ae260526d705f3046ff2a48bee03c5b4f2799f09c3a2af522","category":"Environment"}
