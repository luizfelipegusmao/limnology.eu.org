{"title":"Sports Analytics with Graph Neural Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0046/v1","date":1727774139000,"content":"Graph neural networks and graph convolutional networks are effective at representing complex relationships. We attempt to apply them to sports analytics by reviewing existing applications in sports. These methodologies leverage the inherent graph structure of sports data, capturing interactions among players, teams, and game events. By systematically examining various studies, we highlight how GNNs and GCNs can enhance performance prediction, player evaluation, and tactical analysis in sports. Our review emphasizes the unique advantages these models offer over traditional analytical approaches, particularly in their ability to account for the dynamic and interconnected nature of sports activities. We conclude by identifying potential areas for future research and application, suggesting that the integration of advanced graph-based techniques could significantly advance the field of sports analytics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8fadf4a22777d7fe318b00c3b002ac68163bc24d8c646d201d46adbac8b4a29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
