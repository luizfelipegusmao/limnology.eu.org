{"title":"Educated Socially Responsible Mining Professional CSR Standards and Engagement with Indigenous People","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1220/v1","date":1724122269000,"content":"This review stresses the need for geoscience and mining engineering students to be educated during their undergraduate studies in social and sustainability issues so they would have the skills and knowledge in their work after graduation, as professionals, to engage Indigenous People for mutual benefit. Large - scale mining development often takes place on Indigenous land and these educated mining professionals in their contact with these vulnerable communities must act in a responsible way. This includes the important mining policy issues and standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR), social license to operate and free, prior and informed consent from the Indigenous People before mining.  For example, these policy standards issues would have been important to consider in Indonesia where the Indigenous Muluy Dayak community in East Kalimantan tried to resist large-scale mining operations by depicting their small-scale mining as part of their Indigenous customs and identity and in Australia where there was the recent destruction of an Aboriginal sacred site during large scale mining operations","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea5820630e96086536b50d60fb4b4419a87540d5d6a113c844e8bcc873d2e7df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
