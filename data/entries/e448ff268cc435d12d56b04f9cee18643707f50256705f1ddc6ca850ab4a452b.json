Although overall mortality has decreased for HF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a precursor for HF, their prevalence continues to increase annually. Because the etiology of HF and HCM is heterogeneous, it has been difficult to identify novel therapies to combat these diseases. Isoproterenol (ISP), a non-selective Î²-adrenoreceptor agonist, is commonly used to induce cardiotoxicity and cause acute and chronic HCM and HF in mice. However, the variability in dose and duration of ISP treatment used in studies has made it difficult to determine the optimal combination of ISP dose and delivery method to develop a reliable ISP-induced mouse model for disease. Here we examined cardiac effects induced by ISP via subcutaneous (SQ) and SQ-minipump (SMP) infusions across 3 doses (2, 4, and 10mg/kg/day) over 2 weeks to determine whether SQ and SMP ISP delivery induced comparable disease severity in C57BL/6J mice. To assess disease, we measured body and heart weight, surface electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiography recordings. We found all 3 ISP doses comparably increase heart weight, but these increases are more pronounced when ISP was administered via SMP. We also found that the combination of ISP treatment and delivery method induces contrasting heart rate, RR interval, and R and S amplitudes that may place SMP treated mice at higher risk for sustained disease burden. Mice treated via SMP also had increased heart wall thickness and LV Mass, but mice treated via SQ showed greater increase in gene markers for hypertrophy and fibrosis. Overall, these data suggest that at 2 weeks, mice treated with 2, 4, or 10mg/kg/day ISP via SQ and SMP routes cause similar pathological heart phenotypes but highlight the importance of drug delivery method to induce differing disease pathways.","author":"Patricia Perez-Bonilla","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e448ff268cc435d12d56b04f9cee18643707f50256705f1ddc6ca850ab4a452b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
