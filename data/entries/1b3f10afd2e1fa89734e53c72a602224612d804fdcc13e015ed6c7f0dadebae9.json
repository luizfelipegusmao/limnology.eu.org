We conducted the Youth Friendly Services study among adolescents in Rustenburg, South Africa to address some of these concerns. Participants aged 12–19 were followed quarterly for 12 months, asked at baseline about demographics, their sexual behavior, and tested for HIV, STIs, and pregnancy (girls). Report of sexual activity was not a requirement for enrollment. Assent and parental consent were obtained for participants under 18. Some follow up visits fell during COVID-mandated shutdowns, and we worked with participants to reschedule and extend follow up as appropriate. Here we present data on reported behaviors, participant attrition, risk of HIV, other STI, and pregnancy. From May 2018 to August 2019, we enrolled 223 HIV-negative, non-pregnant adolescents (64% girls). The median age was 17 (IQR: 14–18). Among the 119 (53%) participants who reported being sexually active at baseline, the median age at first sex was 16 years (IQR: 15–17). During follow-up, an additional 16 (7%) participants reported having their first sexual encounter. Among the sexually active participants, the incidence of HIV was 1.5 cases / 100 person-years at risk (PYAR, 95% CI: 0.4–6.0), the incidence of chlamydia was 15.7 cases (95% CI: 10.1–24.4), gonorrhea was 4.7 cases (95% CI: 2.1–10.5), and HSV was 6.3 cases (95% CI: 3.1–12.6); we observed no cases of incident syphilis. The incidence of pregnancy among sexually active girls was 15.0 pregnancies / 100 PYAR (95% CI: 8.5–26.5). Despite small numbers, the incidence of most STIs was significantly higher in females compared to males. We also observed two pregnancies and 5 incident STIs among participants who reported never having had sex, these tended to be younger participants. From March to September 2020, the clinic was shut down for COVID-19, and 53 study visits were postponed. Follow up was concluded in November 2020, a total of 19 participants were lost to follow up, however only one participant dropped off-study during COVID-19 shutdowns. Retention at the final visit was 91.5%. We successfully completed a prospective study of adolescents to learn more about the risks they face as they navigate sexual debut in the context of a program of youth-friendly counseling and services. Among self-reported sexually active participants, we observed a high rate of HIV, STI and pregnancy, however we also observed pregnancy and STIs among those who reported no sexual activity.","author":"Matt A.
