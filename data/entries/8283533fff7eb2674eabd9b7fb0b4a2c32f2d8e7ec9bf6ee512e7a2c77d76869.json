{"title":"Effect of Green Cowpea Manure on the Quality Properties of Sandy Soils Under the Specific Conditions of the Dry Climate in Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1461/v1","date":1726712917000,"content":"As a result of the low organic matter content of the sandy soils in Romania, for the success of most crops, large amounts of chemical fertilizers are needed, which can often lead to the pollution of groundwater with nitrates, given the poor hydrophysical properties in terms of retaining chemical elements by these soils. In this sense, the study carried out in the period 2020-2023 within the rotation cowpea-rye+cowpea successive crop-sorghum for grains, aimed to promote the system of sustainable agriculture, by incorporating into the soil, in the form of green manure, the cowpea sown in succession after the rye. The soil quality analyses, carried out the following year after harvesting sorghum for grains, showed that by incorporating 52.4 t/ha of cowpea biomass into the soil between October 15-20, the quality characteristics of the sandy soil improved significantly. Thus, compared to the initial state of soil fertility, there were annual increases of 0.017-0.029%, in total nitrogen, by 9.5-13.3 ppm, in extractable phosphorus, by 11.333-24 ppm, in exchangeable potassium and by 0.008-0.012%, to organic carbon, also depending on the sorghum fertilization system. Also, the incorporation of green cowpea manure into the soil contributed to reducing the acidity of the soil pH and improving the water holding capacity of the soil profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8283533fff7eb2674eabd9b7fb0b4a2c32f2d8e7ec9bf6ee512e7a2c77d76869","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
