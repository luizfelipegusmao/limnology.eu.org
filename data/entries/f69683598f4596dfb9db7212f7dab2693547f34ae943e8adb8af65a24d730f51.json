{"title":"Elemental Dissolution in Multicomponent PDC Based Mixed-Phase Hard Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0557/v1","date":1712572157000,"content":"Due to the high temperature limitation associated with silicon, SiC, Si3N4, TiC, TiN, TiB2, cBN, CNx, SiO2, Al2O3 and novel multicomponent nanocomposites polymer derived ceramics (PDC) based thin films like Si-C-N, Ti-Si-B-C-N and Si-O-CN that are compatible with silicon and have a wider range of operation in ambient conditions are being investigated. Apart from small scale electro-mechanical devices like N/MEMS, sensors, areas like metallurgical protection, water purification, energy storage, bio medical implants and aerospace have been benefited. The cross-sectional study involving the role of oxygen and nitrogen dissolution at different interfacial configurations has been presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f69683598f4596dfb9db7212f7dab2693547f34ae943e8adb8af65a24d730f51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
