The Illumina HD ovine SNP600K BeadChip genomic arrays were utilized to analyze 114 animals from eight Iranian sheep breeds, namely Ghezel, Afshari, Shall, Sanjabi, Lori-Bakhtiari, Karakul, Kermani, and Balochi. All animals were classified into two groups: cold-weather breeds and hot-weather breeds, based on the environments to which they are adapted and the regions where they have been raised for many years. The unbiased FST (Theta) and hapFLK tests were used to identify the selection signatures. The results revealed five genomic regions on chromosomes 2, 10, 11, 13, and 14 using the FST test, and three genomic regions on chromosomes 10, 14, and 15 using the hapFLK test to be under selection in cold and hot groups. Further exploration of these genomic regions revealed that most of these regions overlapped with genes previously identified to affect cold and heat stress, nervous system function, cell division and gene expression, skin growth and development, embryo and skeletal development, adaptation to hypoxia conditions, and the immune system. These regions overlapped with QTLs that had previously been identified as being associated with various important economic traits, such as body weight, skin color, and horn characteristics. The gene ontology and gene network analyses revealed significant pathways and networks that distinguished Iranian cold and hot climates sheep breeds from each other. We identified positively selected genomic regions in Iranian sheep associated with pathways related to cell division, biological processes, cellular responses to calcium ions, metal ions and inorganic substances. This study represents the initial effort to identify selective sweeps linked to temperature adaptation in Iranian indigenous sheep breeds. It may provide valuable insights into the genomic regions involved in climate adaptation in sheep.","author":"Zahra Patiabadi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6029d93b68e5a2bce8d1387e9337ff71bd8a5d00fbbf3d4a3f3af5f02e68843c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
