{"title":"Modeling and Forecasting Historical Volatility Using Econometric and Deep Learning Approaches: Evidence From the Moroccan and Bahraini Stock Markets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1248/v1","date":1716214107000,"content":"This study challenges the prevailing belief in the necessity of complex models for accurate forecasting by demonstrating the effectiveness of parsimonious econometric models, namely ARCH(1) and GARCH(1,1), over deep learning robust approaches, such as LSTM and 1D-CNN neural networks, in modeling historical volatility within pre-emerging stock markets, specifically the Moroccan and Bahraini stock markets. The findings suggest reevaluating the balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy. Future research directions include investigating the potential existence of threshold effects in market capitalization for optimal model performance. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of volatility dynamics and enhances forecasting modelsâ€™ effectiveness in diverse market conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1f44f58ddff13e8b5cc37a5308357d5aecf5a2c3291d7c7922a8c2beceffd33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
