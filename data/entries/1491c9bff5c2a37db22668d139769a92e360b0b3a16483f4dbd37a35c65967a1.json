{"title":"Cassava retting ability and textural attributes of fufu for demand‐driven cassava breeding","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13400?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Cassava retting ability and the textural qualities of cooked fufu are important quality traits. Cassava retting is a complex process in which soaking causes tissue breakdown, starch release, and softening. The rate at which various traits linked to it evolve varies greatly during fufu processing. According to the literature, there is no standard approach for determining retting ability. The retting indices and textural properties of fufu were measured using both manual and instrumental approaches.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Different protocols were developed to classify 64 and 11 cassava genotypes into various groups based on retting ability and textural qualities, respectively. The retting protocols revealed considerable genetic dissimilarities in genotype classification: foaming ability and water clarity should be measured at 24 h, while penetrometer, hardness, turbidity, pH, and total titratable acidity data are best collected after 36 h. The stepwise regression model revealed that pH, foaming ability, and dry matter content are the best multivariates (with the highest <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup>) for predicting cassava retting. These predictors were used to develop an index for assessing the retting ability of cassava genotypes. The retting index developed showed a significant relationship with dry matter content and fufu yield. The study also showed significant correlations between instrumental cohesiveness and sensory smoothness (<i>r</i> = −0.75), moldability (<i>r</i> = −0.62), and stretchability (<i>r</i> = 0.78). Instrumental cohesiveness can correctly estimate <i>fufu</i> smoothness (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.56, <i>P</i> = 0.008) and stretchability (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.60, <i>P</i> = 0.005).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>pH, foaming ability, and dry matter content are the best traits for predicting cassava retting ability, while instrumental cohesiveness can effectively estimate <i>fufu</i> smoothness and stretchability. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ugo Chijioke, \nSimon Peter Abah, \nOluchi Achonwa, \nBenjamin Okoye, \nOluwatoyin Ayetigbo, \nMercy Ejechi, \nUgochi Jane Iro, \nDamian Njoku, \nNwamaka Ogunka, \nSonia Osodeke, \nChukwudi Ogbete, \nSiraj Ismail Kayondo, \nTessy Madu, \nHernán Ceballos, \nDominique Dufour, \nChiedozie Egesi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1491c9bff5c2a37db22668d139769a92e360b0b3a16483f4dbd37a35c65967a1","category":"Environment"}
