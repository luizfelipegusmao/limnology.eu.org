{"title":"Application of Audio-Magnetotelluric and Dual-Frequency Induced Polarization Joint Inversion in a Pb-Zn Deposit Exploration in Inner Mongolia, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0098/v1","date":1717415643000,"content":"Models of subsurface structures are important for successful deposit exploration but are challenged by the need to integrate data from different geophysical methods. In the present study, we evaluated a method of joint inversion in which audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) and dual frequency induced polarization (DFIP) data sets are inverted simultaneously to produce a consistent 2D resistivity model to show a clear image of subsurface structures. To achieve the objectives, we conducted AMT and DFIP surveys first on the same survey line within the Dongjun lead-zinc deposit in inner Mongolia by developing 31 AMT survey sites with an interstation separation of 40 m on a 1440 m survey track and operated in fifty-three frequencies in the range 1â€“10,400 Hz to record the resistivity distribution of subsurface to depths exceeding 800 m. The same survey setup up was applied to the DFIP method by utilizing the SQ-3C model with a pole-dipole array configuration and conducted measurements at frequencies of 4 Hz and 4/13 Hz. We first separately inverted AMT and DFIP measurements. The two-dimensional (2D) model obtained from AMT data revealed distinct low resistivity anomalies in the middle of the 2D inversion model. In contrast, the DFIP inversion model showed a high resistive body in the same region. In response to the discrepancies observed in the separate 2D inversion models, we implemented a joint inversion for both the AMT and DFIP datasets. The joint inversion resistivity model shows surficial conducting bodies and a high conductive body along the profile with relatively high Percent Frequency Effect (PEF) indicating high chargeability. The final joint inversion resistivity model clearly images the large silica alteration zone and the Pb-Zn mineralization. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a joint inversion methodology and highlights the value of integrating geophysical methods through joint inversion for enhanced characterization and exploration of lead-zinc ores.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b83890daeaef192c6105772b680d3f71248887727be9acc37d29856ab3767f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
