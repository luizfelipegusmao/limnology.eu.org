{"title":"Cookability of 24 pea accessions—determining factors and potential predictors of cooking quality","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13253?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Cooking time and cooking evenness are two critical quantities when determining the cooking quality (termed cookability) of pulses. Deciphering which factors contribute to pulse cookability is important for breeding new cultivars, and the identification of potential cookability predictors can facilitate breeding efforts. Seeds from 24 morphologically diverse pea accessions were tested to identify contributing factors and potential predictors of the observed cookability using a Mattson cooker. Size‑ and weight-based measures were recorded, and seed-coat hardness was obtained with a penetrometer. Content of protein, starch (amylose and amylopectin), and phytate was also determined.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Distinct differences were found between wrinkled and non-wrinkled seeds in terms of water-absorption capacity, seed-coat hardness, and plunger-perforation speed. Potential predictive indicators of cooking time and cooking evenness were seed-coat hardness (<i>r</i> = 0.49 and <i>r</i> = 0.38), relative area gained (<i>r</i> = −0.59 and <i>r</i> = −0.8), and percentage of swelled seeds after soaking (<i>r</i> = −0.49 and <i>r</i> = −0.58), but only for non-wrinkled seeds. Surprisingly, the coefficients of variation for the profile area of both dry and swelled seeds appeared to be potential cookability predictors of all pea types (correlation coefficients around <i>r</i> = 0.5 and supported by principal component analysis). However, no strong correlation was observed between cookability and protein, starch, or phytate levels.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Using three types of instruments together with chemical components enabled the identification of novel cookability predictors for both cooking time and cooking evenness in pea. This study unveils the diverse quantitative aspects influencing cookability in pea. Considering both cooking time and cooking evenness, as well as seed-coat hardness, underscores the multifaceted nature of pulse cookability and offers important insights for future breeding strategies to enhance pea cultivars. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Bjørn Dueholm, \nJohanna Fonskov, \nÅsa Grimberg, \nSandra Carlsson, \nMohammed Hefni, \nTina Henriksson, \nCecilia Hammenhag","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1d073840d4cbd81a5a7fc82cdcd89e08e4586e2cf4cbd5f322a2d784f1f6de07","category":"Environment"}
