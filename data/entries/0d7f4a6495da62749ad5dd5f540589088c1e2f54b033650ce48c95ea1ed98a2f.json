{"title":"Reduced approach disposition in familial risk for depression: Evidence from time-frequency alpha asymmetries","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307524","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Carola Dell’Acqua, Tania Moretta, Simone Messerotti Benvenuti</p>\r\n\r\nDespite the promising role of alpha and delta power in reflecting reduced approach disposition in depression, to date, it is unclear whether these measures can be employed to identify at-risk individuals. Hence, the present study investigated affective disposition in 32 unaffected individuals with a family history of depression (23 F) and 30 individuals without a family history of depression (21 F) through a data-driven analysis of alpha and delta time-frequency power during the viewing of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. Different patterns of posterior alpha asymmetry emerged within each group. Particularly, controls showed greater right posterior alpha desynchronization ~ 600 ms following emotional relative to neutral pictures presentation. Conversely, the group with a family history of depression showed greater posterior left alpha desynchronization only to unpleasant relative to neutral images in a later time window (&gt; 900 ms). Hence, depression vulnerability seems to be characterized by a blunted reactivity to pleasant and delayed reactivity to unpleasant stimuli with a distinct posterior distribution relative to the controls. Finally, the two groups showed a comparable pattern of greater delta power to emotional relative to neutral cues. Overall, initial support was provided for the employment of time-frequency alpha power changes during affective processing in identifying blunted approach disposition in unaffected at-risk individuals.","author":"Carola Dell’Acqua","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0d7f4a6495da62749ad5dd5f540589088c1e2f54b033650ce48c95ea1ed98a2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
