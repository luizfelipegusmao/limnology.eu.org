{"title":"Pathologic In Vivo Assay of the Helicobacter Molecular Infection in Stomach Tissue Using Carbon Nanotube Micro Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0300/v1","date":1728030979000,"content":"Biomolecular detections of Helicobacter pylori(HP) were compared using specially modified sensors and fluorine immobilized on a carbon nanotube (HFCNT) electrode, which yielded sensitive results. Handheld voltammetric circuits were used for optimization. An anodic voltammogram of HP molecular oxidation was obtained at 0.0 V (versus the Ag/AgCl/KCl) in a 0.1M NH4H2PO4 electrolyte solution. Under optimized conditions, the analytical working range was 2.98x103-22.127x103 CFU/ml HP using square wave (SW) stripping voltammetry, precision of R2 =0.9857 (SWSV), the detection limit approached to 2.5x102 CFU/ml HP (S/N=3).The developed techniques have been applied to diagnosis of early-stage HP infections using stomach tissue from healthy humans and gastric patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ecbd181c29a1aa6ce9f6cbef5f32ae4a1b3bf2033ee535eb0caa2977346c4ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
