{"title":"An Online Identification Method for Mechanical Parameters of Dual-Inertia Servo System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1058/v1","date":1718606674000,"content":"In a dual-inertia system based on permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), the elastic transmission mechanism, such as reducer and coupling, is prone to mechanical resonance, which reduces the precision of servo system transmission. Model prediction and introduction of state feedback are effective methods to suppress mechanical resonance, but the control parameters de-pend on the mechanical parameters of the system. Therefore, mechanical parameter identification is very necessary. In this paper, a forgetting factor recursive least square method is used to identify the mechanical parameters of the dual-inertia elastic system. Firstly, the mathematical model of the dual-inertia system is established and reasonably simplified. Then, the discrete function of the identification algorithm is constructed, and the motor speed and electromagnetic torque are sam-pled to achieve the on-line identification of the main mechanical parameters of the dual-inertia system, and the influencing factors of the identification accuracy are analyzed. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"195d8a9944a78688ae76dd8e17ef0609511adcc93a0280a6235aa0e58178e950","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
