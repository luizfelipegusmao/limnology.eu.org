{"title":"Recognition of Derived Semantic Relationships in Geographic Entity Generic Names","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1871/v1","date":1719397158000,"content":"Determining the general-name-derived semantic relationships between geographic names often requires consulting many geographic name documents for verification. In geographic name translation and geographic name knowledge graphs, this method cannot meet the needs of large-scale extraction of general-name-derived semantic relationships between geographic entities. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a general-name derivation relation recognition method based on Prompt learning and Semantic Spatiotemporal Distribution Attention Feature Fusion (SSD-AFF). This method adopts a pipe-based relationship recognition strategy. First, the Prompt learning method is adopted to form a general-name derivation pattern with the general-name-derived geographical name category and the original geographical name category as the prompt word, and then the derivation pattern is combined with the geographical name as the input of the model so that the recognition problem of the general-name derivation of the geographical name can be transformed into a classification problem using the bidirectional language model. Then, by analyzing the characteristics of the semantic association and geographical spatio-temporal distribution between the general-name-derived geographical name and the original geographical name, the semantic spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of the general-name-derived geographical name are constructed. Finally, the network model based on the semantic spatio-temporal distribution Attention Feature Fusion (SSD-AFF) is used to distinguish the general-name-derived semantic relationships. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance. It can effectively mine the general-name-derived semantic relations between the vector data of geographical entities and has important application value in geographical name translation and geographical name knowledge maps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e3f7525bbc955a7c86ae3debe099e9c1ffe1b17be707e7dce6c26174d55b64f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
