{"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Librarians&rsquo; Views on AI Support for Learning Experiences, Lifelong Learning, and Digital Literacy in Malaysia and Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1380/v1","date":1716288615000,"content":"This research delves into librarians' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) support in learning experiences, lifelong learning, and digital literacy within the library context, undertaking a comparative analysis between Malaysia and Indonesia. Employing a survey methodology, a self-developed questionnaire was administered to 59 librarians in Malaysia and 85 in Indonesia. The questionnaire, utilizing a Likert scale, systematically explored subjective judgments on AI's impact across various dimensions. A noteworthy finding is the consistent and harmonized perception among librarians in both countries, underscoring a universal recognition of AI's perceived support for learning experiences, lifelong learning, and digital literacy. Of particular interest is the emphasis on sustainability in librarians' perspectives, as they recognize the enduring value of AI in fostering educational growth. Despite the limitations inherent in perceptual measures and a relatively modest sample size, the empirical and practical contributions of this study are significant. It offers a nuanced exploration of librarians' viewpoints, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors. Moreover, the study's findings have immediate practical implications for the integration of AI tools in library services, policy-making, and professional development, with a focus on ensuring sustainable implementation for long-term benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96a2a0659790db71dc007b8b45e140bd1c075b47b604e87461e34cf6eeee4829","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
