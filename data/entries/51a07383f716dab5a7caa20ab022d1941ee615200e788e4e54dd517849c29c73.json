{"title":"Research on Optimizing Low-Saturation Intersection Signals with Consideration for Both Efficiency and Fairness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1943/v1","date":1719481313000,"content":"In response to the fairness issue arising from the unequal delay of vehicles in different phases at intersections, considering the actual situation of small and variable delays for vehicles in low-saturation intersection phases, this paper proposes the concept of \"sacrificing efficiency for fairness.\" Firstly, the universality of unfair delay phenomena at intersection phases is explained, especially at low-saturation intersections where the fluctuation in phase delays is 1.87 times higher than at other intersections. Then, a fairness evaluation index is constructed using information entropy, and the feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated. Subsequently, a signal optimization model that balances efficiency and fairness is proposed. Finally, the proposed model is validated through case studies, showing that it not only simultaneously considers efficiency and fairness but also has minimal impact on efficiency. Moreover, the changes to timing schemes in the efficiency model are much smaller compared to the model that only considers fairness. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the model performs better under low-saturation intersection conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51a07383f716dab5a7caa20ab022d1941ee615200e788e4e54dd517849c29c73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
