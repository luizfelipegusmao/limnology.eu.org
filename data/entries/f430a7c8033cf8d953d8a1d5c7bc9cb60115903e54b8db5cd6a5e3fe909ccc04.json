{"title":"Quantum Cosmology Part I: The Integration of Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2028/v5","date":1723202177000,"content":"The inability to delineate a unified physical ontology that accounts simultaneously for the laws of special relativity and the results of quantum experiments has been a defining problem in physics for more than 100 years. This analysis addresses the problem by positing a novel mixed ontology composed of a “discrete” 4D spacetime and a physical, ultra-high dimensional (3 x N) “Planck Space.” Together, Planck Space and the three spatial dimensions of 4D spacetime form a tightly integrated ((3 x N) + 3) hyperspace (the “Dual Ontology”).Critically, the Dual Ontology’s structure replaces 1) the continuous, differentiable manifold of 4D spacetime with a discrete, background-independent 4D spacetime that is intrinsically curved and 2) mathematical spaces with a physical (3 x N) Planck Space. Moreover, the Dual Ontology is structurally and dynamically predicated on the one-to-one mapping and identity between the discrete spatial units that simultaneously form 4D spacetime and Planck Space. The one-to-one mapping and identity of the discrete spatial units support an integrated quantum dynamics based upon the dynamic evolution of single and N-body quantum states in 4D spacetime in full compliance with the laws of special relativity and the instantaneous collapse of all quantum states in an ontic Planck Space, where special and general relativity and more generally, 4D spacetime’s laws of physics, do not apply.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f430a7c8033cf8d953d8a1d5c7bc9cb60115903e54b8db5cd6a5e3fe909ccc04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
