{"title":"Blanket bogs exhibit significant alterations to physical properties as a result of temporary track removal or abandonment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2623?af=R","date":1710913800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Temporarily consented tracks made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mesh have been used to mitigate both the physical and ecological impacts on peatlands from low-frequency vehicle usage. However, the impacts of mesh track removal or abandonment at the end of the consented period remain poorly understood. Over a 2-year period, we studied replicate sections of abandoned mesh track which, at the start of the experiment, had been unused for approximately 5 years, on a UK blanket bog. Some sections were removed (using two treatment methods – vegetation mown and unprepared), whereas others were left in situ. Metrics were compared both between treatments and to undisturbed reference areas. Significant differences in surface soil moisture were found between abandoned and removed tracks depending on season. Control areas had higher volumetric soil moisture than track locations. Compaction was significantly higher across all track locations in comparison to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but rarefaction was not recorded post-removal, suggesting long-term deformation. Overland flow events were recorded in rut sections for a mean of 16% of the time, compared to &lt;1% in control areas. Sediment traps on the tracks collected 0.406 kg compared to 0.0048 kg from the control traps, equating to a per trap value of 7.3 g from track samplers and 0.17 g from control samplers. Erosion and desiccation features occurred on both removed and abandoned track sections. Both abandonment and removal of mesh tracks have a wide range of impacts on the physical properties of peatlands, suggesting that only where access is a necessity should such a track be installed.</p>","author":"Jessica Williams‐Mounsey, \nAlistair Crowle, \nRichard Grayson, \nRichard Lindsay, \nJoseph Holden","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"8b2d72d041ae74ebe48575ad898fba3b9cd1f7f25e474496a1160faa306311ef","category":"Environment"}
