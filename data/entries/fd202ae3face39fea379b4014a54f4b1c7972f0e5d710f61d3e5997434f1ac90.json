{"title":"Radical Cyclization-initiated Difunctionalization Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0865/v1","date":1713160912000,"content":"Radical reactions are powerful in the synthesis of diverse molecular scaffolds bearing functional groups. In pervious review articles, we have presented 1,2-difunctionalizations, remote 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5-, 1,6- and 1,7-difunctionalizations, and addition followed by cyclization reactions. Presents in this paper are radical cyclization followed by the second functionalization reactions. The second functionalization could be realized by atom transfer reactions, radical or transition metal-assisted coupling reactions, and reactions with neutral molecules, cationic and anionic species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd202ae3face39fea379b4014a54f4b1c7972f0e5d710f61d3e5997434f1ac90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
