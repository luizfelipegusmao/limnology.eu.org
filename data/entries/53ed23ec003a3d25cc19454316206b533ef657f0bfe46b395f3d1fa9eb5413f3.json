{"title":"Fault-Tolerant Optimal Consensus Control for Heterogeneous Multi-agent System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1332/v1","date":1721125685000,"content":"This study explores fault-tolerant consensus in leader-following heterogeneous multi-agent systems, focusing on actuator failures in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs). An optimization-based fault-tolerant consensus algorithm is proposed. The algorithm utilizes the Euler-Lagrange formula to ensure system consistency under actuator failures, with the Lyapunov stability theory proving the asymptotic stability of the consistency error. The algorithm is applied to heterogeneous multi-agent systems of UAVs and UGVs to derive optimal fault-tolerant consensus control laws for each vehicle type. Simulation experiments give evidence for the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53ed23ec003a3d25cc19454316206b533ef657f0bfe46b395f3d1fa9eb5413f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
