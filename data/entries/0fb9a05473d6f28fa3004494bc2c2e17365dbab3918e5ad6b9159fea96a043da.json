{"title":"Immunophilin FKB20-2 participates in oligomerization of Photosystem I in Chlamydomonas","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1631/7457507?rss=1","date":1701388800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>PSI is a sophisticated photosynthesis protein complex that fuels the light reaction of photosynthesis in algae and vascular plants. While the structure and function of PSI have been studied extensively, the dynamic regulation on PSI oligomerization and high light response is less understood. In this work, we characterized a high light-responsive immunophilin gene <span>FKB20-2</span> (FK506-binding protein 20-2) required for PSI oligomerization and high light tolerance in Chlamydomonas (<span>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span>). Biochemical assays and 77-K fluorescence measurement showed that loss of FKB20-2 led to the reduced accumulation of PSI core subunits and abnormal oligomerization of PSI complexes and, particularly, reduced PSI intermediate complexes in <span>fkb20-2</span>. It is noteworthy that the abnormal PSI oligomerization was observed in <span>fkb20-2</span> even under dark and dim light growth conditions. Coimmunoprecipitation, MS, and yeast 2-hybrid assay revealed that FKB20-2 directly interacted with the low molecular weight PSI subunit PsaG, which might be involved in the dynamic regulation of PSI-light-harvesting complex I supercomplexes. Moreover, abnormal PSI oligomerization caused accelerated photodamage to PSII in <span>fkb20-2</span> under high light stress. Together, we demonstrated that immunophilin FKB20-2 affects PSI oligomerization probably by interacting with PsaG and plays pivotal roles during Chlamydomonas tolerance to high light.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0fb9a05473d6f28fa3004494bc2c2e17365dbab3918e5ad6b9159fea96a043da","category":"Environment"}
