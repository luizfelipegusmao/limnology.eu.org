Medical students are a unique population that may be at a higher risk of obesity due to the demanding nature of their studies and the associated stress.\nObjective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and the associated risk factors among medical students at Jazan University in Saudi Arabia.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 228 medical students from their 2nd to 6th academic years at the Faculty of Medicine, Jazan University. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, dietary habits, comorbidities, medication use, family history, and lifestyle factors. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and waist circumference were recorded. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression were used to identify the risk factors associated with obesity.\nResults: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among the participants was 13.3% and 15% respectively. Hence, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity is 28.3%. The mean weight was 63.39 ± 18.93 kilograms, and the mean height was 163.48 ± 9.78 centimeters. On the other hand, 17.3% of participants had underweight whereas 54.4% had normal BMI. Most of the participants (61%) did not engage in regular exercise. A high proportion consumed fruits (82.9%) and vegetables (58.8%) 3 or fewer days per week, and 84.2% consumed 3 or fewer meals per day. Fast food consumption more than 3 days per week was reported by 42.1% of participants. Obesity was not significantly associated with sociodemographic factors, physical activity, dietary habits, comorbidities, medication use, or family histories. However, those with a monthly family income of 15,000-24,999 riyals had significantly lower odds of obesity than those in the lowest income group (OR 0.230, p = 0.045).\nConclusion: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among medical students at Jazan University is high. Although no significant associations were found between obesity and most risk factors, this study highlights the need for interventions that promote healthy lifestyles among medical students. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies for preventing and managing obesity in this population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"227408d82841d860c13cffa6560406063dde155dd5894db6261b8118fb19e93c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
