It is thus interesting to investigate hypothetical user profiles and the driving factors behind their choices. Setting up legal protection status for species is found to be the most influential factor in shaping public attitudes and is thus more likely to change behaviors. With the high demand for gecko products, the need for up-to-date NDFs is becoming increasingly urgent.\n</p><br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) utilizes animal products derived from hundreds of species. For some species, such as the pangolins (family Manidae), demand from the medicinal trade has been recognized as a major threat and is under strict regulations to conserve declining endangered populations. In parallel, species such as the tokay gecko (<i>Gekko gecko</i> and <i>Gekko reevesii</i>) have only recently attracted conservation attention due to the high volumes in trade despite an apparently still abundant wild population. In this study, we collected market data to assess the trade in pangolin (illegal trade) and tokay gecko (legal trade) medicinal products. We also collect general public's attitude toward the trade and their understanding on the medicinal use of high-profile endangered species (pangolins) and less well-known species (tokay gecko) in Hong Kong. We interviewed a total of 169 shops/clinics and 153 members of the public. We found that tokay gecko was sold in 59% of the surveyed outlets. We estimate that trade volume may reach as many as 0.2 million individuals per year in Hong Kong. The substantial demand for tokay gecko products estimated in this study underscores the urgent need for a thorough assessment of trade sustainability and continuous monitoring of the wild population status of gecko species. In contrast, pangolin scale products were rarely reported, and there was a high level of awareness among sellers regarding the illegality of such products. Our public survey revealed that awareness of the legal status of these products was the most influential factor shaping public choice to support the trade and consequently consume the products. Therefore, setting up legal protection status and enhancing public awareness about the legality of wildlife trade are essential steps toward responsible consumption and conservation. Furthermore, support for the use of alternatives among TCM practitioners presents a promising avenue. This highlights the opportunity to transiting trade toward sustainably sourced alternatives while respecting the traditions associated with TCM.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>传统中医药（TCM）使用的动物制品来自数百个物种。对于某些物种，如穿山甲（穿山甲科）的药用贸易需求已被视为主要威胁，并受到严格监管，以保护不断减少的濒危种群。与此同时，像大壁虎（Gekko gecko和Gekko reevesii）这样的物种最近才引起人们对其保护的关注。尽管野生种群数量仍旧很丰富，但涉及的贸易量巨大。在这项研究中，我们收集了市场数据，以评估穿山甲（非法贸易）和大壁虎（合法贸易）药用制品的贸易情况。此外，我们还收集了香港市民对该贸易的态度，以及他们对知名度较高的濒危物种（穿山甲）和知名度较低的物种（壁虎）药用价值的理解。我们共访问了 169 家商店/诊所和 153 名市民。我们发现，59%的受访商店有出售大壁虎。我们估计，香港每年的大壁虎交易量可达20万只。这项研究估计，人们对大壁虎制品的需求量相当大，突显出对大壁虎贸易的可持续性进行彻底评估，并持续监测大壁虎野外种群状况的迫切需要。相比之下，穿山甲片制品在此次研究中很少见，而且销售者对此类产品的非法性有很高的认识。我们的公众调查显示，对制品合法性的认识是影响公众选择支持贸易并进而消费该制品的最大因素。因此，设立法律保护和提高公众对野生动物贸易合法性的认识是实现负责任消费和保护的必要步骤。此外，鼓励中药从业者使用替代品也是一个可行的措施。将贸易转向可持续来源替代品的同时尊重中医药的相关传统。【审阅:王易孚】</p>","author":"Yifu Wang, \nPauline C.
