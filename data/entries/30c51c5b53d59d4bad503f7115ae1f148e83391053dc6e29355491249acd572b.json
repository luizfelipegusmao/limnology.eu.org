{"title":"In Vitro Utilization of Prebiotics by Listeria monocytogenes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2144/v1","date":1717148144000,"content":"Listeria monocytogenes is an emerging pathogen responsible for serious foodborne disease, listeriosis. Commensal gut microbiota is the first line of defense against pathogen internalization. Gut microbiome can be modified by prebiotic substrates, which are among others frequently added to food products and dietary supplement. Prebiotics should selectively support the growth of beneficial microbes and thus improve host health. Nevertheless, little is known about their effect on growth of L. monocytogenes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth ability of four L. monocytogenes strains, representing the most common serotypes, on prebiotic oligosaccharides: beta(1,3)-D-glucan, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, lactulose, raffinose, stachyose, 2Â´-fucosyllactose and mixture of human milk oligosaccharides as a sole carbon source. The results showed that only beta(1,3)-D-glucan was metabolized by L. monocytogenes. Therefore, the health-safety of beta(1,3)-D-glucan in respect to listeriosis development should be furthermore studied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30c51c5b53d59d4bad503f7115ae1f148e83391053dc6e29355491249acd572b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
