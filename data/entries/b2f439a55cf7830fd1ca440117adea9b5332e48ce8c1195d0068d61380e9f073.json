{"title":"Improvement of processable properties of plant‐based high internal phase emulsions by mung bean protein isolate based on pH shift treatment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13529?af=R","date":1713180033000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>High internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) are unique emulsion systems, which transform liquid oil into solid-like fats, thus avoiding the use of saturated fat and leading to a healthier and more sustainable food system for consumers. HIPEs with oil volume fraction (ϕ) of 75%–85% were fabricated with mung bean protein isolate (MPI) under different pH shift treatments at 1.0% concentration through the one-step method. We investigated the physical properties, microstructures, processing properties, storage stability and rheology properties of HIPEs in the present work.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results suggested that the properties of MPI under different pH shift treatments were improved to different degrees, stabilizing HIPEs (ϕ = 75%–85%) with various processability to meet food processing needs. Under alkali shift treatment conditions, the particle size of MPI was significantly reduced with better solubility. Moreover, the exposure of hydrophobic groups increased the surface hydrophobicity of MPI, awarding MPI better emulsifying properties, which could stabilize the HIPEs with higher oil phase fraction. In addition, the MPI under pH 12 shift treatment (MPI-12) had the best oil-carrying ability to form the stable HIPEs with oil volume fraction (ϕ) up to 85%, which was the highest oil phase in preparing the HIPEs by using plant protein solely at a low concentration under neutral conditions.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A series of stable HIPEs with different processing properties were simply and feasibly fabricated, which are of great potential in applying edible HIPEs.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
