{"title":"The impact of digital transformation of infrastructure on carbon emissions: Based on a \"local-neighborhood\" perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307399","date":1721311200000,"content":"<p>by Jinzhao Song, Qiyue Gao, Xiangxiang Hu, Jie Lei</p>\r\n\r\nIn light of the recent worldwide scientific and technological revolution, it is imperative that urban infrastructure undergo a digital transformation in order to lower carbon emissions and support sustainable urban growth. However, to date, there is a lack of empirical research on carbon emissions based on the digital transformation of urban infrastructure. This paper uses data from 178 prefecture-level cities in China from 2005 to 2020 to study the impact of digital transformation of urban infrastructure on carbon emissions based on the \"local-neighbourhood\" perspective using a spatial difference-in-differences model. The results show that the digital transformation of urban infrastructure reduces the intensity of local carbon emissions while also reducing the carbon emissions of neighbouring cities, with a spatial spillover effect, and the boundary of this spatial spillover is 600 km. Mechanistic analyses suggest that digital transformation of urban infrastructure can reduce carbon emissions locally as well as in nearby areas by promoting green technological innovations. In light of this, this study has important policy implications for maximising the contribution of digital transformation of infrastructure to reducing carbon emissions.","author":"Jinzhao Song","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1dcfc972344a3f6136fb7f6f72f51b5283c4b5841fbc29b9532eb63140d06cf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
