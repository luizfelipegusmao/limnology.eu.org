{"title":"Two birds with one stone: How RhRAP2.4L controls both cell proliferation and expansion to regulate petal growth in rose","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2188/7515154?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span>The control of organ size in plants is a complex process involving a coordinated interplay of cell proliferation and expansion. Plant hormones have long been recognized for their pivotal role in this process. For instance, brassinosteroids and gibberellic acid have been demonstrated to modulate growth in eudicot and monocot leaves, respectively (<a href=\"#kiae004-B5\">Nelissen et al. 2012</a>; <a href=\"#kiae004-B9\">Zhiponova et al. 2013</a>). In contrast, auxin and cytokinins (CK) have been found to regulate growth in roots in an antagonistic manner (<a href=\"#kiae004-B6\">Street et al. 2016</a>; <a href=\"#kiae004-B2\">Di Mambro et al. 2017</a>). Despite significant progress, molecular mechanisms that link hormone actions with cell proliferation and expansion processes during organ growth remain largely unknown. Filling this knowledge gap is crucial, given that organ growth directly influences biomass, a key factor in food and energy production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d6d7e29a98c551bbd902767850057ca7897631b9e1dfe4626953b4156e09d7f2","category":"Environment"}
