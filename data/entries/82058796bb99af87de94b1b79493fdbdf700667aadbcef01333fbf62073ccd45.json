{"title":"Implementing Shoah-Themed Literature into Teaching with the Example of the Boy from Block 66: A WW2 Jewish Holocaust Survival True Story","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1308/v1","date":1726564043000,"content":"In the contribution, through literary content analysis, we present the results of the analysis of the publication The Boy From Block 66: A WW2 Jewish Holocaust Survival True Story (2023). We are convinced that this book can be included in the teaching of Literary Education at various levels of education, especially at the level of application of the historical and integrative approach of introducing students to the literary themes of the Shoah. For two excerpts from this publication, we present several questions and tasks, the aim of which is to guide pupils to an adequate internalization of the tone of the events of the Shoah. We are convinced that (not only) this publication is an adequate narrative in which the events that connote the Shoah are presented authentically and in an attractive way for young readers, and whose presentation in this publication leads to a certain de-abstracting of them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82058796bb99af87de94b1b79493fdbdf700667aadbcef01333fbf62073ccd45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
