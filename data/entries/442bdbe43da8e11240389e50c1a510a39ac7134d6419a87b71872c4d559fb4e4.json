{"title":"Perspective of Creating a Low-Cost Medical Assistant Robot Based on the WafflePI4 Platform with a Palm Vein Pattern Scanner","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1696/v1","date":1711625123000,"content":"Military medical service is an important component of the Armed Forces of any country [1]. In wartime, healthcare performs critical functions of medical support for military operations, providing effective and qualified care to the wounded and sick. Consequently, it is imperative to equip military hospitals with state-of-the-art materials and technical resources commensurate with the predefined requirements. In this study, we examine a series of enhancements applied to the TurtleBot 3 Waffle Pi-based medical assistant robot, tailored for deployment in military hospital settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"442bdbe43da8e11240389e50c1a510a39ac7134d6419a87b71872c4d559fb4e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
