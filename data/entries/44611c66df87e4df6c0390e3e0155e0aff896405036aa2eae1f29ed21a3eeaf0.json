To this end, its application is approached as a real multi-criteria classification problem with the use of the ELECTRE III method and is built from the components, considered from the importance they represent for the agents involved in the tourism sector, which contemplates the tourism supply, demand and management, infrastructure, services, natural and cultural resources, economic benefits and social impact. The results obtained with the use of this approach allowed us to evaluate and compare the tourist destinations that wish to be recognized under this nomination. In conclusion, the ELECTRE method turned out to be a success, since it allows us to explain and understand the competitive order of the tourist destinations under study. For future work, this procedure could be used to identify which factors are most important or attractive to decision makers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44611c66df87e4df6c0390e3e0155e0aff896405036aa2eae1f29ed21a3eeaf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
