Previous research has suggested that musical experience can restructure the brain, thereby enhancing time discrimination. However, this phenomenon remains underexplored. In this study, we seek to elucidate the enhancing effect of musical experience on time discrimination, utilizing both behavioral and electroencephalogram methodologies. Additionally, we aim to explore, through brain connectivity analysis, the role of increased connectivity in brain regions associated with auditory perception as a potential contributory factor to time discrimination induced by musical experience. The results show that the music-experienced group demonstrated higher behavioral accuracy, shorter reaction time, and shorter P3 and mismatch response latencies as compared to the control group. Furthermore, the music-experienced group had higher connectivity in the left temporal lobe. In summary, our research underscores the positive impact of musical experience on time discrimination and suggests that enhanced connectivity in brain regions linked to auditory perception may be responsible for this enhancement.</p>","author":"Jiaqi Jin, \nQi Zheng, \nHongxing Liu, \nKunyun Feng, \nYanru Bai, \nGuangjian Ni","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"b12398e3082bee849d247c1ebfb7ce77ace31c85e783e05592c7e5d5102a7c52","category":"Environment"}
