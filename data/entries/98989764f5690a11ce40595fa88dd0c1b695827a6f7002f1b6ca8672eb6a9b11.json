The primary objective of this study is assess differences between community and non-community pharmacists in perceptions of pharmacist HC prescribing. Secondary objectives include assessment of community pharmacist interest in prescribing HC, and differences in perceptions between pharmacists in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. A survey was emailed in early 2022 to 2592 Georgia pharmacists, with Likert questions assessing interest, perceptions, comfort, and perceived barriers regarding pharmacist prescribed HC. Completed survey response rate was 11.8%. Regardless of practice site, a majority agreed pharmacists are well-trained to prescribe HC (Community 61.8% vs. Non-community 68.1%, p=0.25) and provision of HC services is within the pharmacist’s scope (Community 73.6% vs. Non-community 74.2%, p=0.90). Overall metropolitan and non-metropolitan community pharmacists' perceptions were similar, however more metropolitan pharmacists believed pharmacists are well trained to prescribe HC (66.7% vs 48.7%, p=0.049) and that it is within their scope of practice (78.1% vs. 61.5%, p=0.045). In summary, the majority of pharmacists, regardless of practice type, believe that pharmacists are prepared to prescribe HC and it is a part of pharmacist’s professional scope of practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98989764f5690a11ce40595fa88dd0c1b695827a6f7002f1b6ca8672eb6a9b11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
