{"title":"Oxyhydrogen Gas: A Promising Therapeutic Approach for Lung, Breast and Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2443/v1","date":1722325332000,"content":"Cancer remains a leading cause of death despite advancements in research and treatment, with traditional therapies often causing significant side effects and resistance. Oxyhydrogen gas, a mixture of 66% molecular hydrogen (H₂) and 33% molecular oxygen (O₂) has shown exceptional promise as a novel therapeutic agent due to its ability to modulate oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. H2, a key component of oxy-hydrogen gas, neutralises reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, enhancing existing treatments and reducing harmful oxidative states in cancer cells. H₂ also lowers pro-inflammatory mediators including chemokines, cytokines and interleukins, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and boosting the effectiveness of conventional therapies. Additionally, hydrogen can induce apoptosis in cancer cells by modulating pathways such as MAPK and inhibiting the PI3K/Akt phosphorylation cascade. Preclinical and clinical evidence supports oxyhydrogen gas's potential in treating various cancers. In lung cancer models, it inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and enhances chemotherapy sensitivity. Similar results have been observed in breast cancer, where patients reported improved quality of life. In colorectal cancer, oxyhydrogen gas suppresses tumour growth, induces apoptosis and improves intestinal microflora dysbiosis. The unique properties of oxyhydrogen gas make it a promising adjunctive or standalone cancer treatment. However, further research is needed to understand H₂'s mechanisms, optimise treatment protocols, and evaluate long-term safety and efficacy in human patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc704b2f751d06e5582a47220a1f3a7ac64b8d32f4023c2859e7b2ded22d2db0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
