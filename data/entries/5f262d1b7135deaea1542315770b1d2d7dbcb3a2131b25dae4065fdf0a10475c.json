To remedy the situation, we present a novel, time-efficient and non-destructive laboratory technique to investigate grain-size-specific transport characteristics of bed load pulses. The method consists of a through-water, high-resolution image acquisition followed by the application of a supervised color classification algorithm (Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classification). The analyzed bed load pulse consisted of five different grain size classes of dyed quartz sand and gravel, each having a unique color. The initial experimental bed was uni-colored and contained the same size fractions as the augmented pulse. Quality assessment based on a confusion matrix approach and basic random sampling showed a high classification performance. By statistically analyzing the temporal and spatial color distribution of the experimental reach, characteristic parameters to describe the propagation behavior were determined. The bed load pulse presented in the application example initially showed strong deviations in the grain-size-specific advection and dispersion, and advection proved to be predominant in the transport process.</p>","author":"Kevin Reiterer, \nThomas Gold, \nChristoph Hauer, \nHelmut Habersack, \nChristine Sindelar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"5f262d1b7135deaea1542315770b1d2d7dbcb3a2131b25dae4065fdf0a10475c","category":"Environment"}
