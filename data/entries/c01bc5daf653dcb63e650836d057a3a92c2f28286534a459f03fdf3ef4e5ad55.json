{"title":"The “healthy = sustainable” heuristic: Do meal or individual characteristics affect the association between perceived sustainability and healthiness of meals?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/article?id=10.1371/journal.pstr.0000086","date":1700229600000,"content":"<p>by Gudrun Sproesser, Ulrike Arens-Azevedo, Britta Renner</p>\r\n\r\nResearch has found an association between the perceived sustainability and healthiness of foods and meals between individual consumers. The current study aimed to investigate whether the association between perceived sustainability and healthiness on the individual level is rooted in reality. Moreover, we investigated whether meal or individual characteristics affect this association. In total, 5021 customers of a public canteen rated the sustainability and healthiness of 29 meal options. For determining the actual environmental sustainability and healthiness scores, exact recipes of each meal were analyzed using the NAHGAST algorithm. Results showed a substantial association between perceived sustainability and healthiness at the individual level. However, this perceived relation was unrelated to the overlap between the actual environmental sustainability and healthiness scores of the meals. Moreover, this “healthier = more sustainable” perception was unrelated to other meal characteristics (e.g., vegan content) or individual characteristics (i.e., gender, eating style). However, this association was slightly higher in older than in younger participants. The present study shows in a real-world setting that food consumers seem to evaluate the sustainability and healthiness of meals based on a simple “healthy = sustainable” heuristic which is largely independent of the actual overlap of these dimensions. Future research is needed to shed more light on the nature, sources, and consequences of this heuristic.","author":"Gudrun Sproesser","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"c01bc5daf653dcb63e650836d057a3a92c2f28286534a459f03fdf3ef4e5ad55","category":"Environment"}
