{"title":"Select Venous Analytes and Fibrinogen Determination Using Two Methods in Brown Pelicans","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0018/v1","date":1711959226000,"content":"The brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) is a species often affected by natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes and oil spills as well as general human activities; that subsequently receives medical care and rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, blood may be collected for various testing to help with diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Reference intervals for this species are limited, dated, and typically from small sample sizes. Seventy one presumed healthy brown pelicans were sampled as a part of their pre-release examination from rehabilitation at the Wildlife Center of Texas after a large volume stranding in December 2014 to January 2015, and various venous analytes were measured to establish updated reference intervals for Brown Pelicans. Fibrinogen was measured via heat precipitation and the Abaxis VSPro equine Fibrinogen cartridge to determine reference intervals, and in an attempt to validate the VSPro for use in avian species. Abaxis VS2 Avian/Reptile Chemistry panel, iSTAT CG4+, and iSTAT Chem8+ results in addition to body condition score, spun PCV, cloacal temperature and fibrinogen were measured. Proposed reference intervals for brown pelicans are presented. Fibrinogen results were not comparable between the gold standard method and the VSPro, indicating that the VSPro is not appropriate for use in brown pelicans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6117280d08d391f56b75f1d6e9adee0137bf39d43ba9272adfc60226e8b7655","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
