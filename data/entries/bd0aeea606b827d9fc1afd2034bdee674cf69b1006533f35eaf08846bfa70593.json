{"title":"Early Signs of Swamp Building Collapse: Failure of Wood Pillar Foundation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0107/v1","date":1717418792000,"content":"The construction of a house with a stage structure is the uniqueness of Banjarmasin's swampland. Particularly, foundations for swampy terrain necessitate special handling. Building material defects and the basic inability to modify the use and design of wood pillar foundations are the main causes of house building problems. The very limited capacity of a wooden pillar foundation makes house buildings collapse frequently. The aim of the study is to determine the weaknesses of the wooden pillar foundations by examining the indications of damage to the house structure. Field observation investigations, including housing and individual object observations, will be carried out at multiple construction sites in Banjarmasin (Indonesia) as part of this study. The way the data is presented is descriptive. A wooden pillar foundation, which is a frequently used foundation, has a limited load bearing capacity. Because that, there has been no related research that addresses the issue of how this foundation damage. The aim of the study is to determine the early signs of swamp building collapse in the wooden pillar foundations weaknesses by examining the indications of damage to the house structure. The weak construction of a wooden pillar foundation explains some indications of house building damage, such as broken wooden pillars and floor settlement. The existence of evidence that there is a broken 'sundukâ€™ element is one of the causes of damage to this foundation","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd0aeea606b827d9fc1afd2034bdee674cf69b1006533f35eaf08846bfa70593","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
