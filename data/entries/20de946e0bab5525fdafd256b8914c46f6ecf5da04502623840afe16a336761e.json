{"title":"Pelvic tilt and stiffness of the muscles stabilising the lumbo-pelvic-hip (LPH) complex in tensiomyography examination","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312480","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Karol Bibrowicz, Tomasz Szurmik, Piotr Kurzeja, Bartosz Bibrowicz, Katarzyna Ogrodzka-Ciechanowicz</p>\r\nPurpose <p>The objective of the study was to initially validate the hypothesis about the relationship between the pelvic tilt angle in the saggital plane and the functional state of muscles stabilising the lumbo-pelvic-hip (LPH) complex expressed as a change in their stiffness in a tensiomyography examination.</p> Materials and methods <p>Forty five women aged 19â€“30 years took part in an observational (cross-sectional) study. The examination involved measurements using the tensiomyography method (TMG). The stiffness of muscles stabilising the LPH complex expressed as a maximal muscle displacement (Dm variable) was assessed and the relationship between muscle stiffness and the value of the pelvic tilt (PT) in the sagittal plane was determined.</p> Results <p>The analysis showed significant differences in the values of medians of the muscle displacement (Dm) values in groups identified in terms of the value of pelvic tilt (Table 1) for Erector Spinae (ES) muscles (p = 0.0012), Gluteus Maximus (GM) muscles (p = 0.0004), Rectus Abdominis (RA) muscles (p = 0.0005), Obliquus abdominis externus (OAE) muscles (p = 0.0002*) and Rectus Femoris (RF) muscles (p = 0.0071). The results of the correlation analysis performed using the Spearman rho correlation coefficient between the value of pelvic tilt and muscle stiffness (Dm) show the following significant relations for ES muscles (p = 0&lt;0.0001), GM muscles (p&lt;0.0001), RA muscles (p&lt;0.0001) and OAE muscles (p&lt;0.0001). However, a clear direction of changes in stiffness in accordance with the description of relations defined as Lower Crossed Syndrome was not confirmed.</p> Conclusions <p>A tensiomyographic examination did not show clear relations between the value of pelvic tilt and stiffness of muscles stabilising the lumbar-pelvic-hip complex. The mechanism of Lower Crossed Syndrome (LCS) may be not the only model explaining the relations between musculofascial structures of the hip-lumbar area. The implications of the LCS should not be the only basis for the therapy of disorders resulting from an incorrect position of the pelvis in the sagittal plane.</p>","author":"Karol Bibrowicz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"20de946e0bab5525fdafd256b8914c46f6ecf5da04502623840afe16a336761e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
