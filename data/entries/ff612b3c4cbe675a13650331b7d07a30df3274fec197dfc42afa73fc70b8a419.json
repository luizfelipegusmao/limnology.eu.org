{"title":"Density effects on a tropical copepod Acartia sp.: Implications as live feed in aquaculture","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13020?af=R","date":1712550638000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Calanoid copepods <i>Acartia</i> species are major live feeds for the early stages of economically important marine fish in hatcheries in Southeast Asian countries. However, rearing <i>Acartia</i> copepods at high densities to increase productivity remains a major challenge. To address the issue, we conducted two experiments on (1) <i>Acartia</i> sp. nauplii (1000, 3000, 6000, 9000, 12,000, and 15,000 individuals L<sup>−1</sup>) and (2) adults (1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 individuals L<sup>−1</sup>). We assessed key parameters for biomass production: development, survival, and egg and nauplii production. In general, increased density resulted in longer development time, lowered survival and egg and nauplii production but did not affect the size of adult males and females. Despite survival to adulthood decreasing at higher stocking nauplii densities, the number of surviving adults was highest at a stocking density of 12,000 individuals L<sup>−1</sup>. Egg and nauplii production was very low which may be the result of high predation. The total eggs and nauplii harvested were highest at the lowest adult density. These results are essential for the biomass production of <i>Acartia</i> sp. in central Vietnam.</p>","author":"Hung Quoc Pham, \nCanh Van Bui, \nNam Xuan Doan, \nKhuong V.
