{"title":"GDP and Household Food Waste in the Digital Era: How E-Commerce Can Transform European Sustainability Practices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0995/v1","date":1715768973000,"content":"The article examines the relationship between household food waste and GDP in various European regions, aiming to determine how economic prosperity influences household food waste levels. Using comparative analysis of secondary and tertiary data, we developed a synthetic indicator (IpFW), to assess the interaction between GDP per capita and household food waste per capita. Despite expectations, higher GDP did not consistently correlate with lower food waste, challenging assumptions about economic prosperity and environmental stewardship. The research underscores the complex interplay between economic factors and food waste management, revealing no significant correlation even at regional levels. It also highlights the potential of e-commerce in enhancing food waste reduction strategies. E-commerce platforms can optimize food supply chains and consumer behavior, contributing to more sustainable consumption patterns. The conclusions call for a reevaluation of policies and suggest that integrating e-commerce could bolster efforts to manage food waste more effectively, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a8a4507b1a61a2d6c41a9135638c7b409a534f5e277cf6a5aa703a4703dd1ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
