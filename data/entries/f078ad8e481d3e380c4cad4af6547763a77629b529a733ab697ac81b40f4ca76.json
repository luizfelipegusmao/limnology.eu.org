{"title":"Influences of Etchants on Etched Surfaces of High-Strength and High Conductivity Cu Alloy of Different Processing States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0019/v1","date":1711958848000,"content":"With continuous increase in integration of the semiconductor devices, the requirements on size accuracy and surface quality of the etched lead frame are higher. The etchant is a key factor on etching process and etched surface quality, while effects of the difference in etchants on microscopic etched surface morphology of the Cu alloy have not been directly studied. In this study, the aqua regia, acidic FeCl3 and CuCl2 solutions were used as etchants, and the CuCrSn alloy specimens with different microstructure were etched and characterized. The results show that the etching rate in aqua regia is high, and the grain orientation, grain boundary (GB) and dislocation have significant influence on the local etching rate. The preferential etching of some atomic planes forms steps between grains with different orientations, and the preferential etching around the GB and dislocation group forms grooves, resulting in high surface roughness. For etching of the FeCl3 and CuCl2 etchants, the steps and grooves become blurred, and almost invisible on the surface etched by the CuCl2 etchant, thus the surface roughness is much lower. The CuCrSn alloy surface etched by the aqua regia is clean, with little Cr-rich particles, while high density Cr-rich particles are remained on the surfaces etched with the FeCl3 and CuCl2 etchants. For the same kind of etchant, the ion concentration can affect the etching mechanism and etching surface morphology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f078ad8e481d3e380c4cad4af6547763a77629b529a733ab697ac81b40f4ca76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
