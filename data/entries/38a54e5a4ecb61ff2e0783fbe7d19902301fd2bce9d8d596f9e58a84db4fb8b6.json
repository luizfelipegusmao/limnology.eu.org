{"title":"Pacemaker Optimization Mechanisms in the Spectrum of Cardiac Disease Rationale to Protocol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1090/v1","date":1726281283000,"content":"The problem can be stated as over 3 billion choices to improve 14 disease states with 9 optimization goals (some of the optimization goals are diametrically opposed) to improve dyspnea, shortness of breath, fatigability, exercise intolerance, edema, swelling, fluid retention, and arrhythmias. The goal is to increase Left Ventricular Outflow Integral, reduce mitral regurgitation, increase longitudinal conduction velocities and restore synchrony of the septum to the ventricle that needs it the most. A method to accomplish this task for the spectrum of cardiac disease is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38a54e5a4ecb61ff2e0783fbe7d19902301fd2bce9d8d596f9e58a84db4fb8b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
