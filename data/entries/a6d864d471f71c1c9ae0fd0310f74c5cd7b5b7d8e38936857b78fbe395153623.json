Even though there exist growing research regarding various aspects of digital transformation and sustainability procedure, a more detailed analysis is needed in different national environments. Proposed study empirically analyzes the Greek managersâ€™ perspective for the relationship between digital management intensity and environmental performance. Almost 60 Greek senior managers from various organizational sectors were interviewed, while a synthetic index already developed from previous studies was used. Results indicate that Greek companies are not fully exploit digital technologies to further develop their environmental practices. Digital transformation strategy is contributing effectively to environmental strategies in the case of reducing emissions of waste and avoid environmental accidents, while in the rest of cases emerging technologies play a less important role and not as a part of an holistic digital strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6d864d471f71c1c9ae0fd0310f74c5cd7b5b7d8e38936857b78fbe395153623","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
