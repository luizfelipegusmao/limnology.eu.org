{"title":"Finding a Published Which Meaningfully Averages The Most Pathalogical Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0436/v1","date":1725532486000,"content":"I want to meaningfully average a pathalogical function (i.e., an everywhere surjective function whose graph has zero Hausdorff measure in its dimension). We do this by taking the most generalized, satisfying extension of the expected value, w.r.t the Hausdorff measure in its dimension, on bounded functions which takes finite values only. As of now, I'm unable to solve this due to limited knowledge of advanced math and most people are too busy to help. Therefore, I'm wondering if anyone knows a research paper which solves my doubts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"429b971f6373694b0b9d2b3f738880c2032af6837dd9616a7983116865485ee4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
