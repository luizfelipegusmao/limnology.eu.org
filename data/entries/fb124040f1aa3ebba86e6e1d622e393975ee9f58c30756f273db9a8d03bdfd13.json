{"title":"Internet of Things and Distributed Computer Systems in Business Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0052/v1","date":1725253808000,"content":"The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Computer Systems (DCS) is transforming business models across industries. IoT devices enable real-time monitoring of equipment and processes, reducing downtime and enhancing efficiency. In the case, manufacturing companies use IoT sensors to monitor machinery, predict failures, and schedule maintenance. Also, automation via IoT, reduces manual intervention, resulting in boosted productivity in smart factories and automated supply chains. IoT devices generate thus vast amounts of data, which businesses analyze to gain insights into customer behavior, operational inefficiencies, and market trends. In turn, distributed computer systems process this data, providing actionable insights and enabling advanced analytics and machine learning for future trend predictions. While, IoT facilitates personalized products and services by collecting data on customer preferences and usage patterns, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty, IoT devices support new customer interactions, like wearable health devices, and enable subscription-based and pay-per-use models in transportation and utilities. Conversely, real-time monitoring enhances security, as distributed systems quickly respond to threats, ensuring operational safety. It also aids regulatory compliance by providing accurate operational data. In this way, this study, through a Bibliometric Literature Review (LRSB) of 91 screened pieces of literature, aims at ascertaining to what extent the aforementioned capacities enhance business models. The study concludes that those systems leverage businesses, promoting competitive edge, continuous innovation, and adaptability to market dynamics. A review of 91 academic documents from the Scopus database highlights these impacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb124040f1aa3ebba86e6e1d622e393975ee9f58c30756f273db9a8d03bdfd13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
