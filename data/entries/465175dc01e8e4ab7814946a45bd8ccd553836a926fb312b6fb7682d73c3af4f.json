{"title":"Individual and Community-Level Determinants of Abortion in Southern Ethiopia: A Multi-Level Mixed Effect Logistic Regression Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1564/v1","date":1726757490000,"content":"AbstractBackground: In Ethiopia, 8.6% of maternal deaths are attributed to abortion. Despite the legalization of abortion and improved accessibility of safe abortion services, almost six in 10 abortions in Ethiopia are performed outside of the health facility. Abortion considered as an indicator for various aspects of reproductive health and healthcare access within a particular region or country. Despite the significance of the problem, there is a limited understanding of the magnitude of abortion and the contributing factors in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of abortion and determinant factors among reproductive-age women in the Sidama regional state of Ethiopia.Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to November 11, 2022, among 1,130 women of reproductive age. We utilized a multi-stage sampling method to select eligible women. A structured and pretested questionnaire was utilized to collect the data using Open Data Kit (ODK) mobile application. Due to the hierarchical nature of the data, a multilevel logistic regression model was applied. Variables with p-values &lt; 0.25 on bi-variable analysis were included in a multivariable regression model. In the multivariable regression model, variables with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were declared as statistically significant factors of abortion. Results: Nearly one-fifth (19.5%) of the women had a history of abortion. From the individual level determinates; women with formal education (AOR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.24-0.79), and planned pregnancy (AOR=0.41; 95% CI: 0.28-0.61) had lower odds of abortion. While from the community related factors; urban residence increased the odds of abortion (AOR=2.25; 95% CI: 1.20-4.20) as compared to the rural residence.Conclusion: the prevalence of abortion among reproductive age women of Northern Zone of Sidama Region was high. Education and a planned pregnancy serve as protective factors for abortion, while the risk of abortion increased among women reside in urban area. Therefore, to lower the abortion rate, it is better to implement a comprehensive approach, focusing on education, family planning, and urban-specific intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"465175dc01e8e4ab7814946a45bd8ccd553836a926fb312b6fb7682d73c3af4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
