{"title":"Achieving Real-time Prediction of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Onset by Convolutional Neural Network and Sliding Window on R-R Interval Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1178/v1","date":1723724977000,"content":"Early diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) could suggest patients to receive timely interventions in clinical practice. Various PAF onset prediction algorithms might benefit from accurate heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning classification but to be challenged in real-time monitoring scenarios. The aim of this study is to present an end-to-end deep learning based PAFNet model that integrates a sliding window technique on raw R-R interval of electrocardiogram (ECG) segments to achieve a real-time prediction of PAF onsets. This integration enable the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to be customized as a light-weight architecture that accommodates the size of sliding windows simply by altering the input layer, specifically its effectiveness in making a new prediction with each new heartbeat. Catering to potential influence of input sizes, three CNN models were trained using 50, 100, and 200 R-R intervals, respectively. For each model, the performance of automated algorithms was evaluated for PAF prediction using a ten-fold cross-validation. As a results, a total of 56,381 PAFN-type and 56,900 N-type R-R interval segments was collected from publicly accessible ECG databases, and a promising prediction performance of the automated algorithm with a 100 R-R intervals was achieved in terms of the sensitivity of 97.12%, the specificity of 97.77%, and the accuracy of 97.45%, respectively. Importantly, the automated algorithm with a sliding windows step of 1 could process one sample in only 23.1 milliseconds and identify the onset of PAF at least 45 minutes in advance. The present results suggest that the sliding window technique on raw R-R interval sequences along by deep learning based algorithms may offers the possibility of providing an accurate, real-time, and end-to-end clinical tool for mass monitoring of PAF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55567369d217b108166d0f677c1e1206d1928c5c948498f928e10775d4b7e3a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
