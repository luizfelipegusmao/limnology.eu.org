{"title":"118 Gene editing: A European perspective","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/13/7664705?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gene editing by CRISPR/Cas has revolutionized numerous facets of biotechnology within a remarkably short period of time. Its combined use with either somatic cell nuclear transfer or microinjection into fertilized oocytes is highly useful for mutating genes in a very precise and specific manner. This technology has profoundly transformed the world of animal research, particularly for biomedical and productive applications. Gene editing can now be applied to animal modeling and therapeutic research, bringing us closer to the possibility of using animals as organ donors for xenotransplantation. Furthermore, it has become an effective tool in animal production for purposes such as increasing disease tolerance or resistance and enhancing animal welfare.In this presentation, we will explore how this genome editing tool has influenced the research conducted in Europe, examining the current landscape and addressing the challenges, with a special focus on pigs. We will also discuss the regulation of gene-edited animals in the EU.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"df7bcfcd29763c570adf3a8cb10b47077e02e0ee783ed57f8e794bfa758b8e47","category":"Environment"}
