{"title":"Of attachment and connection: Auxin signaling in the cambium promotes successful plant grafting","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/667/7691840?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span>Plants possess an extraordinarily regenerative ability that allows excised shoot and root systems of two plants to be joined and grow as one. This technique, known as grafting, has been practiced for millennia to improve performance and yields in many crops by combining advantageous traits of the shoot (scion) with those of the root system (rootstock) (<a href=\"#kiae334-B9\">Williams et al. 2021</a>). Successful grafting depends on the attachment of tissues, the formation of an unspecialized mass of cells called callus, and the connection of vascular tissues between the grafted organs (<a href=\"#kiae334-B5\">Melnyk et al. 2015</a>). The signal triggering these processes was thought to originate from the pericycle, the meristematic outer cell layer of the vascular cylinder (<a href=\"#kiae334-B2\">Iwase et al. 2011</a>). The cambium, the stem cell niche that produces vascular cell precursors, is also hypothesized to regulate grafting, as mutations in cambium-associated genes reduce grafting efficiency (<a href=\"#kiae334-B4\">Matsuoka et al. 2021</a>; <a href=\"#kiae334-B10\">Zhang et al. 2022</a>). However, the role of cambium in graft formation has not yet been experimentally tested.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b7bad10de5bd129df363aab15c5f86cafc61d79d79e001fa39b297ee5fdd59cb","category":"Environment"}
