{"title":"Microbes and Sustainable Living: Focus on Electric and Magnetic Fields","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1409/v1","date":1716305189000,"content":"Among earthâ€™s microbial populations are the genes, functional capacities, generational memory and sentient cognition that enable microorganisms to adapt and thrive in the full range of ecological conditions found on planet earth. In prior sequential publications, we considered fundamental properties (e.g., use of and responses to sound, light, vibrations) and features of microorganisms that cause them to be critical co-partners of human and other holobionts as well as the potential benefits for humanity that can be gained by fully applying quantum-related and novel capacities of microbial life. In this narrative review we: 1) discuss key concepts concerning a microbially-enhanced and sustainable future, and 2) focus on electric- and magnetic- based features of microorganisms that make them pivotal for myriad benefits ranging from beyond pharma-based health and wellness to free- and/or renewable energy and restorative agriculture to improved human networking. While the benefits are many, the risks posed by hazardous electric or magnetic field exposures to both holobionts and microbial communities are significant. This review concludes that microbes and their remarkable capacities offer both humanity and the planet a much brighter future if we reverse the demonization of microbes and wanton microbiome degradation that has predominated much of the past century.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"042966d61f7723f383cec7cf9a1c326fcb53a1c07141e8397fdaf45632f949c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
