{"title":"The Realistic Potential of Soil Carbon Sequestration in U.S. Croplands for Climate Mitigation","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003866?af=R","date":1717743600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Existing estimates of the climate mitigation potential from cropland carbon sequestration (C-sequestration) are limited because they tend to assume constant rates of soil organic carbon change over all available cropland area, use relatively coarse land delineations, and often fail to adequately consider the agronomic and socioeconomic dimensions of agricultural land use. This results in an inflated estimate of the C-sequestration potential. We address this gap by defining a more appropriate land base for cover cropping in the United States for C-sequestration purposes: stable croplands in annual production systems that can integrate cover cropping without irrigation. Our baseline estimate of this suitable stable cropland area is 32% of current U.S. cropland extent. Even an alternative, less restrictive definition of stability results in a large reduction in area (44% of current U.S. croplands). Focusing cover crop implementation to this constrained land base would increase durability of associated C-sequestration and limit soil carbon loss from land conversion to qualify for carbon-specific incentives. Applying spatially-variable C-sequestration rates from the literature to our baseline area yields a technical potential of 19.4 Tg CO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>−1</sup> annually, about one-fifth of previous estimates. We also find the cost of realizing about half (10 Tg CO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>−1</sup>) of this potential could exceed 100 USD Mg CO<sub>2</sub>e<sup>−1</sup>, an order of magnitude higher than previously thought. While our economic analyses suggest that financial incentives are necessary for large-scale adoption of cover cropping in the U.S., they also imply any C-sequestration realized under such incentives is likely to be additional.</p>","author":"Nazli Uludere Aragon, \nYanhua Xie, \nDaniel Bigelow, \nTyler J.
