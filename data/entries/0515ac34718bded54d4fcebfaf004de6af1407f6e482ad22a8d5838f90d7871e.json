Astrocytes can also acquire a reactive phenotype that correlates with cognitive impairments in brain diseases. A study in PLOS Biology shows that prolonged activation of astrocytes can trigger both cognitive impairments and a reactive astrocyte phenotype.\r\n\r\nAstrocytes can modulate neuronal activity and also acquire a reactive phenotype that correlates with cognitive impairments in brain diseases.
