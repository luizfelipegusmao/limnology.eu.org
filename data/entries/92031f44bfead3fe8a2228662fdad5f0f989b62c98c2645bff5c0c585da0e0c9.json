{"title":"Advancing Face Recognition for Low-Resolution with Multi-Linear Side Information-Based Discriminant Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0682/v1","date":1725876225000,"content":"Face recognition is a key computer vision task that focuses on identifying or verifying individuals using their facial features. This task becomes more difficult with low-resolution images, where the reduced pixel count and detail make it harder to extract and match features accurately. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of Multilinear Side-Information-based Discriminant Analysis (MSIDA) on low-resolution images, using the CelebA database as a reference. The system showed strong performance, achieving 90.60% accuracy on high-resolution and 88.23% on low-resolution images, highlighting the robustness and effectiveness of MSIDA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92031f44bfead3fe8a2228662fdad5f0f989b62c98c2645bff5c0c585da0e0c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
