{"title":"Facilitators and barriers to contraception access and use for Hispanic American adolescent women: An integrative literature review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003169","date":1721916000000,"content":"<p>by Lindsay M. Batek, Natalie M. Leblanc, Amina P. Alio, Karen F. Stein, James M. McMahon</p>\r\nStatement of the problem <p>Hispanic American adolescents experience high rates of pregnancy with profound consequences. Compared with White teens, Hispanic teens use contraception less frequently and often choose less effective forms of contraception. Access to contraception is a primary barrier to use which contributes to relatively high and disparate rates of pregnancy in Hispanic teens. This integrative review identifies facilitators and barriers of contraception access and use for Hispanic women, 13â€“17 years of age, living in the U.S.</p> Methodology <p>Following the Whittemore and Knafl (2005) methodology and PRISMA guidelines, peer reviewed studies were retrieved from PUBMED, CINAHL and EMBASE. The <i>Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool</i> was used to assess the study quality and thematic analysis was used to categorize barriers and facilitators.</p> Findings <p>Of 131 studies retrieved, 16 met inclusion criteria. Individual, interpersonal and healthcare provider factors were identified as primary categories of barriers and facilitators with structural issues comprising an additional barrier category. Individual level barriers were disproportionately represented and further categorized into themes: beliefs/misconceptions, dislike of contraception, pregnancy risk perception, lack of knowledge, and lack of control. Barriers related to cultural and religious influences were identified in individual, interpersonal and structural levels. The most frequently reported facilitators were perceived parent comfort discussing sexual health and past experience of pregnancy.</p> Discussion <p>Limitations in this review may stem from heterogeneity in the acculturation and geography of participants and analysis by a single reviewer. Implications include considering the range of information sources and the influence they have on risk perception and risk mitigation for this population.</p> Conclusion &amp; significance <p>Adolescents describe many modifiable influences on contraception access and use. Misperceptions related to contraception, stemming from beliefs and perceptions, can be corrected through increased access to reliable sources of sex education, parental support, and direct access to nurses and healthcare providers. Awareness of these influences can inform further research and intervention development to address these health disparities.</p>","author":"Lindsay M.
