{"title":"Enhanced dietary reconstruction of Korean prehistoric populations by combining δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N amino acids of bone collagen","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300068","date":1711548000000,"content":"<p>by Kyungcheol Choy, Hee Young Yun, Benjamin T. Fuller, Marcello A. Mannino</p>\r\n\r\nCompound specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) is a powerful tool for determining dietary behaviors in complex environments and improving dietary reconstructions. Here, we conducted CSIA-AA on human (n = 32) and animal (n = 13) remains from two prehistoric archaeological sites (Mumun, Imdang) to assess in more detail the dietary sources consumed by prehistoric Korean populations. Results of estimated trophic position (TP) using Δ<sup>15</sup>N<sub>Glx-Phe</sub> show that the Imdang individuals consumed aquatic resources, as well as terrestrial resources. Principal component analysis (PCA) using δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N essential amino acid (EAA) values show that the Imdang humans closely cluster with game birds and terrestrial herbivores, whilst the Mumun humans closely cluster with C<sub>4</sub> plants. Quantitative estimation by a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) indicates that the Imdang humans derived a large proportion of their proteins from terrestrial animals and marine fish, whereas the main protein sources for the Mumun humans were C<sub>4</sub> plants and terrestrial animals. Additionally, the comparison between the EAA and bulk isotope models shows that there is a tendency to overestimate the consumption of plant proteins when using bulk isotopic data. Our CSIA-AA approach reveals that in prehistoric Korea there were clear differences in human diets through time. This study adds to a growing body of literature that demonstrates the potential of CSIA-AA to provide more accurate estimations of protein consumption in mixed diets than previous bulk isotopic studies.","author":"Kyungcheol Choy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9b35564db634e0a81c6cea7ac4869159a2b7861d1db59bf1c9751d3c518be683","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
