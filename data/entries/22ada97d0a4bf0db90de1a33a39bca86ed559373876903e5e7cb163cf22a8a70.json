{"title":"A Simple Procedure to Obtain the Grounding Resistance Measure of Very Large and Urban Electrodes by a Modified Fall-of-Potential Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1368/v1","date":1724072095000,"content":"The measurement of the grounding resistance of protection grids in large installations as well as grounding electrodes in urban areas is addressed in this article. The resistance value is obtained using a three-pin array by measuring the fall-of-potential on the ground surface. The resistance measured by this method is corrected using the so-called correction factor that adjusts the measured resistance value to its real value. The proposed measurement method obtains correct values of the grounding resistance even when the auxiliary and potential electrodes of the tree-pin array are close to the electrode to be measured. Thus, it can be applied to large electrodes as well as electrodes in urban areas. Several simulated examples are used to illustrate the method, and some real cases with field measurements are presented for a final validation of the method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22ada97d0a4bf0db90de1a33a39bca86ed559373876903e5e7cb163cf22a8a70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
