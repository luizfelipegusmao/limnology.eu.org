{"title":"Effects of Materials (Aluminum and Brass) and Bio‚ÄêInspired Trapezoidal Riblets on Mitigation of Erosion Induced by Cavitation Bubble Multiple Collapses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1303/v1","date":1718794913000,"content":"The current research investigates the effects of material and riblets on cavitation-induced erosion morphology, depth, and cross-sectional area through experimental approaches. To achieve these aims, the erosion of pure aluminum (1xxxAl or Al) and alpha brass (CuZn37 or CZ108) in the presence and absence of bio-inspired sawtooth riblets was examined after exposure to multiple collapses of single cavitation bubbles with a wall distance of 1.8. The results indicate that the erosion morphology resembles a rounded cone with a circular cross-section. Brass provides 21.6% more erosion resistance compared to Al in terms of material properties. Furthermore, the erosion for both Al (depth by 3.8% and width by 18.3%) and brass (depth by 7.9% and width by 27.4%) decreases in the presence of riblets compared to flat surfaces. The greater erosion resistance of brass compared to Al is attributed to the superior mechanical stability of brass, making it a potentially suitable alloy for propellers and hulls. In sum, the results reveal that riblet-provided materials with high mechanical durability are promising erosion-resistant materials for the shipping industry. However, the potential for chemical reactions in a cathodic environment should be addressed to provide a comprehensive perspective on reducing corrosion intensity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4404e008f08b4e22d1bce3f202264c72864c1fb80de0966e47b4e4a3295476f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
