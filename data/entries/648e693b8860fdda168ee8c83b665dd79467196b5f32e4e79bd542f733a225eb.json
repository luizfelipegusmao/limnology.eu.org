{"title":"Encapsulation of piROBotics within Double/Multiple Layer Beads/Carriers: A Concise Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1734/v1","date":1714116944000,"content":"An increased demand for natural products nowadays most specifically probiotics (PRO) is evident since it comes in conjunction with beneficial health effects for the consumers. In this regard, it is well known that encapsulation could affect positively the PRO's viability throughout food manufacturing and long-term storage. This paper aims to analyze and review various multilayer strategies for encapsulation of PRO. Double-layer encapsulation of PRO by electro-hydrodynamic atomization or electrospray technology has been reported along with layer-by-layer assembly and water-in-oil-in-water (W1/O/W2) double emulsions to produce multilayer PRO-loaded carriers. Finally, their applications in food products are presented. The resistance (cover material) and viability of (PRO) to mechanical damage, during gastrointestinal transit and shelf life of these trapping systems are also described. The PRO encapsulation in double and multiple-layer coatings combined with other technologies can be examined to increase the opportunities for new functional products with amended functionalities opening a novel horizon in food technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"648e693b8860fdda168ee8c83b665dd79467196b5f32e4e79bd542f733a225eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
