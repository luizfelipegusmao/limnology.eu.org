{"title":"Psychological effects of anti-Arab politics on American and Arab peoples’ views of each other","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301282","date":1714572000000,"content":"<p>by Youngki Hong, Angela T. Maitner, Kyle G. Ratner</p>\r\n\r\nDisparaging rhetoric about Arab people was prevalent during Donald Trump’s political rise in the United States. Although this rhetoric was intended to energize conservative Americans, it also echoed throughout many liberal parts of the United States and around the world. In this research, we experimentally examined the effects of such rhetoric on American and Arab people’s attitudes and visual representations of each other before and after Trump was elected. Although people overwhelmingly reported not liking the negative rhetoric, the rhetoric alone did not influence explicit and implicit intergroup biases in either location, as measured by feeling thermometers and Implicit Association Tests. However, the election outcome moderated the way rhetoric influenced how American and Arab people visually represented each other. Our research sheds light on nuanced effects of global politics on various information processing stages within intergroup perception.","author":"Youngki Hong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"34dd94d0bb1a4e081aa49efd9dc7c09348c5dde47f56e918a86aaf72363dfdbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
