{"title":"Study on the Coupling of Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP) and Passive Heating in Cold Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0289/v1","date":1720016464000,"content":"As an active device, air source heat pumps (ASHP) are widely used for heating and cooling in buildings. However, in cold regions, their efficiency decreases, and frost formation becomes a significant issue during winter. This paper proposes a new scheme that couples air source heat pumps with passive heating. By using software simulations and mathematical models, the new scheme is compared to traditional ASHP systems to analyze its heating performance in rural homes during winter in China’s cold regions. According to the simulation and calculation analysis, on the coldest day of winter, the coupling scheme can provide approximately 99.41kWh of heat to the interior, surpassing the 86.67kWh required to maintain an indoor temperature of 20℃. The system’s power consumption is 36.96 kWh, which is 66.88% lower than that of traditional heat pump heating. The study shows that a coupled system of air source heat pumps and passive heating has better heating performance in cold regions. By incorporating phase change materials and heat storage media to address the shortage of solar energy at night, the system can meet the heating needs throughout the entire day.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5809d58bc6c4a5857831f6042039c8647af6bc81b6247bfa19926b088e5e3f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
