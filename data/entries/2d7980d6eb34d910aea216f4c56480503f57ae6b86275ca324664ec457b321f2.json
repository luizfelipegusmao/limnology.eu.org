{"title":"Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption in Neuroimmunological Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1175/v1","date":1724119739000,"content":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a structural and functional barrier for brain homeostasis. This review highlights the pathological contribution of BBB dysfunction to neuroimmunological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS). The transmigration of massive lymphocytes across the BBB caused by the activation of cell adhesion molecules is involved in the early phase of MS, and dysfunction of the cortical BBB is associated with the atrophy of gray matter in the late phase of MS. In the onset of NMOSD, increased permeability of the BBB causes the entry of circulating AQP4 autoantibodies into the central nervous system (CNS). Recent reports have shown the importance of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) autoantibodies as BBB-reactive autoantibodies in NMOSD, inducing antibody-mediated BBB dysfunction. BBB breakdown has also been observed in MOGAD, NPSLE, and AE with anti-NMDAR antibodies. Our recent report demonstrated the presence of GRP78 autoantibodies in patients with MOGAD and the molecular mechanism responsible for GRP78 autoantibody-mediated BBB impairment. Disruption of the BBB may explain the symptoms in the brain and cerebellum in the development of PNS, as it induces the entry of pathogenic autoantibodies or lymphocytes into the CNS by autoimmunity against tumors in the periphery. GRP78 autoantibodies were detected in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and were associated with cerebellar ataxia with anti-P/Q type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies. This review reports that therapies affecting the BBB that are currently available for disease-modifying therapies for neuroimmunological diseases have the potential to prevent BBB damage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d7980d6eb34d910aea216f4c56480503f57ae6b86275ca324664ec457b321f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
