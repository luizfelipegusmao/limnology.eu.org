The sediments were analyzed for their pollution levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The sediments were collected from various depths in harbors, coastal lakes, bays, and lagoons, covering the southeastern Mediterranean of the Nile Delta region. The study aimed at determining the distribution, origin, and potential ecological impact of OCP and PCB pollutants. The researchers used the SRM method of GC-MS/MS to measure the concentration of 18 PCBs and 16 OCPs residues. The study found that the total concentration of OCPs in the samples ranged from 3.091 to 20.512 ng/g, with a mean of 8.749 ± 3.677 ng/g. The total concentration of PCB residues ranged from 2.926 to 20.77 ng/g, with a mean of 5.68 ± 3.282 ng/g. The concentration of DDTs exceeded the effect range low (ERL) (1.00) and threshold effect level (TEL) (1.19) in several stations, but it was still below the effect range median (ERM) (7.00) and the probable effect level (PEL) (4.77). This indicates a low ecological risk. The principal component analysis (PCA) was also conducted to determine the sources of all pollutants in the sediment. The PCA showed significant correlations between the concentrations of Gama-HCH and Beta-HCH (0.741), suggesting similar sources.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nOCPs and PCBs residues were analyzed in the sediment of the southeastern Mediterranean.\nThe concentration, existence, and causes of OCPs and PCBs were investigated.\nOCPs and PCBs ecological risk and ecotoxicological calculation were investigated in detail.\nCluster analysis, PCA, and correlation coefficient were also investigated.\n</p>","author":"Mohamed A.
