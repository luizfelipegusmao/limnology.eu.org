Moulton, Laura Russo</p>\r\n\r\nPlanting floral resources is a common strategy for increasing the abundance and diversity of beneficial flower-visiting insects in human-modified systems. However, the context of the local area and surrounding landscape may affect the attractiveness of these floral resource provisioning plots. We compared the relative effects of local floral resources and surrounding urban land-use on the abundance of bees on flowering plants in common gardens in eastern Tennessee, USA. We planted four types of common garden plots at each of five different landscapes representing a variety of surrounding land use: 1) Urban Garden, 2) Forage Grassland, 3) Mixed Agriculture, 4) Forest, and 5) Organic Farm. Each common garden plot type had a fixed plant community representing one of three plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae) or a mix of all three, and all four common gardens were replicated at all the sites. We concurrently sampled bees in the garden plots and in a 50 m radius (local area) around the garden plots. We found that the size of the floral display (i.e. the visual display size of flowers) and diversity of flowers in the local area did not affect bee abundance or species richness in the garden plots. Although there was a significant positive association between developed land use in a 2 km radius and bee abundance in the gardens, the effect was small, and there was no relationship between land use and bee abundance or species richness in the local area. There were significant differences in the composition of the bee community between the local area and garden plots, but the largest determinants of bee community composition and species richness in the gardens were floral display size and variation in the garden plant species in bloom. This finding is promising for anyone wishing to promote pollinator populations by providing more floral resources.","author":"Devon S.
