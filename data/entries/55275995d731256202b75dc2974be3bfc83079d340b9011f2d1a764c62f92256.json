{"title":"3D Virtual Reality Motionless Imagery Exercise through Avatar in Older People","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1114/v1","date":1710992602000,"content":"Background: 3D virtual reality (VR) Motionless Imagery Exercise through Avatar (MIEA) was developed to improve elderlyâ€™s psychological (cognitive and emotional) and physical health. This study observed the impact of this program on the cognitive functions and emotional well-being and the electrophysiological changes in older adults. Methods: This study was conducted using a randomized controlled trial design. The participants included 38 adults, 65 to 84 years of age, who were physically mobile and neurologically healthy. Among them, 19 participants were assigned to the experimental group, who underwent exercises using elderly avatars in a VR virtual exercise program. The other 19 participants were assigned to the control group who underwent the VR program. Both groups engaged in the VR intervention for 20 minutes three times a week, over six weeks. Results: The cognitive functions, including attention restraint, working memory, and phonemic fluency, of the experimental group showed significant improvements compared to the control group. Regarding emotional well-being, the experimental group showed greater self-efficacy. The electrophysiological changes revealed similar patterns to exercise-induced reactions in electromyography of the experimental group after intervention. Conclusions: These findings confirm that participation in 3D VR MIEA enhances cognitive functions and physical self-efficacy among the elderly. Therefore, 3D VR MIEA can be utilized in the rehabilitation therapy of patients or elderly with limited physical activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55275995d731256202b75dc2974be3bfc83079d340b9011f2d1a764c62f92256","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
