Beam blanking is typically achieved by deflecting the beam from the optical axis with added blanking plates into a purposely designed blanking aperture. However, this approach requires installation of additional hardware into the microscope column. Development of an alternative approach is presented here (Figure 1), where the beam is deflected using the normal scan control coils into a vacuum or sacrificial point in the sample plane. This removes the need of additional components in the microscope column and places the added complexity of beam blanking into the scan controller only.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ad51ba3e6b95c3e08dc4f7073801b4ddad70f9b2cca350ffce9590ff7d516f00","category":"Environment"}
