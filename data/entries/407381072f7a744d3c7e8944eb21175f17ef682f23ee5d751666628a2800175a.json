More specifically, food packaging is of great importance due to the utmost need to monitor and maintain food quality until consumption. Thus, there is a high demand for sensors capable of detecting gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, emitted by packaged meat or chicken which serve as freshness indicators. In the present work, a sensor based on Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes was fabricated and tested against CO<sub>2</sub> at room temperature. Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes were synthesized by solution-based methods and deposited on commercial interdigitated electrodes. Specifically, the Cu<sub>2</sub>O-based sensor successfully detected down to 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (50,000 ppm) in the ambient atmosphere, at room temperature, with a response time of less than 90 s. This level of CO<sub>2</sub> is in the range that indicates the unsuitability of packaged meat for consumption. Furthermore, the sensor was able to maintain its response to CO<sub>2</sub> after being stored in the fridge for 20 days, showcasing its endurance under food maintenance conditions.</p>","author":"Emmanouil Gagaoudakis, \nAngelliki Sfakianou, \nEleni Mantsiou, \nVassilios Binas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"407381072f7a744d3c7e8944eb21175f17ef682f23ee5d751666628a2800175a","category":"Environment"}
