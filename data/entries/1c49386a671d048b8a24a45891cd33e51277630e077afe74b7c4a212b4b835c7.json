{"title":"The Role of the Thyroid Disease and Other Biomarkers in Invasive Breast Cancer. 3-Year Retrospective Comparative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0710/v1","date":1723198082000,"content":"Objective: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cause of death among females. There are many prognostic systems, the most recent of which are the molecular subtypes. Recently, it was included that thyroid disease is a favorable factor for the patients with BC and that the thyroid hormones have an effect on the disease. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), however, is thought to be unrelated to the cancer aggressiveness. In the current study we aimed to examine the status of the postoperative TSH levels, as well as the impact of the thyroid disease on the cancer aggressiveness.\n Methods: A retrospective comparative analysis of invasive BC patients was performed  between 2017 and 2019 year. 111 patients were selected. They were divided into group A (n=62) and group B (n=49), based on the presence or absence of thyroid disease, respectively. The data was processed with SPSS version 25.\nResults: There is a significant difference between group A and group B concerning the molecular subtypes, ki-67, and estrogen receptor. The current study supports the fact that TSH is responsible for the aggressiveness of the invasive BC and not the thyroid hormones themselves. Moreover, based on the correlation analyses calcium levels preoperatively are linked to cancer aggressiveness and could be used as future prognostic factors. \nConclusion: Indeed, the thyroid disease appears to have more favorable prognosis based on the molecular subtype frequency but more emphasis in future studies should be given to the TSH and its relation to the overall survival of the patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c49386a671d048b8a24a45891cd33e51277630e077afe74b7c4a212b4b835c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
