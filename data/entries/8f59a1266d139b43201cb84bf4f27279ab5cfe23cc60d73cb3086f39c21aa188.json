{"title":"Novel Treatment for Pre-XDR-Tuberculosis Linked with a Lethal Case of Acute Myocarditis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1729/v1","date":1721669261000,"content":"Management of resistant Tuberculosis (TB) can be extremely difficult, especially in case of novel unpredicted complications. In this report, we present a case of a 48-year-old patient with pre-extensive-drug-resistant-(XDR)-TB who received a treatment regimen including Pretomanid, Bedaquiline, Linezolid, Cycloserine and Amikacin and died due to myocarditis. Acquired resistance to first- and second-line drugs developed due to previous poor adherence to medication. The clinical presentation of the patient, along with her initial ultrasonographical, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory examinations, were typical for acute myocarditis, however, the patient was considered unstable and further investigation with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), pericardiocentesis and endomyocardial biopsy were not performed. To our knowledge, this is the first case of myocarditis in such a patient, the clinical features of which set a high suspicion of drug-induction that could be attributed to the treatment regimen that was administered. Clinicians who manage cases of drug-resistant TB should be aware of this, newly reported, potentially lethal, adverse event.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f59a1266d139b43201cb84bf4f27279ab5cfe23cc60d73cb3086f39c21aa188","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
