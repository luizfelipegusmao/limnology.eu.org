{"title":"The Roots of Gravity in Electrodynamics the Electrodynamics of Electrically Neutral Bodies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1183/v1","date":1718710180000,"content":"Coulomb’s law and Newton’s law of gravitation are formally identical. Is it a mere coincidence? It seems to us that physics has answered yes so far, at least tacitly. We, on the other hand, do not believe in chance.  Since the alternative to the fact that the strong similarity is only the result of chance is to believe that it is not, and in this case there must be a reason for this similarity, we have chosen the path of investigating the possibility that the two fields are not distinct, but have a common root that we will try to find. We propose an electrodynamics of electrically neutral bodies based on the hypothesis that the Coulomb constant in the case of attraction between charges of opposite sign is slightly greater than that of the case of repulsion between charges of the same magnitude as the previous ones, but of the same sign. If this difference were to exist, even small to the point of not being directly measurable in the laboratory, it could still produce macroscopic effects detectable in the case of large aggregates of charges, even if globally electrically neutral, as happens in the astronomical field. We deduce the electromagnetism of such a model and show the results obtained applying the theory to some significant cases such the light deflection in a gravitational field, a planet perihelion precession, the power radiated by merging black holes, the behaviour of antimatter in a gravitational field and, when available, we compare the predictions with the experimental data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54b4d590edf2d9bbff41e82d203e9ad4474e9757931f60198914d92f9d32febb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
