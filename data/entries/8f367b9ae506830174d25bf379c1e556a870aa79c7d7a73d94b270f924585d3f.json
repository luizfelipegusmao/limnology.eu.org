{"title":"A review of latency in the Alloherpesviridae family","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14016?af=R","date":1725809900000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The ability to impact the immune response of the host has been recognized as essential for the success of a virus during infection. A few groups of viruses can combine these immunomodulatory mechanisms with specific patterns of their own transcriptional and replication regulation to achieve persistence within the host long term. The <i>Herpesvirales</i> order is one of those groups and the resultant state is known as latency. Throughout the years, latency has been studied in many host-herpesvirus models to attempt to understand the complex and profound effects of this state on the host's systems, and in the hopes of deciphering a way to eliminate the latent state from survivors of the primary infection. Most studies of herpesvirus latency have been conducted on mammalian host species, but this review summarizes the data available regarding herpesviruses in fish species and their latent state. As the field of aquatic animal health research continues to advance, the elucidation of these complex mechanisms will be crucial for disease control, prevention, and treatment.</p>","author":"Eva Marie Quijano Cardé, \nEsteban Soto","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"8f367b9ae506830174d25bf379c1e556a870aa79c7d7a73d94b270f924585d3f","category":"Environment"}
