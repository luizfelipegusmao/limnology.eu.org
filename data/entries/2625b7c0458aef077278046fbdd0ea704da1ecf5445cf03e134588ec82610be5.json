{"title":"FLOWERING LOCUS T-mediated thermal signalling regulates age-dependent inflorescence development in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4400/7619521?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Many plants show strong heteroblastic changes in the shape and size of organs as they transition from juvenile to reproductive age. Most attention has been focused on heteroblastic development in leaves, but we wanted to understand heteroblastic changes in reproductive organ size. We therefore studied the progression of reproductive development in the model plant <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, and found strong reductions in the size of flowers, fruit, seed, and internodes during development. These did not arise from correlative inhibition by older fruits, or from changes in inflorescence meristem size, but seemed to stem from changes in the size of floral organ primordia themselves. We hypothesized that environmental conditions might influence this heteroblastic pattern and found that the ambient temperature during organ initiation strongly influences organ size. We show that this temperature-dependent heteroblasty is dependent on FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-mediated signal integration, adding to the repertoire of developmental processes regulated by this pathway. Our results demonstrate that rising global temperatures will not affect just fertility, as is widely described, but also the size and seed number of fruits produced. However, we also show that such effects are not hard-wired, and that selective breeding for FT expression during reproductive development could mitigate such effects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"2625b7c0458aef077278046fbdd0ea704da1ecf5445cf03e134588ec82610be5","category":"Environment"}
