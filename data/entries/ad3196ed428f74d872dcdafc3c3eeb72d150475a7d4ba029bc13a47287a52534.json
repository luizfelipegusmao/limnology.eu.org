{"title":"Getting Grip on Phosphorus: Potential of Microalgae as a Vehicle for Sustainable Usage of This Macronutrient","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1379/v1","date":1716286953000,"content":"Phosphorus (P) is an important and irreplaceable macronutrient. It is central to energy and information storage and exchange in living cell. P is an element with “broken geochemical cycle” since it lacks abundant volatile compounds capable of closing the P cycle. P fertilizers are critical for global food security, but the reserves of minable P are scarce and non-evenly distributed between countries of the world. Accordingly, the risks of global crisis due to limited access to P reserves is expected to be graver than those entailed by competition for fossil hydrocarbons. Paradoxically, despite the scarcity and value of P reserves, its usage is extremely inefficient: current waste rate reaches 80% giving rise to a plethora of unwanted consequences such as eutrophication leading to harmful algal blooms. Microalgal biotechnology comprise a promising solution to tackle this challenge. The proposed review briefly presents the relevant aspects of microalgal P metabolism such as cell P reserve composition and turnover, and the regulation of P uptake kinetics for maximization of P uptake efficiency with the focus on novel knowledge. Multifaceted role of polyPhosphates, the largest cell depot for P, is discussed with emphasis on the P toxicity mediated by short-chain polyPhosphates. Opportunities and hurdles of P bioremoval via P uptake from waste streams with microalgal cultures, either suspended or immobilized, is discussed along with the role of bacterial components of microalgal-bacterial consortia in these processes. Possible avenues of P-rich microalgal biomass such as biofertilizer production or extraction of valuable polyPhosphates and other bioproducts are considered. The review concludes with a comprehensive assessment of the current potential of microalgal biotechnology for ensuring the sustainable usage of phosphorus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad3196ed428f74d872dcdafc3c3eeb72d150475a7d4ba029bc13a47287a52534","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
