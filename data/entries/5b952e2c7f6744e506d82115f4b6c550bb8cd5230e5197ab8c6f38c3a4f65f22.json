{"title":"$2^m - 1$ as the Integer Formulation to Govern the Dynamics of Collatz-Type Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0961/v1","date":1720693695000,"content":"It is discovered that writing an odd integer as $2^m - 1$ for $m \\geq 1$ helps in understanding the dynamics of the Collatz-type sequences. Starting with the original Collatz sequence $3n + 1$, it is found that when the odd step is applied to an odd integer $2^m - 1$, an even integer $2^{m+1} + 2^m - 2$ is obtained, which is exactly once divisible by 2. This implies that the sequence alternates between odd and even steps $m$ times. This governs the dynamics of the Collatz-type sequences because: (i) for the sequence to diverge to infinity, $m$ must be infinite, and (ii) the value of $m$ determines the number of times the integer can be divided by 2 in each even step. This formulation allows construction of odd integers like $\\sum 2^m - 1$ to follow specific patterns of odd and even steps. Applying this understanding to the modified Collatz sequence $5n + 1$ reveals that for $m = 3$, the integer $2^{m + 1} + 2^m - 1$ is obtained, indicating that any integer formulation ending with $2^3 - 1$ in $5n + 1$ will diverge to infinity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b952e2c7f6744e506d82115f4b6c550bb8cd5230e5197ab8c6f38c3a4f65f22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
