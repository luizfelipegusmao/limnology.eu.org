{"title":"Experimental Evaluation of Mechanical Compression Properties of Aluminum Alloy Lattice Trusses for Anti-ice System Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1546/v1","date":1713884307000,"content":"Lattice structures have emerged as promising materials for aerospace structures applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratios, customizable properties, and efficient use of materials. These properties make them at-tractive for use in anti-ice systems, where lightweight and heat exchanging are essential. This paper presents an extensive experimental investigation into mechanical compression properties of lattice trusses fabricated from AlSi10Mg powder alloy, a material commonly used in casted aerospace parts. The truss structures were manufactured using additive manufacturing Selective Laser Melting technique and subjected to uniaxial compressive loading to assess their performance. The results demonstrate that AlSi10Mg lattice trusses exhibit remarkable compressive strength with strong correlations depending upon both topology and cellsâ€™ parameters setup. The finding described highlights the potential of AlSi10Mg alloy as a promising material for custom truss fabrication, offering customizable cost-effective and lightweight solutions for aerospace market. The paper also emphasizes the role of additive manufacturing in producing complex structures with pointwise tailored mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8c62282e601b0cc725f4d63be7f63cf8865dd096e52472a073e34a1c8b4886b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
