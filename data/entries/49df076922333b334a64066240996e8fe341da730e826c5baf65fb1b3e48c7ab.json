{"title":"Honoring the Life, Work, and Impact of Lena Fitting Kourkoutis: Discovering New Biology with Cryo-Electron Tomography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1063/7720379?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Lena Fitting Kourkoutis was most influential in my career. Lena was creative, bold, incredibly intelligent, witty, and generous with her time. Lena was also inspirational both in her science, humility, and ability to take things in stride. When she came to Martinsried to focus on biological materials, Lena decided to work on a problem that was dear to my heart, because it was a central focus of the lab of Klaus Schulten (UIUC), my PhD mentor. Lena wanted to work at the behest of Klaus and Juergen Plitzko (MPI Biochemistry), on purple bacteria. Plants and some bacteria convert solar into chemical energy which sustains all life on earth. Compared to plants, the primitive purple bacteria have a simplified system for photosynthesis, focused on a spherical vesicle, the chromatophore, of ∼60 nm in diameter than contains proteins essential for harvesting photons and converting energy into molecules that support life [<a href=\"#ozae044.1063-B1\">1-6</a>]. Both Klaus and Lena left us when they were inspirational to many and had a vision to transform their fields, and they are dearly missed by their communities. A focus area in my lab is bacterial cell biology. I will speak about the breakthrough of in-cell cryo-EM to discover novel biology, hoping to honor Lena’s legacy in this area.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"49df076922333b334a64066240996e8fe341da730e826c5baf65fb1b3e48c7ab","category":"Environment"}
