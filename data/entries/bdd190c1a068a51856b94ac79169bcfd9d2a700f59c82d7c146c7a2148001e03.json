{"title":"Impact of Yoga on Social Intelligence and Academic Performance of Business Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1773/v1","date":1727147090000,"content":"This research investigates the influence of yoga on social intelligence and academic performance of business students. Employing a randomised controlled experiment with Executive MBA participants, the research explores the mediating role of mindfulness in these relationships. Results indicate that yoga positively influences social intelligence, decision-making skills as reflected in case study scores, and overall academic performance. Mindfulness is found to partially mediate these relationships, accounting for a significant portion of the observed effects. The study reveals that yoga directly contributes 43% to increased social intelligence, with improved mindfulness accounting for 57%. Similarly, yoga directly accounts for 46% of improved academic achievement, while enhanced mindfulness contributes 54%. These findings suggest that incorporating yoga into business education curricula could potentially enhance both the interpersonal capabilities and academic outcomes of students, preparing them more holistically for the challenges of the modern corporate world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdd190c1a068a51856b94ac79169bcfd9d2a700f59c82d7c146c7a2148001e03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
