{"title":"Female Mice Exposed to Pyriproxyfen Since Prepuberty Showed Reproductive Impairment During Sexual Maturity and Increased Fetal Death in Their Offspring","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24374?af=R","date":1729043194000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Pyriproxyfen (PPF) is an insecticide used in agriculture, which is approved for use in drinking water tanks for human consumption. However, some studies indicate that it may act as an endocrine disruptor and affect nontarget organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PPF on reproduction and general health status in female mice exposed from pre-puberty to adulthood. In the first experiment, females were treated by gavage from postnatal day (PND) 23 to (PND) 75 and were distributed into three experimental groups: control (vehicle), PPF 0.1 mg/kg, and PPF 1 mg/kg. Female mice were assessed for the age of puberty onset, body mass, water and food consumption, and the estrous cycle. On PDN 75, a subgroup was euthanized, when vital and reproductive organs were collected and weighed. The thyroid, ovary, and uterus were evaluated for histomorphometry. The other subgroup was assessed in relation to reproductive performance and fetal parameters. In a second experiment, the uterotrophic assay was performed with juvenile females (PND 18) using doses of 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg of PPF. PPF treatment reduced thyroid mass and increased liver mass. Furthermore, there was an increase in ovarian interstitial tissue and, in the uterus, a decrease in the thickness of the endometrial stroma with reduced content of collagen fibers. There was also a reduction of 30% in pregnancy rate in the treated groups and an increase in the frequency of fetal death. This study suggests that, based on this experimental model, the insecticide may pose a reproductive risk for females chronically exposed to the substance from the pre-pubertal period until adulthood. These results raise concerns about prolonged exposure of women to the same compound.</p>","author":"Alice Santos da Silva, \nTainara Fernandes de Mello, \nHenrique Frederico Enz Fagá, \nJennyfer Karen Knorst, \nFátima Regina Mena Barreto Silva, \nGabriel Adan Araújo Leite","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"8547002a8751497b2e9a852035fee7dd588558dac2c5df88c98e91f772382492","category":"Environment"}
