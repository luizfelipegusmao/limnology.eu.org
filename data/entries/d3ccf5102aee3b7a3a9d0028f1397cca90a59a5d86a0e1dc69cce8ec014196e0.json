We examined the mediating role of dimensions of caregiver engagement in the association of caregiver psychological distress with children’s academic and socioemotional outcomes in Ghana. Data came from 4,714 children (aged 5–17 years) and their caregivers in five regions of northern Ghana. Caregiver psychological distress and engagement (i.e., engagement in education, emotional supportiveness, and parenting self-efficacy) were self-reported by children’s primary caregiver. Children’s academic (literacy and numeracy) and socioemotional (prosocial skills and socioemotional difficulties) outcomes were directly assessed using validated measures. Structural equation modelling was used to estimate mediation models. We tested moderation by caregiver exposure to formal education, child’s age, and child’s sex. Fourteen percent of caregivers experienced elevated psychological distress. Higher levels of psychological distress were associated with children’s poorer literacy and numeracy skills, and higher socioemotional difficulties, but not prosocial skills. The mediating role of caregiver engagement varied by caregiver exposure to formal education but not child’s age or sex. Caregiver engagement in education explained the association between psychological distress and children’s literacy skills (but not numeracy or socioemotional) in families where the caregiver had no formal education (indirect effect: <i>β</i> = 0.007 [95% CI: 0.000, 0.016]), explaining 23% of the association. No mediator explained the association of psychological distress with child outcomes among families where the caregiver had some formal education. The mechanisms through which caregiver psychological distress is associated with child outcomes in rural Ghana differ as a function of caregivers’ exposure to formal education. These results highlight the importance of developing multi-component and culturally-sensitive programs to improve child outcomes. Further research in similar contexts is needed to advance scientific understanding on how to effectively promote child and family wellbeing.","author":"Marilyn N.
