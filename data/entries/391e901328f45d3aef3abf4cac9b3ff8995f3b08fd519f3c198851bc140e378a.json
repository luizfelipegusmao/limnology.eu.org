Retrieved a total of 200 articles. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.</p> Results <p>The study included a total of 8 trials and involved 756 KOA patients. The results indicated that compared to the control group, Yoga exercise showed significant improvements in alleviating pain (SMD = -0.92; 95% CI = -1.64 ~ - 0.20; <i>P</i> = 0.01, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 94%), stiffness (SMD = -0.51; 95% CI = -0.91 ~ -0.12; <i>P</i> = 0.01; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 66%) and physical function (SMD = -0.53; 95% CI = -0.89 ~ -0.17; <i>P</i> = 0.004; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 59%) among KOA patients. However, there was no significant improvement observed in terms of activities of activity of daily living (ADL) (SMD = 1.03; 95% CI = -0.01 ~ 2.07; <i>P</i> = 0.05; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 84%), and quality of life (QOL) (SMD = 0.21; 95% CI = -0.33 ~ 0.74; <i>P</i> = 0.44; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 83%) with the practice of Yoga.</p> Conclusions <p>In general, Yoga has been found to be effective in reducing pain and stiffness in KOA patients, it can also improve the physical function of patients. However, there is limited evidence to suggest significant improvements in terms of ADL and QOL.</p>","author":"Junyue Lu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"391e901328f45d3aef3abf4cac9b3ff8995f3b08fd519f3c198851bc140e378a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
