We aimed to compare the nutritional risk index (NRI) in adult CF patients receiving modulator (MT) or only non-modulator (conventional) therapies (non-MT). \nMethods: A single-center prospective cohort study was conducted between June-December 2023. The NRI based on weight gain and albumin was calculated at beginning and end of a 12 weeks period in both groups. This design was pragmatic, since based on individual patient access to MT for 12 weeks. \nResults: 107 patients were included [mean (SD) age: 23.85 (4.98) years, 54.7% male, 46.7% MT]. In the MT group, mean (SD) weight (kg) and albumin (g/dL) increased significantly [changes: +3.09 (2.74) and +0.17 (0.37); p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ce14132322e2526b013b8b0d33a52b478c57bd101c9afa04740c780868b596e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
