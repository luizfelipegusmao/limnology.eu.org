To deliver this type of therapy, electronics ranging from electrodes and leads to power and recording modules may be implanted subcutaneously connecting to the muscle and/or nerves. Some system architectures utilize peripheral nerve cuff electrodes that also rely on connection to an external stimulator requiring percutaneous leads to cross through the dermis [<a href=\"#ozae044.294-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.294-B3\">3</a>].
