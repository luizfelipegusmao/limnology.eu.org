{"title":"Induction and Characteristics of Medicinal Plant Tussilago farfara L. in Callus Culture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1850/v1","date":1727146902000,"content":"Tussilago farfara L. is a traditional medicinal plant valued for its potentially health-promoting metabolites. Its herbal raw material has been recognized and used since ancient times and continues to be widely used in traditional medicine. Introducing these plants to in vitro cultivation is a challenging task, but once the protocol is developed, such cultures can provide an abundant and inexhaustible source of plant material. In this study, we report the successful induction and growth of vigorous T. farfara L. callus in vitro. Callus induction was achieved on solid media in darkness, whereas it appeared inefficient under light conditions and in suspension culture. We present a detailed description of callus growth kinetics, morphological analysis, photosynthetic activity and biochemical parameters (including protein content and photosynthetic pigments) supported by histological studies. Furthermore, we observed potential for organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. This method for in vitro propagation of T. farfara, along with callus culture maintenance, offers a wide range of applications in pharmacy and could benefit the environment by minimizing the depletion of natural populations of this species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de20ccc325db8dcab92bbea9a9e0d64e870099ff2b1b5e16841f987c469730d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
