{"title":"Karyotype Analysis of Diploid and Autotetraploid of Eight Tartary Buckwheat Cultivars in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2453/v1","date":1727806073000,"content":"The diploid and autotetraploid of the eight tartary buckwheat cultivars were used to make a karyotype study by the conventional squash method to establish a reference for polyploid breeding. In this study, the eight cultivars exhibited similar karyotypic features between diploids and autotetraploids. The chromosome number in diploids was found to be 2n=2x=16, while 2n=4x=32 in autotetraploids. T6, T9, T18, T22, T27 and T36 possessed one pair of SAT chromosomes, whereas T25 and T39 had two pairs of SAT chromosomes. Compared with diploids, the total number of chromosomes and SAT chromosomes doubled in autotetraploids. However, the karyotype of autotetraploids remained unchanged in all cases which belonged to the 2A type. The karyotype of the same crop with different ploidy in diploid and autotetraploid buckwheat is the same. These eight cultivars' karyotype and chromosome number of autotetraploids are reported for the first time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7df2b08f4288dd37bc1a88b0f9b640dfaafbdec849eca0086c91453ec8fa47e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
