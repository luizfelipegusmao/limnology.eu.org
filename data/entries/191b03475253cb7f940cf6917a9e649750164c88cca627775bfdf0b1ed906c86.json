{"title":"Quantification of caffeine in coffee cans using electrochemical measurements, machine learning, and boron-doped diamond electrodes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298331","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Tatsuya Honda, Kenshin Takemura, Susumu Matsumae, Nobutomo Morita, Wataru Iwasaki, Ryoji Arita, Suguru Ueda, Yeoh Wen Liang, Osamu Fukuda, Kazuya Kikunaga, Shinya Ohmagari</p>\r\n\r\nElectrochemical measurements, which exhibit high accuracy and sensitivity under low contamination, controlled electrolyte concentration, and pH conditions, have been used in determining various compounds. The electrochemical quantification capability decreases with an increase in the complexity of the measurement object. Therefore, solvent pretreatment and electrolyte addition are crucial in performing electrochemical measurements of specific compounds directly from beverages owing to the poor measurement quality caused by unspecified noise signals from foreign substances and unstable electrolyte concentrations. To prevent such signal disturbances from affecting quantitative analysis, spectral data of voltage-current values from electrochemical measurements must be used for principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, this method enables highly accurate quantification even though numerical data alone are challenging to analyze. This study utilized boron-doped diamond (BDD) single-chip electrochemical detection to quantify caffeine content in commercial beverages without dilution. By applying PCA, we integrated electrochemical signals with known caffeine contents and subsequently utilized principal component regression to predict the caffeine content in unknown beverages. Consequently, we addressed existing research problems, such as the high quantification cost and the long measurement time required to obtain results after quantification. The average prediction accuracy was 93.8% compared to the actual content values. Electrochemical measurements are helpful in medical care and indirectly support our lives.","author":"Tatsuya Honda","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"191b03475253cb7f940cf6917a9e649750164c88cca627775bfdf0b1ed906c86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
