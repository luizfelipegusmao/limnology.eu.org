{"title":"Antibiotic Resistance in Acetic Acid Bacteria Originating from Vinegar","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2116/v1","date":1717141467000,"content":"Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are major contributors to the production of fermented vinegar, offering various cultural, culinary, and health benefits. Although the residual unpasteurized AAB after vinegar production are not pathogens, these are necessary the safety evaluations including antibiotic resistance for the use as starters. In this research, we investigated the antibiotics resistance profiles of 26 AAB strains, including various species of Komagataeibacter and Acetobacter, against ten different antibiotics using the E-test method. All strains exhibited resistance to aztreonam and clindamycin. Komagataeibacter species demonstrated a 50% resistance rate to ciprofloxacin, analogous to Acetobacter species, but showed twice the resistance rates to chloramphenicol and erythromycin. Genomic analysis of K. saccharivorans CV1 identified intrinsic resistance mechanisms, such as multidrug efflux pumps, thereby enhancing our understanding of antibiotic resistance in acetic acid-producing bacteria. These findings enhance understanding of antibiotic resistance in AAB for food safety and new antimicrobial strategies, suggesting the need for standardized testing methods and molecular genetic study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab894bc986df3937bfdba67c015b6a259e7ed3c0419938775ffd02ac0919087a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
