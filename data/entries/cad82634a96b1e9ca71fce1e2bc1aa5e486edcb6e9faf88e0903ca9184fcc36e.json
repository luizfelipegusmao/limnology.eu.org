{"title":"Effect of fibers on starch structural changes during hydrothermal treatment: multiscale analyses, and evaluation of dilution effects on starch digestibility","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13401?af=R","date":1709358588000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Dietary fibers (DFs) may influence the structural, nutritional and techno-functional properties of starch within food systems. Moreover, DFs have favorable effects on the digestive system and potentially a lower glycemic index. These potential benefits may change depending on DF type. Starch processed in the presence of soluble and insoluble fibers can undergo different structural and functional changes, and the present study investigated the effects of short-chain and long-chain inulin and cellulose on the structural and digestive properties of wheat starch.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The combined use of differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) provided insights into the structural changes in starch and inulin at different levels. Short-chain and long-chain inulin had higher water retention capacity and a potential to limit starch gelatinization. The FTIR results revealed an interaction between starch and inulin. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed morphological changes in starch and inulin after the hydrothermal treatment. Cellulose fiber was not affected by the hydrothermal treatment and had no influence on starch behavior. The structural differences observed through XRD, FTIR and scanning electron microscopy analyses between starch with and without inulin fibers did not significantly impact starch digestibility, except for the dilution effect caused by adding DFs.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study highlights the importance of utilizing different analytical tools to assess changes in food samples at different scales. Although short-chain and long-chain inulin could potentially limit starch gelatinization, the duration of the heat treatment (90 °C for 10 min) was sufficient to ensure complete starch gelatinization. The dilution effect caused by adding fibers was the primary reason for the effect on starch digestibility. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Özge Güven, \nİlkay Şensoy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"cad82634a96b1e9ca71fce1e2bc1aa5e486edcb6e9faf88e0903ca9184fcc36e","category":"Environment"}
