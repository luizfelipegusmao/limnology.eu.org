{"title":"Identification of hydrodynamic changes in rivers by means of freshwater mussels' behavioural response: An experimental investigation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2544?af=R","date":1680162461000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present work concerns the interaction between hydraulic processes and biological communities in rivers. In particular, the aim of this study is to investigate the interactions between flow dynamics and the freshwater mussels (FMs) to verify if the mussels' behavioural response to the hydrodynamic stress could be used to monitor natural extreme events in rivers. Although the influence of mussels on the kinematic characteristics of flow at the water–sediment interface was investigated by a certain number of studies, their behavioural response to flow, both in static and dynamic conditions, remains understudied. Laboratory experiments were performed in an artificial flume exposing <i>Unio elongatulus</i> to different values of flow discharge, both in steady and in unsteady conditions either with or without sediment transport. Mussels' behavioural responses were detected by using Hall sensor technology to measure gaping frequency, amplitude and duration, both in static conditions and under the effect of hydrodynamic stresses. Five categories of behavioural response were identified: Normal Activity (NA), Resting (Re), Transition (Tr), Adaptation (Ad) and Avoidance (Av). During NA (standard feeding and moving), FMs presented valve gaping, while during Re valves were kept constantly opened for water filtration. After a variation of flow discharge (ΔQ), FMs promptly reacted showing a transition from their normal behaviour, with constant gaping frequency (below 0.01 Hz), to higher valve gaping frequencies. The mean valves' gaping frequency increased as a function of ΔQ, and the highest values were reached in the presence of sediment transport. The mean valve opening amplitude was less sensitive to ΔQ. Its range of variation was very narrow with the highest values corresponding to the protrusion/retraction of the animals' foot to move or anchor to the substrate. The percentage of mussels responding to the discharge variation (Transition behaviour) increases with ΔQ confirming that mussels' behavioural response represents a promising tool for monitoring the occurrence of hydrodynamic stressors in fluvial systems.</p>","author":"Donatella Termini, \nNina Benistati, \nLuca Tosato, \nAshkan Pilbala, \nVanessa Modesto, \nLuigi Fraccarollo, \nDario Manca, \nTommaso Moramarco, \nNicoletta Riccardi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"adb7f9e05773538ee30b74242cca4136d9bb54fe723c750313059ddc69a5fac4","category":"Environment"}
