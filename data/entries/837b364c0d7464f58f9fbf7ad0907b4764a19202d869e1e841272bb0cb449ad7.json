{"title":"Peptidergic GPCRs Signaling Systems and Cancer: Into New Pharmacological Approaches.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1648/v1","date":1727078502000,"content":"Peptidergic GPCR systems are broadly distributed in the human body and regulate numerous physiological processes by activating complex networks of intracellular biochemical events responsible for cell regulation and survival. Their failure due to overaction, ill-function, or blockade gives rise to cell disturbances, eventually causing disease if compensatory mechanisms do not suffice. Revision of updated experimental research provided an evident relationship associating peptidergic GPCR malfunction with tumor formation and maintenance resulting from uncontrolled cell proliferation and migration, colonization, inhibition of apoptosis or altered metabolism, and increased angiogenesis in tumoral tissues. Determination of the implication of GPCR peptide signaling in specific neoplasia is crucial to designing tailored pharmacological treatments to counteract or dismantle the origin of the signaling circuitry causing cellular disruption. In some cases, particular ligands for these receptors may serve as concomitant treatments to aid other pharmacological or physical approaches to eradicate neoplasias.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"837b364c0d7464f58f9fbf7ad0907b4764a19202d869e1e841272bb0cb449ad7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
