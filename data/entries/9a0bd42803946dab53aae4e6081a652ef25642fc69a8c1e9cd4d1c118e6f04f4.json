{"title":"Long-Term Oritavancin Therapy for Shoulder Prosthetic Joint Infection: A Case Guided by Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0769/v1","date":1720605563000,"content":"Oritavancin is a novel long-acting lipoglycopeptide with in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant (MR) Gram-positive pathogens and a good bactericidal activity even in presence of biofilm forming bacteria. It has been approved for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), but recent reports have demonstrated possible off-label uses, as for prosthetic joint infections (PJI), which, in more than half of cases, are caused by MR Gram positive organisms.\nWe reported a case of a man in his eighties with a late shoulder PJI caused by methicillin resistant Staphyloccus epidermidis (MRSE) with contraindications for surgical replacement and few oral therapeutic options for a long term suppressive antibiotic therapy. The prosthesis was retained, and the patient received ten outpatient sequential doses of 1200 mg of oritavancin during 28 weeks, based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as a guide for correct timing of administration of each dose. During oritavancin administration, the patient achieved clinical cure, with disappearance of the pain and regaining pre-infection joint mobility, with no side effects reported and no further surgery or hospitalization needed. The treatment is ongoing as a long-lasting suppressive antimicrobial therapy. Oritavancin could represent an excellent solution for treating PJI caused by MR organism, especially in patients who need a long-term suppressive therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a0bd42803946dab53aae4e6081a652ef25642fc69a8c1e9cd4d1c118e6f04f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
