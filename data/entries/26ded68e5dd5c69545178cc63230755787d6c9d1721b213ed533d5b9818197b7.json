{"title":"It takes two to tango: Plant hosts influence bacterial effector function through post-translational modifications","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2051/7614653?rss=1","date":1708992000000,"content":"<span>Many bacterial phytopathogens secrete virulence proteins (often termed effectors) directly into plant cells to aid in infecting and colonizing host tissues (<a href=\"#koae059-B2\">Cunnac et al. 2011</a>). While certain effectors have well-established virulence functions inside of the plant cell—typically involving interference with host immune mechanisms—we have a paler understanding of how the host might influence effector activities. After all, eukaryotic cells are wired with organelles and biological processes that prokaryotes do not possess. However, prokaryotic pathogens, despite lacking these cellular mechanisms, display an intriguing ability to leverage and exploit eukaryotic features during infection. Thus, it is exciting to consider how coevolution has driven prokaryotic pathogens to integrate eukaryotic tools into their infection strategy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"26ded68e5dd5c69545178cc63230755787d6c9d1721b213ed533d5b9818197b7","category":"Environment"}
