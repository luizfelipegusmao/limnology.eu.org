{"title":"Diversification over deep and shallow temporal scales in the Holarctic genus Perpolita (Gastropoda: Gastrodontidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae078/7702067?rss=1","date":1719792000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Holarctic land snail genus <span>Perpolita</span> was used to explore the influence of past and current biogeography on diversification. The number of empirically-supported species was determined using a consensus between mtDNA sequence, nDNA sequence, conchology, and geographic and ecological range with five valid temperate-boreal species (<span>Perpolita binneyana</span>, <span>Perpolita electrina</span>, <span>Perpolita hammonis</span>, <span>Perpolita petronella</span>, and <span>Perpolita radiatella</span>) being recognized. Only <span>P. petronella</span> was unchanged in both nomenclature and diagnostic characteristics with the remainder requiring alterations. Perhaps the most important of these was elevation of <span>P. radiatella</span> to a valid species, with its populations having been previously lumped either under European <span>P. hammonis</span> or North American <span>P. electrina</span>. Divergence times of 18.7–10.0 Mya were suggested through genome-wide SNPs in combination with the fossil record, indicating a pre-Pleistocene origin for all <span>Perpolita</span> species. Using genetically-confirmed diagnostic shell characters, we accumulated &gt; 2000 valid occurrences and used these to estimate appropriate modern and Last Glacial Maximum climate extents for all species. These models suggest that modern intra-specific gene pool diversity may generally reflect Pleistocene palaeoclimatology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"026596f0deb45580e6e13359bdf428b254b7074951cbc1eec8e72006b312575f","category":"Environment"}
