The LSPR absorption in metal phosphides, e.g., Cu<sub>3-x</sub>P, is derived from delocalized holes [<a href=\"#ozae044.681-B5\">5</a>]. These holes in Cu<sub>3-x</sub>P arise to compensate for copper vacancies, resulting in LSPR absorption in the near-IR that provides the potential to be exploited for ultrafast optical switching, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, and plasmon-enhanced chemical conversion. However, it is unfeasible to establish direct structure-property relationships due to the poor spatial resolution of most bulk-scale spectroscopy techniques, such as UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. This limits our understanding of the material system and further synthesis optimization, consequently resulting in the failure to realize the full potential of these nanoplasmonic materials. Therefore, to understand the direct impact of morphology and composition on LSPR, it is imperative to employ nanoscale techniques that allow for the characterization of morphology and composition while simultaneously enabling us to visualize individual LSPR modes. Such nanoscale measurements can be realized by state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). STEM-EELS allows directly measuring the plasmonic response with sub-Ã… spatial and &lt; 10 meV energy resolution. The low-loss EELS regime can measure the plasmonic response, whereas the simultaneous atomic-resolution imaging and core-loss EELS can accurately characterize the structure and composition of the nanocrystals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d882611c0ffba6aff211ae2d326b8d86349b26f74cccc4f4b11c66d0e0431d24","category":"Environment"}
