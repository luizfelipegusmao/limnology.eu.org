{"title":"Archaeal Lipid Vesicles as Immune Modulators, Adjuvants and Vaccine Carriers: A Review of the Past and Current Trends.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1716/v1","date":1711615629000,"content":"Abstract: Lipidic carriers employed for the entrapment, encapsulation and precise targeting the bioactive compounds offer significant advantages to the biomedical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries. These lipid and phospholipid-based vesicles can improve the solubility, permeation, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of the encapsulated material. As a matter of fact, nano-sized phospholipid vesicles have attained the highest success rate in commercialization among the available drug encapsulation technologies. Nevertheless, developing industrially acceptable products still remains a challenge. Among the main disadvantages of conventional lipidic carriers are their instability in the biological environments, and their sensitivity to changes in the pH, temperature and enzymes. To overcome these problems, the new generation of phospho/lipid-based carrier systems was developed using ingredients from microorganisms living in extremely harsh environments (i.e., archeaeobacteria). The present entry aims to review unique features of archaeolipids and recent developments in their application for the encapsulation of genetic material as well as their role and function as adjuvants and vaccine candidates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a870ed18167ef657d3b5baa88027c7a142c493300a2bcb52d21e7b364bac3ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
