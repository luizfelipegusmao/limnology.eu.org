{"title":"The Role of Social Entrepreneurship in Addressing Climate Change","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0582/v1","date":1723099180000,"content":"This research aimed at examining how social enterprises mitigate climate change in Ghana, examining their strategies, impacts on the environment that affect climate change, and barriers. The research adopted a cross-sectional survey design, descriptive and involved 185 social enterprises. Questionnaires were administered online and data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The findings revealed that the most used strategies include the development of new funding structures and advocacy for sustainable farming. It also highlights numerous environmental concerns such as the judicious use of hazardous materials and pollution. Nevertheless, results from regression analysis showed that the relationship between the number of social entrepreneurship activities and the impact on the environment is relatively low and the role of other factors may be more significant. Some of the main barriers that were found include competition from large organizations, cultural perspectives towards climate change, policy instability and lack of adequate technical education. Accordingly, the recommendations proposed are developing specialized funding programs for climate-focused social enterprises; climate change education and awareness campaigns; and capacity building to upgrade technical competencies in clean technologies and climate resilience design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9194536bca182e76966b9e94641b04d83194c19532f616dd9e585bd77d6dcd58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
