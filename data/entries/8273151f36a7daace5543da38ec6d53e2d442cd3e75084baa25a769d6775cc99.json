{"title":"Finite Element Analysis of the Upsurge of Bifurcation during the Thinning Process of Large Semiconductor Wafers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0639/v1","date":1710161470000,"content":"During the thinning process, in the semiconductor industry, residual stress from thin films can cause severe warpage in wafers, which can compromise their processability and packaging. This warpage can lead to bifurcation or buckling, making it important to understand this phenomenon for the manufacturing of large semiconductor wafers. We conducted a finite element analysis of the thinning process using ANSYS mechanical enterprise 2023/R2 to investigate the asymmetric curvatures resulting from bifurcation in a standard 300 mm Si (001) wafer. We induced an asymmetry in the system by applying a slight force on a point of the circumferential region perpendicularly to the substrate. We also simulated the compressive stress from the damaged layer formed during the thinning process and considered its influence on warpage and bifurcation in both linear and non-linear cases. We also included the influence of Earth's gravity induced deflection (GID) and investigated the influence of the compressive stress damaged layer on the grinding process of the whole wafer by adding a metal front layer to the ground back damaged wafer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8273151f36a7daace5543da38ec6d53e2d442cd3e75084baa25a769d6775cc99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
