Incorporating the NMS-E into clinical practice could significantly enhance the management of endometriosis by addressing current diagnostic limitations and guiding surgical planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d48d7cb3de1ad7ad93d01649df7199d55687b847b8a8f71bb2016e21a236cbc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
