{"title":"Non-Extensive Statistical Analysis of Seismicity in the West Coastline of Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0076/v1","date":1714546766000,"content":"Mexico is a well-known seismically active country, which is primarily affected by several tectonic plate interactions along the southern Pacific coastline and by active structures in the Gulf of Baja California. In this paper we investigate this seismicity in the context of a non-extensive statistical approach based on Tsallis entropy. The analysis is performed using data from the corrected Mexican seismic catalogue provided by the National Seismic Service, spanning a period from January 2000 to October 2023. The Gutenberg-Richter law fitting to the earthquake sub-catalogues for all six regions studied indicates magnitudes of completeness between 3.30 and 3.76. All six regions display values of the entropic index in the range 1.52≲q≲1.61, which are lower than the previously estimated range 1.54≲q≲1.70 using catalogue data from 1988 to 2010. The cause of this discrepancy is certainly due to the use of modern recording devices, which are sensitive enough to detect a larger number of low-magnitude events compared to older instrumentation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf218933d02ceb96181a99f25507a65ad0d551da98d363552c5c5188b77fc6ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
