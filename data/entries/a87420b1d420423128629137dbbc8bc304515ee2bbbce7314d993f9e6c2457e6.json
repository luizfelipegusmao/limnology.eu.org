{"title":"Declining Bank Erosion Rate Related to Climate‐Change Driven Hydrological Alteration of a Small Sub‐Alpine River","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1134/v1","date":1718614258000,"content":"In the 21st century, climate change and its consequences are getting more serious. The changes in temperature and precipitation alter the run-off conditions, subsequently influencing the channel processes of rivers. The study aims to analyse the hydrological changes of a small, sub-alpine river (Rába River, Central Europe) and the bank erosional processes since the 1950s. The bank erosion was determined based on topographical maps, aerial photographs, and RTK–GPS surveys. Short (2–3 days) floods were common between 1950–1980, and low stages occurred in 65–81% of a year. However, in the 21st century, extreme regimes developed, as record-high, flashy floods alter with long low stages (91–96% of a year). The bank erosion shows a cyclic temporal pattern, gradually increasing until it reaches a high value (4.1–4.9 m/y), followed by a limited erosional rate (2.2–2.8 m/y). However, the magnitude of the bank erosion is decreasing. It could be explained by (1) the lower transport capacity of the more common low stages and (2) the seasonal shift of the flood waves, appearing in the vegetational period when the riparian vegetation can more effectively protect the banks from erosion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a87420b1d420423128629137dbbc8bc304515ee2bbbce7314d993f9e6c2457e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
