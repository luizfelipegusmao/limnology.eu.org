{"title":"Low Bone Mineral Density and Bone Metastases &ndash; a Two-Way Street","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0702/v1","date":1728549917000,"content":"Background: Bone metastases (BM) have a detrimental effect on survival for patients with solid cancers. Materials and methods: This systematic review respected the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: When investigating OP as a risk factor for BM development, for breast cancer patients, some articles do not differentiate between intrinsic breast cancer subtypes. BMD does not seem to contribute in a significant manner when investigating Luminal A breast cancer. While researching breast cancer regardless of intrinsic subtype, untreated OP increases the risk of bone metastasis when compared to no OP group or treated OP group. In urological cancer cases, OP seems to predispose the patients to BM, especially early after diagnosis. Investigating risk factors for OP development in cancer patients resulted in the identification of 32 articles. Most articles identified risk factors for osteoporosis development in the context of breast cancer patients. Other commonly investigated solid cancers were prostate, other urological cancers, gynecological malignancies, and other less common subtypes of solid tumors. Discussion: While investigating OP as a risk factor for BM, it becomes clear that there is a high grade of heterogeneity in the behavior of each type of cancer in its dynamic concerning bone metastasis, and thus, OP might have different behaviors as a risk factor depending on the situation. Conclusion: There is a need for data regarding cancer subtypes that have not been explored concerning their interaction with the skeletal system in a low bone mineral density scenario.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"514e55468f735c2fa2bf538efe90297bc0a8a6793e979c129774c5e1ec4bdfb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
