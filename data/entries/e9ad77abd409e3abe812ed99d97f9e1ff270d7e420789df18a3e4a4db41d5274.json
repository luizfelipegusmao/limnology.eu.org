Extracellular vesicles called exosomes are primarily used as mediators of intercellular signal transmission to control tumor metastasis. Visfatin is an adipokine reported to enhance tumor metastasis, but its relationship with exosome generation in chondrosarcoma motility remains undetermined. Our results found that overexpressing visfatin augments the production of exosomes from chondrosarcoma cells. Visfatin-treated chondrosarcoma exosomes educate macrophage polarization towards the M2 but not M1 phenotype. Interestingly, M2 macrophages polarized by exosomes return to chondrosarcoma cells to facilitate cell motility. According to these findings, chondrosarcoma cells emit more exosomes when treated with visfatin. The stimulation of exosome generation by visfatin polarizes M2 macrophages and enhances the motility of chondrosarcoma.</p>","author":"Chang‐Yu Song, \nChih‐Ying Wu, \nChih‐Yang Lin, \nChun‐Hao Tsai, \nHsien‐Te Chen, \nYi‐Chin Fong, \nLi‐Chai Chen, \nChih‐Hsin Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"e9ad77abd409e3abe812ed99d97f9e1ff270d7e420789df18a3e4a4db41d5274","category":"Environment"}
