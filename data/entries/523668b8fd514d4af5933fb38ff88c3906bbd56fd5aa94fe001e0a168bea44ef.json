{"title":"Cognitive stimulation in activities of daily living for individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia (CS-ADL): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309337","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Simone M. Ryan, Orla Brady</p>\r\nBackground <p>Multi-component CS programs incorporating practice of activities of daily living (ADL) into intervention have reported benefits for ADL outcomes in individuals living with mild-to-moderate dementia. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) within community occupational therapy services in Ireland, is planned to evaluate the effects of CS-ADL, an ADL-focused, multi-component CS program, on ADL outcomes for individuals living with mild-to-moderate dementia.</p> Method <p>A single-blind RCT with a calculated sample size of 34 participants has been planned to compare the effects of CS-ADL versus treatment as usual on the outcomes of basic ADLs and instrumental ADLs. Cognition, mood, communication, and quality of life will also be evaluated as secondary outcomes. CS-ADL sessions will run once weekly for a total of seven weeks, lasting approximately two hours each. Outcome data will be collected at baseline, within sessions and post-intervention at week eight. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the data. This study has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06147479).</p> Discussion <p>CS programs are commonly conducted by occupational therapists working with individuals living with mild-to-moderate dementia. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-component CS program delivered through an occupational therapy lens, potentially influencing the approach to CS and ADL interventions undertaken by occupational therapists.</p>","author":"Simone M.
