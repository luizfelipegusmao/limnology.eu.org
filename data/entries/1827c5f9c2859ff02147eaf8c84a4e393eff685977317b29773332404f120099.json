We determined the occupancy and habitat use of the Arizona toad throughout its range. We surveyed 500-m reaches along perennial and intermittent streams during the summers of 2021 and 2022 (<i>n</i> = 232) in Arizona. We recorded the presence of all toad life stages, focusing on larval stages. We related toad occupancy to broadscale environmental variables, including measures of bioclimate, habitat heterogeneity, solar radiation, and topography. We collected fine-scale variables to summarize vegetation cover and substrate within plots (<i>n</i> = 53). We applied multiple occupancy models. Single-species model results found low toad occupancy with high detection. Two principal component analyses (PCA) were run on broadscale and fine-scale variables to reduce the number of variables included in the models. Toad occupancy was best predicted by top models with bioclimatic components; occupancy decreases with extremely hot temperatures and less precipitation. A logistic regression related toad presence to fine-scale components with top models describing riparian complexity and algae. Arizona toads were selected for areas with foliar canopy cover, shallow water, algae cover, and pebble substrates. Arizona toad is an uncommon species and maintaining riparian forests of complex habitats with shallow and side-channel flow will be important for toad conservation. Implications of less water cause riparian habitat to dry, which ultimately harms aquatic life.</p>","author":"Brett J. Montgomery, \nHeather L. Bateman, \nFábio S. D.
