{"title":"Drought-induced circular RNAs in maize roots: Separating signal from noise","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/352/7658820?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in diverse biological processes; however, their origin and functions, especially in plants, remain largely unclear. Here, we used 2 maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) inbred lines, as well as 14 of their derivative recombination inbred lines with different drought sensitivity, to systematically characterize 8,790 circRNAs in maize roots under well-watered (WW) and water-stress (WS) conditions. We found that a diverse set of circRNAs expressed at significantly higher levels under WS. Enhanced expression of circRNAs was associated with longer flanking introns and an enrichment of <span>long interspersed nuclear element</span> retrotransposable elements. The epigenetic marks found at the back-splicing junctions of circRNA-producing genes were markedly different from canonical splicing, characterized by increased levels of H3K36me3/H3K4me1, as well as decreased levels of H3K9Ac/H3K27Ac. We found that genes expressing circRNAs are subject to relaxed selection. The significant enrichment of trait-associated sites along their genic regions suggested that genes giving rise to circRNAs were associated with plant survival rate under drought stress, implying that circRNAs play roles in plant drought responses. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of circ<span>MED16</span>, one of the drought-responsive circRNAs, enhances drought tolerance in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Our results provide a framework for understanding the intricate interplay of epigenetic modifications and how they contribute to the fine-tuning of circRNA expression under drought stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"eed86c10f8c493c7f158e94fce71cc1e7cb1bf43290833456d02001ce822feb3","category":"Environment"}
