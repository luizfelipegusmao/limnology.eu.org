Traditional methods, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), often rely on the manual identification of atomic columns, especially in areas lacking long-range order, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, recent studies have explored the use of computer vision (CV) techniques to automate defect detection in atomic-resolution STEM and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images [<a href=\"#ozae044.180-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.180-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dd300b64f3fb9ca19177a091e31385e023ce5c133338b697fea66fc70435b7d6","category":"Environment"}
