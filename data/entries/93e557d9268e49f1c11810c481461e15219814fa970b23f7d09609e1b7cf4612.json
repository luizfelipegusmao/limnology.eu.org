{"title":"Towards Hydraulic Design Optimization of Shaft Hydropower Plants: A 3D-CFD Application Based on Physical Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0128/v1","date":1725289374000,"content":"The shaft hydropower plant (SHPP) is a novel hydraulic concept for low-head hydropower sites with several environmental and operational advantages over conventional layouts. However, the first two projects implementing this concept have shown comparatively high construction costs and project risks. Therefore, further optimization is required to the economic attractiveness and enabling broader market adoption. Initial model tests recommend a square-shaped shaft inlet with a three-sided approach flow for low-loss and fish-friendly inflow conditions. Yet, this design requires significant space for structural implementation and may be unsuitable for use with multiple shafts or as an extension of non-powered dams and weirs. This research paper presents the application of a computational fluid dynamics simulation setup to evaluate the hydraulic per-formance of various design configurations, especially, alternative design layouts with one-sided approach flow without further physical model tests,. The simulation setup is calibrated against observations including head loss and velocity measurements from the physical model tests, and its satisfactory performance enables the analysis of alternative design layouts. This aims to derive the most significant design parameters for achieving the desired hydraulic conditions at the intake. Increasing the flow depth before the intake and enlarging the inlet area have the most significant impact, while increasing the overflow of the front gate has the least significant effect.. The chosen CFD application is deemed suitable for hydraulic design optimization and provides guidance on the key parameters to focus on for tailored site-specific design development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93e557d9268e49f1c11810c481461e15219814fa970b23f7d09609e1b7cf4612","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
