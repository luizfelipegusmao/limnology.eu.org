{"title":"Coastal Vulnerability Assessment in the southern Valpara&iacute;so Region, Chile","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0567/v1","date":1710146640000,"content":"The coastal zone of the Valpara√≠so Region has been historically threatened by its natural and anthropogenic conditions, which demands efficient management for the adaptation and mitigation of the impacts that occur on the coast, especially in the face of the growing effects of climate change. As a contribution to decision makers in the development of strategic actions through adaptation plans, this study presents an approach to coastal vulnerability in the southern part of the region, applying the Coastal Vulnerability Index considering the variables geomorphology, coastal slope, changes in sea level, coastal erosion, tidal range, and wave height. The result illustrates a sectorization of the coast according to the degree of vulnerability, where the sectors formed by fine sandy beaches near river mouths and estuaries present greater risks to climatic events than those rocky stretches with medium-low cliffs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a2493bb025e43d3434b85121430999a0930603f4b7f8ad6d5ca188a88860b05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
