A total of 62,646 cases of pertussis worldwide were reported by WHO in 2022. This study aimed to obtain the pertussis seroprevalence and sociodemographic data in children aged 1–14 years and its association factors in the community based on Riskesdas 2013 and 2018. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was carried out on data from 12,753 children aged 1–14 years collected from Riskesdas 2013 and 2018 in Indonesia. Pertussis serology data was obtained based on the results of the ELISA examination which was categorized as seropositive if anti-pertussis toxin IgG ≥ 100 IU/mL or anti-pertussis IgG &gt; 11 NTU. Pertussis seropositive indicated recent pertussis infection if no pertussis vaccine was received within the last twelve months. Pertussis seroprevalence was found at 9.8% and 33.4% in Riskesdas 2013 and 2018 respectively. While 10.1% of children aged 5–14 years were found pertussis seropositive by excluding the possible effect of vaccination in the last twelve months in Riskesdas 2013. The most important associated factor in seropositive pertussis at ages 1–4 years and 5–14 years was a history of pneumonia in the last month (OR = 2.709, 95%CI: 2.592–2.831 in Riskesdas 2013 and OR = 2.421, 95%CI: 2.299–2.550 in Riskesdas 2018). In the adjusted analysis for respondents’ characteristics, low maternal education was the predictive factor that most influenced pertussis seropositivity, especially in the 2013 Riskesdas (APOR = 2.983, 95%CI: 2.670–3.333). In conclusion, the results of this study showed that the seroprevalence of pertussis was high, especially in children aged 5–14 years, so that pertussis vaccine booster administration could be considered. Because the most influencing factor towards pertussis seropositive was low maternal education, the groups of children with low-educated mothers should be targets for strengthening complete vaccination coverage and disease control.","author":"Monica Dwi Hartanti","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"854aedde54123e3b7a6aee3f91487ea4ba45b1d6a43da30ebe6ee991f24c8178","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
