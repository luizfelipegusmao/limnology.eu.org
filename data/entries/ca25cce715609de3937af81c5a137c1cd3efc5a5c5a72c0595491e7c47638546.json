{"title":"Enhanced Linear and Vision Transformer-based Architectures for Time Series Forecasting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1024/v1","date":1713256174000,"content":"Time series forecasting has been a challenging area in the field of Artificial Intel-ligence. Various approaches such as linear Neural Networks, Recurrent Linear Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and recently Transformers have been attempted for the time series forecasting domain. Although, Trans-former-based architectures have been outstanding in the Natural Language Pro-cessing domain, especially in autoregressive language modeling, the initial at-tempts to use transformers in the time series arena have met with mixed success. One of the recent papers demonstrated that modeling the multi-variate time se-ries problem as independent channels on a transformer architecture produced lower mean square and mean absolute errors on benchmarks, however, another recent paper claimed that a simple linear neural network out-performs previous approaches including transformer-based designs. We investigate this paradox in detail comparing the linear Neural Network and Transformer based designs, provide insights to why a certain approach may be better for a particular type of problem. We also improve upon the recently proposed simple linear Neural Network based architecture by using dual pipelines with batch normalization and reversible instance normalization. Our enhanced architecture outperforms all existing architectures for time series forecasting on majority of the popular benchmarks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca25cce715609de3937af81c5a137c1cd3efc5a5c5a72c0595491e7c47638546","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
