{"title":"Defensive Adaptations and Paleoecology of Ankylosaurus: Insights into the Armor and Lifestyle of a Cretaceous Armored Dinosaur","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2611/v1","date":1722437137000,"content":"Ankylosaurus stands as a quintessential example of Cretaceous armored dinosaurs, renowned for its formidable defensive adaptations. This study explores the defensive mechanisms and paleoecology of Ankylosaurus, focusing on its unique armor and lifestyle. Through detailed morphological analysis of fossil specimens, we examine the structure and function of the robust osteoderms and the prominent tail club, evaluating their roles in defense against predators. The distribution and arrangement of these defensive features suggest a sophisticated strategy to deter and survive attacks from contemporary theropods. Additionally, we investigate the paleoenvironmental context of Ankylosaurus, assessing how its habitat and ecological interactions influenced its evolutionary adaptations. Comparative analysis with other ankylosaurids and contemporaneous species provides insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping its armor. Our findings highlight the balance between offensive and defensive strategies in the Late Cretaceous ecosystem, underscoring the role of Ankylosaurus as both a well-protected herbivore and a critical component of its ecological niche. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of armored dinosaurs and their interaction with their environment, offering a comprehensive perspective on the adaptations that defined Ankylosaurus' survival strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52b119be4521e1f021577a5e6fbfbf693d8ded957ab301aac29638ddb98b519a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
