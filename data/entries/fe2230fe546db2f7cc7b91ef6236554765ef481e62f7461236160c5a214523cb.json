{"title":"Impact of putatively beneficial genomic loci on gene expression in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus, Le Conte, 1831) affected by white‐nose syndrome","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13748?af=R","date":1726729200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Genome-wide scans for selection have become a popular tool for investigating evolutionary responses in wildlife to emerging diseases. However, genome scans are susceptible to false positives and do little to demonstrate specific mechanisms by which loci impact survival. Linking putatively resistant genotypes to observable phenotypes increases confidence in genome scan results and provides evidence of survival mechanisms that can guide conservation and management efforts. Here we used an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to uncover relationships between gene expression and alleles associated with the survival of little brown bats (<i>Myotis lucifugus</i>) despite infection with the causative agent of white-nose syndrome. We found that 25 of the 63 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with survival were related to gene expression in wing tissue. The differentially expressed genes have functional annotations associated with the innate immune system, metabolism, circadian rhythms, and the cellular response to stress. In addition, we observed differential expression of multiple genes with survival implications related to loci in linkage disequilibrium with focal SNPs. Together, these findings support the selective function of these loci and suggest that part of the mechanism driving survival may be the alteration of immune and other responses in epithelial tissue.</p>","author":"Robert Kwait, \nMalin L.
