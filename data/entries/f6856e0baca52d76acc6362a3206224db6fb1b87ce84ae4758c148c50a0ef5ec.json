{"title":"Are We Ready to Face Conversion to Liver Transplantation of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Treatment with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0356/v1","date":1717652700000,"content":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Liver transplantation (LT) is the best therapy for most patients with non-metastatic HCC. In recent years, the management of patients with HCC has changed considerably, thanks to the improvement of molecular biology knowledge and the introduction of immunotherapy.\nTo date, systemic therapy is authorized in the Western world only in patients with advanced HCC. However, this therapy could lead not only to stabilize the tumour disease or improve survival but could display excellent response and lead to downstaging of the tumor that finally permits liver transplantation. There are increasing reports of patients that have performed liver transplantation after pretreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, due to the intrinsic mechanism of ICIs to stimulate the immune response against tumors, they could also cause graft rejection.\nThis review aims to evaluate the readiness and outcomes of liver transplantation in patients with advanced HCC who have previously undergone treatment with ICIs. It seeks to identify the challenges, risks, and benefits associated with this conversion therapy. The integration of ICIs into the treatment paradigm for advanced HCC necessitates a nuanced approach to liver transplantation. While early evidence supports the feasibility of LT following ICI therapy, there is an urgent need for standardized guidelines and more extensive longitudinal studies to optimize patient selection, timing, and post-transplant management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6856e0baca52d76acc6362a3206224db6fb1b87ce84ae4758c148c50a0ef5ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
