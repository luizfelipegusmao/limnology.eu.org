{"title":"Investigation on damage evolution mechanism of various FRP strengthened concrete subjected to chemical-freeze-thaw coupling erosion","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303645","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Wei Li, Dayang Wang, Wenyuan Xu, Yongcheng Ji</p>\r\n\r\nThe corrosion resistance of FRP-reinforced ordinary concrete members under the combined action of harsh environments (i.e., alkaline or acidic solutions, salt solutions) and freeze-thaw cycles is still unclear. To study the mechanical and apparent deterioration of carbon/basalt/glass/aramid fiber cloth reinforced concrete under chemical and freeze-thaw coupling. Plain concrete blocks and FRP-bonded concrete blocks were fabricated. The tensile properties of the FRP sheet and epoxy resin sheet before and after chemical freezing, the compressive strength of the FRP reinforced test block, and the bending capacity of the prismatic test block pasted with FRP on the prefabricated crack side were tested. The deterioration mechanism of the test block was analyzed through the change of surface photos. Based on the experimental data, the Lam-Teng constitutive model of concrete reinforced by alkali-freeze coupling FRP is modified. The results indicate that, in terms of apparent properties, with the increase in the duration of chemical freeze-thaw erosion, the surface of epoxy resin sheets exhibits an increase in pores, along with the emergence of small cracks and wrinkles. The texture of FRP sheets becomes blurred, and cracks and wrinkles appear on the surface. In terms of failure modes, as the number of chemical coupling erosion cycles increases, the location of failure in epoxy resin sheets becomes uncertain, and the failure plane tilts towards the direction of the applied load. The failure mode of FRP sheets remains unchanged. However, the bonding strength between FRP sheets and concrete decreases, resulting in a weakened reinforcement effect. In terms of mechanical properties, FRP sheets undergo the most severe degradation in the coupled environment of acid freeze-thaw cycles. Among them, GFRP experiences the largest degradation in tensile strength, reaching up to 30.17%. In terms of tensile performance, the sheets rank from highest to lowest as follows: CFRP, BFRP, AFRP, and GFRP.As the duration of chemical freeze-coupled erosion increases, the loss rate of compressive strength for specimens bonded with CFRP is the smallest (9.62% in salt freeze-thaw environment), while the loss rate of bearing capacity is higher for specimens reinforced with GFRP (33.8% in acid freeze-thaw environment). In contrast, the loss rate of bearing capacity is lower for specimens reinforced with CFRP (13.6% in salt freeze-thaw environment), but still higher for specimens reinforced with GFRP (25.8% in acid freeze-thaw environment).","author":"Wei Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b2d461767547bcc27deda2e0299c820413e75e1270e1f3f3d03e907bbef5095f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
