{"title":"Prediction of Temperature Distribution on Aircraft Hot-air Anti-icing Surface by ROM and Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1860/v1","date":1729705697000,"content":"This study aims to address the inefficiencies and time-consuming nature of traditional hot-air anti-icing system designs by introducing reduced order models (ROM) and machine learning techniques to predict anti-icing surface temperature distributions. This study compares several classic neural networks, ultimately proposing two models: POD-AlexNet and multi-CNNs with GRU (MCG). Design variables of the hot-air anti-icing cavity are used as inputs, and the corresponding surface temperature distribution data serve as outputs. The performance of these models is evaluated on the test set. The POD-AlexNet model achieves a mean prediction accuracy of over 95%, while the MCG model reaches 96.97%. Both models significantly outperform traditional numerical simulation methods, delivering faster predictions. The proposed models achieve fast prediction of anti-icing surface temperature distribution while ensuring acceptable prediction accuracy. These models greatly enhance the prediction efficiency over existing numerical simulation approaches, contributing to the design of aircraft hot-air anti-icing systems based on optimization methods such as genetic algorithms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7a2138e2feecf57ea823fe7692c8351089870e7aa1f47ad52b312b40b28f4e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
