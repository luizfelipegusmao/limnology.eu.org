{"title":"The Role of Aging and Senescence in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Response and Toxicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2008/v1","date":1717059591000,"content":"Cellular senescence accumulates with age and has been shown to impact numerous physiological and pathological processes, including immune function. The role of cellular senescence in cancer is multifaceted, but the impact on immune checkpoint inhibitor response and toxicity has not been fully evaluated. In this review, we evaluate the impact of cellular senescence in various biological compartments, including the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, and the immune system on immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and toxicity. We provide an overview of the impact of cellular senescence in normal and pathological contexts and examine recent studies that have connected aging and cellular senescence to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in both the pre-clinical and clinical contexts. Overall, senescence plays a multi-faceted, context-specific role, and has been shown to modulate immune-related adverse event incidence as well as immune checkpoint inhibitor response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ab3b8215aebc17f91b71ed6e60449ba0ff10c5c95fc6d73509adc3c4fa90b11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
