{"title":"Assesses of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cases with Isoform p53 Protein using Elisa Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1260/v1","date":1721097400000,"content":"Background P53 gene mutation is a very common event in human neoplasia, and genetic mutations in the P53 gene in a single allele are responsible for a hereditary cancer susceptibility syndrome (Li Fraumeni). These variants encode distinct isoforms of the p53 protein, which may disrupt its transcriptional activity. These point mutant proteins are more stable than the normal protein and the mutant product accumulates at a high level that allows obtaining important information about p53 gene expression in malignant cells, especially in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, (CLL). By Enzyme Linked Immune-Absorbent Assay method, (ELISA), was analyzed the frequency of p53 protein expression to 20 eligible patients diagnosed with CLL for to investigate the relationship of this protein in the stages of the disease and the impact on treatment response and survival. In ELISA technique was used the specific antibodies for isoform p53 protein, PAb 240 antibodies. These antibodies bind specifically to denatured p-53 protein. Species reactivity is for human in conformity with the prospect from Manual, Catalog No. LS-F174, Bio-Rad. Results The average concentrations of p53 proteins in 17 of 20 cases were found 16.76 μg / dl, with CV = 0.5% and the probability index p = 0.034. Very high pathological values in the 3 cases of isoform p53 protein were calculated in 2 men, (PM) in the value of 60 µg / dL, respectively at 40 µg / dL and in the case of females, (PW), in 40 µg / dL value, with the transformation into Diffuse Large Lymphoma, (DLL). Conclusion This ELISA method has proven to be a useful prognostic tool for the application of personalized treatment of on-immune therapy, in cases diagnosed with the type B-CLL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdfed8846fcc7c3e4fc698204ca9196c4409bb2ad6439d77acb0f73fc238874c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
