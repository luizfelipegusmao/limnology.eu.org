{"title":"Preparation of porous plate from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash and its application in a biofilm batch reactor","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14459?af=R","date":1721824497000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The reutilization of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash is a prominent area of research. This study focused on creating fly ash porous plate filler (FAPPF) by using techniques, such as water extraction, milling, component adjustment, and sintering. The produced FAPPF was then used to cultivate a biofilm for wastewater treatment. The key parameters included a two-stage water extraction process with a 5:1 liquid-to-solid ratio; milling for 1, 2, and 4 h; component adjustment using waste glass powder, milled fly ash, palygorskite powder, and peanut shell powder at a 7:1:1:1 mass ratio; and sintering temperatures ranging from 700 to 1000°C. For the biofilm cultivation and treatment, this study employed semisimulated sewage in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor system. The results revealed the FAPPF had no heavy metal leaching, with a porosity of 48.53%–54.68%. Approximately 90% of its composition was derived from waste materials. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy microanalysis revealed an internally stable liquid-phase sintering structure. Finally, a mature biofilm developed in 21 days, achieving maximum removal rates of 95.48% for chemical oxygen demand and 78.4% for ammonia nitrogen. This article confirms the sustainable recycling potential of MSWI fly ash.</p>","author":"Jing Wang, \nHan Liu, \nChang‐Jung Sun, \nWeicheng Fang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"fa0256cf3acf6b2714f0dea7793d994a317ebf702083525b5efb9d598910b8bd","category":"Environment"}
