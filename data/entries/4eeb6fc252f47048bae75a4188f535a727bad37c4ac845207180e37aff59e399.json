{"title":"Stress Responses in Horses Housed in Different Stable Designs During Summer in a Tropical Savanna Climate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0973/v1","date":1720776045000,"content":"Single-confinement housing can pose welfare risks to domestic horses. This study investigated horses’ stress responses when confined to single stalls in different stable designs in a tropical savanna region to address a literature gap. In total, 23 horses were assigned to a stable with a central corridor and solid external walls (A) (N = 8), a stable with one side corridor and solid external walls (B) (N = 6) or a stable with a central corridor and no solid external walls (C) (N = 9). Air velocity, relative humidity, air temperature and noxious gases were measured inside the stables, and the heart rate and HRV of the horses were also determined. The relative humidity was lower in stable C than in stable A (p &amp;lt; 0.05), while the air temperature was higher in stable C than in stable B (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during the day. The airflow and ammonia levels were higher in stable C than in stables B and A (p &amp;lt; 0.01–0.0001). Overall, horses’ HRV in stable A was lower than in those in stables B and C (p &amp;lt; 0.05-0.01). Horses in stable A tended to experience more stress than those in other stables.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4eeb6fc252f47048bae75a4188f535a727bad37c4ac845207180e37aff59e399","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
