{"title":"The mechanics of male courtship display behaviour in the Ptiloris riflebirds (Aves: Paradisaeidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blae077/7758821?rss=1","date":1726444800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sexual selection through female choice has driven the evolution of some of the most elaborate signalling behaviours in animals. These displays often require specialized morphological adaptations and may incorporate signals in multiple sensory modalities. Visual and acoustic signals are often precisely choreographed in temporally structured courtship performances, though the precise mechanics of such signalling behaviours are often enigmatic. We find that riflebirds (genus <span>Ptiloris</span>)—a bird of paradise clade—achieve their remarkable display postures by hyperextending the wrist joint, vastly exceeding the maximal wrist extension capabilities of any other known bird. Using video collected in the field, we then show that this hypermobility is required for a sonation unique to riflebirds, and find that the yellow interior of the mouth is displayed in the dynamic phase of display. As this sonation cannot be produced when the mouth is exposed, it represents a mechanical constraint to signal design. Finally, we used a large morphometric dataset to describe patterns of sexual dimorphism in wing length across diverse bird of paradise species, and find evidence of sexual selection for large and structurally modified wings used in riflebird displays. Our study highlights nuanced choreographic differences in the display behaviours of different riflebird species, and sheds light on the intricate design features of sexual signals in this fascinating taxon.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"21c212a73146ceef69b933c3a83030acf486ab43b1288e8813e03cfd01864a33","category":"Environment"}
