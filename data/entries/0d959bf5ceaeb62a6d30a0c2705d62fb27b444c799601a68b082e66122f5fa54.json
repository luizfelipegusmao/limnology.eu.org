CDW phases respond strongly to external perturbations such as pressure, strain, disorder, electric and magnetic fields, etc., all of which may suppress the CDW and stabilize competing electronic phases including superconductivity or magnetism [<a href=\"#ozae044.728-B2\">2-4</a>]. Despite the strong electron-lattice coupling in CDW, our understanding of interactions between CDW and structural defects is sparse. Studying the defect-CDW correlation requires both real-space probe to characterize the defects locally and reciprocal-space probe to observe the effects of defects on the CDW. Here, using <span>in-situ</span> cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and four-dimensional (4D) STEM, we examine the effects of microstructure on the CDW phases of rare-earth tritellurides.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0d959bf5ceaeb62a6d30a0c2705d62fb27b444c799601a68b082e66122f5fa54","category":"Environment"}
