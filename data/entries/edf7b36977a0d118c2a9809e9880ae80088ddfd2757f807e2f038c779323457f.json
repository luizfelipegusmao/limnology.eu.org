{"title":"The Marine Fish Gut Microbiome as a Source of Novel Bacteriocins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1215/v1","date":1716192688000,"content":"The marine environment is the largest ecological habitat on Earth, albeit one of the least explored, particularly in terms of its microbial inhabitants. The marine fish gut is host to a diverse microbial community from which diverse bioactive molecules can be sourced. Due to the unique environmental pressures these microbial communities experience, the bioactive molecules they produce often evolve unique adaptations that give them diverse structures and activities, differentiating them from terrestrial homologues. Of particular interest, due to their structural and functional diversity, are the ribosomally-synthesized antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins). With increasing pressure from emerging antibiotic-resistant disease and industrial demand for novel therapeutics, the marine fish gut microbiome represents a relatively untapped resource of novel bacteriocins that could prove beneficial to human health and aquaculture. This review presents an overview of the marine fish gut microbiome and explores its potential as a source of bacteriocins for human health with considerations for applications and future research in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edf7b36977a0d118c2a9809e9880ae80088ddfd2757f807e2f038c779323457f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
