{"title":"Unexpected Hepatoprotective Effects of the Neuroproteсtor Lithium Ascorbate in a Model of a ʺWesternʺ Diet with Iron Overload and Multiple Organ Pathology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1645/v1","date":1726837112000,"content":"Lithium ascorbate (LiAsc) is a non-toxic lithium salt (LD50&gt;5000 mg/kg) with normothymic and neuroprotective properties. Chemoreactomic modeling of LiAsc predicted possible hepatoprotective effects which were tested here on a rat model of a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with multiorgan pathology caused by combined intake of excess saturated fats (palm oil), carbohydrates (fructose) and inorganic iron salt (ferrous sulfate). Dynamics of biochemical parameters (biomarkers of liver function, kidneys, hematopoiesis, inflammation, thrombus formation, etc.) and histological evidence of hemosiderosis in the model upon reproduction of the model are described. Experimental confirmations of the hepatoprotective effects of LiAsc were obtained. Comparison of the effects of LiAsc with the effects of myoinositol (a substance with known hepatoprotective properties) shown a number of differences in pharmacological action. Both LiAsc and MI lowered ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, AST, ALT, serum creatinine, leukocytes (LiAsc to a greater extent) and normalized lowered serum protein and glomerular filtration rate. However, only LiAsc lowered heightened reticulocytes (absolute and fraction) and platelets towards the corresponding reference intervals, normalized levels of vitamin B12 in blood and lowered the number of Kupffer cells in liver that were overloaded with iron (contained Prussian blue in morphometric studies). In a clinical perspective, hepatoprotective properties of a neuroprotector and it’s potential to reduce hemosiderosis might be useful for treating patients with hepatic encephalopathy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5ffe73648ebb1e1ae1f080eef2e26efeebdb9dc766615f9c049bcacfd4ce5c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
