The floodplain fishery of Tonle Sap Lake near the Kampong Khleang stilted community in the Chamkar Youn village in Cambodia was evaluated by: (1) characterizing fish assemblage structure and function, (2) highlighting temporal differences in fish assemblage, and (3) assessing potential indicators of fishing-down-the-food-web by the fishery. Fish trap data from the wet season were used to characterize fish abundance, diversity, species richness, and functional feeding guilds from fish catches in 2014 and 2019. Fish abundance declined 62% and species richness declined between 2014 and 2019. Smaller-bodied, lower-trophic level fishes dominated the catch. Our limited findings add insight into the status of a globally important fishery and highlight the need for more local collaborative fishery assessments.</p>","author":"Jyoti Thapa, \nMegan English, \nChouly Ou, \nJulia Lanoue, \nRichard H.
