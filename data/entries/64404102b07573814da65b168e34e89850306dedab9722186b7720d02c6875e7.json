We elucidated the functional mechanism of hypoxia-like conditions in CC cell ferroptosis resistance. CC cells were subjected to normoxia or hypoxia-like conditions, followed by erastin treatment to induce ferroptosis. The assessment of cell viability/ferroptosis resistance was performed by MTT assay/Fe<sup>2+</sup>, MDA, and glutathione measurement by colorimetry. KDM4A/SUMO1/Ubc9/SENP1 protein levels were determined by Western blot. Interaction and binding sites between KDM4A and SUMO1 were analyzed and predicted by immunofluorescence/co-immunoprecipitation and GPS-SUMO 1.0 software, with the target relationship verified by mutation experiment. SLC7A11/GPX4/H3K9me3 protein levels, and H3K9me3 level in the SLC7A11 gene promoter region were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot/chromatin immunoprecipitation. H3H9me3/SLC7A11/GPX4 level alterations, and ferroptosis resistance after KDM4A silencing or KDM4A K471 mutation were assessed. Hypoxia-like conditions increased CC cell ferroptosis resistance and KDM4A, SUMO1, and Ubc9 protein levels, while it decreased SENP1 protein level. KDM4A and SUMO1 were co-localized in the nucleus, and hypoxia-like conditions promoted their interaction. Specifically, the K471 locus of KDM4A was the main locus for SUMO1ylation. Hypoxia-like conditions up-regulated SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression levels and decreased H3K9me3 protein level and H3K9me3 abundance in the SLC7A11 promoter region. KDM4A silencing or K471 locus mutation resulted in weakened interaction between KDM4A and SUMO1, elevated H3K9me3 levels, decreased SLC7A11 expression, ultimately, a reduced CC cell ferroptosis resistance. CoCl<sub>2</sub>-stimulated hypoxia-like conditions enhanced SUMO1 modification of KDM4A at the K471 locus specifically, repressed H3K9me3 levels, and up-regulated SLC7A11/GPX4 to enhance CC cell ferroptosis resistance.</p>","author":"Jing Xiong, \nPuxiang Chen, \nLing He, \nXiaoshan Chai, \nYongjing Zhang, \nShujuan Sun","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"64404102b07573814da65b168e34e89850306dedab9722186b7720d02c6875e7","category":"Environment"}
