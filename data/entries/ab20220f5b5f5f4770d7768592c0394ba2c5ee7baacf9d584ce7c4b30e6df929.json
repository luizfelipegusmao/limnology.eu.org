{"title":"COVID-19 IgG seropositivity and its determinants in occupational groups of varying infection risks in two Andean cities of Ecuador before mass vaccination","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309466","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Jose E.

There are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and its determinants from Andean countries prior to mass vaccinations against COVID-19.</p> Objective <p>To estimate SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and its determinants before vaccination in occupational groups of adults presumed to have different levels of exposure and associations with potential symptomatology.</p> Methods <p>We measured seropositivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a cross-sectional study of vaccine-naïve adults aged 18 years and older, recruited within three occupational risk groups (defined as low [LR], moderate [MR], and high [HR]) between January and September 2021 in two Andean cities in Ecuador. Associations with risk factors were estimated using logistic regression.</p> Results <p>In a sample of 882 adults, IgG seropositivity for the three different occupational risk groups was 39.9% (CI 95% 35.3–44.6), 74.6% (CI 95% 66.4–81.4), and 39.0% (CI 95% 34.0–44.4) for the HR, MR, and LR groups, respectively. History of an illness with loss of taste and/or smell was significantly associated with seropositivity in all occupational groups, with adjusted ORs of 14.31 (95%CI, 5.83–35.12; p&lt;0.001), 14.34 (95%CI 3.01–68.42; p&lt;0.001), and 8.79 (95%CI 2.69–28.72; p&lt;0.001), for the HR, MR, and LR groups, respectively; while fever was significant for the LR group with an adjusted OR of 1.24 (95%CI, 1.11–4.57; p = 0.025) and myalgia for the HR group with an adjusted OR of 2.07 (95%CI, 1.13–3.81; p = 0.019).</p> Conclusion <p>Notable proportions of seropositivity were seen in all occupational groups between January and September 2021 prior to mass vaccination. Loss of taste and/or smell was strongly associated with presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies irrespective of presumed occupational exposure risk.</p>","author":"Jose E.
