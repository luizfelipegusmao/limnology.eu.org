{"title":"Design Process for Beautiful, High-Performance Microscopy Facilities at Johns Hopkins University","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.962/7720229?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>We will present a collaborative design process for high-performance imaging and characterization facilities, based on our experiences as scientist and architect designing the Materials Characterization and Processing facility at Johns Hopkins University. Our process addresses the documentation and coordination of complex technical needs, recognizes the unknowability of future needs, and elevates the human experience in the facility built in an historic silver factory. This process, and the resulting facility, are rare in that the beauty of the facility is an explicit criterion for success. We believe that the facilityâ€™s success in meeting this criterion has observable results in student learning, research success, and the degree to which the facility is used and occupied by the university community and outside users.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"564a0c6cec4b3fa7917923b569722edf17acaba1a1a36aec9d4cbf81539e9071","category":"Environment"}
