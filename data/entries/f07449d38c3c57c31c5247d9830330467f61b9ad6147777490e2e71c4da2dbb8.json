{"title":"Integration of Postbiotics in Food Products through Attenuated Probiotics: A Case Study with Lactic Acid Bacteria in Bread","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2123/v1","date":1717144855000,"content":"The study examines the integration of postbiotics in food products through the use of attenuated probiotics, specifically lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in bread. Postbiotics, non-viable microorganisms or their metabolites, offer health benefits similar to probiotics without the risks associated with live bacteria. This research evaluates the regulatory aspects and safety of LAB in sourdough bread production, highlighting their historical and significant use in Europe before 1997. The study includes microbial quantification and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify LAB in traditional sourdough, comparing them with historical and current EFSA Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) lists. Findings show that the LAB present in sourdough have been extensively and safely used in bread making, supporting their classification as non-novel foods under EU regulations. The stability and consistency of LAB metabolites in sourdough bread are also confirmed, ensuring quality and safety in each batch. The study concludes that LAB in sourdough, when inactivated through bread-making processes, are not considered novel foods, aligning with historical, scientific, and regulatory evidence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f07449d38c3c57c31c5247d9830330467f61b9ad6147777490e2e71c4da2dbb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
