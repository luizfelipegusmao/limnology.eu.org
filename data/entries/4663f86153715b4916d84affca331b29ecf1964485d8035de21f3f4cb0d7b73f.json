{"title":"Analyzing Docker Vulnerabilities through Static and Dynamic Methods and Enhancing IoT Security with AWS IoT Core, CloudWatch, and GuardDuty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1507/v1","date":1719199735000,"content":"During our digital transition, Docker containers have become essential for adaptable application deployment, although posing inherent security threats. This study utilizes Trivy for static analysis and Falco for dynamic analysis to identify and address vulnerabilities in Docker environments before deployment and in real-time. The IoT sector is now dealing with security issues that are made more severe by extensive connectivity and the prevalence of WiFi. This research promotes the use of AWS cloud security technologies such as IoT Core, CloudWatch, and GuardDuty to protect IoT devices from threats, with the goal of maintaining user privacy and ensuring safety in our interconnected digital world. This comprehensive strategy aims to enhance security measures in both Docker and IoT sectors, strengthening the security framework in our interconnected world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4663f86153715b4916d84affca331b29ecf1964485d8035de21f3f4cb0d7b73f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
