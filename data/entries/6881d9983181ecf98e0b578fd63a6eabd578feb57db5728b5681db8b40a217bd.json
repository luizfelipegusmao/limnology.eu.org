It has gained worldwide recognition as a distinct discipline. Its origin is associated with Walter Ebeling's publication <span>Urban Entomology</span> in 1975. Urbanization, invasive pests, increased demand for pest management services, and changes in legislation collided in the 1970s to create a need for research and extension activities worldwide. This resulted in urban entomology as a discipline and, within two decades, its national and international recognition. In this review, we present the factors that led to the development of urban entomology and how they have shaped its current meaning. As urbanization intensifies and the global economy increases, the demands for urban pest management will continue to grow. We discuss how these future challenges may shape and alter the discipline.</p></div>","author":"Michael K. Rust, Chow-Yang Lee, Gary W. Bennett and William H.
