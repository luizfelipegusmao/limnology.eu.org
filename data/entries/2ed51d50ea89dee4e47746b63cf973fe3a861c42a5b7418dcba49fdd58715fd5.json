{"title":"In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of the Effects of Drug 2c and Derivatives on Ovarian Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1360/v1","date":1713535737000,"content":"Background: The identification of novel therapeutic strategies for Ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecological neoplasm, is of utmost urgency. Here, we have tested the effectiveness of the compound 2c (4-Hydroxy-2,6-bis(4-nitrobenzylidene)cyclohexanone 2). 2c interferes with cyste-ine-dependent deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), thus affecting the ubiquitin-proteasome de-pendent degradation of proteins. Methods: 2c phenotypic/molecular effects were studied in two OC cell lines, primary tumor cells cultured in 2D/3D and in a mouse xenograft model. We also propose an in-silico model of 2c interaction with DUBs. Finally, we tested the effect of 2c conju-gated to several linkers to generate 2c-derivatives usable for improved drug delivery. Results: 2c effectively impairs OC cell line and primary tumor cell viability in both 2D and 3D conditions. The effectiveness is confirmed in a xenograft mouse model of OC. We show that 2c impairs pro-teasome activity and triggers apoptosis most likely by interacting with DUBs; we propose a mechanism for the interaction with a model DUB via an in-silico evaluation of the en-zyme-inhibitor complex. 2c also reduces cell growth by down-regulating the level of the transcrip-tion factor E2F1. Finally, 2c activity is often retained after the conjugation with linkers. Conclu-sion: Our data strongly support the potential therapeutic value of 2c/derivatives in OC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ed51d50ea89dee4e47746b63cf973fe3a861c42a5b7418dcba49fdd58715fd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
