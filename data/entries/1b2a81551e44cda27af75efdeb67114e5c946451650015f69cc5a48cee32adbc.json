{"title":"Internet of Things and Bigdata Analytics in Preventive Healthcare: A Synthetic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0445/v1","date":1723012562000,"content":"Background: IoT and Big Data are newer technologies that can provide substantial support for healthcare systems and help overcome their shortcomings. The aim of this paper was to analyze literature production descriptively, thematically, and chronologically from an interdisciplinary perspective in a holistic way to identify the most prolific research entities and themes. Methods: The synthetic knowledge synthesis qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes the production of literature through a combination of descriptive bibliometrics, bibliometric mapping and content analysis. For this analysis the Scopus bibliometric database was used. Results: In the Scopus database, 2272 publications were found, which were published between 1985 and June 10, 2024. The first article in this field was published in 1985. Until 2012 the production of literature was steady increasing, after that exponential growth began, which reached its peak in 2023. The most productive countries were the USA, India, China, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany and Italy. The content analysis resulted in 8 themes (four from the perspective of computer science and four from the perspective of medicine) and 21 thematic concepts (eight from the perspective of computer science and 13 from the perspective of medicine). Conclusions: The results show that IoT and Big Data have become key technologies in preventive health. The study outcomes might represent a starting point for the further development of research that combines multidisciplinary aspects of healthcare.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b2a81551e44cda27af75efdeb67114e5c946451650015f69cc5a48cee32adbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
