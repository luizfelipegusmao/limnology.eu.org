{"title":"A Grouping and Aggregation Modeling Method of Induction Motors for Transient Voltage Stability Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0307/v1","date":1722933624000,"content":"Induction motors are the most numerous and significant dynamic loads in power systems. In transient voltage stability analysis, dynamic equivalent models are commonly used to simplify the representation of a group of induction motors. This paper presents an method for the grouping and aggregation of induction motors at a common bus. Firstly, grouping rules were provided for clustering induction motors into several subgroups based on the mechanical principles of rotor force and motion, and Aggregation Rules were provided for aggregating a motor subgroup into a single-unit model based on the relationship between voltage drop and power transmission in distribution networks. Secondly, guided by the grouping rules, high-speed remaining electromagnetic torque and low-speed remaining electromagnetic torque were defined as new clustering indicators, and an adaptive K-means clustering method using silhouette coefficient verification was provided to obtain the optimal motor subgroups. Thirdly, guided by the Aggregation Rules, a dynamic equivalent method was further provided to obtain the equivalent single-unit model from a motor subgroup. Lastly, a transient voltage stability simulation in a typical distribution network was presented to illustrate that the proposed clustering and equivalent methods are more reasonable, accurate, and effective than traditional methods, as the obtained model has better dynamic characteristics and can more accurately reproduce the process of voltage collapse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bd8589e584ceb44babbecb9ae7eb3041e3aca30f89b5805a70f6cf757452b87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
