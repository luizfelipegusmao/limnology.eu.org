{"title":"Implications of Time-Invariant Space Model in Fundamental Physics and Cosmology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1581/v1","date":1729497985000,"content":"Time is what we measure with clocks. With clocks, we measure the duration of material change tuning in space. Material change runs in space only, time, as duration enters existence when measured. Time is an emergent physical reality that enters existence when measured by the observer. No measurement means no time. The motion does not require time. Motion requires only space and the physical object that moves in space, which is time-invariant. There is no physical past; there is no physical future. Past and future exist only in the human mind. Humans, we experience time-invariant space as NOW. The entire universe exists and develops into NOW.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61359e6fa7f569bded2c0b60a45017478573c21cb4cf844cd533553a77be724d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
