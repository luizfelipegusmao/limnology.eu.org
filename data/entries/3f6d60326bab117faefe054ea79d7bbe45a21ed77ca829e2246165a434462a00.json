{"title":"Experimental Study on Flexural Bearing Capacity of RC Beam after Explosion Based on Piezoelectric Intelligent Aggregate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1494/v1","date":1721381746000,"content":"In order to study the effect of explosion load on the flexural performance of RC beams, two RC beams of the same size were carried out explosion test and bearing capacity test successively. Piezoelectric intelligent aggregate was embedded in the beams in advance to monitor the damage state of the beams, which realized the whole process of damage monitoring of the concrete inside the structure from explosion damage to compression damage.Based on wavelet packet analysis and residual bearing capacity damage evaluation criteria, the beam damage was quantitatively evaluated, and the bending bearing capacity of RC beam after explosion damage was compared and analyzed.The results show that the change of concrete strain gauge signal, the phenomenon of crack development and the increase of internal crack development index indicate that the RC beam is damaged by explosion load.After explosion damage, the damage index of the beam increases and the residual bending capacity decreases, which proves that the piezoelectric intelligent aggregate sensor can effectively monitor the bending capacity change of the component after explosion damage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f6d60326bab117faefe054ea79d7bbe45a21ed77ca829e2246165a434462a00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
