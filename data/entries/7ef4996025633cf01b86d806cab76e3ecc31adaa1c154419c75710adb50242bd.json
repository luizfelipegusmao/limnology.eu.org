{"title":"Evaluating E6 Oncoprotein and Anti-E6 Antibodies as Saliva-Based Biomarkers for HPV-Associated Oral Cancer: Insights from SPR Immunoassays","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0680/v1","date":1725876411000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-related biomarkers, specifically E6 oncoproteins and anti-E6 antibodies, have emerged as promising indicators for detecting HPV-associated oral cavity cancers through salivary fluid analysis. This study assessed the survival outcomes of oral cancer patients who were double positive for these candidate biomarkers. Methods: Using biosensor immunoassays, we simultaneously detected E6 oncoprotein and anti-E6 antibodies in oral rinse fluids from patients with advanced T3/T4 oral cancer. Results: Preliminary findings revealed that over one-third of these patients had detectable HPV-related biomarkers in their saliva, with 37.9% testing positive for E6 oncoprotein and 31.0% showing elevated anti-E6 antibody levels. Double positivity was observed in 24.1% of cases. Although survival rate differences between the groups were not statistically significant, the double positivity subgroup demonstrated a trend toward improved survival outcomes compared to single-positive or double-negative patients. Conclusions: These initial results suggest that simultaneous detection of E6 oncoprotein and anti-E6 antibodies could be potential saliva-based biomarkers for clinical applications. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques to identify double positivity may enhance early detection of HPV-related oral cancer, potentially informing more effective treatment strategies in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ef4996025633cf01b86d806cab76e3ecc31adaa1c154419c75710adb50242bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
