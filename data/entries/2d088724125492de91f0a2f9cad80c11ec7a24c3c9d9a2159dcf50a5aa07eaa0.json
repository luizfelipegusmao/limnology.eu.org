{"title":"Integrating HEC-RAS Modeling for Improved Flash Flood Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1420/v1","date":1713803039000,"content":"This research focuses on the use of the HEC-RAS model to estimate flash flood risk. It combines advanced hydraulic modeling techniques and precise data entry. The aim is to contribute knowledge to assess flash flood risk and reduce impacts on communities and infrastructure. The selection of study areas with a history of severe flooding, such as the Lam Saphung Basin, Phrom River Basin, and Lam Chern River Basin Part 1 in Thailand, highlights the importance of thorough flash flood risk assessment. By leveraging the HEC-RAS model, the results of this research inform proactive risk management strategies, improve emergency preparedness and help develop sustainable mitigation measures. The results are important in developing emergency response strategies and overall recovery ability in areas at risk of flash floods. The research combines advanced hydrologic modeling and real-world flash flood data. In addition to the flood condition assessment, the extent of the flood area and associated hazards were assessed using a two-case simulation strategy. The study covers future scenarios related to land use changes and retrospective analysis of past flood events. The results have practical implications for improving emergency response strategies, land use planning, and overall resilience in flash flood-prone areas. The integrated approach emphasizes the research output to providing insights and actionable solutions for communities facing ongoing challenges posed by flash floods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d088724125492de91f0a2f9cad80c11ec7a24c3c9d9a2159dcf50a5aa07eaa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
