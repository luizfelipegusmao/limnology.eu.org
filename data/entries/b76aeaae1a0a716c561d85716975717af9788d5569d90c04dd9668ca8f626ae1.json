The metals and linkers in a MOF can be altered based on the desired functionality and structure. The tunable and structurally diverse nature of these materials, coupled with their high porosity and surface areas, make them optimal candidates for gas storage and capture [<a href=\"#ozae044.922-B1\">1</a>]. Amines appended onto the MOF increase its selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> from air. In particular, diamine-appended Mg<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) (dobpdc<sup>4–</sup> = 4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate) has the highest gravimetric capacity used for CO<sub>2</sub> capture from air. Structural characterization via single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) performed on an analogous material, diamine-appended Zn<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc), showed that CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption proceeded via a cooperative mechanism, where the gas inserts into the metal-N bonds. Given that the strength of the metal-amine bond informs the adsorption properties, it is imperative to understand the structure of the material of interest instead of its metal analogue. Attempts at structural characterization of diamine-appended Mg<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) have been so far unsuccessful because it has not been possible to grow large enough single crystals for X-ray diffraction [<a href=\"#ozae044.922-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b76aeaae1a0a716c561d85716975717af9788d5569d90c04dd9668ca8f626ae1","category":"Environment"}
