In this study, pyrite autotrophic denitrification (PAD) was coupled with a three-dimensional biofilm electrode reactor (BER) to enhance denitrification. The effect of current on denitrification was extensively studied. The nitrate removal of the PAD-BER increased by 14.90% and 74.64% compared to the BER and the PAD, respectively. In addition, the electron utilization, extracellular polymeric substances secretion, and denitrification enzyme activity (NaR and NiR) were enhanced in the PAD-BER. The microbial communities study displayed that Dokdonella, Hydrogenophaga, Nitrospira, and Terrimonas became the main genera for denitrification. Compared with the PAD and the BER, the abundance of the key denitrification genes narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ were all boosted in the PAD-BER. This study indicated that the enhanced autotrophic denitrifiers and denitrification genes were responsible for the improved denitrification in the PAD-BER.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nPAD-BER displayed higher nitrate removal, EPS, NAR, and NIR activity.\nThe three types of denitrification (HD, HAD, and PAD) and their contribution percentage in the PAD-BER were analyzed.\nHAD was dominant among the three denitrification processes in PAD-BER.\nMicrobial community composition and key denitrification genes were tested to reveal the denitrification mechanisms.\n</p>","author":"Shenyu Tan, \nYu Huang, \nHeng Yang, \nShiyang Zhang, \nXinhua Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"562ea17e182a5d295ee7c135c06f38131c78c0d7423b009f297a3005c41e54e8","category":"Environment"}
