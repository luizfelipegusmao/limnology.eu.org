{"title":"Spectral Properties of Bistatic Radar Signals using the Ray Tracing Technique and a Facet Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1328/v1","date":1716304965000,"content":"Bistatic radar experiments have been used to study surface characteristics of extra-terrestrial bodies in the Solar System, including the Moon, Venus, Mars, and Titan. This paper proposes a 3D model to characterize the scattered field of a Gaussian rough surface on an extra-terrestrial body for an orbital bistatic radar configuration. Specifically, this model will investigate how the variability of surface roughness impacts the spectral broadening of the received signal using physical optics approximations and ray tracing on a surface model using a facet approach with Gaussian properties. A linear relationship between spectral broadening of the signal and surface roughness was found. This relationship is in line with results obtained by commonly used analytical models for bistatic radar on planetary surfaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f29a946b8e7983b51c2e0b12adaa53027cd458e36a4da10353ab15fc48c5086","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
