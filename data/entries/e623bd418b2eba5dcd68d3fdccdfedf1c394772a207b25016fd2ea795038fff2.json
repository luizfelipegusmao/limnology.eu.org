{"title":"Psychophysics of Social Cyber-Physical System Acceptance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0241/v1","date":1712138869000,"content":"A review of literature, supporting the view on the psychophysical origins of some acceptance effects of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), is presented and discussed in the paper. Psychological effects like the reactance to a robot or the uncanny valley phenomenon suggest that CPSs are perceived as a special type of ‘being’, a phylogenetically emergent category, or a novel ontology in a philosophical sense, culturally developing as a function of the social brain. Justification of this view is provided by the psychophysically-relevant human responses to technologically and socially ambiguous stimuli on the one hand, and the probabilistic independence of the proposed ontology to similar ontologies, subjectively experienced by the human, on the other. The results of the presented in the paper analysis demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hypothesis of ontological ‘near independence’ of the distribution of the probabilistic psychophysical processes in response to the cyber-physical stimulus as a socially evolving phenomenon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e623bd418b2eba5dcd68d3fdccdfedf1c394772a207b25016fd2ea795038fff2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
