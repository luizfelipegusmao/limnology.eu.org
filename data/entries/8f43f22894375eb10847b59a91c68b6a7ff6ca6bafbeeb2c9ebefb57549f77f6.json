{"title":"The Incidence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients with Dento-Skeletal Malformation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1376/v1","date":1716340235000,"content":"Purpose: The aim of this article is to analyze the incidence of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea OSA  in patients affected by dento-skeletal malformation. We also evaluated the patterns most affected by the condition and calculated the post surgical changes.\nMethods:  We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 71 patients including 35 men and 36 women. Patients were evaluated with Polysomnography before surgery and at least 6 months after surgery to assess any improvement or worsening of the apnea hypopnea index AHI index. Regarding AHI evaluation criteria an AHI &gt; 5 was considered indicative of OSA, 4 5, com-pared to 20.5% described in the Italian population.\nConclusion: In patients who receive orthognathic surgery the presence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea is significantly higher than in the general population. When planning the surgical correction of a dentoskeletal malformation, the surgeon must aim not only to the aesthetics results, but also to a proper stomatognathic and respiratory function, this cannot be done without taking poly-somnography information into account.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f43f22894375eb10847b59a91c68b6a7ff6ca6bafbeeb2c9ebefb57549f77f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
