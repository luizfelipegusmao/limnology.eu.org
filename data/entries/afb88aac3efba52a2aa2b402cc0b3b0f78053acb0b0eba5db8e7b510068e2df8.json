{"title":"Type I interferon promotes the fate of Toll-like receptor 9–stimulated follicular B cells to plasma cell differentiation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae152/7649237?rss=1","date":1713312000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The activation and differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (PCs) play critical roles in the immune response to infections and autoimmune diseases. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) responds to bacterial and viral DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs and triggers immune responses in B cells; however, abnormal recognition of self-DNA by TLR9 can cause autoimmune diseases. When stimulated with TLR9 agonists, follicular (FO) B cells, a subset of B cells residing in the FO regions of secondary lymphoid organs, exhibit a propensity for activation but fail to give rise to PCs. The factors that enable the transition of TLR9-activated FO B cells from activation to differentiation into PCs remain unclear. In this study, we show that type I interferon-alpha (IFNα) signaling causes FO B cells activated by CpG stimulation to differentiate into PCs. Although CpG stimulation alone only temporarily increased interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) expression in FO B cells, co-stimulation with both CpG and IFNα enhanced and maintained high IRF4 expression levels, ultimately enabling the cells to differentiate into PCs. Overexpression of IRF4 in FO B cells results in CpG-induced PC transition without IFN signaling. Furthermore, co-stimulation of TLR9 and IFNα receptors significantly enhanced mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which regulates IRF4 expression and PC generation. These findings suggest that IFNα may play a key role in promoting the fate of PC differentiation in FO B cells activated by TLR9 stimulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"afb88aac3efba52a2aa2b402cc0b3b0f78053acb0b0eba5db8e7b510068e2df8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
