Because of the limitations and adverse effects associated with conventional IBD therapies, there has been increased scientific interest in microbial-derived biomolecules, known as postbiotics. Postbiotics are defined as the preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confer a health benefit on the host, comprising inactivated microbial cells, cell fractions, metabolites, etc. Postbiotics have shown potential in enhancing IBD treatment by reducing inflammation, modulating the immune system, stabilizing intestinal flora and maintaining the integrity of intestinal barriers. Consequently, they are considered promising adjunctive therapies for IBD. Recent studies indicate that postbiotics offer distinctive advantages, including spanning clinical (safe origin), technological (easy for storage and transportation) and economic (reduced production costs) dimensions, rendering them suitable for widespread applications in functional food/pharmaceutical. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the definition, classification and applications of postbiotics, with an emphasis on their biological activity in both the prevention and treatment of IBD. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shuxin Wang, \nPu Wang, \nDonghui Wang, \nShenghai Shen, \nShiqi Wang, \nYuanyuan Li, \nHao Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f7fe57666543f78de2f4042f915083bc996ee5cb7985d9a40716c51ffa04662d","category":"Environment"}
