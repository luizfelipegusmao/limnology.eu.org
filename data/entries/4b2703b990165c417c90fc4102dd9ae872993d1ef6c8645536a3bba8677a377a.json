{"title":"Bolstering Poultry Health: The Urgency of Updating Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Vaccines in India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0092/v1","date":1727849420000,"content":"Newcastle disease is a global disease, spreading quickly during outbreaks in poultry and leading to significant economic loss due to high morbidity, mortality, trade restrictions and embargoes. This disease has been present in India for the past 96 years, since 1928. Antigenic differences among Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains are resulting in massive outbreaks in vaccinated and un-vaccinated poultry flocks around the globe. Synanthropic bird reservoirs contribute significantly to the extensive genetic diversity of the virus. This diversity, along with the vulnerability of many avian species, has led to diagnostic and vaccination failures. The genetic attributes of the circulating strains in India, meanwhile, remain mostly undisclosed. Ongoing evolution of spectrum of NDV genotypes in India, this review paper underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and adaptation of vaccination strategies to address emerging variants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b2703b990165c417c90fc4102dd9ae872993d1ef6c8645536a3bba8677a377a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
