{"title":"266 Evaluation of anchovy fish meal with or without added fish solubles on nursery pig performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/167/7664894?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two experiments were conducted in a commercial environment to evaluate anchovy fish meal with or without added anchovy fish solubles on nursery pig performance. In Exp. 1, pigs [n = 2,172; initial body weight (BW) = 5.2 kg] were randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. There were 25 or 27 pigs/pen and 14 replications/treatment. Dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal-based and consisted of: 1) diet containing 7.0% enzymatically treated soybean meal (HP 300; Hamlet Protein; Findlay, OH), 2) diet with 3.5% spray-dried bovine plasma (APC Inc, Ankeny, IA), 3) diet with 5.0% microbially enhanced soybean meal (MEPro, Prairie Aquatech, Brookings, SD), 4) diet with 5.2% microbially enhanced soybean meal with added anchovy fish solubles (TASA, Lima, Peru), 5) diet with 4.85% anchovy fish meal (TASA Prime, TASA, Lima, Peru), and 6) diet with 5.1% anchovy fish meal with added fish solubles (TASA Swine, TASA, Lima, Peru). In Exp. 2, pigs (n = 1,134; initial BW = 4.7 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments. There were 27 pigs/pen and 14 replications/treatment. Dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal-based consisting of a control diet containing enzymatically treated soybean meal at 7.0% of the diet, a diet containing 5.1% anchovy fish meal, and a diet containing 5.3% anchovy fish meal with added anchovy fish solubles. All protein sources in both trials were added on an SID Lys basis to maintain the same level of soybean meal across all dietary treatments. For both experiments, pigs were fed treatments for approximately 21 d in two phases based on feed budgets of 2.3 kg and 5.4 kg/pig in phases 1 and 2, respectively. For Exp. 1, diets contained 18.0 and 7.2% lactose for phase 1 and 2, respectively. For Exp. 2, diets contained 16.0 and 6.6% lactose for phase 1 and 2, respectively. Following experimental diets, all pigs were fed a common corn-soybean meal-based diet until the completion of the study. For Exp. 1, from d 0 to 21, pigs fed spray-dried bovine plasma or anchovy fish meal had increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) compared with pigs fed anchovy fish meal with solubles with other treatments intermediate (Table). For Exp. 2, there were no differences in growth performance throughout the experimental period (d 0 to 21; <span>P</span> &gt; 0.10); however, during the common period (d 21 to 42), pigs previously fed anchovy fish meal with added fish solubles had increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) gain to feed ratio (G:F) compared with pigs fed the control diet with those fed anchovy fish meal alone intermediate. In conclusion, both experiments indicate anchovy fish meal can be used in nursery pig diets; however, further analysis is warranted to confirm the results of fish meal with solubles from Exp. 2.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d9e5363d22ffe705686e0a63f869cb4cc43cd7551c4339d763abf6dd37905707","category":"Environment"}
