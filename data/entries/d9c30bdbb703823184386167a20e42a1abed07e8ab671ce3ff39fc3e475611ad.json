{"title":"Corneal Epithelial Wavefront Error as a Novel Objective Biomarker Diagnostic Marker for Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2276/v1","date":1725038456000,"content":"Synopsis\nCorneal epithelial wavefront error and epithelial thickness variance qualify as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD). The biomarkers show a normalization after treatment of EBMD with phototherapeutic keratectomy.\n\nPurpose: To gauge the diagnostic value of a novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) based imaging modality for simultaneous morphological (thickness profile) and refractive (optical wavefront) assessment of the corneal epithelial layer in one of the most common but often underdiagnosed corneal dystrophies: epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD).\t\n\nMethods: In this prospective observational study, a total of 32 eyes of 32 patients diagnosed with EBMD and 32 eyes of 32 healthy control subjects were examined with high-resolution anterior segment SD-OCT (MS-39; CSO, Florence, Italy). Various epithelial thickness and epithelial wavefront derived terms were compared between groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to analyze the diagnostic capacity of the respective parameters. A total of 17 of 32 EBMD patients underwent treatment with phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) and were followed up for 3 months.\t\n\nResults: Epithelial thickness variance (60.4 ± 56.7 µm versus 7.6 ± 6.1 µm) and interquartile range (11.0±6.9 versus 3.3±1.9 µm) were markedly elevated in EBMD patients as compared with healthy controls (both with p &lt; 0.001). Epithelial wavefront analysis showed a highly statistically significant excess in all examined aberration terms in EBMD patients (all with p &lt; 0.001). Significantly greater areas under the curve (AUC) were yielded by the epithelial wavefront derived parameters (e.g. total epithelial wavefront error: AUC = 0.966; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.932 – 1) than by the epithelial thickness-derived parameters (e.g., variance: AUC = 0.919; 95% CI 0.848 – 0.990). \t\n \t\nConclusion: Corneal epithelial wavefront aberrometry proved valuable as an objective biomarker for EBMD with high sensitivity and specificity. PTK resulted in a reduction of morphological and refractive epithelial irregularities in EBMD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9c30bdbb703823184386167a20e42a1abed07e8ab671ce3ff39fc3e475611ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
