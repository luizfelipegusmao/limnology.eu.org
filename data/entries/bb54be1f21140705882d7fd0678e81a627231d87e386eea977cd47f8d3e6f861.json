{"title":"Cu-Polymetallic Deposit Exploration under Thick Cover in Gucheng-Yaxi Area Using Audio Magnetotelluric and Spread Spectrum Induced Polarization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1860/v1","date":1716890529000,"content":"Successful geophysical exploration works in Gucheng-Yaxi area located in Gaochun District, Jiangsu province, China, have been limited partly due to complex geological condition of the area and high artificial noise in data acquired using electrical and electromagnetic methods. In this work, we deployed the new anti-interference spread spectrum induced polarization method (SSIP) and audio magnetotellurics (AMT) method to detect a copper-polymetallic deposit in the area. Two-dimensional (2D) inversion results at Gucheng-Yaxi Area revealed a high chargeability anomalous zone on SSIP profile that coincided with a zone of moderate resistivity located between two resistor bodies on AMT profile. A follow up 1200 meters drill hole was established at this high chargeability-moderate resistivity zone which encountered polymetallic (copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver) mineralization at the depth â‰¥ 400 m. Drill hole data analysis showed that mineralization occurs interspaced in marble rock mass at varies depth. Furthermore, several low resistivity-weak chargeability sections were revealed and inferred attributed to Cretaceous sediments and faults. These faults are thought to have played critical role in the polymetallic mineralization genesis. In summary, this work demonstrated the successful of application of SSIP and AMT at detecting a metallic deposit in an area with high artificial noise. Hence the geophysical prospection potential of Gucheng-Yaxi area is great.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb54be1f21140705882d7fd0678e81a627231d87e386eea977cd47f8d3e6f861","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
