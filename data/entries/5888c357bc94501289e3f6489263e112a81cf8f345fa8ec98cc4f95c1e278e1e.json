{"title":"Decentralized Wastewater Treatment at the Giniginamar Plant: A Case Study in Efficient Resource Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2024/v1","date":1717067863000,"content":"The only solution to avoid pollution due to sewage is to treat the effluent and reuse water and sludge at the wastewater production site. This makes it necessary to install treatment plants distributed along the sewer system to prevent the movement of effluents with the consequent losses to the aquifer. This new management is called decentralized wastewater treatment. To make this change possible, it is necessary to develop treatment plants that do not represent a health hazard for citizens, eliminating the nuisance caused by traditional plants. These plants need to be robust, operate autonomously, have reduced maintenance and exhaustive control of each process, where each cubic meter of effluent is perfectly controlled, avoiding losses to the aquifer or discharges that may occur due to deficiencies in their purification capacity; constantly producing water and sludge, which are directly reusable with all the health and environmental guarantees regardless of variations in inlet effluent or environmental conditions. This article presents a paradigmatic case of a decentralized solution with conditions of maximum complexity that has been solved efficiently, saving around 98% of the initial investment, completely avoiding wastewater discharges into the environment and reusing 100% of the treated water, in 14 years of operation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5888c357bc94501289e3f6489263e112a81cf8f345fa8ec98cc4f95c1e278e1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
