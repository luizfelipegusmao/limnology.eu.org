{"title":"Genomic Selection for Growth and Wood Traits in Castanopsis hystrix","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0713/v1","date":1720507504000,"content":"Castanopsis hystrix, a precious tree species in Southeast Asia, has the advantages of rapid growth and high-quality wood materials. However, there are problems such as long breeding cycle, time-consuming and low efficiency, which greatly restricts the industrial development of C. hystrix. To perform the genome selection (GS) for growth and wood traits and the early selection of superior progeny have great significance for the rapid breeding of new superior varieties of C. hystrix. The 226 clones in the main distribution and 479 progenies within 23 half-sib families were used as experimental materials in this study. Genotyping datasets were obtained by high-throughput re-sequencing technology, and GS studies were conducted on the growth (tree height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH)) and wood (wood density (WD), fiber length (FL), and fiber length-width ratio (LWR)) traits. The coefficient of variation (CV) of five phenotypic traits ranged from 10.1% to 22.73%, the average CV of growth traits was 19.93%, and the average CV of wood traits was 9.72%. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the five traits were almost significantly positive. Based on the Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) model, the broad-sense heritabilities of growth traits were higher than those of wood quality traits, and the different number of SNPs had little effect on the heritability estimation. GS prediction accuracy first increased and then reached a plateau around 3K SNPs for all five traits. The broad-sense heritability of these five traits was significantly positively correlated with their GS predictive ability (r=0.564, P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a28baac100754e6ae418a6439c3347f0e64b031a4aa546a953849ab512e8a5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
