{"title":"DHAFormer: Dual-channel hybrid attention network with transformer for polyp segmentation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306596","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Xuejie Huang, Liejun Wang, Shaochen Jiang, Lianghui Xu</p>\r\n\r\nThe accurate early diagnosis of colorectal cancer significantly relies on the precise segmentation of polyps in medical images. Current convolution-based and transformer-based segmentation methods show promise but still struggle with the varied sizes and shapes of polyps and the often low contrast between polyps and their background. This research introduces an innovative approach to confronting the aforementioned challenges by proposing a Dual-Channel Hybrid Attention Network with Transformer (DHAFormer). Our proposed framework features a multi-scale channel fusion module, which excels at recognizing polyps across a spectrum of sizes and shapes. Additionally, the frameworkâ€™s dual-channel hybrid attention mechanism is innovatively conceived to reduce background interference and improve the foreground representation of polyp features by integrating local and global information. The DHAFormer demonstrates significant improvements in the task of polyp segmentation compared to currently established methodologies.","author":"Xuejie Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"81134e0fc2e717a0e6c70292ea9ab5bb017520c6a0d570cbcb3864764beb6e1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
