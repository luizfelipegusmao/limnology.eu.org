{"title":"Image Segmentation Using 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform for Medical Image","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1507/v1","date":1716444472000,"content":"Medical image segmentation is a critical step in various healthcare applications, aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of a segmentation approach based on the 2D wavelet transform. Leveraging a dataset comprising 10 diverse medical images, we evaluate the performance of our segmentation method using three key metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances segmentation accuracy, offering promising results compared to existing methods. By harnessing the multi-resolution feature extraction capabilities of the 2D wavelet transform, our method achieves improved delineation of medical image structures, paving the way for more accurate and efficient healthcare interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31e2e4520a3818010158bc81e94772756d231d4fde3664e6da9d8b1976f2901a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
