{"title":"Effective Strategies and a Ten-Point Plan for Cardio-Kidney-Metabolic Health in Croatia. An Expert Opinion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1440/v1","date":1726740415000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, including in Croatia. Since most patients have multiple disorders and diseases caused largely by the same risk factors, and as it is essential to approach each patient as a person with all disorders, today we are talking about a new paradigm - cardio-renal-metabolic (CKM) syndrome and cardio-renal-metabolic health, which necessarily includes brain health. Elevated systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, impaired renal function or chronic kidney disease, which all stem from insufficient physical activity, unhealthy diet with excessive intake of table salt, and air pollution, are the leading causes of overall morbidity and mortality from CKM diseases, especially mortality from CVD. Experts from various fields key to CKM health have written this document with the aim of integrating it as part of the national plan for the prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases with a focus on CVD, which should become mandatory and be based on the existing guidelines of professional societies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a33e20fd0574e844deb84c8ecc1cc1362f3ee3ffa52fca69d74808d6c80537b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
