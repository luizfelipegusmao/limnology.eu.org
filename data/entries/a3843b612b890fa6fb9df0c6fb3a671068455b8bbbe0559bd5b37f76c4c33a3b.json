{"title":"Quality assessment of paediatric education and research in southwest China: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301708","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Jing Gao, Haining Zheng, Tingting Wu, Jing Zhu</p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a limited analysis of medical education research both domestically and internationally. To enhance, improve the quality of medical education, this study conducted a quantitative analysis of teaching project data from an affiliated hospital during the period 2016–2022. The results indicated that a total of 133 teaching projects were initiated during this period, with an average age of project leaders being 42.73±6.45 years. Regarding professional ranks and titles, municipal-level project leaders had a high concentration of seniors (48.15%), while at the university-level, most project leaders held the title of deputy seniors (58.82%). At the university-level, project leaders were mainly distributed between deputy senior titles (37.08%) and intermediate titles (38.20%). In terms of research content, nearly half of the studies (46.62%) focused on teaching methods and models. Further regression analysis revealed that professional ranks and titles were an independent factor influencing the project level (P&lt;0. 05). These findings suggest the need for improvement in medical education research, including addressing the uneven distribution of research topics, enhancing the research capacity of junior and mid-career medical education teachers, and improving the dissemination of research results.","author":"Jing Gao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a3843b612b890fa6fb9df0c6fb3a671068455b8bbbe0559bd5b37f76c4c33a3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
