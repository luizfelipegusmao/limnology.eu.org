{"title":"The Ideal Model on the Cosmic Continuum: A Unified Mechanism on Cosmic and Material Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2046/v2","date":1724378841000,"content":"The fundamental divergence in foundation of modern physics lies in the incompatibility between quantum theory and relativity. This study created a relative continuum, found a mathematical tool for the cosmic continuum; proposed dark particle hypothesis, filled gap on minimum existence quantity particle; discovered new equivalence principle, bridged differences in foundation of physics; and established an ideal model, revealed deep essence of cosmic and material structure. In this model, any cosmic system is a continuum composed of existence continuum relative to the wavelength of bosons energy waves and its dimension continuum. This model provides new perspectives on the fundamental problems of physics and cosmology. Firstly, it elucidated the physical mechanism of bosons in fundamental interactions. Secondly, it reconstructed the understanding of the basic unit of the cosmic and material structure. Thirdly, it updated the inherent concepts about the existence form and existence dimension. Fourthly, it restored the causality truth of wave function collapse in quantum mechanics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95847a021b1e2d4658be82ef05d07ff33a888259d12b961a92034fc8a82fc223","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
