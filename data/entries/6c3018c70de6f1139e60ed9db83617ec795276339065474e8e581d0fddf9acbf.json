{"title":"Hemodiafiltration May Be Associated with Senescence-Related Phenotypic Alterations of Lymphocytes Which May Predict Mortality in Dialysis Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2497/v1","date":1722409365000,"content":"Introduction: Senescence-resembling alterations on lymphocytes of dialysis patients have been widely described. However, pathophysiology behind these phenomena has not been clarified. In this study, we examine the impact of dialysis prescription and residual renal function on T and B lymphocytes, in dialysis patients. Methods: T and B cell subsets were determined with flow cytometry in 36 hemodialysis and 26 hemodiafiltration patients, according to the expression of CD45RA, CCR7, CD31, CD28, CD57 and PD1 for T cells, and IgD and CD27 for B cells. Immune phenotype was associated with dialysis modality, hemofiltration volume, and mortality. Results: Compared to hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration patients had significantly decreased percentage of CD4+CD28-CD57- T cells [3.8(2.4-5.3) vs 2.1(1.3-3.3)%, respectively, P=0.002] and exhausted CD4+ T cells [14.1(8.9-19.4) vs 8.5(6.8-11.7)% , respectively, P=0.005]. Additionally, hemofiltration volume was negatively correlated to CD8+ EMRA T cells (r=-0.46, P=0.03). Finally, exhausted CD4+ T cells percentage could predict all-cause mortality in dialysis patients, independently of age. Conclusion: Hemodiafiltration, especially with high hemofiltration volume, may have beneficial effects on senescence-related immune phenotype. Immune phenotype may also be a predicting factor for mortality in dialysis patients","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c3018c70de6f1139e60ed9db83617ec795276339065474e8e581d0fddf9acbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
