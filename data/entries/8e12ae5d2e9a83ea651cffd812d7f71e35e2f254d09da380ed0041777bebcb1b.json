{"title":"Monte-Carlo Simulation of Reliability of System with Complex Interconnections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1860/v1","date":1721747328000,"content":"Modern automotive systems should must satisfy strict reliability requirements. Most of the real vehicle systems and safety-critical networks have complex interconnections. Sensitivities and probabilistic uncertainties of reliability of System with Complex Interconnections (SwCI) can be investigated by the Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS). The paper focuses on sensitivities and parametrical uncertainties of SwCIs reliability. The proposed method can be used forimplemented in the investigation of uncertainties of SwCIs reliability â€“ in other wordsi.e., for in the determination of critical system elements and to estimateion of the Required Number of Spare Parts (RNSP) of the system, which depends on the probability of allowable spare equipment shortage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e12ae5d2e9a83ea651cffd812d7f71e35e2f254d09da380ed0041777bebcb1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
