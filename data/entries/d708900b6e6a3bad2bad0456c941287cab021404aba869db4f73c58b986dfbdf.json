{"title":"New Valid and Reliable Test to Assess Glenohumeral Rotation Range of Movement in Clinical Practice, Injury Prevention Programs and Evaluation of Treatment Response in Overhead Athletes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0963/v1","date":1728719591000,"content":"The measurement of shoulder range of motion (ROM) has gained value within the healthcare field. Thanks to modern technology, goniometers have been developed as mobile applications; however, the reliability and validity of many of these apps have not been established. Such is the case of reliability of the OnForm app and validity of the My ROM app, object of this study. Methods: With data obtained from both apps from the measurement of bilateral external and internal rotation (at 90º of shoulder abduction) of 49 subjects, four different tests were run: inter-observer, test-retest, and intra-observer and one for validity. The statistical method applied was the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Both, OnForm and My ROM obtained in all the tests, significant results that prove that they are valid and reliable tools for athletes’ assessment. Conclusions: Both OnForm and My ROM are valid and reliable tools for daily use in clinical practice. They may be used by a single evaluator, they are easy to find with a convenient price, and the availability of the results is immediate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d708900b6e6a3bad2bad0456c941287cab021404aba869db4f73c58b986dfbdf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
