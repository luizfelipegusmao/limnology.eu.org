The rise of online Open Access (OA) publications that are immediately available to readers everywhere free of charge has transformed the publishing landscape in the past decades. I offer a translation of this article into Brazilian Portuguese as my own attempt to improve access to scientific content (Supplementary Information, SI). In this article, I introduce OA publishing in the context of the aquatic sciences.
