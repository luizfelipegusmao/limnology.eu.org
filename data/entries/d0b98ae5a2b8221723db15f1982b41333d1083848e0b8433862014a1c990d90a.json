Despite growing evidence that visual adaptations to light underly the ecology and evolution of the avian tree of life, no comprehensive comparative analysis of visual acuity as approximated by eyes size exists for the global aquatic avifauna.\n\nHere, I use Stanley Ritland's unpublished dataset of measurements for axial length collected from museum specimens to explore the ecology and evolution of eye size variation for half of the aquatic avifauna (<i>N</i> = 464 species).\n\nAfter correcting for body mass allometry and incorporating phylogenetic relationships, aquatic species had significantly smaller eyes compared to terrestrial species. Furthermore, species using hyperopic foraging manoeuvres, exhibiting carnivorous and insectivorous diets, and displaying nocturnal behaviour had larger eyes. Plunge-divers (e.g. boobies and tropic birds) and stalkers (e.g. herons) had the largest relative eye sizes, especially species identifying prey at higher altitudes or longer distances. Underwater pursuit-divers foraging at greater depths had larger eyes, likely due to the dramatic attenuation of light in the deep ocean. Overall, residual eye size was phylogenetically conserved (<i>l</i> = 0.94), with phylogeny alone explaining 62% of residual eye size variation.\n\nCollectively, these results suggest that the relatively bright environments found in aquatic ecosystems negate the adaptive benefits of costly metabolic investments associated with developing and maintaining larger eyes, while also reducing the potential occurrence of disability glare. Strong correlations between eye size and foraging ecology in different aquatic environments corroborate similar comparative studies of terrestrial birds and underscore the central role that vision has played in driving the ecology and evolution of the global avifauna.\n</p>","author":"Ian J.
