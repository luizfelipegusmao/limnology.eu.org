{"title":"AutoTrendyKeywords: Real-Time AI-Driven Trend-Based SEO Using LLMs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1164/v1","date":1728974623000,"content":"Considering the evolution of search engine optimization (SEO) methods, it is crucial to generate and update relevant keywords continuously based on trends in a dynamic method to maintain the relevance and visibility of a web page, which enhances user engagement. To automate the process of continuous SEO, this paper proposes a method called AutoTrendyKeywords to leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate the constant generation of SEO keywords and the selection of trending keywords based on changing data. Unlike the manual selection method, the new system automatically uses real-time trend data from sources such as Google Trends. This unsupervised approach ensures up-to-date relevance of the page and can ensure satisfactory traffic for pages in unpopular languages when the web is dominated by content in popular languages. Additionally, the system offers transparency to understand the reason behind each keyword selected. The method streamlines the keyword update process for digital content creators and marketers by eliminating the need for manual intervention, thereby constantly ensuring visibility across search results. The system has wide-ranging societal benefits, such as facilitating access to desired information and promoting diverse languages. The system successfully generated keywords using an LLM, selected the most trending keywords, generated a title and description of the page for SEO, and integrated the keywords and the description into HTML code. The system generated URL paths that are short and contain the trending keywords.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d94d985676a9c6c1eab74974094df4632a6a32284f570cb23493674e79b39a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
