{"title":"A Comprehensive Research on Unclamped-Inductive-Switching (UIS)-Induced Electrical Parameters Degradations and Optimizations for 4H-SiC Trench MOSFETs Structures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0880/v1","date":1715612536000,"content":"In this paper, single and repetitive frequency UIS characteristics of 1200 V asymmetric (AT)and double trench silicon carbide (DT-SiC) metalâ€“oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) under different working conditions are investigated by experiment and simulation. For asymmetric trench SiC MOSFETs, the failure mode is all thermal runaway under working conditions. However, the failure mode of double trench SiC MOSFETs mostly is gate oxide rupture, which indicates an instable avalanche robustness under UIS stress. The variations of measured parameters are recorded to evaluate typical electrical features of device failure. Furthermore, TCAD simulation is used to reveal the electro-thermal stress inside the device during avalanche. Additionally, failed devices are decapsulated to verify the location of failure point from the perspective of the semiconductor die. Finally, a new type of stepped-oxide vertical power DT MOSFET with P-type shielding and current spread layers is proposed for improvement of gate dielectric reliability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7f55ec594c9cbb2b32f70116c518602f5c7da81800c06227686355998448684","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
