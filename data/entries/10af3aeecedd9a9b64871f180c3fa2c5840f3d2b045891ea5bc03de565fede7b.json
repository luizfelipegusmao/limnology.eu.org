External HIV-related stigma impedes both HIV prevention and access to health care and reduces the quality of treatment and care received. This study examined the prevalence of and factors associated with higher levels of HIV-related stigma among youth and adults 15 years and older in South Africa. The analysis used a nationally representative population-based household survey data collected using a multistage cluster random sampling design. Exploratory factor analysis was used to calculate the primary outcome (higher and lower HIV stigma index scores above and below the mean, respectively), based on the total number of factors retained from the 10 item self-reported questions relating to attitudes and beliefs against PLHIV. Bivariate and multivariate generalised linear models with a log link and binomial distribution were fitted to estimate crude and adjusted risk ratios (ARR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors associated with external HIV-related stigma. Of 38 919 respondents, 49% (49.8%; 95% CI: 48.6–51.1) were categorised as having higher levels of external HIV-related stigma. Higher levels of HIV-related stigma were significantly associated with those who had secondary level education than those with no education/primary education [ARR = 1.14 (95% CI: 1.05–1.24), p = 0.002], those employed than unemployed [ARR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02–1.14), p = 0.006], those in rural areas than urban areas [ARR = 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07–1.23), p&lt;0.001], those who were aware of their HIV status than not aware [ARR = 1.34 (95% CI: 1.12–1.61), p&lt;0.001], those who were HIV positive than HIV negative [ARR = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02–1.17), p = 0.018], and those with no correct HIV knowledge and myth rejection than their counterparts [ARR = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03–1.15), p = 0.002]. The findings highlight the need for peer-facilitated HIV-stigma reduction interventions targeting all types of educational institutions and the strengthening of work-based interventions. The findings emphasise the prioritisation of rural informal settings/tribal areas when developing and implementing HIV stigma reduction interventions. The study suggests that stigma reduction should be considered an important component of HIV testing and awareness. Addressing public misconceptions about HIV can mitigate externalised stigma.","author":"Vuyelwa Mehlomakulu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"10af3aeecedd9a9b64871f180c3fa2c5840f3d2b045891ea5bc03de565fede7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
