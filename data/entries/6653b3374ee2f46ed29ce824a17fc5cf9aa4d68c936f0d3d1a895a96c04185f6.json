{"title":"Oral processing behavior and dental caries; an insight into a new relationship","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306143","date":1719928800000,"content":"<p>by Melanie F. Alazzam, Issam B. Rasheed, Suhad H. Aljundi, Dalal A. Shamiyah, Yousef S. Khader, Reem S. Abdelhafez, Mohammad S. Alrashdan</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Previous evidence suggests an individual variation in the preferred oral processing behavior. Individuals can be classified as firm processing(FPL) or soft processing likers(SPL). FPL(crunchers and chewers) prefer using their teeth while SPL(smooshers and suckers) prefer using the tongue and the palate when processing different food items. Variation in the preferred oral processing behavior has been associated with differences in food texture preference and eating time. Time is one of the factors directly related to the development of dental caries(tooth decay). Oral retention and eating times are associated with greater caries experience. This study aims to explore if a relationship exists between the preferred oral processing behavior and the individual’s caries experience.</p> Materials and methods <p>This was a cross-sectional, dental center-based study conducted at Jordan University of Science and Technology. Five hundred participants consented to fill out the preferred oral processing behavior(POPB) questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements (including weight, height, and waist circumference) were recorded. A single trained and calibrated dentist registered each participant’s caries experience and plaque levels using the DMFS index and plaque index of Silness and Loe.</p> Results <p>A total of 351(70.2%) and 149(29.8%) participants were typed as FPL and SPL, respectively. SPL demonstrated higher levels of dental caries experience compared to FPL. The mean DMFS score for SPL was 28.8(±25.43) while for FPL was 18.71(± 18.34). This difference remained significant after adjustment for confounders(P&lt;0.001). SPL exhibited a significantly higher mean score for the “M” component(P &lt;0.001) while no significant difference in the mean score of the “D”(P = 0.076) and “F”(P = 0.272) components was observed when compared to FPL.</p> Conclusion <p>The current findings provide new insight into a possible relationship between the preferred oral processing behavior and an individual’s caries experience. A relationship in which the preferred oral processing behavior can potentially affect and/or be affected by the dental caries experience.</p>","author":"Melanie F.
