{"title":"Aneurysmal Wall Enhancement of Non-ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms after Endovascular Treatment Correlates with Higher Aneurysm Reperfusion Rates, but Only in Large Aneurysms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1964/v1","date":1719495156000,"content":"Aneurysmal wall enhancement (AWE) of non-ruptured sacular intracranial aneurysms (IA) after endovascular treatment (ET) is a frequently observed imaging finding. So far, its value remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of AWE on aneurysm reperfusion rates in a longitudinal cohort. This is a retrospective MRI study over the timespan of up to 5 years, assessing the correlation of increased AWE of non-ruptured IAs and events of aneurysm reperfusion and retreatment, PHASES Score and grade of AWE. T1 SPACE fat saturation (FS) and T1 SE FS blood suppression sequences after contrast administration were used for visual interpretation of increased AWE. The IAs’ sizes were assessed via the biggest diameter. The grade of enhancement was defined in a grading system from grade 1 to grade 3. 127 consecutive non ruptured IA-patients (58.9 ± 9.0 years, 94 female, 33 male) who underwent elective aneurysm occlusion were included. AWE was observed in 40.2% of patients (51/127) after ET, 6 patients already showed AWE before treatment. In large IAs (which were defined as a single maximum diameter of over 7.5mm,) AWE was significantly associated with aneurysm reperfusion in contrast to large aneurysm without AWE (p = 000.1). All grades of AWE were significantly associated with reperfusion. Our data suggests that in patients with initially large IAs, AWE is correlated with aneurysm reperfusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca0f82d8ae7d21c61e60d2c8ed074017cf3ebf2c5efb441df0d6dbf01077718c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
