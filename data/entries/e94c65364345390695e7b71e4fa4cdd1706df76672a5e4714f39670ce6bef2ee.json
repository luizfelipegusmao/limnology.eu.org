{"title":"Obesity Control and Supplementary Nutraceuticals as Co-Factors of Brain Plasticity in Multiple Sclerosis Populations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1943/v2","date":1725849541000,"content":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration within the central nervous system. Brain plasticity, the brain's ability to adapt its structure and function, plays a crucial role in mitigating MS's impact. This paper explores the potential benefits of lifestyle changes and nutraceuticals on brain plasticity in MS population. Lifestyle modifications, including physical activity and dietary adjustments, can enhance brain plasticity by upregulating neurotrophic factors, promoting synaptogenesis, and reducing oxidative stress. Nutraceuticals, such as vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid, have shown promise in supporting brain health through anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms. Regular physical activity has been linked to increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and improved cognitive function. Dietary interventions, including caloric restriction and the intake of polyphenols, can also positively influence brain plasticity. Integrating these lifestyle changes and nutraceuticals into the management of MS could provide a complementary approach to traditional therapies, potentially improving neurological outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for MS population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e94c65364345390695e7b71e4fa4cdd1706df76672a5e4714f39670ce6bef2ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
