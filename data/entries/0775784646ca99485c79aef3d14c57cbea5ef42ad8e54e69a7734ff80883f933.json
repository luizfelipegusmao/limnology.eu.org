Recalcitrant (mainly mineral-associated organic matter) and labile (mainly particulate organic matter) organic materials differ dramatically in nature. Yet, the patterns and drivers of recalcitrant (<i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub>) and labile (<i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub>) organic N mineralization rates and their consequences on ecosystem N retention are still unclear. By collecting <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub> (299 observations) and <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub> (299 observations) from 57 <sup>15</sup>N tracing studies, we found that soil pH and total N were the master factors controlling <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub> and <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub>, respectively. This was consistent with the significantly higher rates of <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub> in alkaline soils and of <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub> in natural ecosystems. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub> directly stimulated microbial N immobilization and plant N uptake, while <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub> stimulated the soil gross autotrophic nitrification which discouraged ammonium immobilization and accelerated nitrate production. We also noted that <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub> was more efficient at lower precipitation and higher temperatures due to increased soil pH. In contrast, <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub> was more efficient at higher precipitation and lower temperatures due to increased soil total N. Overall, we suggest that increasing <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nrec</sub> may lead to a conservative N cycle, improving the ecosystem services and functions, while increasing <i>M</i>\n<sub>Nlab</sub> may stimulate the potential risk of soil N loss.</p>","author":"Shending Chen, \nAhmed S.
