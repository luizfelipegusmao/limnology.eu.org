{"title":"Low-Cost Adsorbent Production within a Circular Economy Approach: Desalination Brine Pretreated Spruce Sawdust for Methylene Blue adsorption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0244/v1","date":1722913141000,"content":"A sustainable low cost activated carbon substitute was produced based on pretreated lignocellulosic biomass, especially spruce sawdust. A harmful liquid waste, desalination brine was used for the treatment of a solid wood industry waste, spruce sawdust. This approach is in the circular economy theory and aims to the decarbonization of the economy. The pretreated sawdust was tested as an adsorbent appropriate for the removal of a commonly used pollutant, methylene blue, from industrial wastewater. The adsorption capacity of the pretreated material was found to increased four times comparing to the untreated one in the case that the Freundlich equation was fitted to the isothermsâ€™ data. The treatment experimental conditions with desalination brine that gave maximum adsorption capacity correspond to 1.97 combined severity factor in logarithmic form value. The same adsorption capacity was found to increase five to six times comparing to the untreated spruce sawdust in the case that the Langmuir isotherm model was applied at the same data. Moreover, kinetic experiment was cried out as regards the methylene blue adsorption process. The desalination brine pretreated sawdust adsorption capacity increased 1.4 times comparing to the untreated one, in the case of the Lagergren kinetic equation fitting. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of the same material was increased 1.6 times when the second order kinetic model was applied to the same data. Industrial scale applications can be based on the kinetic data findings as they have to do with a very shorter adsorption period comparing to the isotherm data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8707f145bfa0c709d5405ee056bee9972222c612bf98297c683e101039242c62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
