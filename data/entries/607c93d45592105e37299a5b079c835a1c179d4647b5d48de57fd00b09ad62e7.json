{"title":"Evaluation of Superparamagnetic Fe3O4-Ag Decorated Nanoparticles: Cytotoxicity Studies in Human Fibroblasts (HFF-1) and Breast Cancer Cells (MCF-7)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0009/v1","date":1719818074000,"content":"This study investigates the cytotoxicity profile of superparamagnetic Fe3O4-Ag decorated nanoparticles against human fibroblasts (HFF-1) and breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The nanoparticles underwent comprehensive characterization employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and magnetic assays including hysteresis curves and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) plots. Notably, the nanoparticles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior as evidenced by magnetic studies. Remarkably, cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that both HFF-1 and MCF-7 cells maintained nearly 100% viability upon nanoparticle exposure. These results underscore the outstanding biocompatibility of Fe3O4/Ag decorated nanoparticles, suggesting their potential utility in biomedical applications such as drug delivery and magnetic targeting without inducing significant cytotoxic effects. This investigation advances our understanding of the behavior of nanostructured materials in biological settings and highlights their promising prospects in biomedicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"607c93d45592105e37299a5b079c835a1c179d4647b5d48de57fd00b09ad62e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
