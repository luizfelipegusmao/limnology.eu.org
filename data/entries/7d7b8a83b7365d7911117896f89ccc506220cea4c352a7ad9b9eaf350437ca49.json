These roots play an important role in acquiring water and nutrients, facilitating below-ground exploration, and aiding in anchoring both young and established plants to their growth substrate. LR formation is so important, in fact, that it is a defining feature of all extant euphyllophytes (<a href=\"#koae079-B1\">Hetherington et al. 2020</a>). Understanding root plasticity and the regulatory mechanisms controlling the seemingly spontaneous formation of these post-embryonic organs therefore goes hand-in-hand with our understanding of plant adaptation and evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"7d7b8a83b7365d7911117896f89ccc506220cea4c352a7ad9b9eaf350437ca49","category":"Environment"}
