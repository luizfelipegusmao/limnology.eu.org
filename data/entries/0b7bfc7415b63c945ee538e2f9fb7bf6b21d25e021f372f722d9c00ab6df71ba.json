It remains technically challenging to characterize interfacial behaviors in the nanoscale under different conditions such as heat. Standard measurement techniques often provide only global averages and local determination such as strain across grain boundaries or evolution of lattice parameters remain technically challenging [<a href=\"#ozae044.146-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.146-B3\">3</a>]. Here, we use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with advanced post-processing to produce strain and lattice parameter maps across a grain boundary in copper (Cu) bicrystals as a function of temperature. Determining the local interfacial behavior aids our understanding of structure-dependent properties that can be significant in polycrystalline materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0b7bfc7415b63c945ee538e2f9fb7bf6b21d25e021f372f722d9c00ab6df71ba","category":"Environment"}
