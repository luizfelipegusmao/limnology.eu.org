{"title":"Most Colorectal Hyperplastic Nodules Represent Polypoid Colitis Nucleomigrans - A New Challenge in Classifying Colorectal Mucosal Tumor-Like Lesions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.1700/v2","date":1711728604000,"content":"Hyperplastic nodules (HNs) are benign polypoid lesions of the colorectal mucosa reportedly caused by hyperplasia of the crypt epithelial cells. They differ from hyperplastic polyps because the crypts do not have histologically serrated changes. HNs often occur in the rectal mucosa and tend to be multifocal. We have proposed a new colitis nucleomigrans (CN) concept as the third type of microscopic colitis. Our histopathological criteria of CN include: i) chained nuclear migration to the middle part of the surface-lining columnar epithelium, ii) apoptotic nuclear debris scattered in the eosinophilic cytoplasm underneath the nuclei, and iii) mild to moderate chronic inflammation in the lamina propria. Immunostaining for cleaved-caspase 3 revealed apoptotic bodies. In this study, we report that most HN lesions share the histological features with CN, representing polypoid CN. We evaluated 108 lesions of HN in total, and 94 (87%) were reclassified as polypoid CN. In the polypoid CN, the lamina propria mucosae were uniformly edematous, suggesting that accelerated apoptosis of the mucosal surface epithelium may cause osmotic dysregulation to form localized mucosal elevations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58ffe1953e1ee2945e630bc1d31674ea8960b645c5db059c3a017f213bc6a588","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
