{"title":"The associations between functional dyspepsia and potential risk factors: A comprehensive Mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302809","date":1715176800000,"content":"<p>by Zeyu Wang, Tangyi Liu, Dan Cao, Hui Luo, Ze Yang, Xiaoyu Kang, Yanglin Pan</p>\r\nBackground <p>Previous cross-sectional studies have identified multiple potential risk factors for functional dyspepsia (FD). However, the causal associations between these factors and FD remain elusive. Here we aimed to fully examine the causal relationships between these factors and FD utilizing a two-sample MR framework.</p> Methods <p>A total of 53 potential FD-related modifiable factors, including those associated with hormones, metabolism, disease, medication, sociology, psychology, lifestyle and others were obtained through a comprehensive literature review. Independent genetic variants closely linked to these factors were screened as instrumental variables from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). A total of 8875 FD cases and 320387 controls were available for the analysis. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the primary analytical approach to assess the relationship between genetic variants of risk factors and the FD risk. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the consistency of the findings using the weighted median model, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO methods.</p> Results <p>Genetically predicted depression (OR 1.515, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.231 to 1.865, p = 0.000088), gastroesophageal reflux disease (OR 1.320, 95%CI 1.153 to 1.511, p = 0.000057) and years of education (OR 0.926, 95%CI 0.894 to 0.958, p = 0.00001) were associated with risk for FD in univariate MR analyses. Multiple medications, alcohol consumption, poultry intake, bipolar disorder, mood swings, type 1 diabetes, elevated systolic blood pressure and lower overall health rating showed to be suggestive risk factors for FD (all p&lt;0.05 while â‰¥0.00167). The positive causal relationship between depression, years of education and FD was still significant in multivariate MR analyses.</p> Conclusions <p>Our comprehensive MR study demonstrated that depression and lower educational attainment were causal factors for FD at the genetic level.</p>","author":"Zeyu Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"76d5b24112fe665aea2852ca6f7f2822f41be2aab20e18e6d088de2deb39f5e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
