{"title":"Novel Technologies towards the Implementation and Exploitation of “Green” Wireless Agriculture Sensors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1519/v1","date":1713933451000,"content":"The manuscript presents the use of three novel technologies for the implementation of wireless green battery-less sensors that can be used in agriculture. The three technologies, namely additive manufacturing, energy harvesting, and wireless power transfer from airborne transmitters carried from UAVs, are considered for smart agriculture applications. Additive manufacturing is exploited for the implementation of both RFID based sensors and passive sensors based on humidity sensitive materials. A number of energy-harvesting systems at UHF and ISM frequencies are presented which are in position to power platforms of wireless sensors, including humidity and temperature IC sensors used as agriculture sensors. Finally, in order to provide the wireless energy to the soil-based sensors with energy harvesting features, wireless power transfer (WPT) from UAV carried transmitters is utilized. The use of these novel technologies can facilitate the extensive use and exploitation of battery-less wireless sensors which are environmentally friendly and thus “green”. Additionally, it can potentially drive precision agriculture in the next era, through the implementation of a vast network of wireless green sensors which can collect and communicate data, to airborne readers so as to support with data the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based, decision making platforms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"363d5889de156e3fcd956376916c471ca5be4f4810ea38b8a2ba37013ee0cd49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
