This paper discusses methods for addressing this problem using data compression algorithms and the optimization of computational processes. Specifically, we examine research results that demonstrate the potential for significantly reducing energy consumption through mathematical solutions, such as the Riemann Hypothesis. We also present the notarized test results of an image compression program developed by the author. The work was presented at a UN panel session and an ECO webinar, receiving recommendations for implementation in ECO member countries. Additionally, modern technologies for accelerating cryptographic methods and algorithms are considered.The growing energy consumption in the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) industries is becoming an increasingly critical issue.
