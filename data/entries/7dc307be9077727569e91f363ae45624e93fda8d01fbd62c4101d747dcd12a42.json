{"title":"Development and characterization of brain cell line from Trachinotus blochii and its application in virological and gene expression studies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13927?af=R","date":1712742994000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A permanent cell line, SPB (Snubnose pompano brain) was established from <i>Trachinotus blochii</i> by the explant culture method. It has been sub-cultured more than 75 passages and showed optimal growth at 28°C using L-15 medium supplemented with 15% to 20% FBS. The SPB cells were cryopreserved at different passage levels for various applications. SPB cells were composed of fibroblastic and epithelial-like cells. The SPB cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination which was found to be negative. The origin of the SPB cell line from <i>T. blochii</i> was confirmed by amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. The transfection efficiency of SPB cell line is 15% assessed by expression of green fluorescent protein using pEGFP-N1 plasmid. In addition, two CMV promotor plasmids pFNCPE42-DNA and pcDNAVP28 were transfected to SPB cells and it shows high expression levels of FNCP of fish nodavirus and VP28 protein of white spot syndrome virus by immunostaining. The SPB cells showed susceptibility to SJNNV and the infection was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot, ELISA, TCID<sub>50</sub> and RT-qPCR. Experimental infection was carried out in <i>T. blochii</i> using SJNNV propagated in SPB cell line and found 100% mortality with clinical signs. The infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. The SPB cell line can be used for propagation of fish viral pathogens and production of the recombinant proteins.</p>","author":"A. Nafeez Ahmed, \nS. Mithra, \nS. Suryakodi, \nG. Taju, \nM. J.
