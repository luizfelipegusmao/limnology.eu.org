{"title":"Securitising Infrastructure Sustainability: A Case Study on Implementing Resilience Bonds in a China Supply Chain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1827/v1","date":1719373880000,"content":"In response to the escalating climate-related catastrophes of recent decades and their significant impacts on global transportation systems, this study explores the concept of resilience bonds as a novel financial tool for enhancing supply chain sustainability. The research applies a case study from China to demonstrate the application of resilience bonds in funding infrastructure projects that aim to enhance the sustainability and resilience of supply chain networks. The study examines the market mechanisms and valuation models of resilience bonds, assessing their potential to mitigate risks associated with transportation failures and to reduce economic losses from unexpected disruptions. By applying empirical data, the research quantitatively evaluates the impact of resilience bonds on the sustainability and reliability of transportation systems. The findings show that resilience bonds can significantly contribute as a sustainable solution to enhance supply chain resilience and sustainability, offering insightful alternatives for financing resilient infrastructure projects. This study not only supports policymakers, investors, and business leaders in understanding innovative funding mechanisms but also makes a significant contribution to resilience financing for sustainable transportation within supply chains, especially in the context of global disruptions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee5811d0011adbb8c7e5f25efc205f6bd3c7687a774bfd95a0811a7793da7f5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
