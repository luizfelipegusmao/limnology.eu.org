This study investigated movement patterns of sea trout in a coastal fjord at the Swedish Skagerrak region from August 2018 to January 2019, using acoustic telemetry, while assessing these against environmental variables across different spatial and temporal scales. Six acoustic receivers were deployed in the fjord and a river, which flows into the upper reaches of the fjord, with the aim of detecting 20 sea trout that had been tagged with acoustic transmitters. Sea surface temperature and winds (east–west) affected movement patterns of the sea trout the most, while changes in atmospheric pressure were also important, but to a lesser extent. Sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure both had a positive relationship with the number of detections, whereas stronger winds from the east (i.e. from land) resulted in more detections than stronger winds from the west (i.e. from the ocean). In addition, interesting diel (day–night) movement patterns were observed for some fish. A significant positive correlation was also discovered between the weight of the fish and the number of detections. This study offers insight in movements of sea trout that use coastal habitats and how environmental conditions can affect movement patterns in a fjord system. To further our understanding of sea trout movement patterns and connectivity, tracking from river, through fjord, out to sea and at a longer time scale with more variation in fish size would be valuable to understand more about the complex movement dynamics of this important species.</p>","author":"Thomas A.
