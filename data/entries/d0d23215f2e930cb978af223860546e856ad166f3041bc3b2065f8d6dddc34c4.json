Our study aims to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes regarding dementia and Alzheimer’s disease among medical students.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional study was conducted among 393 medical students in Palestine from August 2023 to November 2023. The assessment of knowledge and attitude toward dementia was measured using the Alzheimer’s Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) and Dementia Attitude Scale (DAS). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 26, and the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare the mean between the groups with a 5% significance level.</p> Results <p>The overall mean score of the student’s knowledge of dementia measured by the ADKS was 18.91 (±3.32 SD) out of 30. The mean score of the student’s attitude toward dementia measured by the DAS was 91.68 (±3.32 SD). Clinical students had higher ADKS scores than pre-clinical students (p-value &lt; 0.001). No significant differences in the knowledge and attitudes toward dementia were found between males and females. The medical students’ knowledge and attitude scores were positively correlated (ρ = 0.227, p-value &lt;0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Palestinian medical student’s knowledge about Alzheimer’s disease and dementia is insufficient, with students in the clinical phase showing better understanding than pre-clinical students. The findings highlight a necessity for enhancing the dementia curriculum and conducting further studies to evaluate training’s impact on students’ knowledge and attitudes.</p>","author":"Mohammad Abuawad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d0d23215f2e930cb978af223860546e856ad166f3041bc3b2065f8d6dddc34c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
