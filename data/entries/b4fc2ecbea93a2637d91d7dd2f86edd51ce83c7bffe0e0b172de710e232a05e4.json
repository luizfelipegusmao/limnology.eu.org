{"title":"Fluid Chemical and Isotopic Signatures Insighting the Hydrothermal Control of the Wahongshan-Wenquan Fracture Zone (WWFZ), NE Tibetan Plateau","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0757/v1","date":1712832820000,"content":"Compared to the southern Tibetan Plateau, the northern part has been regarded as relatively lacking geothermal resources. However, there is no lack of natural hot springs exposed in beads along large-scale fracture systems, and research on them is currently limited to individual hot springs or geothermal systems. This paper focuses on the Wahongshan-Wenquan Fracture Zone (WWFZ), analyzes the formation of five hydrothermal activity zones along the fracture zone in terms of differences in the hydrochemical and isotopic composition of the hot water, and then explores the hydrothermal control of hot springs in the zone by the fracture. The results show that the main Fractures of WWFZ is the regional heat-control structures, and the fracture system formed by a small number of near-north-south and near-east-west fractures transversal to it provides a favorable channel for deep hydrothermal convective circulation. Ice and snow melt water from the Ngola Shan Mountains, with an average elevation of more than 4,500 meters above sea level, infiltrates along the fractures and is heated by deep circulation to form deep geothermal reservoirs. There is no detectable contribution of mantle source heat to the hot spring gases, and the heat source is mainly natural heat conduction warming, but the \"Low-Velocity body (LVB)\" in the middle and lower crust of the area may be the primary heat source of the high geothermal background in the area. The hydrochemical components of the hot springs in the area show a certain regularity, and the main ionic components, TDS and water temperature, tend to increase away from the main rupture, reflecting the controlling effect of the WWF on the hydrothermal transport in the area. In the future, the geothermal work in this area should focus on the hydrothermal control properties of different levels, the nature of fractures in the area, and the thermal contribution of LVB in the middle and lower crust.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4fc2ecbea93a2637d91d7dd2f86edd51ce83c7bffe0e0b172de710e232a05e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
