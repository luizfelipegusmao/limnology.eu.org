{"title":"United Nations on Climate Refugees: A Contemporary Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0925/v1","date":1713163658000,"content":"The prevailing challenge in our current era is climate change, a crisis recognized by the global community that has prompted immediate actions to confront and mitigate its consequences. There is a consensus among scientists that human activities, driven by developmental ambitions, are the driving force behind the ongoing climate crisis. “The well-documented aftermath, including the rise in sea levels, coastal erosion, reduced agricultural yields, compromised access to clean water, and health implications, emphasizes the intricate and wide-ranging effects of climate change.” Furthermore, there is an increasing recognition that climate change gives rise to distinct social, economic, and divergent consequences. “Although all countries worldwide will undergo the impacts of climate change, the distribution of these effects will differ among regions, generations, age groups, income levels, occupations, and genders.” Notably, the adverse consequences will disproportionately impact the impoverished, predominantly situated in developing nations. “This paper explores the effects of climate change on displacement and the ensuing refugee dilemma.” It aims to scrutinize the inclusion of climate-induced displacement in the present international framework, encompassing both climate change and refugee regimes. The paper promotes a human rights-centred approach to tackling displacement stemming from climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa240af2e96b4a2f33fccac0c006fcd2eca58710ba879b7c5e64c0dbf5c88409","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
