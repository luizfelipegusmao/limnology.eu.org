{"title":"MRI-Based Brain Tumor Classification Using Dilated Parallel Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Ensemble of Machine Learning Classifiers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0321/v1","date":1715092728000,"content":"Brain tumors are frequently classified with high accuracy using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and better comprehend the spatial connections among pixels in complex pictures. Due to their tiny receptive fields, the majority of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based techniques overfit and are unable to extract global context information from more significant regions. While dilated convolution retains data resolution at the output layer and increases the receptive field without adding computation, stacking several dilated convolutions has the drawback of producing a grid effect. To handle gridding artifacts and extract both coarse and fine features from the images, this research suggests using a dilated parallel deep convolutional neural network (PDCNN) architecture that preserves a wide receptive field. To reduce complexity, initially, input images are resized and then grayscale transformed. Data augmentation has since been used to expand the number of datasets. Dilated PDCNN makes use of the lower computational overhead and contributes to the reduction of gridding artifacts. By contrasting various dilation rates, the global path uses a low dilation rate (2,1,1), while the local path uses a high dilation rate (4,2,1) for decremental even numbers to tackle gridding artifacts and extract both coarse and fine features from the two parallel paths. Using three different types of MRI datasets, the suggested dilated PDCNN with the average ensemble method performs better. The accuracy provided by the Multiclass Kaggle dataset-III, Figshare dataset-II, and Binary tumor identification dataset-I is 98.35%, 98.13%, and 98.67%, respectively. In comparison to state-of-the-art techniques, the suggested structure improves results by extracting both fine and coarse features, making it efficient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5501852e1149db832d374eba74656f7f8f0516b510600132c1229d979f62f5f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
