{"title":"Assessing on-road emission inventory and compatible control measures for morning rush hour in Rasht, Iran: 2030 perspective","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-024-05483-1","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This study aims to estimate morning rush hour on-road emissions in Rasht, the largest city in northern central Iran. The International Vehicle Estimator was found to be more accurate than the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator in predicting on-road emissions in Iran. The real world driving cycle was developed for urban and extra-urban areas, individually. The resuts revealed that the average driving velocity for urban and extra-urban cycles are 20.08 and 29.47 km/h, respectively. CO, VOC, NOx, and SOx have the emission rates of 3850, 330, 290, and 21 kg/h, respectively in 2019. Passenger cars and taxis have the largest share of CO, SOx, and VOC emissions. NOx emission rate in terms of g/(km.vehicle) for bus, truck, minibus, and passenger car is 10.14, 9.41, 6.35, and 0.56, respectively. This is due to the nature of diesel engines, as well as the longer lifespan of diesel vehicles (over 10 years) in Rasht. Per capita emission in Rasht is considerable in comparison with other developing areas worldwide, that is attributed to the improper public and active transportation modes and lack of environmental security perception. Investigating emission control strategies in 2030 horizon revealed that enhancing I/M programs was the most effective scenario, with a 28% reduction. Additionally, using Euro-4 fuel, increasing gasoline prices by 100%, greening public transportation and truck traffic ban in the city center would significantly reduce total emissions about 19%, 16%, 6.5% and 1%, respectively. However, extra-urban road expansion by 33% would lead to an 8% increase in emissions on average.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"d0b830818499e52731682965ff98098d3e618229d3edecd8339dccaf2a5c7de5","category":"Environment"}
