{"title":"Methods for assembling complex mitochondrial genomes in land plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/17/5169/7596290?rss=1","date":1706745600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The large size and complex structural rearrangements inherent in the mitochondrial genomes of land plants pose challenges for their sequencing. Originally, the assembly of these genomes required the cloning of mitochondrial DNA fragments followed by Sanger sequencing. Subsequently, the advent of next-generation sequencing significantly expedited the process. This review highlights examples of plant mitochondrial genome assembly employing various technologies, including 454 sequencing, Illumina short sequencing reads, and Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technology long sequencing reads. The combination of short and long reads in hybrid assembly has proven to be the most efficient approach for achieving reliable assemblies of land plant mitochondrial genomes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"107d3a529cce834ed86f3ae9fa7b667895d400d3bd76822377f6988213ef46ff","category":"Environment"}
