Among them, 21-, 22-, and 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can all trigger gene silencing (<a href=\"#koae239-B4\">Sigman et al. 2021</a>). However, the study of endogenous 22-nt siRNAs has been challenging due to their limited abundance. Researchers using Arabidopsis mutants defective in both cytoplasmic RNA decay and 21-nt siRNA production were able to observe an accumulation of 22-nt siRNAs (<a href=\"#koae239-B5\">Wu et al. 2020</a>).
