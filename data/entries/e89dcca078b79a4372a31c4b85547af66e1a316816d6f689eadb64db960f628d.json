{"title":"Prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> receptor 2 downstream signaling and modulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells from patients with asthma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307750","date":1721916000000,"content":"<p>by Christina Gress, Maximilian Fuchs, Saskia Carstensen-Aurèche, Meike Müller, Jens M. Hohlfeld</p>\r\n\r\nIncreased production of Prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>) is linked to development and progression of asthma and allergy. PGD<sub>2</sub> is rapidly degraded to its metabolites, which initiate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) migration and IL-5/IL-13 cytokine secretion in a PGD<sub>2</sub> receptor 2 (DP<sub>2</sub>)-dependent manner. Blockade of DP<sub>2</sub> has shown therapeutic benefit in subsets of asthma patients. Cellular mechanisms of ILC2 activity in response to PGD<sub>2</sub> and its metabolites are still unclear. We hypothesized that ILC2 respond non-uniformly to PGD<sub>2</sub> metabolites. ILC2s were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with atopic asthma. ILC2s were stimulated with PGD<sub>2</sub> and four PGD<sub>2</sub> metabolites (Δ<sup>12</sup>-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, Δ<sup>12</sup>-PGD<sub>2</sub>, 15-deoxyΔ<sup>12,14</sup>-PGD<sub>2</sub>, 9α,11β-PGF<sub>2</sub>) with or without the selective DP<sub>2</sub> antagonist fevipiprant. Total RNA was sequenced, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified by DeSeq2. Differential gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory DEGs in ILC2s stimulated with PGD<sub>2</sub> (14 DEGs), Δ<sup>12</sup>-PGD<sub>2</sub> (27 DEGs), 15-deoxyΔ<sup>12,14</sup>-PGD<sub>2</sub> (56 DEGs) and Δ<sup>12</sup>-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (136 DEGs), but not with 9α,11β-PGF<sub>2</sub>. Common upregulated DEGs were i.e. ARG2, SLC43A2, LAYN, IGFLR1, or EPHX2. Inhibition of DP<sub>2</sub> via fevipiprant mainly resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as DUSP4, SPRED2, DUSP6, ETV1, ASB2, CD38, ADGRG1, DDIT4, TRPM2, or CD69. DEGs were related to migration and various immune response-relevant pathways such as “<i>chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 production</i>”, “<i>cell migration”</i>, <i>“interleukin-13 production”</i>, <i>“regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT”</i>, or <i>“lymphocyte apoptotic process”</i>, underlining the pro-inflammatory effects of PGD<sub>2</sub> metabolite-induced immune responses in ILC2s as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of DP<sub>2</sub> inhibition via fevipiprant. Furthermore, PGD<sub>2</sub> and metabolites showed distinct profiles in ILC2 activation. Overall, these results expand our understanding of DP<sub>2</sub> initiated ILC2 activity.","author":"Christina Gress","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e89dcca078b79a4372a31c4b85547af66e1a316816d6f689eadb64db960f628d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
