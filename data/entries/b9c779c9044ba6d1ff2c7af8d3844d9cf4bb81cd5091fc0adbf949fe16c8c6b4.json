However, service utilization could in turn influenced by the womenâ€™s satisfaction with the service provided by the health care providers. In addition, their satisfactions with the institutional delivery service remains understudied. Assessment of the maternal satisfaction with maternal health service is a major input to improve maternal health services. Objective: To assess the maternal satisfaction with maternal health service and its predictors among the women who gave birth in last 12 months in Darara district, Southern Ethiopia.Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was done using a mixed method among the sample of 520 women in Darara district, South Ethiopia from June 1-30, 2023. A systematic and purposive sampling procedure was utilized to choice the study subjects. A structured, validated and pretested interview-administrated questionnaire and in-depth interview were utilized to collect the data. The data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. The chi-square (X2) test was utilized to determine the overall association between independent and dependent variables. Both bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Important assumptions of the binary logistic regression were checked to be satisfied. The coding and analysis of the qualitative data were done using thematic content analysis technique by Atlas-Ti software and presented in narratives. Results: The total maternal satisfaction with maternal health service was 55.2% (95% CI = 50.8-59.4). The identified predictors of maternal satisfaction were distance from household to health post (AOR = 3.59; 95% CI= 1.71 - 7.55), absence of preparation of HEWs during procedure (AOR= 2.87; 95% CI = 1.74 - 4.74), acceptability of the HES by HHs (AOR= 2.18; 95% CI = 1.14 - 4.18), having a reliable communication method with HEWs (AOR = 3.47; 95% CI = 1.77 - 6.79) and received training on the model family (AOR= 2.48, 95% CI= 1.86 - 2.57). These quantitative results were supported by the individual, organizational, socio-demographic and cultural qualitative findings.  Conclusions: This study indicated that 55.2% of women were satisfied with maternal service.Distance from household to health post, absence of preparation of HEWs during procedure, acceptability of the Health Extension Service (HES) by household, having a reliable communication method with HEWs and received training on the model family were significant predictors of maternal satisfaction. The interventions to increase maternal satisfaction with HES need to focus on household-based acceptability of them and their reliable communication method in planning and implementing the services. Similarly, expansion of training of model family in the community would increase maternal satisfaction levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9c779c9044ba6d1ff2c7af8d3844d9cf4bb81cd5091fc0adbf949fe16c8c6b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
