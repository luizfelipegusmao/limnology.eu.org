{"title":"Modulation of Integrin &alpha;v&beta;3 Activation and Signaling in BV-2 Microglial Cells and THP-1 Monocytes by Thyroid Hormones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1956/v1","date":1721836016000,"content":"Much evidence now indicates a direct crosstalk between thyroid hormones (THs) and the immune system. We previously showed that THs behave as anti-inflammatory agents in human leukemic THP-1 monocytes, but a potential neuroprotective effect of THs in microglia have been under-investigated. Microglia, the primary innate immune cells of the brain, play a pivotal role in the regulation of neuroinflammation and nongenomic integrin αvβ3-mediated action of THs appear to be involved. Integrin αvβ3 was highly expressed in activated BV-2 cells, while it was decreased by THs. In addition, THs facilitated wound healing in BV-2 murine microglia cells activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), through integrin αvβ3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), with tetrac (a metabolite of TH) potentiated the inhibition of migration. Nitric oxide (NO) played a role with different mechanisms in the presence of either T3 or T4. Our data showed the capability of TH and analogues to modulate the M1-to-M2 microglial transition and suggest a new spectrum of actions in the central nervous system (CNS).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ce3e9790fd3563cfc0f500a666f4a6bc346e6a4e6d61801c033a5ee9cc5ef10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
