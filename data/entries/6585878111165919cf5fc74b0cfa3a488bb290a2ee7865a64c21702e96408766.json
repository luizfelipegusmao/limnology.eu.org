{"title":"Aerobic exercise up-regulates Klotho to improve renal fibrosis associated with aging and its mechanism","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311055","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Jinfeng Zhao, Yue Guan, Yingxiu Jia, Yinghua Chen, Yue Cai</p>\r\n\r\nRenal fibrosis is a major cause of renal dysfunction and is a common pathological event in almost all forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently, the pathomechanisms of renal fibrosis are not well understood. However, researchers have demonstrated that aerobic exercise can improve renal fibrosis. Klotho is considered to be a negative regulator of renal fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of Klotho in the improvement of renal fibrosis through aerobic exercise. We performed a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention in 19-month-old male C57BL/6J mice. Physiological and biochemical indexes were performed to assess renal function and renal fibrosis. The roles of Klotho were further confirmed through knockdown of Klotho by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in C57BL/6J mice.Q-PCR and Western blot were performed to quantify determine the expression of relevant genes and proteins in the kidney. Results: Aging decreased Klotho expression via activated the upstream TGF-β1/p53/miR34a signaling pathway and affected its downstream signaling pathways, ultimately leading to renal fibrosis. Exposure to aerobic exercise for 12 weeks significantly improved renal fibrosis and alleviated the intrarenal genetic alterations induced by aging. Conclusion: Our results showed that aerobic exercise increased Klotho expression by inhibiting the TGF-β1/p53/miR34a signaling pathway and further inhibited its downstream TGF-β1/smad3 and β-linker protein signaling pathways. These results provide a theoretical basis supporting the feasibility of exercise in the prevention and treatment of CKD.","author":"Jinfeng Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6585878111165919cf5fc74b0cfa3a488bb290a2ee7865a64c21702e96408766","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
