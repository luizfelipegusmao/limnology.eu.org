{"title":"Top of the food chains: an ecological network of the marine Paja Formation biota from the Early Cretaceous of Colombia reveals the highest trophic levels ever estimated","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad092/7275647?rss=1","date":1694822400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Mesozoic Marine Revolution restructured the worldâ€™s ocean biodiversity into the complex marine ecosystems of today. This revolution began during the Triassic but the origin of this complexity is poorly understood due to a lack of detailed ecosystem reconstructions throughout time. We present the first site-specific ecological network for a marine Mesozoic fauna based on the Early Cretaceous Paja Formation biota of Colombia that preserves numerous, large-bodied, predatory marine reptiles. The trophic food-web was quantitatively reconstructed based on inferred trophic interactions of marine producers, consumers, and large apex predators. Compared to well-studied Caribbean reef ecosystem networks, the Paja biota network is missing a great proportion of benthic invertebrates and fishes, despite its rich higher trophic levels. We hypothesize that the ammonites from the Paja biota either mirrored the diversity represented by some fishes today or established a novel trophic unit with no living analogue. Recalibrating the Paja biota network to trophic analogues in the Caribbean, such as sea turtles, estimates that the largest Paja marine reptile hyper-apex predators occupied trophic levels a full tier higher than any extant marine apex predator. The Paja biota network is a starting point to tracing the evolution of marine ecosystems across the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"641546b9526470d3c3f572466d5c078aafaf0435ae38789ae8f3b08b486019dd","category":"Environment"}
