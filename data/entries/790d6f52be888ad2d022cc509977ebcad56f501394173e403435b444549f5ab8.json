Unlike traditional inflammation biomarkers, this study aims to evaluate the prognosis of IPF patients by considering both inflammation and nutritional status. Method: A total of 102 patients with IPF were included in the study. Clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical records. NLR and ALI score were calculated based on data collected at the initiation of antifibrotic treatment using the following formula: Neut/Lym and albumin × BMI / NLR. Results: IPF subject subgroups in terms of ALI based on gender–age–physiology (GAP) stages (1,2,3), FVC (median split,","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"790d6f52be888ad2d022cc509977ebcad56f501394173e403435b444549f5ab8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
