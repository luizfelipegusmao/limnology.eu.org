For this purpose, we developed over the years an CEOS electron <span>Energy</span><span>Filter</span> and <span>Imaging</span><span>Device</span> (CEFID) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1059-B1\">1</a>] (Fig.1) which also can act as an high resolution electron spectrometer. And, in addition, currently we are in the process of developing a novel ground potential monochromator (GP-MC) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1059-B2\">2</a>]. One of the figures of merit of spectrometers in combination with a monochromator, for example, is the attainable energy resolution and the available beam current. The latter, of course, also depends on the brightness of the used electron source.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fb6353ba6c6acb465ae744b5fddb266ce0d0a282d050acd6aa3d51e709465db2","category":"Environment"}
