{"title":"Pt/CB-Catalyzed Chemoselective Hydrogenation Using in situ-Generated Hydrogen by Microwave Mediated Dehydrogenation of Methylcyclohexane under Continuous-Flow Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1603/v1","date":1716532703000,"content":"Hydrogen gas (H2) has attracted attention as a next-generation clean energy source. Its efficient and safe preparation and utilization are crucial in both industry and organic chemistry. In this study, a Pt/CB-catalyzed MW-mediated continuous-flow hydrogenation reaction was developed using methylcyclohexane (MCH) as the reducing agent (hydrogen carrier). Alkynes, alkenes, nitro groups, benzyl esters, and aromatic chlorides were chemoselectively hydrogenated using Pt/CB under MW-assisted continuous-flow conditions. This methodology represents a safe and energy-efficient hydrogenation process, as it eliminates the need for an external hydrogen gas supply or heating jackets as a heat medium. Further application of MW-mediated continuous-flow hydrogenation reactions is a viable method for the efficient generation and utilization of sustainable energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62cdb813ab69ada1252c0ca07d07191bea0412bef752fef1fe0edd31771e4732","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
