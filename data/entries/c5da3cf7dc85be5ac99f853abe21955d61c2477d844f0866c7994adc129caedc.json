{"title":"Pain Perceptions and Management in Outpatient Gynecological Procedures: Survey Insights and Future Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1341/v1","date":1724070587000,"content":"Objective: This analysis investigates patient experiences regarding pain management during gynecological procedures through a comprehensive survey, aiming to address the lack of clear guidelines in the clinical landscape and emphasize the importance of effective pain management strategies in enhancing patient care and satisfaction. Design: A cross-sectional survey with 258 respondents assessed pain management experiences during gynecological procedures. The survey was distributed via Qualtrics, and 258 responses were obtained. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Participants provided demographic information and responded to questions regarding contraceptive methods, procedures undergone, pain management discussions, anxiety levels, and willingness to accept pain management interventions. Confidentiality and informed consent protocols were strictly observed throughout the study. Results: Most female respondents reported diverse contraceptive methods and procedures. Pain management discussions and provisions varied, with a significant portion reporting never being offered pain management. Many experienced anxiety and pain during procedures, with varying intensities, that were not addressed or discussed by their treating provider. Most expressed willingness to accept pain management interventions. Limitations: This study relies on self-reported data, potentially introducing recall bias, and has limited generalizability due to its cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Findings reveal a significant gap in pain management provision and discussion during gynecological procedures. Improved guidelines and practices are necessary to address patient discomfort effectively. Standardized pain management protocols are crucial to enhance patient experiences and outcomes, with further research needed to tailor strategies to individual patient needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5da3cf7dc85be5ac99f853abe21955d61c2477d844f0866c7994adc129caedc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
