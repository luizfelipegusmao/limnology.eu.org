We hypothesized that common variants in genes responsible for ciliary function may contribute to the development of asthma with certain phenotypes.</p> Methods <p>Three independent adult Japanese populations (including a total of 1,158 patients with asthma and 2,203 non-asthmatic healthy participants) were studied. First, based on the ClinVar database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), we selected 12 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with molecular consequences (missense, nonsense, and 3’-untranslated region mutation) in 5 primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-related genes and calculated a PCD-genetic risk score (GRS) as a cumulative effect of these PCD-related genes. Second, we performed a two-step cluster analysis using 3 variables, including PCD-GRS, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>), and age of asthma onset.</p> Results <p>Compared to adult asthma clusters with an average PCD-GRS, clusters with high and low PCD-GRS had similar overall characteristics: adult-onset, female predominance, preserved lung function, and fewer features of type 2 immunity as determined by IgE reactivity and blood eosinophil counts. The allele frequency of rs1530496, a SNP representing an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of <i>DNAH5</i> in the lung, showed the largest statistically significant difference between the PCD-GRS-High and PCD-GRS-Low asthma clusters (p = 1.4 x 10<sup>−15</sup>).</p> Conclusion <p>Genes associated with PCD, particularly the common SNPs associated with abnormal expression of <i>DNAH5</i>, may have a certain influence on the development of adult-onset asthma, perhaps through impaired mucociliary clearance.</p>","author":"Rie Shigemasa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee8254359e725a3897a368820769998907aaa9f9de2f0d27ead8c9787a4062f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
