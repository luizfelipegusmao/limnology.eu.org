{"title":"Floater Assembly and Turbine Integration Strategy for Floating Offshore Wind Energy: Considerations and Recommendations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1866/v1","date":1727171391000,"content":"The increasing demand for cost-effective floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) necessitates streamlined mass production and efficient assembly strategies. This research investigates the assembly and integration of 15 MW FOWT floaters, utilising a semi-submersible floater equipped with a 15 MW wind turbine. The infrastructure and existing port facilities of Taiwan are used as an example. The effectiveness of various assembly and integration strategies has been evaluated. The study outlines equipment and infrastructure requirements for on-quay floater and turbine assembly, comparing on-quay assembly versus construction at remote locations and subsequent towing. Detailed analyses of port operations, crane specifications, and assembly procedures are presented, emphasizing the critical role of crane selection and configuration. The findings indicate that on-quay assembly at one major port is feasible and cost-effective, provided that port infrastructure and operational logistics are optimised. This research offers insights and recommendations for implementing large-scale FOWT projects, contributing to advancing offshore wind energy deployment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2d8df8f8992f687e2f259ff8a5c6e0dd84e2cba715f3fe6552c71e5d73839df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
