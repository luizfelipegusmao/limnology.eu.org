{"title":"Environmental Stressors Interaction Effect on the Short-Term Recovery of the Mediterranean Forest of South America","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2420/v1","date":1727702426000,"content":"The interplay between wildfires and drought stress has significantly limited forest recovery in the Mediterranean ecosystem of central Chile. Since 2010, the region has faced a prolonged 'Mega Drought,' which intensified into a 'Hyper Drought' in 2019, with record-low precipitation and high temperatures, further constraining forest recovery amidst increasing wildfire frequency. This study evaluates short-term vegetation recovery across drought gradients in three sclerophyllous evergreen forests, analyzing Landsat time series (1987â€“2022) for 42 wildfires. Using the LandTrendr algorithm, we assessed post-fire forest recovery based on NDVI changes between pre-fire values and subsequent years. The results revealed significant differences in recovery across drought gradients and fire severity interactions. After five years, the xeric forest dominated by Quillaja saponaria and Lithrea caustica showed 89% recovery during the Mega Drought and 34% during the Hyper Drought. In contrast, the mesic forest dominated by Cryptocarya alba and Peumus boldus exhibited 28% recovery during the Mega Drought and 43% during the Hyper Drought. Degraded thorny shrublands showed the lowest recovery, averaging 23% under Hyper Drought and medium fire severity. These findings underscore the critical role of prolonged, severe drought in shaping forest recovery dynamics and highlight the need to understand these patterns to improve future forest resilience under increasingly arid conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd9c1c1bd252513a1b13e4db1b09ff519390e1ecc5090d9a011b483f04de05cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
