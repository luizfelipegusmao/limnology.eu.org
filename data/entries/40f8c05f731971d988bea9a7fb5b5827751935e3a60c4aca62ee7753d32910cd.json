{"title":"Seamless Transition to Post-Quantum TLS 1.3: A Hybrid Approach Using Identity-Based Encryption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2219/v1","date":1725009699000,"content":"This paper proposes a novel approach to transitioning the classical TLS 1.3 protocol to a post-quantum version with minimal changes to the existing infrastructure. By integrating a hybrid KEMTLS protocol with Identity-Based Encryption (IBE), the solution achieves post-quantum security without incorporating post-quantum keys into TLS certificates. This enables the protocol to function with Certificate Authorities that do not support post-quantum keys, ensuring its security while simplifying the transition. The main challenge addressed is the immediate need for support of post-quantum algorithms by Certificate Authorities and servers. The proposed solution leverages existing certificates and keys, facilitating a smoother transition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40f8c05f731971d988bea9a7fb5b5827751935e3a60c4aca62ee7753d32910cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
