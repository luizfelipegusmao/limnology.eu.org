{"title":"Joint Action of Trichoderma atroviride and a Vegetal Derived-Protein Hydrolysate Improves Yield, Fruit Quality and Economic Profitability of Two Woodland Strawberry Cultivars Grown Under Greenhouse","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1070/v1","date":1710840022000,"content":"Woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) is an underutilized plant species, appreciated by consumers for its qualitative features. Utilizing technical means of production, such as plant biostimulants, that can increase crop productivity and quality could be highly important in woodland strawberry cultivation. The scope of the present study was to appraise the influence of two biostimulants (Trichoderma atroviride and plant protein hydrolysate) - used either alone or combined - on plant performance and economic profitability of two woodland strawberry genotypes (‘Alpine’ and ‘Regina delle Valli’). Overall, data showed that ‘Alpine’ had the highest productive performances, whereas ‘Regina delle Valli’ revealed the highest fruit qualitative traits. T. atroviride inoculation and V-PH application significantly boosted plant marketable yield (+20.5% for T. atroviride and +12.9% for V-PH), total sugars (+1.9% for Trichoderma and +1.4% for V-PH) and anthocyanins (+14.1% for T. atroviride and +9.8% for V-PH) compared to non-treated plants. Plants supplied with both biostimulants had higher marketable yield (+34.8%), mean fruit weight (+6.0%), fruit dry matter (+13.8%), total sugars (+3.5%), ascorbic acid (+12.7%), flavonoid (+26.3%) and anthocyanins (+29.9%) compared to non-treated plants. Furthermore, our study revealed that the highest fruit polyphenols concentration was recorded in both genotypes treated with the combination of biostimulants and in ‘Regina delle Valli’ sprayed with V-PH, whereas the highest antioxidant activity was found in ‘Regina delle Valli’ fruit when plants were supplied with both biostimulants. Our study pointed out that the application of microbial and non-microbial biostimulants, especially in combination, might be an useful strategy for improving performances of underutilized species and, therefore, encourage its cultivation, valorisation and economic profitability (+10195.3 €/ha when plants were exposed to both biostimulants).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddf5b8c68c71305298f28a2a48b290164d599d7065fb51d68f8dbd193b582ec1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
