{"title":"Cytostatic Bacterial Metabolites Interfere with 5-Fluorouracil and Paclitaxel Efficiency in 4T1 Breast Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0153/v1","date":1714728163000,"content":"The microbiome is capable of modulating the bioavailability of chemotherapy drugs mainly due to metabolizing these agents. Multiple cytostatic bacterial metabolites were recently identified that have cytostatic properties on cancer cells. In this study we addressed the question whether the cytostatic bacterial metabolites (cadaverine, indolepropionic acid, indoxylsulfate) can interfere with the cytostatic effects of the chemotherapy agents used in the management of breast cancer (doxorubicin, gemcitabine, irinotecan, methotrexate, rucaparib, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel). The chemotherapy drugs were applied in a wide concentration range to which a bacterial metabolite was added in a concentration within its serum reference range and the effects on cell proliferation were assessed. There was no interference between doxorubicin, gemcitabine, irinotecan, methotrexate, rucaparib and the bacterial metabolites. Nevertheless, cadaverine increased the Hill coefficient of the inhibitory curve of 5-fluorouracil and indolepropionic acid increased the IC50 value of 5-fluorouracil that are either disadvantageous effects or effects of unknown significance. Nevertheless, indolepropionic acid decreased the IC50 value of paclitaxel that is a potentially advantageous combination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d747e980a151d73166a814bac90ef8093e387443aeca1092b837951a0417794b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
