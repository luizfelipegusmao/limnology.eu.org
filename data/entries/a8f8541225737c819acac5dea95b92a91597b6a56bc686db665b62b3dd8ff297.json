{"title":"Tolerance threshold of a pelagic species in China to total dissolved gas supersaturation: from the perspective of survival characteristics and swimming ability","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae023/7675713?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Total dissolved gas (TDG) \nsupersaturation downstream of dams can occur in the Yangtze River basin and \nis known to cause stress and even death in fish. Consequently, it is \nimportant to establish tolerance thresholds of endemic fish to protect local \naquatic resources. We conducted experiments to assess survival \ncharacteristics and swimming ability of bighead carp, an important commercial \nfish dwelling in the Yangtze River, to evaluate its tolerance threshold to \nTDG supersaturation. The typical external symptoms of gas bubble trauma (GBT) \nwere observed and the time when the fish lost equilibrium and died were \nrecorded. The results showed that the mortality occurred when TDG level \nexceeded 125%, with obvious symptoms such as exophthalmos and bubbles \non the head. The interval between loss of equilibrium and mortality decreased \nwith an increase in TDG level. Neither exposure time nor TDG level \nsignificantly affected the critical swimming speed (U<sub>crit</sub>) of fish \nexposed to non-lethal exposure (110%, 120% and 125% TDG) \nover a 7 day period. Significant reductions in U<sub>crit</sub> were \nfound under 130% and 135% TDG conditions when the exposure lasted 52.0 h and 42.9 h, respectively. The U<sub>crit</sub> also significantly decreased after exposure of 1.6 h under 140% TDG condition. Moreover, after exposure to 140% TDG for 39.2 h, 135% TDG for 56.5 h and 130% TDG for 95.9 h, bighead carp were transferred into air saturated water to recover for \n24 h or 48 h; however, swimming performance remained impaired. The results of this study indicate that 125% TDG was the highest TDG level where limited mortality was observed and the swimming ability was not impaired, showing that 125% TDG can be set as the tolerance threshold of this species to guide the operation of dams in the Yangtze River \nBasin.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"a8f8541225737c819acac5dea95b92a91597b6a56bc686db665b62b3dd8ff297","category":"Environment"}
