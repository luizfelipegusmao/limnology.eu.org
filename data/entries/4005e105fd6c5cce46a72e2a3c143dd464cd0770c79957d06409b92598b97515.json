{"title":"Agroclimatic mapping for olive cultivation in Brazil: pinpointing optimal growing regions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13221?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This research aimed to identify the agroclimatic zones in Brazil, excluding Rio Grande do Sul, that are suitable for olive (<i>Olea europaea</i> L.) cultivation, considering both climatic and topographical factors. Olives require specific conditions: moderate winter temperatures (7–15 °C), warmer summers (25–35 °C) and sufficient water during growth and fruit maturation. They can endure some drought, making them a viable option for agricultural diversification. Using daily meteorological data from 1989 to 2023 from NASA-POWER, this study analyzed variables like air temperature (minimum and maximum) and rainfall. Key climate variables were the mean air temperature in winter (T_w), spring (T_s), summer (T_su) and autumn (T_a) and total annual precipitation (Prec). Criteria for suitability included: T_w between 5 and 20 °C, T_s between 15 and 23 °C, T_su between 15 and 30 °C, T_a between 15 and 22 °C, annual precipitation over 900 mm and altitude below 900 m. Geographic information system software and Python 3.8 were employed for data analysis and zoning.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Results indicated that only 1.92% of the analyzed area, mainly in Minas Gerais, was suitable for olive cultivation. High temperatures and low rainfall in Brazil, particularly in the North and Midwest, make 59.56% of the country unsuitable for olive farming. Additionally, 18.58% of the land, mainly in the Northeast, faces challenges due to extreme heat (T_w) and insufficient water supply. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lucas Eduardo de Oliveira Aparecido, \nGuilherme Botega Torsoni, \nRafael Fausto de Lima, \nDaniel Zimmermann Mesquita, \nPedro Maranha Peche","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4005e105fd6c5cce46a72e2a3c143dd464cd0770c79957d06409b92598b97515","category":"Environment"}
