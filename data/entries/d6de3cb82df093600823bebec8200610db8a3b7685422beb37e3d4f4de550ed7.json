{"title":"Comprehensive Understanding of Recent Molecular and Physio-Biochemical Mechanisms in the Response of Tomatoes to Low Temperature Stress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1853/v1","date":1724752480000,"content":"Climate change has emerged as a crucial global issue that significantly threatens the survival of plants. In particular, low temperature (LT) is one of the critical environmental factors that influence plant morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes during both the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. LT, including abrupt drops in temperature, as well as winter conditions, can cause detrimental effects on the growth and development of tomato plants, ranging from sowing, transplanting, truss appearance, flowering, fertilization, flowering, fruit ripening, and yields. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the adaptation and acclimation of tomato plants to LT at the morphological and the molecular levels. In this review, we discuss the previous and current knowledge of morphological and physiological changes, which contains major factors and traits associated with the LT stress response during the period of the vegetative and reproductive growth and development in tomato plants. Moreover, we highlight recent advances in the understanding of physiological and biochemical responses, and molecular mechanisms, including LT perception, signaling transduction, gene regulation, and fruit ripening and epigenetic regulation. The comprehensive understanding of LT response provides a solid basis to develop the LT-resistant varieties for sustainable tomato production under the ever-changing temperature fluctuations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6de3cb82df093600823bebec8200610db8a3b7685422beb37e3d4f4de550ed7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
