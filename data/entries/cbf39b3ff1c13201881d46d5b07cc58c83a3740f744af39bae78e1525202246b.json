{"title":"Impact of Combined Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (Comb-NMES) on Glucose Signaling and Muscle Myofiber Distribution in a Patient with Acute Spinal Cord Injury and Lower Motor Neuron Lesion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1240/v1","date":1718710459000,"content":"This case report examines the impact of a novel Combined Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (Comb-NMES) regimen on muscle glucose signaling, fiber type distribution, and metabolic function in a patient with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) and lower motor neuron lesions (LMNLs). A 32-year-old male with complete T9 SCI underwent a ten-session Comb-NMES intervention targeting the quadriceps. Muscle biopsies and blood samples were analyzed pre- and post-intervention to evaluate changes in muscle fiber types, key metabolic proteins, fasting insulin, glucose, and lipid profiles. The intervention led to a 74.7%, and 28.2% reduction in fasting insulin and glucose, respectively. Muscle analysis showed significant increases in CaMK II, Hexokinase II, and IRS-1, indicating improved glucose metabolism. Comb-NMES training markedly improved metabolic control and muscle glucose metabolism in a patient with acute SCI and LMNLs. Enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization were evidenced by upregulated metabolic proteins which suggests Comb-NMES is a promising intervention for improving muscle and metabolic health in SCI patients with LMNLs. Further studies are needed to confirm these benefits and explore long-term effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbf39b3ff1c13201881d46d5b07cc58c83a3740f744af39bae78e1525202246b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
