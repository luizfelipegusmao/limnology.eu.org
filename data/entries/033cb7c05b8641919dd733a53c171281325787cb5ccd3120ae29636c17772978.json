{"title":"BOANN: Bayesian-Optimized Attentive Neural Network for Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2367/v1","date":1727679469000,"content":"This study presents the Bayesian-Optimized Attentive Neural Network (BOANN), a novel approach enhancing image classification performance by integrating Bayesian optimization with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Traditional image classification struggles with the extensive data in today's big data era. Bayesian optimization has been integrated into neural networks in recent years to enhance model generalization, while channel and spatial attention mechanisms improve feature extraction capabilities. This paper introduces a model combining Bayesian optimization with these attention mechanisms to boost image classification performance. Bayesian optimization optimizes hyperparameter selection, accelerating model convergence and accuracy; the attention mechanisms augment feature extraction. Compared to traditional deep learning models, our model utilizes attention mechanisms for initial feature extraction, followed by a Bayesian-optimized neural network. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, our model outperforms classical models in metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving an accuracy of 77.6%. These technologies have potential for broader application in image classification and other computer vision domains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"033cb7c05b8641919dd733a53c171281325787cb5ccd3120ae29636c17772978","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
