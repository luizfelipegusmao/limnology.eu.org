{"title":"Models For The Design And Optimization Of The Multi-stage Wiredrawing Process Of Znal15% Wires For Spray Metallization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0605/v1","date":1728392939000,"content":"Key findings include the modelling of the material behavior when ZnAl15% wires were subjected to the tensile test at different speeds, with strain rate sensitivity coefficient m = 0.0128, demonstrating that this type of alloy is especially sensitive to the strain rate. Besides, the optimal friction coefficient (µ) for the drawing process of this material was experimentally identified as µ = 0.28, the ideal drawing die angle was determined to be 2α = 10°, and the alloy's deformability limit has been established by a reduction ratio r ≤ 22.5%, that indicates good plastic deformation capacity. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed models are feasible for the design and optimization of industrial processes to improve the efficiency and quality of ZnAl15% alloy wire production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6b3ed8a72c334309dcdfa27427b74844b5248679ac6916208f55ffe55ba2222","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
