{"title":"400 Effect of pH on in vitro ruminal metabolism of trans-10 18:1 and trans-11 18:1","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/378/7757478?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Dietary C18 unsaturated fatty acids are extensively biohydrogenated by rumen microbiota into 18:0 and trans-18:1 isomers. Usually, the biohydrogenation (BH) pathways produce mostly 18:0 and trans-11 18:1 as the main intermediate. However, when fed low-forage diets that decrease the rumen pH, the main BH intermediate often is the trans-10 18:1 isomer. This change in BH, called the trans-10 shift, is associated with milk fat depression, but despite that, little is known about the triggers of the trans-10 shift and its ecological role in rumen microbiota. Microbiota stressed by low rumen pH may benefit from increased trans-18:1 availability favoring the production of the trans-18:1 isomer with a slower rate of BH. Thus, we hypothesize that at low rumen pH conditions, the BH of trans-10 18:1 will be slower than that of trans-11 18:1. We tested that with an in vitro experiment using batch incubation in Hungate tubes, replicated in 5 wk. In each run, 24 tubes were allocated at 6 treatments and 4 incubation times (0, 6, 24 and 48 h). The treatments resulted from the combination of 2 buffering solution pH (6.74 vs. 5.85) and 3 substrates: 1) Control (60 mg feed DM) 2) T10 (Control plus 1.2 mg of trans-10 18:1) and 3) T11 (Control plus 1.2 mg of trans-11 18:1). Volatile fatty acids (VFA) and long-chain fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. Data were analyzed using the 2 × 3 factorial arrangement for each incubation time. Low pH resulted in less 30 to 37% DM disappearance than those with high pH at all incubation times (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). The decrease in VFA with low pH was less expressive (≈17%) and only evident at 24 and 48 h incubation times. The low pH also decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the BH of 18:1n-9 (less ≈47 to 53%), 18:2n-6 (less 30 to 34%) and 18:3n-3 (less 20 to 22%) at 24h and 48h incubation times, respectively. The disappearance of trans-11 18:1 was 14.6% at 6 h, 29.0% at 24 h and 32.8% at 48 h and was not affected by pH. The disappearance of trans-10 18:1 was dependent on pH. At 6 h and high pH the disappearance of both was similar, but at low pH the disappearance of trans-10 18:1 was much less (9.8%) than that of trans-11 18:1. However, at 48 h and low pH, the disappearance was similar between isomers and the disappearance of trans-10 18:1 was much greater (46.6%) than trans-11 18:1. In summary, the BH of trans-10 18:1 is less at low pH than at high pH, and this could in part explain its abundance in some practical ruminant feeding conditions.
