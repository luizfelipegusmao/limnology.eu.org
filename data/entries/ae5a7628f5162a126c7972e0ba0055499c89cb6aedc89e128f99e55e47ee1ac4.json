{"title":"MIS-Net: A deep learning-based multi-class segmentation model for CT images","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299970","date":1710338400000,"content":"<p>by Huawei Li, Changying Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of traditional CT image segmentation algorithms is hindered by issues such as low contrast and high noise in the images. While numerous scholars have introduced deep learning-based CT image segmentation algorithms, they still face challenges, particularly in achieving high edge accuracy and addressing pixel classification errors. To tackle these issues, this study proposes the MIS-Net (Medical Images Segment Net) model, a deep learning-based approach. The MIS-Net model incorporates multi-scale atrous convolution into the encoding and decoding structure with symmetry, enabling the comprehensive extraction of multi-scale features from CT images. This enhancement aims to improve the accuracy of lung and liver edge segmentation. In the evaluation using the COVID-19 CT Lung and Infection Segmentation dataset, the left and right lung segmentation results demonstrate that MIS-Net achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.61. Similarly, in the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2017 public dataset, the DSC of MIS-Net reaches 98.78.","author":"Huawei Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ae5a7628f5162a126c7972e0ba0055499c89cb6aedc89e128f99e55e47ee1ac4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
