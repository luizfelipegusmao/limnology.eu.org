{"title":"An Inversion-Based Microseismic Simulator for Fracture Diagnostics","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00603-024-04188-8","date":1728172800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Microseismic events are monitored to understand the geometry of hydraulic fractures. However, important source information including fracture orientation, length, and slip is usually not fully considered. An inversion-based microseismic simulator with natural fractures is developed to evaluate source information based on improved nonlinear solvers and extend the solvers to solve large-scale fracturing problems that consider natural fractures and their interaction with a propagating hydraulic fracture. A hydraulic fracturing simulator is used to generate simulated microseismic events for a fracturing treatment. The limited far-field displacement (LFFD), storing the information of measured microseismic signatures, is chosen as an important element to conduct fracture diagnostics of source parameters. The source moment tensor, allowing a description of any oriented discontinuity in the formation, is connected to the LFFD. An inversion kernel function is defined to update estimated data and search for the optimal parameters that can provide the best match to the observed data. The results demonstrate insightful and interesting characteristics of both source mechanisms and non-linear solvers served by the kernel function. The agreement of inversed sources with microseismic results is significantly improved using either particle swarm assisted by two observation wells or the integration of particle swarm and Fmincon with one observation well. The results show how the configuration of observation wells affects focal mechanism estimations since the determination of a reliable focal mechanism solution from multiple possibilities needs more coverage from observation wells. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to investigate the spatial distribution of microseismic events. The model provides a tool to conduct fracture diagnostics and unveil high-resolution details of source mechanisms.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"707a07abf5622b4aef854d2c1996550f215e2dd35b086e813a2cd6891553d3ba","category":"Environment"}
