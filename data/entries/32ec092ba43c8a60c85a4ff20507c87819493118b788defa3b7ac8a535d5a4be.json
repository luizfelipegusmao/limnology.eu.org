{"title":"Arduino-Powered Device for the Study of Talbot-Plateau law: White Perception Beyond the Visual Trichromatic Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1480/v1","date":1718957372000,"content":"Arduino microcontrollers are being used for a wide range of technological and biomedical applications such as image classification, computer vision, brain-computer interaction and vision experiments. Here I present a new cost-effective mini-device based on RGB LED flicker stimulation for the assessment of polychromatic temporal resolution of visual function. The visual device configuration allows for relative luminance thresholding, mono- and polychromatic critical flicker fusion frequency assessment. The results demonstrate the steady white visual perception of a trichromatic flicker stimulus beyond the critical flicker fusion frequency, as predicted by TalbotÂ´s law for monochromatic stimuli. The trichromatic critical flicker fusion frequency (tFCC) depends on the relative luminance threshold at the light-adaptation level. Finally, wavefront measurements demonstrate that high-order aberrations improve the temporal resolution of visual function.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32ec092ba43c8a60c85a4ff20507c87819493118b788defa3b7ac8a535d5a4be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
