{"title":"Sustainable Synergy: Areca Sheath Paper Cups from Waste to Wonder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0198/v1","date":1717511111000,"content":"Areca palm sheath leaves were an incredibly noble food packaging system. In ancient times, naturally available wood, leaves, stems, and barks were used to store food materials. But all these were turned down upon the rise of civilization. Today, many modern food packaging systems are used; paper and paperboard packaging materials are used mainly as a replacement for plastic materials. But somehow, paper-based materials have major drawbacks when temperature-dependent products are stored; leaching out components poses a higher threat to health. To alleviate it, bio-based components were used in the manufacturing of paper materials, but the migration of those components was still risky. This study focuses on how the areca palm sheath leaves can be effectively used to prevent this migration of components.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a69cd00e196a2c47856dcf3f65a5a9da5955a833eef9e3caa14a36d138e565b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
