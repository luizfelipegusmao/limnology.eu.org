Surma is one of the vital rivers in Bangladesh located in the northeast part, with higher chances of MP pollution due to different anthropogenic reasons. In this instance, we carried out the investigation on the abundance, distribution, and characteristics of MPs in the sediment and surface water of the river. Samples were collected from 15 major locations of the Surma river flowing through Sylhet municipality. MPs particles were isolated from sediments and water samples utilizing techniques like sieve analysis, wet peroxide oxidation, density separation, and filtration and then characterized using a stereomicroscope. The abundance of MPs recorded 8 to 18 items/L in water samples (mean ± SD: 12.33 ± 2.98 items/L) and 360 to 1120 items/kg in sediment samples (mean ± SD: 522.67 ± 197.84 items/kg). The prominent size, shape, and color of MPs isolated from sediments were 1–2 mm sizes (24.49%), fragments (47.71%), and black (30.65%). However, for water samples, 1–2 mm sizes (37.22%), fiber shapes (48.48%), and transparent colors (38.46%) were dominant features. Conspicuously, in both sediment and water samples, there was a higher prevalence of smaller sized particles, posing a significant threat to the ecosystem. This heightened risk stems from the increased likelihood of ingestion by microorganisms, as well as the larger surface area of these particles, which may serve as vectors for other pollutants like organic pollutants and heavy metals. A greater abundance of fibers suggests an increased presence of lightweight particles in the water and sediment. Furthermore, the transparent color of the MPs in water might be impacted by prolonged weathering in the river, while the presence of black-colored MPs in sediment points to the existence of plastic pellets originating from industrial and diverse sources. Future studies should concentrate on long-term and broad monitoring, ecological effects, and practical mitigation techniques for MPs, providing essential baseline data to guide the formulation of policies in developing nations.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\n12.33 items/L in surface water and 522.67 items/kg in sediment were observed.\nHigh correlation indicates a single MP source in mainstream water, differing from sediment.\nFiber shapes, black, and transparent colored MPs are dominant.\nHigher prevalence of smaller sized MPs, posing a significant threat to the aquatic ecosystem.\n</p>","author":"Saif Izlal, \nFahim Mahafuz Ruhad, \nTariqul Islam, \nMd.
