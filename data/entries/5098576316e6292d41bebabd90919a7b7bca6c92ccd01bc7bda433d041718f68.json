{"title":"Perspectives on Resistance Exercise Intensity of Healthcare Professionals and People With a Spinal Cord Injury in Japan, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0153/v1","date":1717480493000,"content":"(1) Background: This study aims to investigate differences in the perspectives of exercise intensity for resistance exercise of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and adults living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Asian countries. Also, it verifies the appropriateness of the conventional indicators for resistance exercise intensity in an Asian context; (2) Methods: 121 certified HCPs and 107 adults with SCI participated in a survey conducted in Indonesian, Japanese, Korean and Thai languages. The survey asked what principles are important for prescribing resistance exercise, and if ‘moderate’ and ‘vigorous’ were appropriate terms for indicating an intensity level. Perspective differences were examined between both groups and, further, between countries from a psychosocial perspective; (3) Results: Of the HCPs, 92% perceived that resistance exercise intensity was far more important than frequency, time or type of exercise while frequency (61%) followed by intensity (58%) was perceived as important by respondents with SCI. Only Japanese respondents with SCI agreed with HCP’s perception of intensity. Both HCPs and respondents with SCI showed unfavorable responses on the usage of ‘moderate’ and ‘vigorous’ for describing resistance exercise intensity, especially Japanese HCP and respondents with SCI from Indonesia; (4) Conclusion: Our findings suggest that non-HCPs must improve their perceptions of exercise intensity. Findings also suggest the need for more explicit and user-friendly terms or expressions indicating the level of intensity in a local (Asian) context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5098576316e6292d41bebabd90919a7b7bca6c92ccd01bc7bda433d041718f68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
