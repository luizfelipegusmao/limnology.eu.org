This study constructed a chain mediation model based on Bandura's Social Learning Theory to explore the mechanism of internet gaming disorder and avatar identification in it; (2) Methods: We conducted a randomized survey involving 973 adolescents from various middle schools in China. We used the Harsh Parenting Scale, the Online Gaming Disorder Scale, the Incarnate Identity Scale, and the Buss-Perry Aggression Scale to conduct a randomized survey. Empirical analyses were conducted using SPSS 25.0 and Amos 24.0 software to examine the mediating role of online gaming barriers and avatar identity; (3) Results: There was a two-by-two significant positive correlation between harsh parenting, internet gaming disorder, avatar identification and aggression. The me-diation model between harsh parenting, internet gaming disorder, avatar identification and ag-gression was well fitted ( Ï‡2/df=7.268, GFI=0.961, AGFI=0.923, IFI=0.970, CFI=0.970, TLI=0.951, RMSEA=0.080).; (4) Conclusions: Parental harsh parenting affects adolescent aggression not only through the separate mediating roles of internet gaming disorder and avatar identification, but also through the chain mediating roles of internet gaming disorder and avatar identification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbca2d501660d3850a975964782f07633de117e945a925bfa4831a903a51e6e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
