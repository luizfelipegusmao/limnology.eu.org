{"title":"The correlation between flavor formation and microbial community dynamics during the fermentation of zha cai","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13447?af=R","date":1718692178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p><i>Zha cai,</i> a pickled vegetable with unique flavors, is produced by fermenting fresh mustard tubers. In this study, the main physicochemical indices and volatile flavor compounds were determined in three fermentation periods. The bacterial and fungal communities in the three fermentation periods of <i>zha cai</i> were also monitored using high-throughput sequencing. Key microbial communities were identified based on significant correlations with flavor substances.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the main bacterial phyla found within the three fermentation periods. Lactic acid bacteria, namely <i>Lactobacillus</i>, was the predominant bacteria found at the genus level. Ascomycetes and Stenotrophomonas were the major fungal phyla found in the three fermentation periods. Yeast, namely <i>Debaryomyces</i>, was the predominant fungus found at the genus level. A total of 42 bacterial genera were negatively correlated with volatile flavor substances of <i>zha cai</i>, and 37 bacterial genera were positively correlated. Meanwhile, a total of 47 genera of fungi were negatively correlated with the volatile flavor substances of <i>zha cai</i>, while 50 genera were positively correlated. Several microbial genera were significantly correlated with volatile flavor compounds, including <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Halomonas</i>, <i>Rhodococcus</i>, and <i>Debaryomyces</i>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study identified the microbial classes that positively regulate the flavor of <i>zha cai</i> which could provide valuable help for flavor modulation in <i>zha cai</i> production.
