Milne Edwards, 1837</a>. We reared larvae in the laboratory and recorded body size, molt increment, stage duration, and mortality during the three larval instars and postlarval stages. Larvae were either fed continuously or subjected to starvation periods immediately after hatching. Larval mass increased with embryo mass suggesting that energetic advantages of heavier embryos are conferred to the larvae. Stage I larvae hatched from clutches with heavier embryos and had lower mortality after five days without food. Stage I duration decreased with increasing embryo mass in treatments with initial periods without food of three, four, and five days. We also observed greater size increase at first molt and larger postlarval size in some treatments. Our results suggest that larger embryos produce larvae that are more resistant to starvation, which may provide a survival advantage when experiencing variable food supply due to the patchy distribution of their planktonic prey.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"5c6feccd970a98b6ab6e2cbf27ef8a03d795a27ee12d609f404ce8ac30dda5c2","category":"Environment"}
