The job outlook for material scientists is projected to increase by 6% by 2032, which is close to double the projected average for all professions[<a href=\"#ozae044.1082-B1\">1</a>]. For this reason, it is not only important but necessary to involve students at all levels in science and expose them to semiconductors from an early stage. Introducing young learners to the wonders of microscopy and semiconductors opens a direct path to careers in materials science.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4b84b8ff16fbe207e2872b0a6868964611985ec618cb1d066cf5782f5b35e407","category":"Environment"}
