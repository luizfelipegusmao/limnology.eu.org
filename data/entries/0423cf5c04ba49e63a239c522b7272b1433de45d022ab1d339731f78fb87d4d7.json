This retrospective cohort implementation study evaluated the effects of a community-based program consisting of CCM, CHWs, guidelines-based treatment protocols, and inexpensive freely accessible medications on type 2 diabetes and hypertension pharmacotherapy quality. A door-to-door household survey identified 856 adults 35 years of age and older living in a low-income Peruvian community, of whom 83% participated in screening for diabetes and hypertension. Patients with confirmed type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension participated in the program’s weekly to monthly visits for &lt; = 27 months. The program was implemented as two care periods employed sequentially. During home care, CHWs made weekly home visits and a physician made treatment decisions remotely. During subsequent clinic care, a physician attended patients in a centralized clinic. The study compared the effects of program (pre- versus post-) (N = 262 observations), and home versus clinic care periods (N = 211 observations) on standards of treatment with hypoglycemic and antihypertensive agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and low-dose aspirin. During the program, 80% and 50% achieved hypoglycemic and antihypertensive standards, respectively, compared to 35% and 8% prior to the program, RRs 2.29 (1.72–3.04, p &lt;0.001) and 6.64 (3.17–13.9, p&lt;0.001). Achievement of treatment standards was not improved by clinic compared to home care (RRs 1.0 +/- 0.08). In both care periods, longer retention in care (&gt;50% of allowable time) was associated with achievement of all treatment standards. 85% compared to 56% achieved the hypoglycemic treatment standard with longer and shorter retention, respectively, RR 1.52 (1.13–2.06, p&lt;0.001); 56% compared to 27% achieved the antihypertensive standard, RR 2.11 (1.29–3.45, p&lt;0.001). In a dose-dependent manner, the community-based program was associated with improved guidelines-based pharmacotherapy of type 2 diabetes and hypertension.","author":"John E.
