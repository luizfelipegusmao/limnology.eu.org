{"title":"A Fractional Differential Operator Based on Quantum Calculus and Bi-Close-to-Convex Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0071/v1","date":1717461501000,"content":"This study explores the properties and behavior of bi-close-to-convex functions, introducing new subclasses defined by their relationship with fractional differential operator and bi-univalent functions. Using the Faber polynomial technique, we derive upper bounds for the n^{th} coefficient of functions in these classes. We also investigate the erratic behavior of initial coefficients in bi-close-to-convex functions, as characterized by the (λ,q)-fractional differintegral operator. Furthermore, we address Fekete-Szegö problems and present notable findings from our investigation, contributing to the continued growth and refinement of geometric function theory, yielding new insights and practical uses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4c6296a7e26e9c051e1ef135dcdce9b5ee9b3bc0b0f2b39e96f00970bed715b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
