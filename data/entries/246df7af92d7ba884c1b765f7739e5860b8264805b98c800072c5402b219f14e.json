{"title":"Corporate Social Responsibility in Practice: Environmental Solidarity Initiatives in Colombia Under the Framework of Elinor Ostrom's Principles of Organizational Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2060/v1","date":1719882412000,"content":"Colombia has initiated the process of participating in the environmental projects of the United Nations global agenda for the mitigation of climate change and the protection of biodiversity. Consequently, organizations within the solidarity sector have devised projects with the objective of aligning themselves with regional programs and of promoting leadership in the rural development through solidarity-based environmental initiatives. These include the organizations Canapro Ambiental, Cooperaci√≥n Verde and Cootregua, which have participated in and accompanied local environmental projects. This study has identified the common elements related to the principles of organizational design proposed by Elinor Ostrom as a result of the adoption of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for the purpose of a sustainable growth. The above findings serve to corroborate the relevance of the principles of organizational design as a qualitative assessment methodology for environmental solidarity initiatives. In particular, the methodology demonstrates the value of supporting the objectives of environmental sustainability and governance in the long term, by means of the strengthening of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for the purposes of the solidarity ecosystem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"246df7af92d7ba884c1b765f7739e5860b8264805b98c800072c5402b219f14e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
