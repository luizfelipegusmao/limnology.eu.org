{"title":"Genetic Algorithm based optimization of Clustering Algorithms for the Healthy Aging Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1663/v1","date":1716797129000,"content":"Clustering is a crucial at the same time challenging task in several application domains. It is important to incorporate the optimum feature finding into our clustering algorithms for getting better prediction accuracy but this is difficult when there is no or little information about the importance or relevance of features. To tackle this task in an efficient manner we employ the natural evolution process inherent in genetic algorithms (GA) to find the optimum features for clustering for the healthy aging dataset. In order to empirically verify the findings, genetic algorithms were combined with a number of clustering algorithms including parti-tional, density based as well as agglomerative. A variant of the popular KMeans algorithm, named KMeans++ gave the best performance on all performance metrics when combined with GA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2f5d3f9460d1212879a0bc0644e4d17fc71c51cc8c0da432966bd654194ef58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
