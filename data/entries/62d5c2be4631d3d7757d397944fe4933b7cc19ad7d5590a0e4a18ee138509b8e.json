Ayala</p>\r\n\r\nTDP-43 is an essential RNA-binding protein strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates and loss of nuclear TDP-43. The protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, yet maintaining predominantly nuclear TDP-43 localization is important for TDP-43 function and for inhibiting cytoplasmic aggregation. We previously demonstrated that specific RNA binding mediates TDP-43 self-assembly and biomolecular condensation, requiring multivalent interactions via N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we show that these complexes play a key role in TDP-43 nuclear retention. TDP-43 forms macromolecular complexes with a wide range of size distribution in cells and we find that defects in RNA binding or inter-domain interactions, including phase separation, impair the assembly of the largest species. Our findings suggest that recruitment into these macromolecular complexes prevents cytoplasmic egress of TDP-43 in a size-dependent manner. Our observations uncover fundamental mechanisms controlling TDP-43 cellular homeostasis, whereby regulation of RNA-mediated self-assembly modulates TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic distribution. Moreover, these findings highlight pathways that may be implicated in TDP-43 proteinopathies and identify potential therapeutic targets.","author":"Patricia M. dos Passos","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"62d5c2be4631d3d7757d397944fe4933b7cc19ad7d5590a0e4a18ee138509b8e","category":"Environment"}
