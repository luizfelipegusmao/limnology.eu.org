{"title":"Temperature‚Äêrelated increase in growth rate in four freshwater lake fish species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15745?af=R","date":1712717376000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Growth is one of the most direct and common ways fish respond to climate change, as fish growth is intimately linked to the temperature of the environment. Observational studies on the effect of shifts in temperature on fish growth are scarce for freshwater fish, and particularly lacking for lake populations. Here, changes in growth rate of bream (<i>Abramis brama</i>), perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>), pikeperch (<i>Sander lucioperca</i>), and roach (<i>Rutilus rutilus</i>) over three decades were studied and compared with changes in temperature in the two largest lakes of western Europe: Lake IJsselmeer and Lake Markermeer in the Netherlands. In the autumnal survey catches of bream, perch, and roach, the mean length of YOY increased significantly between 1992 and 2021 in both lakes, but for YOY pikeperch, no temporal changes were found. In a length-stratified dataset of age groups of bream, roach, and perch, the relationship between length and age differed significantly between time periods. In the more recent time periods, indications for higher growth rates across multiple ages were found. Temperature during the growth season increased in the same decades and showed significant correlations with the YOY mean length, for bream, perch, and roach in both lakes, and for pikeperch in Lake Markermeer. These results point toward consistent temperature-induced increases in growth over the age groups for bream, roach, and perch. These increases were found despite the simultaneous process of de-eutrophication in this water system and its potential negative effect on food production. For pikeperch, it is hypothesized that the absence of temporal increase in YOY growth rate is related to its necessary switch to piscivory and subsequent food limitation; the lower thermal range of its main prey smelt, <i>Osmerus eperlanus</i>, is hypothesized to have inhibited food availability for YOY pikeperch and its opportunity to achieve higher growth rates.</p>","author":"Nicola S.
