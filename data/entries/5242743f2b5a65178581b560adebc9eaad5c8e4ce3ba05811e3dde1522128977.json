{"title":"Synthesis, molecular docking study and biological evaluation of new pyrrole scaffolds as potential antitubercular agents for dual targeting of enoyl ACP reductase and dihydrofolate reductase","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303173","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Mater H.

R., Shrinivas D. Joshi</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, new series of N’-(2-(substitutedphenoxy)acetyl)-4-(1<i>H</i>-pyrrol-1-yl)benzohydrazides (3a-j) 4-(2,5-dimethyl-1<i>H</i>-pyrrol-1-yl)-N’-(2-(substitutedphenoxy)acetyl)benzohydrazides (5a-j) were synthesized, characterized and assessed as inhibitors of enoyl ACP reductase and DHFR. Most of the compounds exhibited dual inhibition against the enzymes enoyl ACP reductase and DHFR. Several synthesized substances also demonstrated significant antibacterial and antitubercular properties. A molecular docking analysis was conducted in order to determine the potential mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds. The results indicated that there were binding interactions seen with the active sites of dihydrofolate reductase and enoyl ACP reductase. Additionally, important structural details were identified that play a critical role in sustaining the dual inhibitory activity. These findings were useful for the development of future dual inhibitors. Therefore, this study provided strong evidence that several synthesized molecules could exert their antitubercular properties at the cellular level through multi-target inhibition. By shedding light on the mechanisms through which these compounds exert their inhibitory effects, this research opens up promising avenues for the future development of dual inhibitors with enhanced antibacterial and antitubercular properties. The study’s findings underscore the importance of multi-target approaches in drug design, providing a strong foundation for the design and optimization of novel compounds that can effectively target bacterial infections at the cellular level.","author":"Mater H.
