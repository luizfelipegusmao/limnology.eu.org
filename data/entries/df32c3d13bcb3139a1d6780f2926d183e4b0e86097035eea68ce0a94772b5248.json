Exo-electrogen bacteria are key agents in an MFC. <i>Shewanella</i> sp. as a common exo-electrogen bacteria can transfer electrons from the cell surface through different electron transfer mechanisms. In this work, EIS was used to probe the effects of biofilms of <i>Shewanella</i> sp. and the solution of 10% V/V <i>Shewanella</i> on the MFC performance. This research investigates the effects of both microbial biofilms and <i>Shewanella</i> bacterial solutions on MFC efficacy. Findings revealed that biofilm formation on the anode surface significantly reduces anode charge transfer resistance, thereby enhancing power generation. Notably, a 10% <i>Shewanella</i> solution resulted in a 25% higher power density compared to the biofilm. Furthermore, the MFC demonstrated up to 80% chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency in treating brewery wastewater. The study underscores the viability of <i>Shewanella</i> bacterial solutions as an efficient alternative to biofilms, emphasizing their role in improving MFC performance and wastewater treatment efficiency.</p>","author":"Fatemeh Nourbakhsh, \nFahameh Zolfagharzadeh, \nMohammad Pazouki, \nShahryar Jafarinejad","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"df32c3d13bcb3139a1d6780f2926d183e4b0e86097035eea68ce0a94772b5248","category":"Environment"}
