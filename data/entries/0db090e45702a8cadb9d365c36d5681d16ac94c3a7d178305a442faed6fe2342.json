GB mobility, which quantifies the rate of GB migration, is one of the most important parameters determining the kinetics of microstructure evolution in polycrystals. Despite extensive efforts over the years to gauge GB mobilities through both simulations and experiments [<a href=\"#ozae044.822-B3\">3</a>], a comprehensive understanding of its mechanics remains elusive. The disconnection theory, however, presents a promising avenue for elucidating the nature of GB mobility [<a href=\"#ozae044.822-B4\">4</a>]. A disconnection is a type of GB defect which has both a step and a dislocation character with can be quantified by step height and Burgers vector, respectively. According to this theory, GB mobility hinges on two primary factors: the nucleation of disconnections along the GB, governed by intrinsic GB parameters, and the mobility of these disconnections, which in turn is shaped by their interactions with other defects. To investigate the effect of GB defects on its mobility, we present a study of the interaction between the GB disconnections and GB dislocations at atomic resolution using <span>in-situ</span> heating in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0db090e45702a8cadb9d365c36d5681d16ac94c3a7d178305a442faed6fe2342","category":"Environment"}
