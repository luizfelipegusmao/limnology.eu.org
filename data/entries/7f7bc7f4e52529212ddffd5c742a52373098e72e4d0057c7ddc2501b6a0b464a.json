This paper aims to evaluate the navigational risk of ferry transport by a continuous risk management matrix (CRMM) based on the fuzzy Best-Worst Method (BMW). Its originalities include developing CRMM to figure out the risk level of risk factors (RFs) for ferry transport and adopting fuzzy BWM to estimate the probability and severity weights vector of RFs. Empirical results show that twenty RFs for ferry navigation are divided into four zones corresponding to their risk values, including extreme-risk, high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk areas. Particularly, results identify three extreme-risk RFs: inadequate evacuation and emergency response features, marine traffic congestion, and insufficient training on navigational regulations. The proposed research model can provide a methodological reference to the pertinent studies regarding risk management and multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).","author":"Linh Thi Pham","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7f7bc7f4e52529212ddffd5c742a52373098e72e4d0057c7ddc2501b6a0b464a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
