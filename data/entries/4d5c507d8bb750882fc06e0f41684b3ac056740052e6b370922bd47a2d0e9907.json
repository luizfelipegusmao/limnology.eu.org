{"title":"Developmental process of the modern house shrew’s molars: implications for the evolution of the tribosphenic molar in Mesozoic mammals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/3/463/7499308?rss=1","date":1703548800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phylogenetically, the tribosphenic molars—prototypes of multi-cusped cheek teeth in marsupial and placental mammals—are derived from the single-cusped conical teeth of reptiles through the addition of cusps. Ontogenetically, mammalian molars are formed through the interface between the dental epithelium and mesenchyme (future enamel–dentin junction), becoming geometrically complex by adding epithelial signaling centers, called enamel knots, which determine future cusp positions. To reevaluate cusp homologies in Mesozoic mammals from an ontogenetic perspective, this study tracked molar development in a living placental mammal species, the house shrew (<span>Suncus murinus</span>), whose molars are morphologically the least derived from tribosphenic prototypes. The development of shrew molars proceeded as if it replayed the evolutionary process of tribosphenic molars. The first formed enamel knots gave rise to the evolutionarily oldest cusps—upper paracone and lower protoconid. The order of formation of other enamel knots and their location in development seemed to trace the order of cusp appearance in evolution. The parallel relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian molars, if any, suggests that a change in the timing between developmental events rather than a change in the morphogenetic mechanism itself, should have been a major causal factor for the evolutionary transformation of tooth morphology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"4d5c507d8bb750882fc06e0f41684b3ac056740052e6b370922bd47a2d0e9907","category":"Environment"}
