{"title":"Relationships of gaming disorder, ADHD, and academic performance in university students: A mediation analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300680","date":1712152800000,"content":"<p>by Nazir Hawi, Maya Samaha</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the intersection of Gaming Disorder (GD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Grade Point Average (GPA), among university students, a critical demographic often overlooked in research on these disorders. A sample of 348 university students was analyzed using the IGD-20 Test for risk of GD, the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) for ADHD symptoms, and GPA as a metric of academic performance. The findings indicate that 4.3% of the surveyed sample scored within the range for GD. The prevalence was higher in males, with 5.3% of the male cohort affected, compared to 1.2% of the female cohort. Significantly, the prevalence of ADHD was substantially higher in the GD group (35.7%) than in the non-GD group (24.2%). Further, ADHD symptoms were found to be a stronger predictor of GD in females than in males. Incorporating the mediating role of Gaming Disorder, this study also probes into how GD may serve as an intermediary in the impact of ADHD on academic performance. By examining the intricate relationship between these disorders, our findings suggest that GD exacerbates the negative effects of ADHD on academic performance, thereby underscoring the potential for Gaming Disorder to act as a bridge in this dynamic. This mediation analysis clarifies how ADHD may indirectly impact academic performance through GD. The study reveals a positive correlation between ADHD symptoms and GD severity, which in turn correlates negatively with academic achievement. In addition, the findings underscore the need for gender-sensitive interventions and highlight the importance of considering the comorbidity of ADHD and GD in academic settings, advocating for systematic screening for GD among students with ADHD, and vice versa. The dual challenges posed by ADHD and GD should be addressed to prevent their escalation into pervasive academic and psychosocial adversities.","author":"Nazir Hawi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dc403197d22c7ba8fa0da804fd69f41746c80c89303b78e6997f9e18ef9765ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
