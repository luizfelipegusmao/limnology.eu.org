{"title":"A Study of Plant-Filled Polymer Composites Based on Highly Plasticized Polyvinyl Chloride","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0637/v1","date":1712651469000,"content":"PVC-based materials are bad in terms of biodegradability. To enhance the ecological property of such materials, the fabrication of PVC-based composites using biofillers with acceptable performance characteristics could be considered. In this work, plant-filled PVC-based composite materials were obtained and study their optical, structural, thermal, and mechanical properties depending on the nature of the filler (spruce flour, birch flour, and rice husk) were studied. Increasing the proportion of plant filler somewhat reduces the strength characteristics and reduces the flexibility of the samples. But samples with plant filler allows them to be used at low temperatures without changing the operating characteristics. Some of the fillers affected the thermal stability of composites by increasing their thermal decomposition resistance. So, results have shown that plant-filled polymer composites based on PVC can be used on an equal basis with unfilled PVC plastic compound for some applications such as construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53a1a081f4a7ee2cd281c0f53dec8f9cb809617d7e27d740cdad3ac9bc0285e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
