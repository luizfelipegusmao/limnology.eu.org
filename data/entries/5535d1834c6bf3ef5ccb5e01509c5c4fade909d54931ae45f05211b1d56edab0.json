{"title":"Metabolomics and Lipidomics Techniques, Databases and Software Used for Studying Gastrointestinal Parasites of Animals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0443/v1","date":1725521233000,"content":"Gastrointestinal parasites (GIP) are diverse parasitic organisms known to have coevolved with bacterial populations inside the gut of mammalian hosts. These helminths produce small molecules, peptides and proteins to evade or fight their hosts' immune systems. Small molecules include polar compounds, amino acids, lipids and carbohydrates. Metabolomics is an emerging field of research recently applied to study helminth infections and host-parasite interactions. This review comprehensively discusses metabolomics studies of small molecules of GIP in animals, providing insights into the available tools and techniques, databases, and analytical software. Most metabolomics investigations employed LC-MS, MS or MS/MS, NMR, or a combination thereof. Recent advancements in metabolomics platforms, including artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted software tools and databases, have propelled helminth metabolomics forward, offering new avenues to explore host-parasite interactions, immunomodulation, and the intricacies of parasitism. As our understanding of helminth metabolomics continues to expand, it promises to unveil novel perspectives and enrich the knowledge of these complex host-parasite relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5535d1834c6bf3ef5ccb5e01509c5c4fade909d54931ae45f05211b1d56edab0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
