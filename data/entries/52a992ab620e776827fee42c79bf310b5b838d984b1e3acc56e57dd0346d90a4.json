{"title":"A New Understanding of Einstein-Rosen Bridges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0190/v1","date":1727875179000,"content":"In 1935, Einstein and Rosen (ER), in their seminal paper \"Particle Problem in General Relativity\" proposed that \"a particle in the physical Universe has to be described by mathematical bridges connecting two sheets of spacetime\" in order to achieve a consistent understanding of quantum fields in curved spacetime. We discuss similar conclusions independently arrived at by Schr\\\"{o}dinger in 1956 and 't Hooft in 2016 in the context of cosmological and black hole spacetimes. Quantum effects at gravitational horizons involve inverse harmonic oscillators. We demonstrate that an analogous ER proposal of a mathematical bridge is envisioned by Berry and Keating for the description of a quantum inverse harmonic oscillator that has horizons in its phase space. Recently proposed direct-sum quantum theory reconciles the ER's vision by expressing a single quantum state in the physical space as a direct-sum of two components in the parity conjugate regions with opposite arrows of time. We discuss the implications of this framework for offering a new understanding of the ER bridges, promising a unitarity description of quantum fields in curved spacetime along with observer complementarity. Furthermore, we present compelling evidence for our new understanding of ER bridges in the form of large-scale parity asymmetric features in the cosmic microwave background. We finally discuss the implications of this new understanding for our endeavors in combining gravity and quantum mechanics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52a992ab620e776827fee42c79bf310b5b838d984b1e3acc56e57dd0346d90a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
