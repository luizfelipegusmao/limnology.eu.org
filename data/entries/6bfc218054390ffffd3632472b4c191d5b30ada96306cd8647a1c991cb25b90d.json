{"title":"Identifying toxic effects and metabolic perturbations of Duttaphrynus melanostictus skin extracts in human erythrocytes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae086/7686605?rss=1","date":1717372800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Skin secretions of toads are widely used in medicine all over the world for their antiviral, anti-infective, and cardiotonic properties. Because these secretions are mostly employed to combat blood parasite infection, it is important to understand their potential toxic effects on human erythrocytes. Therefore, the objective of the current investigation was to elucidate the effects of <span>Duttaphrynus melanostictus</span> (Schneider) skin extracts on the physiology of human erythrocytes.<div>Methods</div>Toads captured from their natural habitat were separated into three groups according to their body size. Hydroalcoholic extracts of toad skin were prepared by reflux heating. These extracts were then evaluated for their hemolytic and hemoglobin denaturation potential. The effects of the extracts on cytosolic and membrane-bound enzymes of human erythrocytes were assessed.<div>Results</div>The hemolysis and hemoglobin denaturation caused by these extracts correlated positively with the respective toad sizes. Extracts from medium and large toads led to increased osmotic fragility even at near iso-osmotic concentrations. Biochemical analysis of hemolysate showed that the treatment induced a shift of metabolic flux toward the glutathione pathway. Analysis of membrane-bound enzymes revealed a significant decrease in the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. SDS-PAGE analysis of the erythrocyte membrane did not show the band of tropomodulin for the cells treated with 1000 ùúág/ml extract from large toads.<div>Conclusions</div>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the toxicity of toad skin secretions aggravates with the size of the animal and interferes with the physiology of human erythrocytes, leading to their membrane disruption and rapid lysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"6bfc218054390ffffd3632472b4c191d5b30ada96306cd8647a1c991cb25b90d","category":"Environment"}
