{"title":"The Myb73–GDPD2–GA2ox1 transcriptional regulatory module confers phosphate deficiency tolerance in soybean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2176/7606655?rss=1","date":1707696000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phosphorus is indispensable in agricultural production. An increasing food supply requires more efficient use of phosphate due to limited phosphate resources. However, how crops regulate phosphate efficiency remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a major quantitative trait locus, <span>qPE19</span>, that controls 7 low-phosphate (LP)-related traits in soybean (<span>Glycine max</span>) through linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies. We identified the gene responsible for <span>qPE19</span> as <span>GLYCEROPHOSPHORYL DIESTER PHOSPHODIESTERASE2</span> (<span>GmGDPD2</span>), and haplotype 5 represents the optimal allele favoring LP tolerance. Overexpression of <span>GmGDPD2</span> significantly affects hormone signaling and improves root architecture, phosphate efficiency and yield-related traits; conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-edited plants show decreases in these traits. GmMyb73 negatively regulates <span>GmGDPD2</span> by directly binding to its promoter; thus, GmMyb73 negatively regulates LP tolerance. GmGDPD2 physically interacts with GA 2-oxidase 1 (GmGA2ox1) in the plasma membrane, and overexpressing <span>GmGA2ox1</span> enhances LP-associated traits, similar to <span>GmGDPD2</span> overexpression. Analysis of double mutants for <span>GmGDPD2</span> and <span>GmGA2ox1</span> demonstrated that GmGDPD2 regulates LP tolerance likely by influencing auxin and gibberellin dose-associated cell division in the root. These results reveal a regulatory module that plays a major role in regulating LP tolerance in soybeans and is expected to be utilized to develop phosphate-efficient varieties to enhance soybean production, particularly in phosphate-deficient soils.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"160806c2ba0880426218cac4770c5335a2152e082a6b0d119ce384c466079016","category":"Environment"}
