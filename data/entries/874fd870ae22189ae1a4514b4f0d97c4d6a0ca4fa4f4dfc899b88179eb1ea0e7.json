{"title":"102 Circadian patterns of behavior, respiration, rectal temperature, saliva melatonin, cytokine concentrations, and milk immune cells are altered by cooling heat-stressed lactating sows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/33/7664816?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Lactating sows are particularly vulnerable to heat stress (HS) due to the increased metabolism from milk production. A greater understanding of HS response could assist in mitigating its detrimental effects on animal production. Two core circadian clock genes were pinpointed in a recent genome study as potential mediators of HS response, indicating the possible alteration of circadian clocks by HS exposure. This study aimed to assess how cooling of lactating sows under natural heat stress conditions in the summer influenced circadian patterns of respiration rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), behaviors, salivary concentration of cortisol and melatonin, milk cell populations and relative abundance of multiple cytokines in saliva. Lactating sows of mixed parities were divided into two treatment groups: treated with electronic cooling pad (C; n=9) and heat-stressed control (H; n=9). Experiments were conducted during two 48 h periods of increased environmental temperatures from summer heatwaves. During the initial 48 h period, rectal temperature (RT) was monitored every 60 min, rectal temperature (RT) every 30 min, and behaviors of eating, standing, sitting, laying, sleeping, drinking, and nursing every 5 min. Morning milk samples were collected following the completion of the first phase and utilized to categorize and count somatic cells. The second trial was approximately 1 wk later, and during this period saliva samples were collected every 4 h over the 48-h period. Results were analyzed for significant effect of treatments and interaction using periodic regression while circadian patterns were further detected by incorporating a Fourier series model utilizing sine-cosine variables that denote a fit and/or shift in circadian pattern. The analysis revealed that cooling decreased RT and RR while also modifying circadian patterns (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Cooling had no impact on the percentage of time spent in any activity over the 48-h period (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Nevertheless, the daily patterns of eating, standing, and sitting were different between the treatments (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). A shift in eating time to later in the day in H sows relative to C sows related to a second rise in RT during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Saliva melatonin concentrations were increased in C sows and circadian pattern altered relative to H (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), but there was no effect on salivary cortisol concentrations (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Cooling reduced milk lymphocytes (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and influenced diurnal pattern of saliva cytokines including interleukins (IL) IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and IL-15 and transforming growth factor-beta 1. In conclusion, the cooling of heat-stressed sows altered the circadian patterns of physiology, behavior and melatonin, suggesting the need for additional research to investigate whether circadian disruption contributes to reduced production efficiency observed in HS animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"874fd870ae22189ae1a4514b4f0d97c4d6a0ca4fa4f4dfc899b88179eb1ea0e7","category":"Environment"}
