{"title":"CO<sub>2</sub> exposure drives a rapid pH response in live adult <i>Drosophila</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302240","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Sandra G. Zimmerman, Celeste A. Berg</p>\r\n\r\nCO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia is the most common method for immobilizing <i>Drosophila</i> for research purposes. But CO<sub>2</sub> exposure has consequencesâ€”it can impact fertility, behavior, morphogenesis, and cytoskeletal dynamics. In this respect, <i>Drosophila</i> is an outstanding model for studying the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> exposure on tissues. In this study we explored the response of intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) to a one-minute CO<sub>2</sub> pulse using a genetically encoded, ubiquitously expressed pH sensor, tpHusion, to monitor pH<sub>i</sub> within a live, intact, whole fly. We compared wild-type flies to flies lacking Imaginal disc growth factors (Idgfs), which are chitinase-like proteins that facilitate developmental processes and the innate immune response. Morphogenetic and cytoskeletal defects in <i>Idgf-null</i> flies are enhanced after CO<sub>2</sub> exposure. We found that pH<sub>i</sub> drops sharply within seconds of the beginning of a CO<sub>2</sub> pulse and recovers over several minutes. The initial profile was nearly identical in control and <i>Idgf-null</i> flies but diverged as the pH<sub>i</sub> returned to normal. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring pH in live adult <i>Drosophila</i>. Studies exploring pH homeostasis are important for understanding human pathologies associated with pH dysregulation.","author":"Sandra G.
