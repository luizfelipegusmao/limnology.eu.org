The statistical populace for this examination comprised all patrons of food retail establishments in Tehran, with the sample size determined using the Cochran formula for an unknown community size, involving the distribution of 30 questionnaires to customers (n=439). Data collection was carried out through a random sampling technique. The survey instrument consisted of a questionnaire with two sections consisting of general queries (7 questions) and specific inquiries (23 items) categorized into four dimensions (product, price, place, and promotion) for the clientele. The questionnaire's validity was confirmed through face and content validation, while its reliability was assessed utilizing Cronbachâ€™s alpha. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS25 software, encompassing both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. The results revealed a positive and significant correlation between customers' inclination to consume organic goods and the characteristics of the product, price, and promotion. However, no association was found between the propensity to consume organic products and location characteristics. Concerning contextual variables, a solely positive and significant correlation was identified between the willingness to purchase organic items and consumer income levels. No significant relationships were detected between other contextual variables and organic product consumption. A notable contrast was observed between respondents' gender and their readiness to buy organic products, while no significant variances were noted regarding age, income, occupation, and education in relation to the propensity to purchase organic commodities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e0145ea932fb668cf887eb05fa4b4ef2dd94492a0e5f3d3ad6fc37633ff7b2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
