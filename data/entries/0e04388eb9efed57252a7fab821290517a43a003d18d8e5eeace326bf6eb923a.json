It is therefore necessary to study this breakdown and its origin in order to develop potential methods of prevention. This type of component failure can be modeled in bulk dielectric materials, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), by using an electron accelerator to implant the plastic with charged particles before forcing a breakdown, also called an electrostatic discharge, via mechanical insult [<a href=\"#ozae044.264-B3\">3-6</a>]. This nearly instantaneous discharge leaves behind a track of dendritic breakdown channels, also known as Lichtenberg figures [<a href=\"#ozae044.264-B7\">7-9</a>]. The characteristics of these residual damage patterns provide essential information about the physics at play in the material at the time of the breakdown event. Here we study and categorize these discharge patterns via correlative optical and electron microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0e04388eb9efed57252a7fab821290517a43a003d18d8e5eeace326bf6eb923a","category":"Environment"}
