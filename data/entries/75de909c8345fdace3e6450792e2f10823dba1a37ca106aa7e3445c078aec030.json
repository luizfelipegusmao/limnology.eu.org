{"title":"Characterization of Overtopping Volumes from Focused Wave Groups over Smooth Dikes with Emerged Toe: Insights from Physical Model Tests","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0747/v1","date":1718111429000,"content":"This research examines the overtopping volumes associated with focused wave groups on smooth dikes with an emerged toe. Focused wave groups are employed to represent the highest waves of random sea states in a compact form, obviating the need to model the entire irregular wave train. The study investigates how overtopping volumes are affected by focus location and phase. Results from 418 experimental tests have been gathered and analyzed. The experiments employed first-order wave generation theory to analyse structural response. Subsequent studies will address the errors induced by this approximation and compare it with second-order wave generation. The experiments simulated extreme wave impacts on an idealised coastal layout, comprising a 1:6.3 foreshore slope and three different dike slopes, including vertical structures, with the initial still water level set below the dike toe. The study employed NewWave theory for generating focused wave groups, aiming to extend recent research on wave overtopping under varied conditions. The results, analysed in both dimensional and non-dimensional forms, indicate that overtopping volumes are significantly influenced by the focus phase. Critical focus locations were identified at a distance of one-third of the deep-water wavelength from the toe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75de909c8345fdace3e6450792e2f10823dba1a37ca106aa7e3445c078aec030","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
