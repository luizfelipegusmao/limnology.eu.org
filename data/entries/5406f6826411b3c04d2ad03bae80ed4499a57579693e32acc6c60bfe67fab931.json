{"title":"Transcriptomics Provide Insights into Early Responses to Sucrose Signaling in Lupinus albus, a model plant for adaptations to Phosphorus and Iron Deficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1842/v1","date":1716890550000,"content":"Phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) deficiency are major limiting factors for plant productivity worldwide. White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) has become a model plant for understanding plant adaptations to P and Fe deficiency, because of its ability to form cluster roots, bottle-brush-like root structures that play an important role in the uptake of P and Fe from soil. However, little is known about the signaling pathways involved in sensing and responding to P and Fe deficiency. Sucrose, sent in increased concentrations from the shoot to the root, has been identified as a long-distance signal of both P and Fe deficiency. To unravel responses to sucrose as signal, we performed Oxford Nanopore cDNA sequencing of white lupin roots treated with sucrose for 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min, compared to untreated controls. We identified a set of 17 genes, including two bHLH transcription factors, that were up-regulated at all three time points of sucrose treatment. GO (gene ontology) analysis revealed enrichment of auxin- and gibberellin-responses as early as 10 min after sucrose addition, and the emerging of ethanol-responses at 20 min of sucrose treatment, indicating a sequential involvement of these hormones in plant responses to sucrose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5406f6826411b3c04d2ad03bae80ed4499a57579693e32acc6c60bfe67fab931","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
