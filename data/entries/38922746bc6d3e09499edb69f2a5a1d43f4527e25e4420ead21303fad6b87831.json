{"title":"The p-Frobenius Number for the Triple of the Generalized Star Numbers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2280/v1","date":1722239438000,"content":"In this paper, we give closed-form expressions of the $p$-Frobenius number for the triple of the generalized star numbers $a n(n-1)+1$ for an integer $a\\ge 4$. When $a=6$, it is reduced to the famous star number. For the set of given positive integers $\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_k\\}$, the $p$-Frobenius number is the largest integer $N$ whose number of nonnegative integer representations $N=a_1 x_1+a_2 x_2+\\dots+a_k x_k$ is at most $p$. When $p=0$, the $0$-Frobenius number is the classical Frobenius number, which is the central topic of the famous linear Diophantine problem of Frobenius.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38922746bc6d3e09499edb69f2a5a1d43f4527e25e4420ead21303fad6b87831","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
