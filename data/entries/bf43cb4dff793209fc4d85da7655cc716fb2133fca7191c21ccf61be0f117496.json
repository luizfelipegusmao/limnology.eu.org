{"title":"Probing the Stacking Order of Covalent Organic Frameworks using Electron Ptychography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.156/7719566?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The ability to characterize the three-dimensional atomic-scale structure of beam-sensitive materials is a longstanding challenge in electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B1\">1</a>]. The stacking order of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is important because it controls the transport of charge and mass through the layers. Other techniques have difficulty characterizing variations in stacking order in COFs: for example, x-ray diffraction (XRD) produces spatially averaged information, while methods such as micro-electron diffraction can be difficult to interpret in the presence of grain boundaries and stacking faults. Here, we use electron ptychography to directly image the structure and stacking order of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). We studied the TAPB-DMPDA (1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene - 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) COF system [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B2\">2</a>], which are porous, multilayered 2D COFs utilized in catalysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B3\">3</a>], sensors [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B4\">4</a>], and molecular separators [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B5\">5</a>]. Using multislice ptychography [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B6\">6</a>], we are able to achieve a z-depth resolution of ptychography of 7 nm. This high depth resolution allows us to visualize a half unit cell shift 20 nm deep in the material, as well as smaller shifts in stacking order throughout the sample. These data reveal that, contrary to prior reports that most COFs have eclipsed or nearly-eclipsed stacking orders [<a href=\"#ozae044.156-B7\">7</a>], TAPB-DMPDA contains much larger shifts in stacking order within individual crystals, even for COFs that appear oriented in x-ray diffraction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bf43cb4dff793209fc4d85da7655cc716fb2133fca7191c21ccf61be0f117496","category":"Environment"}
