{"title":"Exploring The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: A Broad Analysis of Market and Technological Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1860/v1","date":1714379158000,"content":"The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, a cornerstone of modern software engineering, offers a robust framework for developing dynamic user interfaces. This paper conducts a broad analysis of MVC’s deployment across various sectors, emphasizing its critical role in technological advancement and market integration. By examining implementation strategies in web development, mobile applications, and enterprise solutions, the study illustrates how MVC enhances application manageability, promotes efficient code reuse, and facilitates parallel development. The paper explores the adoption of MVC principles within major technologies such as Java, .NET, and JavaScript frameworks, underlining its widespread acceptance. Additionally, the analysis covers the preferential use of MVC frameworks within diverse market sectors including technology enterprises, educational institutions, e-commerce, and financial services, which leverage MVC for superior data management and user experience. Emerging trends such as the shift towards the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and the integration of MVC with artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are also discussed. This comprehensive review not only reaffirms MVC’s enduring relevance but also its adaptive evolution in response to emerging technological demands and market needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4ec251f54e534f26a59709ddd4c10f93de225ca8d1fe91b23b175d04f39ae3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
