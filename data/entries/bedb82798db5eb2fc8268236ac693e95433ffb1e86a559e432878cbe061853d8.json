{"title":"Sustainability of Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2TiBr6 Perovskite Solar Cells: The Challenges and Research Roadmap for Power Conversion Efficiency Improvement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1340/v2","date":1718890513000,"content":"The stability issues in the widely known organic inorganic halide perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3, lead to the development of alternative halide double perovskite materials which get great attention in recent times. Although the stability issue seems promising, both materials and device performance of these photovoltaic materials remain inferior and challenging for improvements. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of single junction organic inorganic halide perovskite is now 24.2% and 29.15% for textured monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, but for all-inorganic halide perovskite solar cell is 7.11% and halide double perovskite solar cells based on Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2TiBr6 is 2.8% and  3.3%, respectively, which is far less than 24.2% and 29.15%, respectively. This creates big question and concern that can both all-inorganic halide perovskite solar cell and halide double perovskites solar cells really be an acceptable alternatives to replace organic inorganic halide perovskite solar cells or lead based perovskite solar cells in the market in order to realize the sustainable practical applications? Not only this concern, but also there are many other big challenges facing by halide double perovskite solar cells. Such big challenges include: a) geometric constraints and limited integration with interfacial materials, b) dynamic disorder and a wide band gap and localized conduction band caused by cubic unit cell which restrains the interactions of orbitals, c) high processing temperature which may limit on the diverse applications, d) low electronic dimensionality making them less appropriate for single junction solar cell purpose and etc. Moreover, origin of electronic and optical properties such as the polarizability, the presence of molecular dipoles and their influence on the dynamics of the photo-excitations in the halide double perovskites remains unlock concern that need to be elucidated. Now, another big question is how to develop overcoming mechanisms for such challenges. Can we really overcome these current limitations faced by halide double perovskites so that we use them for sustainable commercialization? This research roadmap for performance improvement is suggested focusing on: materials surface and bulk engineering, band gap engineering, interfacial engineering, composition engineering, doping engineering, device architectural engineering, polar and domain order engineering. This was the reason that this review was developed in order to forward great contributions to the readers and commercial ventures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bedb82798db5eb2fc8268236ac693e95433ffb1e86a559e432878cbe061853d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
