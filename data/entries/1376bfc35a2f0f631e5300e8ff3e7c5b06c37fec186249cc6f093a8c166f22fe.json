{"title":"159 The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for companion animals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/128/7757136?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid of the plant <span>Cannabis sativa</span> L. CBD is increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional therapies to treat health disorders in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action of CBD have been investigated mostly in rodents and in vitro and include interactions with cell receptors of the endocannabinoid system (ES). In companion animals, CBD is well tolerated at physiological doses. Some dog studies have found CBD to improve clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to conclude the therapeutic action of CBD for each of these conditions, as well as for decreasing anxiety and aggression in dogs and cats. In this presentation, we will summarize the available scientific evidence associated with the mechanisms of action of CBD as adjunct therapy for various health conditions, as well as its pharmacokinetics and tolerability in companion animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1376bfc35a2f0f631e5300e8ff3e7c5b06c37fec186249cc6f093a8c166f22fe","category":"Environment"}
