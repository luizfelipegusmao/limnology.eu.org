{"title":"Water‐in‐oil adjuvant challenges in fish vaccination: An experimental inactivated adjuvanted vaccine against betanodavirus infection in Senegalese sole","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13945?af=R","date":1711342177000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The extensive growth of intensive fish farming has led to a massive spread of infectious diseases. Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is the causative agent of the viral encephalo- and retinopathy disease which has become a major threat for fish farming all over the globe. The devastating mortality rates recorded in disease outbreaks, especially when infected specimens are at early stages of development, have a high economic impact on the sector. Currently, vaccines are the most cost-effective preventing tool in the fight against viruses. Inactivated vaccines have the advantage of simplicity in their development at the same time as present the antigen in a similar manner than the natural infection in the host. Nevertheless, they usually trigger weaker immune responses needing adjuvants to boost their effectiveness. In this work, we have intraperitoneally vaccinated Senegalese sole juveniles (<i>Solea senegalensis</i>) with a previously designed inactivated vaccine against NNV based on binary ethylenimine (BEI), mixed or not with an oil-adjuvant. Our results demonstrated the potential activation of different immune pathways when the vaccine was administered alone compared to the oil-adjuvanted vaccine, both resulting in an equivalent partial improvement in survival following a NNV challenge. However, whilst the vaccine alone led to a significant increase in specific antibodies, in the adjuvanted version those antibodies were kept basal although with a slight improvement in their neutralization capacity. At transcriptional level, neither vaccine (adjuvanted or not) triggered the immune system activation during the vaccination period. However, after NNV infection, the BEI-inactivated vaccines alone and oil-adjuvanted both elicited the stimulation of antiviral responsive genes (<i>rtp3</i>, <i>herc4</i>), antigen presentation molecules (<i>mhcii</i>) and T-cell markers (<i>cd8a</i>) in the head-kidney. Additionally, the oil-adjuvanted vaccine appears to stimulate mediator cytokines (<i>il6</i>) and B-cell markers (<i>ight</i> and <i>ighm</i>). Surprisingly, when the adjuvant was administered alone, fish showed the highest survival rates concomitantly with a lack of NNV-IgM production, pointing to the possible induction of different immune pathways than the B-cell responses <i>via</i> antibodies by the adjuvant. Since this combined vaccine did not succeed in the full extension of protection against the pathogen, further studies should be performed focusing on unravelling the molecular mechanisms through which adjuvants trigger the immune response, both independently and when added to a vaccine antigen.</p>","author":"Yulema Valero, \nSandra Souto, \nJosé G.
