{"title":"Latin America&#039;s Dengue Outbreak Poses Global Health Threat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0405/v1","date":1720078388000,"content":"Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), presents a significant global health challenge, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. In 2024, dengue cases in Brazil are four times higher than in 2023, with a significant increase in deaths. This serves as a warning for potential new dengue outbreaks in non-tropical areas. Herein, we explored various aspects of DENV transmission, clinical manifestations, epidemiological trends, and management strategies. DENV transmission involves Aedes mosquitoes as vectors and humans as a host, influenced by temperature, humidity, and precipitation, exacerbated by climate change. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, affected by viral serotype and host factors. Common symptoms of dengue include strong headache, body and joint pain, prostration, weakness, pain behind the eyes, rash, and itchy skin. In some cases, especially in children, dengue may initially present with intense diarrhea and vomiting before progressing to more characteristic symptoms. Even patients with mild dengue fever often experience symptoms, particularly weakness, that hinder their ability to perform daily activities. These symptoms can persist for at least one week. We approached several diagnoses that combine clinical symptoms with serological and molecular tests. Prevention strategies implemented in Brazil include vector control, community engagement, and vaccination programs are described and shown to be insufficient to prevent the outbreak in 2024. Climate change drives the geographical expansion of dengue-endemic areas, with recent outbreaks in Europe highlighting the evolving epidemiological landscape. Vigilant and global collaborative efforts are crucial to decrease dengue's impact worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0a9b2d9004226983445bd753c5411272949519f6b898a7e8eea0096276ef717","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
