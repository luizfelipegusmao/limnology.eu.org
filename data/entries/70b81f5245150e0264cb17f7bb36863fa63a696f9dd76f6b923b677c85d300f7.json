{"title":"Combining Immunotherapy with Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma-The Rationale and Review of Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2257/v1","date":1722232451000,"content":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide and a major global health burden. The treatment of HCC has experienced a paradigm shift in the last few years, following the discovery of immunotherapy. However, despite the profound success of immunotherapy in other cancer types, their response in HCC remains unsatisfactory. Some of the reasons that can explain this poor response include the immunosuppressive microenvironment of HCC, the absence of reliable biomarkers for response, and drug resistance. Previous preclinical and clinical studies have highlighted the role of combination therapy in overcoming some of these hurdles. In this article, we discuss the benefit of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in HCC and shed light on promising clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70b81f5245150e0264cb17f7bb36863fa63a696f9dd76f6b923b677c85d300f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
