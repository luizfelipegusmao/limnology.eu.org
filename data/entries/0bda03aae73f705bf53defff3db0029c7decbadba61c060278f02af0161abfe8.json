{"title":"Spectral variation and pigmentary basis of ornamental and mimetic wing colour patches of swallowtail butterflies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/evolinnean/kzae018/7740487?rss=1","date":1724457600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Colours and colour patterns are diverse traits that are often used as visual signals. To test ecological and evolutionary drivers of these visual signals, a clear understanding of their nature and variation is necessary. Here we characterize variation in wing coloration of mormon swallowtail butterflies (<span>Papilio</span>, subgenus <span>Menelaides</span>). These species exhibit two kinds of colour patches on black wings: creamy white/yellow/green patches that are presumably used as sexual ornaments, and pure white patches that are presumably used as mimetic signals. Using reflectance spectrophotometry we quantified spectral properties of black wing background and colour patches between sexes, wing surfaces, and mimicry status. We found that brightness and saturation of the black background were less variable across sexes, wing surfaces, and mimetic/nonmimetic status. However, colour contrast and saturation were higher on dorsal surfaces than on ventral surfaces, and colour contrast between the black background and colour patches was higher in males than in females. Colour patches in nonmimetic butterflies were brighter and more saturated across the whole colour spectrum compared to mimetic butterflies. Thus, our study characterizes colour variation in an extraordinary signal radiation on the wings of swallowtail butterflies, a model clade in ecology, evolution, and genetics. Our results generate numerous hypotheses about the ecological and sexual functions of these colour patches, which may guide further behavioural experiments. Finally, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry we identified the pigment papiliochrome-II to be the chemical basis of the presumed sexual ornaments in mormon swallowtails.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"3a6bf3189332aa8d860b0369d5aa2ac065f7385b7c3f4543469ad2a55950d26a","entryHash":"0bda03aae73f705bf53defff3db0029c7decbadba61c060278f02af0161abfe8","category":"Environment"}
