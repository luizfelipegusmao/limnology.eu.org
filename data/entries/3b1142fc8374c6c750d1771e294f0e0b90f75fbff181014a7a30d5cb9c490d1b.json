In most cases the detail of preserved cells, vessels and nerves liberated through decalcification is startling in light of the vast time periods involved and the associated impact of soil scavengers, decomposers, and severe environmental pressures placed upon buried remains. Until 2020, a review of the most cited reports of dST might have left the wrong impression that the osteocytes (bone cells), blood vessels and red blood cell-like structures discovered have only come from a few specimens of minimally disarticulated limb bones (mostly encapsulated femurs) that were deeply buried in fluvial sandstones, largely undisturbed over deep time and not scavenged by bacteria, fungi, microbes, worms, insects or rodents.
