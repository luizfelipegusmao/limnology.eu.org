In forensic toxicology, the accurate determination of blood OPP concentration is mandatory to prove death by OPP poisoning. However, fatal pesticide concentration in blood at autopsy varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the dead body. In this study, we found that 16 OPPs were degraded by human serum albumin (HSA) in a temperature-dependent fashion. The mechanism underlying MA, DMTP, azinphos-methyl, etrimfos, fenthion (MPP), pirimiphos-methyl, (<span>E</span>)-dimethylvinphos, (<span>Z</span>)-dimethylvinphos, vamidothion, edifenphos (EDDP), fosthiazate, and pyraclofos degradation involves the formation of adducts with tyrosine residues in HSA. The mass spectra obtained by liquid chromatography quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry revealed that phosphate ester amino acid adducts such as Y-adduct1, Y-adduct2, Y-adduct3, Y-adduct4, and Y-adduct5 were formed in HSA solution incubated with OPPs. These results indicate that the 16 OPPs are postmortem changed by HSA. The detection of phosphate ester amino acid adducts such as Y-adduct1, Y-adduct2, Y-adduct3, Y-adduct4, and Y-adduct5, instead of MA, DMTP, azinphos-methyl, etrimfos, MPP, pirimiphos-methyl, (<span>E</span>)-dimethylvinphos, (<span>Z</span>)-dimethylvinphos, vamidothion, EDDP, fosthiazate, and pyraclofos <span>per se</span>, may be used to determine death by these OPPs poisoning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"e10ea5ce29aaf637db7597f3d758c6520abb03df2342eaf51be370575555d303","category":"Environment"}
