{"title":"New Design Scheme and Application of Fresnel Lens for Broadband Photonics Terahertz Communication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1140/v1","date":1726306663000,"content":"In terahertz communication systems, lens antennas used in transceivers are basically plano-convex dielectric lenses. As the aperture increases and the focal length decreases, the thickness and mass of the plano-convex lens increase rapidly. Through theory and simulation, we designed a Fresnel lens suitable for the terahertz band to meet the requirements of large aperture and short focal length, and simulated the performance, advantages and disadvantages of the terahertz Fresnel lens. A 300GHz terahertz wireless communication system was built to verify the gain effect of the Fresnel lens antenna. The experimental results show that the Fresnel lens can amplify the signal in the terahertz band. The theoretical gain of a 30 cm Fresnel lens is 48.83dB, while the actual measured gain is approximately 45dB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be335fac139c01b5c2a64aeab16a484e59c9fa7001194935001fb6e553a53032","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
