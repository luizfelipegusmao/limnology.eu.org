{"title":"An Influence of Structural Parameters of Nanoporous Alumina Matrices on Optical Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0756/v1","date":1710345569000,"content":". In this work, two types of nanoporous alumina membranes were prepared using different acids and were tested. Structural features of the samples were investigated by scanning electron spectroscopy and further by different types of fractal dimension estimation methods. Transmission and scattering of accelerated He+ ions were studied in experiments on ion irradiation of dielectric channels based on porous alumina. Ion accelerator was used as a source of the He+ beam with an energy of 1.7 MeV. A scattering of ions was studied by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Helium transition through nanoporous alumina at various angles between the normal to the sample and the beam direction were observed. It is shown that the porous structure of anodic aluminum oxide is excellent as a dielectric matrix of nanocapillaries. Owing to the small angle scattering, it allows the transportation of the accelerated charged particles through the dielectric capillaries, and, as a result, localization of high energy ion irradiation effects. Additionally, according to the transmission UV-Vis spectra the energy gaps of samples obtained were calculated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98078232bfcd6b9d574773307300302a862b9c1d9d3d2d0cd71bf9ce97b19780","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
