The following imaging features were collected from the primary tumor: tumor size, tumor density, central necrosis, spicules and SUV<sub>max</sub>. For standardization, an indexSUV<sub>max</sub> was calculated (SUV<sub>max</sub> primary tumor/SUV<sub>max</sub> liver). Descriptive statistics and correlations of survival time analyses for PFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression including a hazard ratio (HR). A value of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 was set as statistically significant. The 95%-confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The median follow-up time was 63 (IQR 27–106) months.</p> Results <p>This study included a total of 82 patients (25 women, 57 men; mean age: 66 ± 9 years). IndexSUV<sub>max</sub> (PFS: HR = 1.0, CI: 1.0–1.1, <i>p</i> = 0.49; OS: HR = 1.0, CI: 0.9–1.2, <i>p</i> = 0.41), tumor size (PFS: HR = 1.0, CI: 0.9–1.0, <i>p</i> = 0.08; OS: HR = 1.0, CI: 0.9–1.0, <i>p</i> = 0.07), tumor density (PFS: HR = 0.9, CI: 0.6–1.4, <i>p</i> = 0.73; OS: HR = 0.3; CI: 0.1–1.1; <i>p</i> = 0.07), central necrosis (PFS: HR = 1.0, CI: 0.6–1.8, <i>p</i> = 0.98; OS: HR = 0.6, CI: 0.2–1.9, <i>p</i> = 0.40) and spicules (PFS: HR = 1.0, CI: 0.6–1.9, <i>p</i> = 0.91; OS: HR = 1.3, CI: 0.4–3.7, <i>p</i> = 0.65) did not significantly affect PFS and OS in the study population. An optimal threshold value for the indexSUV<sub>max</sub> was determined by ROC analysis and Youden’s index. There was no significant difference in PFS with an indexSUV<sub>max</sub>-threshold of 3.8 (13 vs. 27 months; <i>p</i> = 0.45) and in OS with an indexSUV<sub>max</sub>-threshold of 4.0 (113 vs. 106 months; <i>p</i> = 0.40).</p> Conclusions <p>SUV<sub>max</sub> and morphologic parameters from pre-therapeutic [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT were not able to predict PFS and OS in NSCLC-patients.</p>","author":"Helena A.
