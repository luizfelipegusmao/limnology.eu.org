The results reveal that GL biochar, activated with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> at a temperature of 500°C (500-ZGBC), demonstrated the greatest specific surface area (S<sub>BET</sub>) of 536.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> for 2,4-D adsorption. The biochar's properties, including specific surface area, morphology, structure, thermal stability, and functional groups, were analyzed. Additionally, studies of kinetic and isotherm profiles were conducted, yielding the highest recorded adsorption capacity of 281.8 mg g<sup>−1</sup>. Pore filling, hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, surface complexation with Zn groups, and electrostatic interactions contribute significantly to the adsorption performance of 500-ZGBC for 2,4-D. Optimal adsorption was determined to occur at pH 2.117, with a dose of 0.4230 g L<sup>−1</sup> of 500-ZGBC, and an initial concentration of 2,4-D at 294.7 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, as evidenced by the application of the response surface method (RSM).</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nPremium pharmaceutical-grade biochar, derived from Ginkgo leaves, boasting a S<sub>BET</sub> of 536.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> was produced.\nAn absorption capacity reaching 281.8 mg g<sup>−1</sup> was observed in Ginkgo leaf biochar for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) adsorption.\nThe adsorption procedure was refined through the employment of response surface methodology.\n</p>","author":"Wenyu Ma, \nRui Song, \nYujiao Wang, \nXiaoyan Cui, \nYumei Yan, \nZhili Liu, \nXiaojun Wang, \nHaixiang Gao, \nRunhua Lua, \nWenfeng Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"5bca2110c75a40021fe266d02234ee6c189a4db20283ea1d7f89c800fe2739ca","category":"Environment"}
