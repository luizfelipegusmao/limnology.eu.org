{"title":"Modelling, Optimising and Improving Metal Foam and Porosity of PEMFCs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1102/v2","date":1716193202000,"content":"The fuel cell particularly the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is a new energy technology that plays a critical role in achieving market viability. The PEMFC has high power density, zero CO2 emissions, and high conversion efficiency. However, with uniform distribution of fuel in PEMFC, we can improve the performance and reduce the cost. The PEMFC will be more efficient and effective in terms of renewable energy as a byproduct only water. Metal foam is used as an alternative for the channels in PEMFC. The model of PEMFC was established by using the ANSYS Fluent 3D Model. Then we proposed four configurations of PEMFC. The outcome demonstrates that Case IV provided outstanding performance if it is compared with the other three cases. In terms of power density, Case IV provided a high power density that is double that of Case I. The porosity of metal foam was investigated. The 0.6 porosity value is found as the optimal value. The uniform distribution of the fuel can be achieved at this value which leads to the outstanding current density.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a82cfcb390fc2f74338e019d12baf5f606af81f08a1197eae6061a570724846","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
