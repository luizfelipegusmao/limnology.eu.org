{"title":"Mathematical Analysis of a Navier Stokes Model with Mittag-Leffler Kernel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1468/v1","date":1724231004000,"content":"In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness results of the fractional Navier-Stokes evolution equation using the Banach fixed point theorem, where the fractional order Î² is in the form of the Atangana-Baleanu Caputo fractional order. The iterative method combined with the Laplace transform and Sumudu transform are employed to find the exact and approximate solutions of the fractional Navier-Stokes equation of a one-dimensional problem of unsteady flow of a viscous fluid in a tube. Mathematica software is used to present the solutions graphically.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed02c2d443d338f3fd3d09c66a41b763a72a149e7c1738c1d934eb7b93172967","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
