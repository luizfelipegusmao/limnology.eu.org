{"title":"Methane Concentration Measurements in the Longwall Area as a Data Source for the Assessment of Methane Hazard","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1950/v1","date":1727185376000,"content":"As an important element of methane prevention in mining facilities, measurements of concentration serve to obtain information about methane hazards. Information about methane concentration must be linked to the place and time of its occurrence to create valuable data for ongoing hazard analysis. The article presents the results of a methane hazard analysis based on an airflow and methane concentration model, validated using measurement data. Subsequently, simulations of crew movement and the operation of individual methane detectors working according to the algorithms of the Methane Hazard Detection System were conducted based on this model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f954534bafcf624bb1ad90927cd21c8099decbc4ea1079a8cecc8bf71e44c7df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
