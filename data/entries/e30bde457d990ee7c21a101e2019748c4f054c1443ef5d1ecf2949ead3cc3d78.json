NEWS2 scores were measured at admission, on 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after their ad-mission to the hospital using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (ROC).\nResults: Overall, 192 adult COVID-19 patients aged 25-94 years (mean=62.1, SD=13.9) were en-rolled. Of those, 49.0% were males, 47.4% were vaccinated, and 53.6% were with diabetes. The mean NEWS scores during the patientâ€™s hospital stay were excellent predictors of mechanical ventilation, admission to the ICU, and mortality, as indicated by an AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88-1.00, P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e30bde457d990ee7c21a101e2019748c4f054c1443ef5d1ecf2949ead3cc3d78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
