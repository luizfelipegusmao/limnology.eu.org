{"title":"Optimization of Conventionally Processed Biological Samples for STEM-EDS Elemental Quantification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.428/7720089?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for imaging biological samples such as cells and their ultrastructure with atomic resolution. However, it cannot provide elemental composition maps if operated in the traditional manner, unless through energy filtered imaging (EFTEM) which has other challenges with quantification and requires an energy filter. By using a TEM that also has materials science capabilities such as scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we can acquire elemental maps by scanning the samples with a focused electron beam and acquiring a spectrum through either electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) or energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with appropriate detectors at resolutions of less than 1 nm and sensitivities of less than one atomic percent. This provides many opportunities to answer important scientific questions related to the presence of metal atoms or other biologically relevant elements such as S, P, Ca, etc. in cells and biological structures in general [<a href=\"#ozae044.428-B1\">1-3</a>]. EDS in particular is a fast and versatile method that has greatly improved through the development of new detectors and can be used to detect and quantify a wide range of elements, even in the low-Z range. EDS detectors are commonly found on materials science microscopes, but typically not compatible with cryo-boxes. Therefore, we would prefer to use STEM-EDS at room temperature on fixed biological samples for simplicity and to improve resistance to beam damage in STEM which can be significant on hydrated frozen samples. The other benefit of STEM imaging, particularly high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM), is the ability to image thicker samples with enhanced mass-thickness contrast as compared to TEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.428-B4\">4</a>]. This also makes the technique ideal for thick biological samples and removes some of the need for heavy metal staining in fixed samples. In fact, heavy metal staining can interfere with the mass contrast provided by STEM imaging. STEM also provides opportunities for elemental mapping with tomography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6ed1bef436383147b0b267ce77a864c22ec231dd0c65c37a8e85f52b5f43500a","category":"Environment"}
