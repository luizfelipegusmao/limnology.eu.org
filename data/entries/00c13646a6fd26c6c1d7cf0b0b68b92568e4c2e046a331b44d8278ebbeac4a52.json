Resistive memory technologies, such as phase change and conductive filament devices, have been demonstrated as potential routes to neuro-inspired computing, but have drawbacks in reliability and power consumption. Recently, hydrogen-based electro-chemical random access memory (EC-RAM), has been shown to overcome these issues [<a href=\"#ozae044.562-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.562-B3\">3</a>]. Using a WO<sub>3</sub> channel, proton-based EC RAM devices are capable of conductance modulation over three orders of magnitude with 1000 or more discernable states, making them well suited to analog neuro-morphic computing applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.562-B3\">3</a>]. An EC-RAM device and its working principle are illustrated in Figure 1a.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"00c13646a6fd26c6c1d7cf0b0b68b92568e4c2e046a331b44d8278ebbeac4a52","category":"Environment"}
