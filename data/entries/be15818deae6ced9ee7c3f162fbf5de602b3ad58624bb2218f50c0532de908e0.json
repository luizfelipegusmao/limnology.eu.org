{"title":"Identification of New Polymorphic Patterns for Elacestrant Dihydrochloride","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1250/v1","date":1718757725000,"content":"Extensive polymorphism screening of elacestrant dihydrochloride, an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), was conducted using various methods and solvents. The solubility assessment and polymorph screening of elacestrant dihydrochloride (referred to as elacestrant throughout the paper) utilized both crystalline and amorphous forms of the API as input material with 40 non-conventional solvents, employing slow cooling, maturation, and/or evaporation. Crystalline material underwent further screening via anti-solvent addition, polymer templating, and solvent-drop grinding. A total of 7 new polymorphs were identified. No solvated forms were identified, but some samples contained notable water content, tentatively classified as hydrated forms. Comprehensive solid-state characterization data for representative crystalline samples of each polymorph is presented. Polymorph A exhibited the highest melt (225-226 째C, onset). Thermal analysis of polymorphs B, C, D, E, F and G showed an endothermic-exothermic event (with an onset temperature between 136 and 184 째C), indicating a form conversion, followed by a melt at 205-222 째C (onset), consistent with the previously identified and most stable form of elacestrant. This suggests that these materials convert to the most stable form prior to melting. Pattern G does not show an endothermic-exothermic event, but after desolvation, the material melts at 222 째C (onset temperature).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be15818deae6ced9ee7c3f162fbf5de602b3ad58624bb2218f50c0532de908e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
