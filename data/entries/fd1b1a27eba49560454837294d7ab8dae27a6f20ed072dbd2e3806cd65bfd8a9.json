{"title":"Imaging the Raf&ndash;MEK&ndash;ERK Signaling Cascade in Living Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2028/v1","date":1724830736000,"content":"Conventional biochemical methods for studying cellular signaling cascades have relied on destructive cell disruption. In contrast, live cell imaging of fluorescent-tagged transfected proteins offers a non-invasive approach to understanding signal transduction events. One strategy involves monitoring the phosphorylation-dependent shuttling of a fluorescent-labeled kinase between the nucleus and cytoplasm using nuclear localization, export signals, or both. This paper introduces a simple method to visualize intracellular signal transduction in live cells by exploring the translocation properties of PKC from the cytoplasm to the membrane. We fused bait protein to PKC, allowing the bait (RFP-labeled) and target (GFP-labeled) proteins to co-translocate from the cytoplasm to the membrane. However, in non-interacting protein pairs, only the bait protein was translocated to the plasma membrane. To verify our approach, we examined the Raf–MEK–ERK signaling cascade (ERK pathway) and directly observed the Raf1/MEK2 interaction. We also identified ternary complexes containing the KSR1 scaffold protein. Additionally, the MEK/ERK interaction was dependent on the exogenous expression of KSR1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd1b1a27eba49560454837294d7ab8dae27a6f20ed072dbd2e3806cd65bfd8a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
