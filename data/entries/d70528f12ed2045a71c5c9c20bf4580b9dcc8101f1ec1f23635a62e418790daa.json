Substitution or partial substitution of 0.1% EGCG for sucrose (1.5%) was added into surimi, and the surimi samples without and with commercial cryoprotectants (4% sucrose and 4% sorbitol) were used as the control group.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The result suggested that with the increase of frozen storage time, the structural performance of surimi protein gradually weakened (e.g., the decrease of the surface hydrophobicity, the increase of the total sulfhydryl and solubility, and the protein MCH bands became shallow) and surimi gel quality gradually deteriorated (e.g., the decrease of water-holding capacity, gel strength and all TPA attributes). However, compared to the other three group surimi samples during the frozen period, the surimi proteins with the partial replacement of sucrose by EGCG had a higher total sulfhydryl group content and solubility of proteins, lower surface hydrophobicity of protein, suggesting that the addition of EGCG as a partial substitute for sucrose can enhance the antifreeze ability of surimi. Meanwhile, the surimi gel with the partial replacement of sucrose by EGCG has a higher water retention capacity, gel strength, and texture attributes (e.g., hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and resilience), indicating that the addition of EGCG as a partial substitute for sucrose can inhibit the deterioration of surimi gel quality.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall, EGCG partially replacing sucrose can play an alternative cryoprotectant with a lower sweetness to prevent the quality of surimi from deteriorating.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
