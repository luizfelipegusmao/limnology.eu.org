{"title":"Analysis of aggregation profile of glucagon using SEC-HPLC and FFF-MALS methods","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304086","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Zhongli Bao, Ya-Chi Cheng, Mary Ziping Luo, Jack Yongfeng Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nRecently, the first generic glucagon for injection was approved for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Unlike its brand name recombinant glucagon, the generic glucagon is synthetic. Since glucagon has a high propensity to form aggregates in solution, it is essential to assess the aggregation profile of the synthetic glucagon compared to the recombinant glucagon. In this study, two robust separation methods, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) and field-flow fractionation coupled with a multi-angle light scattering detector (FFF-MALS), were employed to characterize generic and brand glucagon aggregation in six lots (three newly released, three expired). The presence of aggregation in samples was determined from the generated chromatograms and analyzed. The study showed that both products have comparable aggregation profiles. The SEC-HPLC demonstrated that in both glucagon versions, the expired lots had a higher percentage of dimers than the newly released lots, but even at expiration, the amount was negligible (âˆ¼0.1%). The FFF-MALS method did not detect any dimers or higher molecular weight aggregates. Further evaluation of the detection limit found that FFF-MALS was unable to detect aggregates at amounts lower than 0.5% of total glucagon. The negligible amounts of dimer detected in the generic and brand glucagon indicate that both versions are physically stable and are not prone to aggregation under clinically relevant conditions.","author":"Zhongli Bao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"73696d123c2752d314c50f47c3d58c9bedb43b5eaea02c1affa00b09c99f64e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
