{"title":"103 Effects of partial or total replacement of dried distiller’s grain with soybean meal on growth performance, carcass characteristics, sera urea nitrogen, and net energy utilization in finishing beef steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/29/7664755?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine if partial or complete replacement of dried distiller’s grains plus solubles (DDGS) with solvent-extracted soybean meal (SBM) influences growth performance, efficiency of dietary net energy utilization, sera urea-N (SUN) concentrations, or carcass traits in finishing beef steers. Continental × British steers [initial shrunk body weight (BW) = 382 ± 37 kg] were used in a 139-d experiment. Treatments included: DDGS fed at 20% DM (13.4% CP; DDGS), SBM replacing 50% of DDGS (14.4% CP; SBM50), and SBM replacing 100% of DDGS (15.4% CP; SBM100). Steers (n = 189) were weighed and allotted to 1 of 24 pens (n = 8 steers per pen; 8 pens per treatment) at the Ruminant Nutrition Center near Brookings, SD. Whole blood was collected and harvested as sera on d 77, 105, and 139 to determine SUN concentration. Growth and carcass data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS 9.4 with treatment and block (initial BW grouping) as fixed effects; SUN data were analyzed using repeated measures, pen was the experimental unit. Inclusion level was evaluated for linear and quadratic components by the method of orthogonal polynomials. Final BW was calculated by dividing hot carcass weight (HCW) by 0.625. No differences were noted (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.18) for final BW, average daily gain, dry matter intake, or feed efficiency. Dietary treatment tended to affect gain to feed ratio (G:F; quadratic; <span>P</span> = 0.10) and SBM increased the apparent efficiency of energy capture. Treatment had no effect (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.22) on HCW, rib fat, marbling score, USDA yield grade, or final BW adjusted to 28% empty body fat. Complete replacement of DDGS with SBM increased rib eye area by 1% (linear; <span>P</span> = 0.02), but decreased dressing percentage (linear, <span>P</span> = 0.03). Distribution of USDA quality or yield grades were unaffected by treatment (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.36). No treatment × day interaction was observed for SUN (<span>P</span> = 0.20). However, day (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and treatment (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) effects were observed. Initial samples (d 77) differed between DDGS and SBM treatments, with the latter having greater SUN values (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). On d 105, the SBM100 treatment had greater SUN than DDGS, and SBM50 was intermediate (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). On d 139, steers from SBM100 had elevated increased SUN compared with SBM50 and DDGS treatments (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Net energy values calculated from animal performance for DDGS agreed closely with tabular estimates. In this experiment, replacement of DDGS with SBM increased the observed to expected ratio of dietary NE, increased muscularity and tended to decrease DP with no other observed effects on growth performance or carcass traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"fa310400aa1444d4e2da7d91bdaa1689cfe4cf7b6e25b84027af69fcc25706ce","category":"Environment"}
