{"title":"Chromosome-specific painting reveals the Y genome origin and chromosome rearrangements of the St genome in Triticeae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/870/7735785?rss=1","date":1724025600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Karyotypes provide key cytogenetic information on phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary origins in related plant species. The St genome of <span>Pseudoroegneria</span> contributes to 8 alloploid genera, representing over half of the species that are highly valuable for wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span>) breeding and for understanding Triticeae species evolution. However, St chromosome characterization is challenging due to limited cytogenetic markers and DNA information. We developed a complete set of St genome-specific chromosome painting probes for identification of the individual chromosomes 1St to 7St based on the genome sequences of <span>Pseudoroegneria libanotica</span> and wheat. We revealed the conservation of St chromosomes in St-containing species by chromosome painting, including <span>Pseudoroegneria</span>, <span>Roegneria</span>, <span>Elymus</span>, and <span>Campeiostachys</span>. Notably, the Y genome showed hybridization signals, albeit weaker than those of the St genome. The awnless species harboring the Y genome exhibited more intense hybridization signals compare to the awned species in <span>Roegneria</span> and <span>Campeiostachys</span>, yet weaker than the hybridization signals of the St genome in autotetraploid <span>Pseudoroegneria strigosa</span>. Although awnless species were morphologically more similar to each other, phenotypic divergence progressively increased from awnless to awned species. Our results indicate that the Y genome originated from the St genome and shed light on the possible origin of the <span>Roegneria</span> and <span>Campeiostachys</span> species, enhancing our understanding of St-genome-containing species evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"82dd93cb8ffa9fcbfe5526d7b5948abf186499fd8e54bbd7e35e73cdd60cc51d","category":"Environment"}
