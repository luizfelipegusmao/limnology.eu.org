{"title":"The OsMOB1A–OsSTK38 kinase complex phosphorylates CYCLIN C, controlling grain size and weight in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2873/7667909?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Grain size and weight are crucial yield-related traits in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). Although certain key genes associated with rice grain size and weight have been successfully cloned, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain size and weight regulation remain elusive. Here, we identified a molecular pathway regulating grain size and weight in rice involving the MPS ONE BINDER KINASE ACTIVATOR-LIKE 1A–SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE 38–CYCLIN C (OsMOB1A–OsSTK38–OsCycC) module. OsSTK38 is a nuclear Dbf2-related kinase that positively regulates grain size and weight by coordinating cell proliferation and expansion in the spikelet hull. OsMOB1A interacts with and enhances the autophosphorylation of OsSTK38. Specifically, the critical role of the OsSTK38 S322 site in its kinase activity is highlighted. Furthermore, OsCycC, a component of the Mediator complex, was identified as a substrate of OsSTK38, with enhancement by OsMOB1A. Notably, OsSTK38 phosphorylates the T33 site of OsCycC. The phosphorylation of OsCycC by OsSTK38 influenced its interaction with the transcription factor KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 7 (OsKNAT7). Genetic analysis confirmed that OsMOB1A, OsSTK38, and OsCycC function in a common pathway to regulate grain size and weight. Taken together, our findings revealed a connection between the Hippo signaling pathway and the cyclin-dependent kinase module in eukaryotes. Moreover, they provide insights into the molecular mechanisms linked to yield-related traits and propose innovative breeding strategies for high-yielding varieties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"75ebb4193f47f275f7daf8cf496705b2837eff4bb3a65349b91c2d44212a5319","category":"Environment"}
