We included 134 articles representing 123 parenting trials (PROSPERO record CRD42022285998). Studies were conducted across high-income (62%) and low-and-middle-income (38%) countries. The most frequently used interventions were Reach Up and Learn, Nurse Family Partnership, and Head Start. Half of the interventions were delivered as home visits. The other half used mixed settings and modalities (27%), clinic visits (12%), and community-based group sessions (11%). Due to the lack of data, we were only able to test the moderating role of a few implementation characteristics in intervention impacts on parenting and cognitive outcomes (by country income level) in the meta-analysis. None of the implementation characteristics moderated intervention impacts on cognitive or parenting outcomes in low- and middle-income or high-income countries. There is a significant need in the field of parenting interventions for ECD to consistently collect and report data on key implementation characteristics. These data are needed to advance our understanding of how parenting interventions are implemented and how implementation factors impact outcomes to help inform the scale-up of effective interventions to improve child development.</p>","author":"Marilyn N.
