Although freshwater drain to the coast, the downstream consequences in coastal marine ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we propose that a century of afforestation in Northern Europe has caused more than a month delay in spawning time for the Northeast Atlantic cod. The two are connected through a cascade of physical and biological processes, starting with plant growth on land moving through browner lakes and rivers causing decreased light penetration in coastal waters that postpone the phytoplankton spring bloom and culminate in an adaptive adjustment of spawning time for the cod.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>At high latitudes, the suitable window for timing reproductive events is particularly narrow, promoting tight synchrony between trophic levels. Climate change may disrupt this synchrony due to diverging responses to temperature between, for example, the early life stages of higher trophic levels and their food resources. Evidence for this is equivocal, and the role of compensatory mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we show how a combination of ocean warming and coastal water darkening drive long-term changes in phytoplankton spring bloom timing in Lofoten Norway, and how spawning time of Northeast Arctic cod responds in synchrony. Spring bloom timing was derived from hydrographical observations dating back to 1936, while cod spawning time was estimated from weekly fisheries catch and roe landing data since 1877. Our results suggest that land use change and freshwater run-off causing coastal water darkening has gradually delayed the spring bloom up to the late 1980s after which ocean warming has caused it to advance. The cod appear to track phytoplankton dynamics by timing gonadal development and spawning to maximize overlap between offspring hatch date and predicted resource availability. This finding emphasises the importance of land–ocean coupling for coastal ecosystem functioning, and the potential for fish to adapt through phenotypic plasticity.</p>","author":"Anders Frugård Opdal, \nChristian Lindemann, \nTom Andersen, \nDag O.
