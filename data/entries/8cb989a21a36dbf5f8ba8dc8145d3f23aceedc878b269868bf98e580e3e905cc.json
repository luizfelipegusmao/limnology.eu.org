{"title":"Exploring the Microstructural Effect of FeCo Alloy on Carbon Microsphere Deposition and Enhanced Electromagnetic Wave Absorption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1521/v1","date":1718981927000,"content":"The rational design of magnetic carbon composites, encompassing both composition and microstructure, holds significant potential for achieving exceptional electromagnetic wave absorbing materials (EAMs). In this study, FeCo@CM composites was efficiently fabricated through an advanced microwave plasma assisted reduction chemical vapor deposition (MPARCVD) technique, offering high efficiency, low cost, and energy-saving benefits. By depositing graphitized carbon microspheres, the dielectric properties were significantly enhanced, resulting in improved electromagnetic wave absorption performances through optimized impedance matching and a synergistic effect with magnetic loss. A systematic investigation revealed that the laminar-stacked structure of FeCo exhibited superior properties compared to its spherical counterpart, supplying a higher number of exposed edges and enhanced catalytic activity, which facilitated the deposition of uniform and low-defect graphitized carbon microspheres. Consequently, the dielectric loss performance of the FeCo@CM composites was dramatically improved due to increased electrical conductivity and the formation of abundant heterogeneous interfaces. At a 40 wt% filling amount and a frequency of 7.84 GHz, the FeCo@CM composites achieved a minimum reflection loss value of -58.2 dB with an effective absorption bandwidth (fE) of 5.13 GHz. This study presents an effective strategy for developing high-performance EAMs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cb989a21a36dbf5f8ba8dc8145d3f23aceedc878b269868bf98e580e3e905cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
