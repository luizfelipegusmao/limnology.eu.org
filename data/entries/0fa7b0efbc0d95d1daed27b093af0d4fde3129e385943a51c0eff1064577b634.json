Surfactant has emerged as a potential modifier since it is eco-friendly and simple. In this study, the surface of functionalised silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) was modified using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in a polyacrylamide (PAM) composite. Characterisation of the drilling fluid was examined through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, surface tension, contact angle and rheological tests. According to the results, FTIR proved that the modification of PAM was successful. However, all modified PAM showed more hydrophilic properties with low surface tension than bare PAM. The rheological properties of all the modified PAM were varied over all the concentrations of SDS. Meanwhile, the rheological properties of the modified PAM were better than that of bare PAM. Due to the synergistic effect between the surfactant and functionalised material involved, the drilling fluid achieved low plastic viscosity in modified PAM. With a flat gel strength and better rheological properties, 0.2 wt% SDS in modified PAM is a great and promising formula in this study. In the future, further investigation can be conducted on bored pile drilling using this formulation.</p>","author":"Jin Kwei Koh, \nChin Wei Lai, \nMohd Rafie Johan, \nSin Seng Gan, \nWei Wei Chua","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"0fa7b0efbc0d95d1daed27b093af0d4fde3129e385943a51c0eff1064577b634","category":"Environment"}
