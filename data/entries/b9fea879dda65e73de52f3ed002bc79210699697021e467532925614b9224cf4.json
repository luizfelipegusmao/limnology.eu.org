{"title":"Three-dimensional analysis of the intracellular architecture by scanning electron microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/3/215/7335656?rss=1","date":1698796800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The two-dimensional observation of ultrathin sections from resin-embedded specimens provides an insufficient understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) morphological information of membranous organelles. The osmium maceration method, developed by Professor Tanaka’s group &gt;40 years ago, is the only technique that allows direct observation of the 3D ultrastructure of membrane systems using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), without the need for any reconstruction process. With this method, the soluble cytoplasmic proteins are removed from the freeze-cracked surface of cells while preserving the integrity of membranous organelles, achieved by immersing tissues in a diluted osmium solution for several days. By employing the maceration method, researchers using SEM have revealed the 3D ultrastructure of organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in various cell types. Recently, we have developed new SEM techniques based on the maceration method to explore further possibilities of this method. These include: (i) a rapid osmium maceration method that reduces the reaction duration of the procedure, (ii) a combination method that combines agarose embedding with osmium maceration to elucidate the 3D ultrastructure of organelles in free and cultured cells and (iii) a correlative immunofluorescence and SEM technique that combines cryosectioning with the osmium maceration method, enabling the correlation of the immunocytochemical localization of molecules with the 3D ultrastructure of organelles. In this paper, we review the novel osmium maceration methods described earlier and discuss their potential and future directions in the field of biology and biomedical research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"b9fea879dda65e73de52f3ed002bc79210699697021e467532925614b9224cf4","category":"Environment"}
