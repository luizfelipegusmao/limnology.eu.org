{"title":"Coating Hydroxyapatite with 2-Heptylcyclopropane-1-Carboxylic Acid Prevents P. gingivalis Biofilm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2565/v1","date":1722584873000,"content":"Infections are a common post-operative ailment for patients who have received a dental implant or device and can be attributed to biofilm formation in tissue or on the implant. Many current solutions for oral hygiene have side effects and affect the natural oral microbiome. 2-heptylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (2CP) is a medium-chain fatty acid and synthetic diffusible signaling factor that can prevent and disperse biofilm. The purpose of this work was to evaluate an immersion strategy for coating hydroxyapatite (HAp) with 2CP to prevent biofilm attachment on and around natural teeth and dental implants. The release profile of 2CP-loaded and 2CP+oral rinse-loaded HAp coupons (n=6) was assessed by a 3-day exposure to phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Antimicrobial properties against Porphyromonas gingivalis and cytocompatibility of 2CP-loaded HAp coupons (n=4) were also assessed alone and in combination with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. The majority of 2CP is released by 12 hours. 2CP, oral rinse, and 2CP+oral rinse significantly reduced P. gingivalis viability, though direct contact assay demonstrates a significant reduction in Saos-2 viability for oral rinse and 2CP+oral rinse coupons. Immersion or rinsing hydroxyapatite with 2CP could inhibit biofilm-associated dental infections and prevent further complications including caries, gingivitis, and peri-implantitis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"039979069973307de2a8ed0e9e579036a90f8e3c9cb16f95060d4765b3bc1906","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
