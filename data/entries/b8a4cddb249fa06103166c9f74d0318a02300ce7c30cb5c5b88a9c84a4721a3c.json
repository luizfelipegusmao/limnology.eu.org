{"title":"308 Awardee Talk: Prevention and mitigation of pathogens in feed and feed manufacturing systems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/234/7665033?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Prior to 2013, pathogen transmission through feed was focused primarily on bacteria and biosecurity was used to prevent adulterant entry into the ingredients and the feed mills. Following the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak in 2013, research focused on pathogen mitigation and control quickly became a subject of interest. Since PEDV, multiple endemic viruses and foreign animal diseases have been found to be transmissible in feed or feed ingredients. As African swine fever virus (ASFV) spread closer to the United States and endemic pathogens are a continued pressure on production systems, it is imperative that prevention measures are included in the feed supply chain and options for mitigation are fully elucidated for times of need. Previous research has demonstrated that preventative measures such as boot baths, lines of separation, showers, and changing clothes are effective measures when appropriately maintained. However, these protocols can seem costly and burdensome to employees, especially when the risk of disease transmission appears low. Employee training is difficult as disease transmission is difficult to visualize and exhibit the importance of each measure. Glo Germ, a florescent substance, is a cost-effective training tool which can demonstrate the efficacy of prevention protocols and can identify areas where biosecurity measures have not been properly utilized. Preventative measures are the first line of defense for feed manufacturing systems, but understanding and using mitigation techniques in the event of contamination can limit pathogen spread and protect the rest of the feed supply chain. Pelleting, as a method of thermal inactivation process, has recently been demonstrated to lessen the quantity of detectable viral RNA and decrease the risk of infection. The pelleting process, however, is a point-in-time mitigant and does not decrease the risk of product re-contamination as feed continues down the supply chain. The use of chemical mitigants, like formaldehyde, medium-chain fatty acids, and organic acids, can decrease the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens with longer-lasting mitigation properties. These mitigants can either be used in the feed itself, or as an addition to flushing batches which help disperse the chemical mitigants throughout the feed manufacturing equipment, thus reducing the risk of product re-contamination. In the event more drastic measures must be taken to eliminate pathogen presence from feed mills, gaseous fumigation and the use of portable heaters show promise as methods to decontaminate feed manufacturing equipment without the use of water or complete equipment breakdown. Overall, effective training and implementation of preventative measures are needed to provide pathogen-free feed to production systems, but continued research in mitigation and mill decontamination will further protect the feed supply chain in the event of pathogen contamination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b8a4cddb249fa06103166c9f74d0318a02300ce7c30cb5c5b88a9c84a4721a3c","category":"Environment"}
