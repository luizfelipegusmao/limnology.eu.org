{"title":"Trend and Priority Change of Global Automotive Engine Innovation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0140/v1","date":1727921344000,"content":"The purpose of this study is to examine how sales restrictions on gasoline-powered vehicles influence patent application behavior in automobile engine technology. This is achieved through a factorial analysis targeting structural changes in patent applications. We examine patterns in patent data from 1985 to 2019 using index decomposition based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index. The analysis utilizes patent data and focuses on one non-green (internal combustion engine vehicles) and three green automobile engine technologies (battery electric vehicle, hybrid electric vehicle, and full cell vehicle). Furthermore, the study focuses on four significant patent offices (China, Japan, the United States, and Germany) to examine global disparities. The analytical results reveal that a countryâ€™s green investment pattern changes depending on its growth stage. Intellectual property protection policies and encouragement of R&amp;D will extend the scope of R&amp;D activities in emerging nations where intellectual property markets are not well developed. Furthermore, different countries have distinct product development strategies when it comes to various forms of green automotive engine technologies. Green patents are likely to rise in industrialized nations for incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies for R&amp;D spending on specific technological advancements and the extension of intellectual property protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb112777a01a504b522fe4baf31597cb3571b8025384d816b3edfc4841e8f4be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
