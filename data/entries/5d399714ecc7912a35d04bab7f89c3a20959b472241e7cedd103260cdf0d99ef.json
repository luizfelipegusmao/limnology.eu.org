{"title":"Food Safety Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) Among Dairy Retail Vendors in Amman, Jordan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1041/v1","date":1715785064000,"content":"Food safety in dairy shops has gained increasing attention. Consequently, this study aims to evaluate dairy handlers' knowledge of food safety practices, assess compliance with food safety codes regarding facility maintenance and personal hygiene, and understand retail dairy shops' capacity to implement food safety standards. This research involved surveys and interviews with 110 dairy retail workers to gauge their grasp of food safety principles, their recognition of its importance, and the obstacles they encounter in implementing proper food safety measures. Among the participants, 93% were males under 35 years old, with experience ranging from 1 to 8 years. \nThe study revealed that while over 83% of participants were familiar with standard procedures ensuring dairy product safety, only 37% understood “HACCP” in relation to food safety. Additionally, 42% believed that freezing food at -18°C eliminates food bacteria, and 56% thought food contamination could be identified by taste, indicating misconceptions among respondents. Results showed that 90% of survey participants had a strong awareness of food safety, with 98% emphasizing the importance of regular inspection of production areas for cleanliness to ensure a safe dairy production environment. However, less than 45% had received formal training on dairy-specific food safety practices, and only 53.6% had a documented system for correctly labeling and providing production dates for dairy products. These findings have significant implications for public health and food safety policies in Jordan. Furthermore, the study provides valuable insights to enhance food safety practices among dairy retail vendors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d399714ecc7912a35d04bab7f89c3a20959b472241e7cedd103260cdf0d99ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
