{"title":"Promoting urban corridors in Saudi city center to enhance walkability feature using multi-criteria decision analysis methods.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1177/v1","date":1718706230000,"content":"Saudi Arabian cities have experienced a rapid expansion of their urban areas - particularly their city centers - over the last four decades. This has resulted to an increase in vehicular usage, which has adversely affected the daily walking experience of the residents. Walkability has several positive effects on people's health as well as the environment in cities. In addition to being a means of transportation, it also helps people create a sense of place, enhancing their image ability to be easily understood as a legible urban structure, and deepen their emotional bond with the city. Using the medium-sized Saudi Arabian city of Onaizah as a case study, this study looks into the feasibility of creating urban walking corridors to encourage users to walk more. According to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which emphasizes the value of sustainable urban development and raising quality of life for residents, the study addresses walkability as a generator to maintain and improve the urban scene of the city center. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used to analyze the data and generate the urban corridors in the city center. The results showed the possibility of improving walking in Onaizah through three urban corridors to the city center, measuring 1,401 meters, 1,283 meters, and 1,507 meters, respectively. These corridors represent urban, commercial and heritage corridors, giving an opportunity for planners and decision makers to challenge prioritize pedestrian connectivity and enhance the physical environment, leading to sustainable urban development. This research paper used various criteria analysis methods to provide a comprehensive assessment of various factors to conclude these urban corridors; for example, assessments of land use, transportation and environmental considerations. The study aligns with Saudi Arabia's vision 2030 by promoting walking and enhancing the city's overall walkability while offering Onaizah society by creating and suggesting urban corridors to the city center a sustainable and livable urban environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4726fce1e332e46dd558278eff409761512753d88d721f4f9659d0b04fa2792d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
