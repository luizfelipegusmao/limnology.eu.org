{"title":"The Efficacy and Safety of Oncolytic Viruses in Treatment of Glioma: A Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1161/v1","date":1726542099000,"content":"Objective: The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of Oncolytic Viruses (OVs) in glioma therapy. Methods: We searched the literature in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes assessed were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). The risk of bias was evaluated by sensitivity analysis and publication bias. Results: We identified 21 studies with 440 patients in this meta-analysis. In the single-arm analysis, the results showed that the 1-year OS rate was 47% (95% CI: 34%-61%, I2 = 75%) and the 2-year OS rate was 14% (95% CI: 10%-20%, I2 = 0%). The median OS was 12.48 months (95% CI: 10.71-14.25, I2 = 96%). The 1-year PFS rate was 13% (95% CI: 5%-24%, I2 = 0%), with the median PFS being 4.01 months (95% CI: 2.99-45.03, I2 = 96%). The pooled estimate of ORR was 7% (95% CI: 3%-12%, I2 = 23%). Funnel plots for median PFS were asymmetric with Eggerâ€™s test P &lt; 0.01 indicating publication exists. The incidence of OVs-related AEs was 49% (95% CI: 20%-79%, I2 = 95%), and AEs &gt; grade 3 was 8% (95% CI: 3%-16%, I2 = 62%). Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicated that OVs therapy was relatively safe but did not significantly extend survival in patients with gliomas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7127a7051ca058685424e917074ef210edb10265811a28d46f40ae3be149a55d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
