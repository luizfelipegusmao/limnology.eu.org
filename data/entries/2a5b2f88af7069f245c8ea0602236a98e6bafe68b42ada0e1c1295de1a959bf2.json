{"title":"Fungal community and toxigenic taxa in chestnut fruits in postharvest conditioning process and storage","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13723?af=R","date":1728660030000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Chestnut fruit quality is affected by fungal contamination. The study of the patterns of contamination in the postharvest is crucial to individuate the critical phases and propose solutions. To understand how fungal colonization varies on fruits, the composition of mycobiota was investigated in postharvest handling and in between tissues (shell and kernel).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Fungal sequences were clustered into 308 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Biodiversity was higher in shell than kernel tissues. Results evidenced the risk of new contamination in specific phases such as the ‘cold bath’ and storage. Genera known as mycotoxin producers were detected in all phases. Specifically, 47 OTUs belonging to <i>Penicillium</i>, eight to <i>Fusarium</i> and two to <i>Aspergillus</i> genera were identified. While <i>Fusarium</i> spp. was sensitive to ‘warm bath’ phase, <i>Penicillium</i> spp. was largely insensitive and accumulated in storage conditions. Surprisingly, <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. was poorly represented. Aflatoxin, ochratoxin A, fumonisins and T-2/HT-2 detection was performed for shell and kernel, and process phases. Higher contamination was observed on shell than in kernel samples. While aflatoxins were within the European Union (EU) limits for dry fruits, Ochratoxin exceeded the EU limits. The present study represents the first report of fumonisins and T-2/HT-2 detection in chestnuts.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Fungal contamination taxa is high in chestnut fruits following postharvest handling and storage. A parametrization of process phases such as the ‘warm bath’ is functional to reduce the risk for some taxa. For other spoilage and mycotoxigenic genera strict sanitation procedures of equipment and water must be individuated and implemented to reduce their impact. © 2024 The Author(s).
