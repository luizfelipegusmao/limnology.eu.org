{"title":"The Captivating Journey of Water: From Philosophies to\nModern Science and Wisdom of the Quran","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1117/v1","date":1721009930000,"content":"The understanding of the natural water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, has evolved significantly from early philosophical contemplations to the contemporary scientific models employed today. Ancient Greek philosophers initiated this development, and further progression occurred during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods through empirical research. The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed transformative impacts with technological advancements. Notably, the Quran contains descriptions of the water cycle that align with contemporary scientific knowledge. This study underscores the timeless accuracy of the Quranic verses, which remain unaffected by the era in which they were revealed and align with the latest scientific discoveries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b537818a93f570cb64360fc145e3fb58bb03bbf3edc88326000a80e3a79ef08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
