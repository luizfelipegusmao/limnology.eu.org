It also needs to provide the apparatus to control the power output level. This usually takes the form of a bar-mounted display.</p>\n<p>In addition, a kit will include sensors to detect how fast you’re travelling and your level of pedal input to ensure the power supplied matches your needs.</p>\n<p>We’ve tested a few <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike</a> conversion kits here at BikeRadar, but there are lots more we’re yet to try.

This is usually powered by a separate battery.</p>\n<p>This sounds simple, but the main downside is that it adds rotating mass to your bike, which feels harder to accelerate than non-rotating mass.</p>\n<p>There’s a steady stream of front- and rear-wheel conversion kits on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PetrolScooter-Electric-Bicycle-front-Conversion/dp/B074TH1CCP/ref=pd_sbs_200_2/261-6034015-0409760?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B074TH1CCP&amp;pd_rd_r=ba3944e0-a231-4738-ba38-130cace40b73&amp;pd_rd_w=r9avu&amp;pd_rd_wg=hSVgn&amp;pf_rd_p=2773aa8e-42c5-4dbe-bda8-5cdf226aa078&amp;pf_rd_r=Q84H18ASJ1038R3FZW0B&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=Q84H18ASJ1038R3FZW0B&amp;tag=bikrad-21&amp;ascsubtag=bikeradar-0\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xelectric+bike+conversion+kit.TRS0&amp;_nkw=electric+bike+conversion+kit&amp;_sacat=0\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a>, all looking suspiciously similar, priced from around £150 and with names you’ve probably never heard of.</p>\n<p>Be wary of systems controlled by a throttle (also called ‘twist-and-go’) though.

It’s the system that was used by Belgian cyclocross pro Femke Van den Driessche in 2016 to power her way to victory in her home championships. She was found out at a subsequent race, got a six-year ban and quit racing.</p>\n<p>Vivax Assist may be no more, but we reckon this idea still has legs – at least for the budding cyclocross cheat.</p>\n<h2>Mid-drive ebike conversion kit</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"TongSheng Mid drive motor system\" title=\"TongSheng Mid drive motor system\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> eBay and Amazon are awash with mid-drive motor electric bike conversion kits like this one from TongSheng.</span></figcaption><span> <i>TongSheng</i></span></div>\n<p>Many commercially available ebikes are powered with motors mounted around the bottom bracket, near the pedals.</p>\n<p>These have the advantage of placing the weight low down on the bike, making it more stable.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just a ready-made option though – you can also buy aftermarket conversion kits with mid-drive units.</p>\n<p>Bafang is a brand that is increasingly focusing on complete ebikes, but it also offers a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bafang-BBS01B-Conversion-Mountain-System/dp/B07MKCD9LG/?tag=bikrad-21&amp;ascsubtag=bikeradar-0\" target=\"_blank\">mid-drive conversion kit on Amazon</a>, as well as wheel hub motors.</p>\n<p>Priced from £360, Bafang says the conversion is easy to install using only a few tools to remove the bottom bracket and fit the drive on the front of the down tube.</p>\n<p>As above, be careful of throttle-controlled kits that won’t pass the UK ebike regulations and will legally be considered a moped.</p>\n<p>You’ll find other mid-motor systems on Amazon too, such as that from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/TongSheng-Sensored-Electric-Central-Conversion/dp/B07HK1DM35/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=TongSheng&amp;qid=1591180832&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=bikrad-21&amp;ascsubtag=bikeradar-0\" target=\"_blank\">TongSheng</a>, which is claimed to fit 95 per cent of standard bike frames and be 30 per cent lighter than a Bafang unit.</p>\n<p>It uses a torque sensor, so should fall within the ebike regulations, and is priced from around £350 – although that doesn’t include a battery.</p>\n<p>German brand Pendix has a mid-drive system priced from €999 to €2,190 that weighs from 5.4kg for a 28km range.

They generally work with a powered hub in the front wheel and a battery carried in a bag mounted on the front.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, Swytch and Cytronex can both be used to convert a Brompton. Swytch’s Brompton kit is priced at £999, although discounts of up to 50 per cent are sometimes available on the site.</p>\n<p>As with its other systems, there’s a front wheel hub motor, a clip-on power pack and a bottom bracket torque sensor.

There may be a minimum age to ride an electric bike: in the UK it’s 14.</p>\n<p>The rules are different in the US, where higher power outputs and higher speeds are usually legal, while Australia has some variants as well, so it’s worth checking that your electric bike conversion kit is legal where you live before purchasing.</p>\n<h2>Is converting an electric bike worth it?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CycMotor X1 Pro Gen 3 motor\" title=\"CycMotor X1 Pro Gen 3 motor\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Premium electric bike conversion systems can cost a pretty penny.</span></figcaption><span> <i>CycMotor</i></span></div>\n<p>An electric bike conversion kit is not cheap, so you want to be sure it’s going to work for you.</p>\n<p>You need to have a candidate bike in decent condition to justify taking the kit route.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to have to buy a bike to fit the kit to, or going to need to make a lot of repairs to your bike to make it roadworthy, the total cost is probably going to mean it’s not a lot cheaper than buying a complete electric bike.</p>\n<p>You need to be confident you can fit the kit yourself as well. If you’re going to have to pay a shop to fit the motor or sort things out if the conversion goes wrong, your savings over purchasing a new electric bike may dwindle quickly.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that an electric bike conversion kit may affect your bike’s handling, particularly if there’s a heavy motor and battery mounted somewhere where the bike was not designed to carry it.</p>\n<p>Drivetrain components may not be adequately beefed up for the extra power they need to transmit and may wear or break. Factors such as torque steer may be a problem, and cabling and sensors can be unsightly.</p>\n<p>In contrast, if you buy a complete electric bike from a reputable brand, it will have been engineered around the motor and battery, and you’ll know what the finished product looks like.</p>\n<h2>Can you convert any bike into an electric bike?</h2>\n<p>There are designs of electric bike conversion kit that will work with pretty much any type of bike. Kits are available that are engineered specifically for certain bikes, such as the folding bike conversion kits we’ve talked about above.</p>\n<p>A design such as the Rubbee should be mountable on most bikes. However, tyre wear may be an issue with a road bike with narrower tyres, and wet-weather grip between the motor’s drive wheel and the tyre may also be a problem.</p>\n<p>But some kits, such as those that work with a specific <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> configuration, may not fit on some bikes.
