{"title":"Maternal exposure to Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) inhibit orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) expression to prevent Sertoli cells proliferation through the AKT signaling pathway","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae140/7748643?rss=1","date":1725321600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Background: Studies have demonstrated that Sertoli cells are the direct target of Dibutyl phthalate (DBP). However, the role of neurotransmitter receptors is not elucidated. Methods: Based on our previous studies, maternal Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats in Gestation Day (GD) 14–18 and TM4 cells exposure to 750 mg/kg/day and 100 μM DBP were regarded as treated groups. Firstly, qRT-PCR array was used to determine the different expression of neurotransmitter receptors. We examined the OX1R expression on Rats in Control and DBP groups by immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR and Western Blot were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression levels of OX1R in vivo and in vitro. The potential downstream signaling pathways were explored by analyzing the GSE99690 cohort. In addition, we extracted Primary Sertoli Cells (PSCs) from the testis of control group. The apoptosis-related proteins, AKT signaling pathway-related proteins and mRNA expressions were detected by Western Blot and Real-time PCR in PSCs. The validity of PSCs was measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometric analysis was used to demonstrate the apoptotic rates of PSCs after DBP exposure. Results: The Orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) was screened out by qRT-PCR array. Our results showed that DBP could significantly suppress the OX1R expression of Sertoli cells in vivo and in vitro. Functional analysis showed the AKT signaling pathway was mediated by OX1R. The highly expressed apoptosis level and impaired cell activity were observed in PSCs, which can be reversed by Orexin A. Meanwhile, the p-AKT signaling pathway were hindered after DBP exposure while rescued in DBP + Orexin-A group. Conclusions: DBP can induce Sertoli cell apoptosis through its toxicological effect by suppressing OX1R and p-AKT expression, which provide a novel insight on the role of neurotransmitter receptors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"8a2d60306f805874aa233bd7f92796cc7f05e037080342b0b8e04667982c8fe9","category":"Environment"}
