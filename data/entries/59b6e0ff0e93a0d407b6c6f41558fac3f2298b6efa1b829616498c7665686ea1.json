{"title":"Methane Emissions in the ESG Framework at the World Level","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1568/v1","date":1729504869000,"content":"This article affords the question of methane emissions in the context of the ESG framework at the global level. The World Bank ESG-Environmental, Social, and Governance database was used. The data refers to 193 countries for a period between 2011 and 2020. The econometric models used are Panel Data with Random Effects, Panel Data with Fixed Effects, Pooled Ordinary Least Squares-OLS, and Weighted Least Squares-WLS. The impact of methane on the ESG model was calculated through three equations capable of analyzing the impact of methane emissions, respectively, con-cerning the E-Environmental, S-Social, and G-Governance components of the ESG model. The re-sults show that methane emissions tend to increase even in the improvement of ESG conditions at world level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59b6e0ff0e93a0d407b6c6f41558fac3f2298b6efa1b829616498c7665686ea1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
