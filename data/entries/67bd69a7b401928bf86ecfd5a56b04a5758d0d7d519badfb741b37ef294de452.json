{"title":"DNA as a Double-Coding Device for Information Conversion and Organization of Self-Referential Unity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1208/v1","date":1729051991000,"content":"Living systems are capable on the one hand, of eliciting a coordinated response to changing environment (aka adaptation) and on the other hand, they are capable of reproducing themselves. Notably, adaptation to environmental change requires the monitoring of the surroundings, while reproduction requires monitoring oneself. These two tasks appear separate and making use of different sources of information. Yet both the process of adaptation as well as that of reproduction are inextricably coupled to alterations of genomic DNA expression, while a cell behaves as an indivisible unity in which apparently independent processes and mechanisms are both integrated and coordinated. We argue that at the most basic level, this integration is enabled by the unique property of the DNA to act as a double coding device harboring two logically distinct types of information. We review biological systems of different complexity and infer that inter-conversion of these two distinct types of DNA information represents a fundamental self-referential device underlying both systemic integration and coordinated adaptive response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67bd69a7b401928bf86ecfd5a56b04a5758d0d7d519badfb741b37ef294de452","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
