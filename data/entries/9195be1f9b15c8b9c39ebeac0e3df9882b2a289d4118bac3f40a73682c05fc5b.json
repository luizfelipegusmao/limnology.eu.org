{"title":"Biology, Ecology, and Management of the Potato Psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae), and Zebra Chip Disease in Potato","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-020123-014734?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>The potato psyllid, <span>Bactericera cockerelli</span> (Šulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae), transmits the pathogen “<span>Candidatus</span> liberibacter solanacearum” (Lso), the putative causal agent of zebra chip disease (ZC). ZC is a disease of potato that reduces yield and quality and has disrupted integrated pest management programs in parts of the Americas and New Zealand. Advances in our understanding of the ecological factors that influence ZC epidemiology have been accelerated by the relatively recent identification of Lso and motivated by the steady increase in ZC distribution and the potential for devastating economic losses on a global scale. Management of ZC remains heavily reliant upon insecticides, which is not sustainable from the standpoint of insecticide resistance, nontarget effects on natural enemies, and regulations that may limit such tools. This review synthesizes the literature on potato psyllids and ZC, outlining recent progress, identifying knowledge gaps, and proposing avenues for further research on this important pathosystem of potatoes.</p></div>","author":"Erik J.
