{"title":"Evaluation of Horizontal Shear Performance of Composite Girders using Separable Shear Connectors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0950/v1","date":1728659495000,"content":"The increased volume of heavy vehicles and the use of de-icing agents on concrete bridge decks have accelerated their deterioration. Concurrently, the demand for rapid replacement of these structures and research interest in prefabricated bridges have increased. Traditionally, horizon-tal shear connections between girders and precast decks have utilized rebar stirrup shear con-nectors. Although effective for initial construction, this method complicates the dismantling of aged decks because the rebar connectors are fully embedded within the girders. The removal of concrete decks requires cutting, whereas composite decks atop girders must be demolished us-ing breakers. This process generates dust, noise, and vibrations, raising environmental concerns and causing delays in urban demolition projects due to public complaints. This study introduces an embedded separable shear connector that minimizes deck breaking and facilitates easy rein-stallation by allowing simpler separation of the deck from the girder. Horizontal shear and flexural tests on composite girders and comparisons with various design codes were conducted to evaluate this innovative connector. The results show that the proposed connector provides superior horizontal shear strength relative to traditional methods and satisfies modern ductility design criteria. Simulations confirmed that the decks could be easily separated and reassembled, maintaining shear strength under initial construction conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d1b5033cdb53d0264638540049d1f54c00baf8acafb6c0db81f242684b8c7c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
