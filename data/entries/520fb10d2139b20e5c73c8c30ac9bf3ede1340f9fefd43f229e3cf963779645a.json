Poultry accounts for 40% of the global meat sector and therefore represents a significant area for further growth. One starting point for increasing production is to refine the composition of feed to improve the efficiency of growth and nutrient utilization, prevent disease and at the same time reduce environmental impact. Similar considerations have led to the long-standing sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal husbandry, which is associated with the threat of rising antimicrobial resistances and the resulting consequences for human and animal health. In order to circumvent these drawbacks, an increasing number of alternative feed additives are becoming more prevalent. The use of phytogenic feed additives, which includes hops (<i>Humulus lupulus</i>), is regarded as a viable alternative. In addition to its natural availability, hops have been demonstrated to exhibit antimicrobial effects and there is increasing evidence of growth-promoting effects <i>in vivo</i>.
