Within this context, spintronics, which leverages the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom, has emerged as a pivotal area of research. Spin waves, often called magnons, representing the collective oscillations of aligned spins in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, are recognized for their potential in facilitating high-speed data transmission, making them ideal candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices. Typically, spin waves are driven by the radio frequency (RF) magnetic field generated from RF electrical current via waveguides and antennas. To study spin-wave physics, time-resolved imaging capabilities on nanometer scales are a necessity. With the laser-free ultrafast electron microscope (UEM) developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory [<a href=\"#ozae044.709-B1\">1-5</a>], it is now possible to send RF signals to generate coherent dynamics and synchronized to the electron pulses, enabling the exploration of microwave-driven phenomena.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4807ee3b374555c45818d966aadf3dae8e2100d180526a7dae7b7f0931afe257","category":"Environment"}
