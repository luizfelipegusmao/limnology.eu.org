{"title":"A Survey of Visible Light Communication Based Indoor Positioning Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1400/v1","date":1718874402000,"content":"There is a growing demand for indoor positioning systems (IPS) in a wide range of applications. However, traditional solutions such as GPS face many technical challenges.  In recent years, a promising alternative has been emerging: IPS based on visible light communication (VLC), which offers a combination of which is highly accurate, low cost and energy efficient. This article presents a comprehensive review of VLC-based IPS, providing a tutorial-like overview of the system. It begins by comparing various positioning systems and providing background information on their inherent limitations. The mechanisms of VLC-based IPS are then discussed, including a comprehensive examination of their performance metrics and underlying assumptions. The complexity and efficiency of VLC-based IPS is examined by analyzing factors such as channel modeling, signal processing, and localization algorithms. To optimize the system, a variety of strategies are explored. These include the design of efficient modulation schemes, the development of advanced encoding and decoding algorithms, the implementation of adaptive power control, and the use of state-of-the-art localization algorithms. Additionally, system parameters such as LED placement, receiver sensitivity, and transmit power are carefully examined to highlight their impact on energy efficiency and localization accuracy. Altogether, this paper serves as a comprehensive guide to VLC IPS, providing in-depth insights into its vast potential and the challenges it presents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f20f5601b661352d2f8ab8a86398ecebf5d16c8f7bd5c536e66e9ab0225e97f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
