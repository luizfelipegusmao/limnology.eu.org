{"title":"Sexual and Metabolic Differences in the Evolution of the Hippocampal Brain Tissue. Relationship with the Glucidic Metabolism-Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Binomial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1675/v1","date":1727142793000,"content":"Sex differences in brain metabolism and their relationship to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's are an important emerging topic in neuroscience. Intrinsic anatomic and metabolic differences related to male and female physiology have been described, underscoring the importance of considering biological sex in studying brain metabolism and associated pathologies. The hippocampus is a key structure exhibiting sex differences in volume and connectivity. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, dendritic spine density, and electrophysiological plasticity contribute to the hippocampus' remarkable plasticity. Glucose transporters GLUT3 and GLUT4 are expressed in human hippocampal neurons, with proper glucose metabolism being crucial for learning and memory. Sex hormones play a major role, with the aromatase enzyme that generates oestradiol increasing in neurons and astrocytes as an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism. Inhibition of aromatase increases gliosis and neurodegeneration after brain injury. Genetic variants of aromatase may confer higher Alzheimer's risk. Oestrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women prevents hippocampal hypometabolism and preserves memory. Insulin is also a key regulator of hippocampal glucose metabolism and cognitive processes. Dysregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 may explain the comorbidity between type II diabetes and Alzheimer's. GLUT4 colocalizes with the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase IRAP in neuronal vesicles, suggesting an activity-dependent glucose uptake mechanism. Sex differences in brain metabolism are an important factor in understanding neurodegenerative diseases and future research must elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of these differences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e4e4ce8a8080c176270c67110621f58ee3d1f9420275d953e02e718a4022295","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
