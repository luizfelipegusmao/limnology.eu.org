{"title":"Identification of Rice Varieties Based on Nutritional Quality Estimation Through UAV Hyperspectral Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1763/v1","date":1727083527000,"content":"Identification of nutritious rice variety through non-destructive detection technology is necessary for high quality seed production. With the development in technology, rapid and non-destructive identification methods based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology are increasingly gaining scientific community attention. This study utilized hyperspectral imaging technology to acquire spectral reflectance data from the rice canopy during the grain-filling stage. Different models (Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression, SMLR and the Back Propagation Neural Network, BPNN) for estimating rice nutritional quality indicators based on canopy spectral information were constructed using both multiple stepwise regression and BP neural networks. The results showed that the model based on BPNN estimation performed best for predicting grain protein content, with an R2 =0.9516 and RMSE=0.3492, indicating high accuracy and stability of the model. Overall, hyperspectral imaging technology combined with various model could significantly help to identify rice varieties. Further, the current findings provide a technical reference for the selection of high-quality rice varieties in a non-destructive manner.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c4a7d23088e92b6249602496e42e124c390943ec378b1671a82f5391b81bd07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
