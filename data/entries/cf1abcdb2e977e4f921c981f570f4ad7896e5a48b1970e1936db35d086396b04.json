{"title":"Reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks from a single species","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002826","date":1728050400000,"content":"<p>by Gaurav Baruah, Meike Wittmann</p>\r\n\r\nMutualistic ecological networks can suddenly transition to undesirable states due to small changes in environmental conditions. Recovering from such a collapse can be difficult as restoring the original environmental conditions may be infeasible. Additionally, such networks can also exhibit a phenomenon known as hysteresis, whereby the system could exhibit multiple states under the same environmental conditions, implying that ecological networks may not recover. Here, we attempted to revive collapsed mutualistic networks to a high-functioning state from a single species, using concepts from signal propagation theory and an eco-evolutionary model based on network structures of 115 empirical plant–pollinator networks. We found that restoring the environmental conditions rarely aided in recovery of collapsed networks, but a positive relationship between recovering pollinator density and network nestedness emerged, which was qualitatively supported by empirical plant–pollinator restoration data. In contrast, network resurrection from a collapsed state in undesirable environmental conditions where restoration has minimal impacts could be readily achieved by perturbing a single species or a few species that controls the response of the dynamical networks. Additionally, nestedness in networks and a moderate amount of trait variation could aid in the revival of networks even in undesirable environmental conditions. Our work suggests that focus should be applied to a few species whose dynamics could be steered to resurrect entire networks from a collapsed state and that network architecture could play a crucial role in reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks.","author":"Gaurav Baruah","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"cf1abcdb2e977e4f921c981f570f4ad7896e5a48b1970e1936db35d086396b04","category":"Environment"}
