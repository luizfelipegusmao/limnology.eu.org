{"title":"Antimicrobial Resistance in Aquaculture: Risk Mitigation within One Health Context","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0874/v1","date":1718262245000,"content":"The application of antimicrobials in aquaculture primarily aims to prevent and treat bacterial infections in fish. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials in fish farming may result in the emergence of zoonotic antibiotic-resistant bacteria and subsequent transmission of resistant strains to humans via food consumption. From recently, AMR emerged as a significant public health concern in the aquaculture ecosystem and fisheries. The aquatic environment serves as a potential reservoir for resistant bacteria, with aquaculture practices providing an ideal breeding ground for AMR due to the excessive use of antimicrobials to prevent and treat diseases. The mutual inter-connection of intensive fish farming systems with terrestrial environments, food processing industry and human population creates pathways for the transmission of resistant bacteria, exacerbating the problem further. One Health concept, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal and environmental health, enables a holistic approach to address the challenges posed by AMR. By understanding the evolution of such approach, the future of aquaculture, being the important source of a global animal protein supply, can be safeguarded. Risk mitigation strategies for AMR should be based on One Health concept to contribute to sustainable aquaculture practices that protect human and animal health, ensure food safety and protection of environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f0da86e25c279e5216f08cce6659ea3b759ffb769b29aad3b7bb0e17c1be2a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
