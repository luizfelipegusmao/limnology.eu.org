{"title":"Adaptive Load Balancing Approach to Mitigate Network Congestion in VANETS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1012/v1","date":1721051978000,"content":"Load balancing to alleviate network congestion remains a critical challenge in Vehicular  Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). During route and response scheduling, RSUs risk being overloaded beyond their calculated capacity. Despite recent advancements like RSU-based load transfer, NP-Hard hierarchical geography routing, RSU-based MAC schemes, simplified clustering, and network activity control, a significant gap persists in employing a load-balancing server for effective traffic management. We propose a server-based network congestion handling mechanism (SBNC) in VANETs to bridge this gap. Our approach clusters RSUs within specified ranges and incorporates dedicated load balancing and network scheduler RSUs to manage route selection and request-response scheduling, thereby balancing RSU loads. We introduce three key algorithms: optimal placement of dedicated RSUs, a scheduling policy for packets/data/requests/responses, and a congestion control algorithm for load balancing. Using the VanetMobiSim library of Network Simulator-2 (NS-2), we evaluate our approach based on residual energy consumption, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and control packet overhead. Results indicate substantial improvements in load balancing through our proposed server-based approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb17b2992654bf2114d8cdcf7bc1ee7f17d76dffb587efb48446e3bf14f1008f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
