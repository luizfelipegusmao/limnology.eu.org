{"title":"Characteristics and Driving Mechanisms of Coastal Wind Speed During Typhoon Season: A Case Study of Typhoon Lekima","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0100/v1","date":1717417726000,"content":"The development and utilization of wind energy is of great significance to the sustainable development of China's economy and the realization of the goal of \"dual carbon\". Under the typhoon system, the randomness and volatility of wind speed become an important basis for affecting the energy efficiency utilization and design of wind turbines. Therefore, based on wind speed and wind direction data at 10m, 30m, 50m and 70m heights of a wind power tower in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, this paper analyzes the change characteristics of wind speed and wind direction by using BFAST method and Hurst index. Based on typhoon body data, topographic data and mesoscale system wind direction data, the causes of the occurrence and development of wind speed and wind direction of wind tower are further analyzed, and a conclusion is drawn: (1) In BEAST method, there are 5, 5, 6 and 6 change points at the height of 10m, 30m, 50m and 70m respectively. Among them, the change points at the height of 10m, 30m and 50m all change before and after node 325, and the change time point at the height of 70m is inconsistent with other heights. Hurst index results show that the inconsistency at 70m altitude is stronger than that at other altitudes. (2) The wind direction sequence at 10m, 30m, 50m and 70m altitude is fitted by stages, and the direction of wind direction is SE-E-SE-SW-W-NW, where, At the height of 70m, the deviation of the fitting trend line from other altitudes is larger in the wind speed strengthening stage and weakening stage. (3) The wind speed at the height of 10m and 70m has different response degrees to the typhoon body. The correlation between the wind speed and the distance between the wind measurement tower and the typhoon near the center is stronger at the height of 10m than at the height of 70m. The surface type and the wind direction of the mesoscale system also have certain effects on the wind speed and direction. In this paper, the change characteristics and influencing factors of wind speed and direction of wind tower are studied, which provides methods and theoretical support for the study of short-term wind speed when typhoon passes through, and provides reliable support for the selection of wind power forecast indicators and the selection and design of wind turbines under extreme gale weather systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce2bad2a6d56b02bb1c5a57c918c3ffef3f0ddf56a3709e3a5692ecb77d01845","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
