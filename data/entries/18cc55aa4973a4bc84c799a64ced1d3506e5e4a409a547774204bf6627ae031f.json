{"title":"Economic Impacts of the Electric Road System Implementation on Rotterdam-Antwerp Corridor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0843/v1","date":1720605088000,"content":"Electric road systems (ERS) are a group of technologies that allow powering adequately-equipped road transport vehicles with electricity from the road infrastructure while in motorway traffic. They can be categorised in three technology groups: overhead catenary, ground conductive and ground inductive, depending on the used mode of power transfer. The supplied energy is used for propulsion and for charging the vehicle batteries to be used once the vehicle leaves the electrified road section. Also, another energy source, e.g. diesel, natural gas or hydrogen, can be used while away from ERS. This research investigates the potential impacts of implementing the different ERS technologies on the Rotterdam-Antwerp motorway corridor that links the two largest ports in Europe. The aim is to identify which of the routes between the ports is best suited for implementation of ERS, whether there are substantial differences in economic performance of the different ERS technologies, see what ERS vehicle traffic volumes are required and potentially available for successful implementation, what investment is required to build the system and whether the ERS operator can be profitable, and could transport operators operate their trucks on ERS profitability in this corridor setting. The research shows that that the route between Rotterdam and Antwerp that runs on motorway E19 is the best to be electrified from an economic standpoint. Our calculations show that the traffic on Rotterdam-Antwerp corridor is sufficient for economically justifying ERS infrastructure rollout and operation. For transport operators, that happen to have specific client base, e.g. where they usually serve clients from one of the ports along the electrified route, the construction of ERS on the route can prove to be very lucrative if they adopt the technology early.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18cc55aa4973a4bc84c799a64ced1d3506e5e4a409a547774204bf6627ae031f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
