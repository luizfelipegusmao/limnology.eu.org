Rather, policies and practices need to consider ethics ahead of time. If it is only added “after the fact,” policy will be less efficient and opportunities for carbon minimization will be lost. This will require the cooperation of people at many levels and can be guided by two essential ethical principles: distributive justice and environmental sustainability.","author":"Cristina Richie","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"b4e61002a195471c0cdf5dbdfd9b509de182d09eb5f308abe686f4dd516e2fc6","category":"Environment"}
