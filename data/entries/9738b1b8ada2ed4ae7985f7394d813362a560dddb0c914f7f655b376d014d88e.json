{"title":"Evidence of the Detrimental Effects of Bacterial Resistance to Cephalosporins and Penicillins in Egypt&rsquo;s Primary Healthcare Facilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0056/v1","date":1725333775000,"content":"Background:\nBacterial resistance to several antibiotic classes is seen as a grave threat worldwide. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics was mostly caused by the abuse and overuse of antibiotics, particularly penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins, in Egypt's primary healthcare facilities.\n\nAim of the study:\nTo investigate the main resistant bacteria to a few chosen penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins, as well as the characterization of these antibiotics' resistant genes and their detrimental effects in Egypt's main medical facilities.\nMethodology:\nTwo hundred respiratory and urinary tract infection (RTI and UTI) specimens were gathered from Egyptian primary medical center patients. The turbidimetric assay at 630 nm wavelength, the broth dilution technique, and the nanopore sequencing homology approach were used to characterize the major resistant pathogenic bacteria and their resistant genes to cefadroxil (first generation cephalosporins) and nafcillin (antipseudomonal penicillin). Moreover, adverse outcomes resulting from antibiotic resistance were noted.\nResults:\nOut of 200 specimens with RTI and UTI, 186 samples showed the proliferation of resistant bacteria isolates. Enterococcus faecium strain NFC and Staphylococcus aureus strain CDX were among them. Nanopore sequencing confirmed that the antibiotic-resistant gene in Enterococcus faecium was the NFC gene, whereas the antibiotic-resistant gene in Staphylococcus aureus was the CDX gene.\nPenicillin-binding proteins with modest affinity were encoded by both genes. These bacterial resistance patterns were linked to a low death rate of 5% and a high morbidity rate of 47%.\nConclusion:\nBy expressing low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins through resistant NFC and CDX genes, Enterococcus faecium strain NFC and Staphylococcus aureus strain CDX were found to be the predominant bacterial isolates that cause antibiotic resistance to first-generation cephalosporins and penicillins.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9738b1b8ada2ed4ae7985f7394d813362a560dddb0c914f7f655b376d014d88e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
