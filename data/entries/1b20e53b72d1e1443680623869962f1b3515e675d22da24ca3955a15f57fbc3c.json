{"title":"MLOps Approach for Automatic Image Segmentation Based on U-Net","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2447/v1","date":1722340111000,"content":"The usage of classic segmentation methods has drastically decreased recently. Implementation of convolutional neural networks and their modifications leads to significantly improved results. With the help of U-net, you can perform automatic segmentation. However, this requires significantly more hardware and software resources. The use of cloud computing now provides a wide range of possibilities, which allows processing and sharing the obtained experience and results to improve the quality of diagnosis. This article presents an approach to implementing MLOPS for automatic image segmentation using U-net technology. The approach's key feature is the developed software block that allows the creation of a dataset based on given rules. The infrastructure also supports automatically deploying the necessary environment on the cloud, particularly on DigitalOcean.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b20e53b72d1e1443680623869962f1b3515e675d22da24ca3955a15f57fbc3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
