{"title":"Analysis of perturbed Boussinesq equation via novel integrating schemes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302784","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Miguel Vivas-Cortez, Saima Arshed, Zahida Perveen, Maasoomah Sadaf, Ghazala Akram, Kashif Rehan, Komal Saeed</p>\r\n\r\nTo analyze and study the behaviour of the shallow water waves, the perturbed Boussinesq equation has acquired fundamental importance. The principal objective of this paper is to manifest the exact traveling wave solution of the perturbed Boussinesq equation by two well known techniques named as, two variables ( G â€² G , 1 G ) expansion method and generalized projective Riccati equations method. A diverse array of soliton solutions, encompassing periodic, bright solitons, singular solitons and bright singular solitons are obtained by the applications of proposed techniques. The constraint conditions for newly constructed solutions are also specified. To enhance comprehension, the numerical illustrations of constructed solutions have been represented using surface plots, 2D plots and density plots. The results delineated in this paper transcend existing analysis, offering a novel, well-structured, and modern perspective. The solutions obtained not only enrich understanding of shallow water wave models but also exhibit efficacy in providing detailed descriptions of their dynamics.","author":"Miguel Vivas-Cortez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"58389c9e5de4c39c74ed3a213f0472d22184486bff8bd55466f55a34a8dbdafe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
