{"title":"Enhancing Multilingual Table-to-Text Generation with QA Blueprints: Overcoming Challenges in Low-Resource Languages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2032/v1","date":1724893504000,"content":"Limiting training data in low-resource languages is a barrier to Natural Language Processing (NLP). Regardless, languages with thousands of users worldwide require improved NLP capabilities. The Table-to-Text task—typically develops natural language descriptions using data tables, tests model reasoning abilities—although it is especially tough in multi-language settings. System output frequently lack credit to their underlying data. Intermediate planning strategies—which include Question-Answer (QA) blueprints—improving summarization tasks by presenting related QA pair prior to verbalization. Therefore, this study analyses whether QA blueprints improve multilingual Table-to-Text output attribution. An enlarged multilingual dataset, encompassing African languages, contains QA blueprints that were produced and filtered heuristically. This dataset is used to fine-tune sequence-to-sequence model (transformers)—both with and without blueprints. Two configurations are evaluated—English reference blueprints with language target verbalization and modified blueprints. These results show that English-only models benefit from blueprints, whereas multi language models cannot. Errors in machine-translating blueprints provide challenges, as do models that rely on their generated blueprints.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74eb227377fe93a431443a676bd39a44d20a86360e67c8a4d99d811fa638c039","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
