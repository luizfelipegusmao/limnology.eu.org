Few studies have been conducted in mangrove fish predators to investigate interpopulation trophic niches and ontogenetic shifts. Using stable isotope analysis and two complementary approaches, the authors investigated trophic niche patterns within and between two ontogenetic groups (juveniles and sub-adults) of a generalist predator (<i>Acentrogobius viridipunctatus</i>) in four mangroves with heterogeneous environmental conditions (<i>e.g.</i>, tidal regimes, salinity fluctuations and mangrove tree community). The authors hypothesized that the trophic niche between populations would vary regionally and trophic position would increase consistently from juvenile to sub-adult stages. The results revealed that both δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N values varied greatly across populations and between ontogenetic groups, and complex spatio-ontogenetic variations were expressed by Layman's metrics. They also found some niche separation in space, which is most likely related to resource availability in spatially diverse ecosystems. In addition, trophic niche position increased consistently from juveniles to sub-adults, indicating ontogenetic feeding shifts. The isotopic plasticity index and Fulton's condition index also showed significant spatial-ontogenetic variation, which is consistent with optimal foraging theory. The findings highlight that trophic plasticity has a high adaptive value for mangrove fish predators in dynamic ecosystems.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>鱼类的营养生态位反映了生态系统中重要的捕食关系，是食物网结构研究的基础。在红树林中，肉食性鱼类种群间营养生态位及其个体发育阶段的转换研究相对较为有限。本研究通过使用稳定同位素技术和两种互补分析方法，以红树林定居性鱼类-青斑细棘鰕虎鱼 (Acentrogobius viridipunctatus)为研究对象，研究它在四片不同环境条件 (例如潮汐、盐度波动和植物群落)红树林的种群营养生态位及其从幼鱼发育到亚成鱼过程中的变动。研究假设种群间营养生态位在异质性环境下存在分化且营养级从幼鱼向亚成鱼发育过程中表现出一致性增加。研究结果表明，δ13C和δ15N值在种群和发育阶段之间差异显著，Layman's指标呈现出复杂的空间-发育阶段变异。研究还发现了空间上的生态位分离，可能与空间异质性的饵料资源可用性有关。此外，营养生态位位置从幼鱼向亚成鱼阶段表现出一致性增加，表明发育阶段间存在相似的摄食转换。同位素可塑性指数和Fulton's条件指数也显示出显著的空间-发育阶段变异，与最佳觅食理论一致。研究结果表明营养可塑性对于红树林定居性鱼类适应动态异质性生境具有重要意义。</p>","author":"Jiao Qin, \nFengming Liu, \nBjorn Victor Schmidt, \nZhuoxin Sun, \nLingwei Kong, \nYunrong Yan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"a850dfd6df304d88f6e8ecb703b520ab93df950b5d4f54241b3ed3e8c2a8dbe4","category":"Environment"}
