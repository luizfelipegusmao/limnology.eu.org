{"title":"Seasonal Dynamics and Three-Dimensional Hydrographic Features of the Eastern Gulf of Thailand: Insights from High-Resolution Modeling and Field Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1135/v1","date":1715938561000,"content":"Through the integration of high-resolution hydrodynamic modeling and comprehensive field measurements, this study elucidates the intricate three-dimensional hydrographic characteristics of the eastern Gulf of Thailand (eGOT). In addition to the prevalent tidal currents dictating alternating flow along the northwestern and southeastern axes, our investigation reveals pronounced seasonal variations in mean currents, water temperature, and salinity within the eGOT, closely linked to the dynamics of the Asian-Australian monsoon system. During the southwest monsoon, mean currents exhibit a southeasterly trend, contrasting with a northwesterly pattern during the northeast monsoon. Lowest water temperatures occur during the latter, while the highest levels are observed during the 1st monsoon transition (April-March). Notably, salinity levels reach their lowest levels during the southwest monsoon and the 2nd monsoon transition (October), coinciding with the seasonal stratification of the water column and the emergence of a distinct stable along-the-shore northwesterly current with the average speed of 15 cm/s, defined here as the “Chathaburi Coastal Current (CCC)”. Model experiments attribute the formation of the CCC to decreased salinity induced by direct rainfall, highlighting the significance of rainfall as a key factor influencing coastal water dynamics in tropical regions or areas experiencing high precipitation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"841367eb1dc9b4908b64030b2cc9cdee0645338b67b96791adc392acfc66a295","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
