{"title":"Alike but genetically divergent: The resurrection of Urotrygon asterias (Jordan & Gilbert, ) from its closest relatives, the Munda and the Blotched stingray","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15864?af=R","date":1720502454000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The genus <i>Urotrygon</i> comprises small- to medium-sized endemic round rays on the American continent and has undergone several synonymization processes. Here, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, including meristic, morphometric, and mtDNA analyses, to resolve the particularly intricate relationship among <i>Urotrygon munda</i> Gill, 1863, <i>Urotrygon chilensis</i> (Günther, 1872), and <i>Urotrygon asterias</i> (Jordan &amp; Gilbert, 1883). The latter species is currently a synonym of <i>U. munda</i> but is also considered the <i>U</i>. <i>chilensis</i> “northern morphotype.” These taxonomic entities have historically been confounded, mainly due to their phenotypical resemblance along their geographic distribution in the eastern Pacific. We assessed 78 specimens (43 “northern” and 30 “southern morphotypes” of <i>U. chilensis</i>, as well as 5 <i>U</i>. <i>munda</i>) using 19 external variables for taxonomic and morphometric analysis. Distinct meristic patterns, including pectoral and pelvic ceratotrichia, vertebrae number, and thorn distribution along the dorsal midline, were observed in the series-type specimens of the three taxonomic entities. Our multivariate morphometric analyses consistently differentiated the three groups as distinct taxonomic entities, with an overall classification accuracy of 66.7%. The meristic results also provided reliable information distinguishing the three entities. Based on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (<i>NADH</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>2</i>\n</sub>) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (<i>COI</i>) genes, our phylogenetic analysis were consistent with the morphometric and meristic data, supporting these three entities as distinct species having their own evolutionary lineages. Our comprehensive approach confidently demonstrated that the northern <i>U</i>. <i>chilensis</i> morphotype matched and corresponded to the description of the Starry round ray, <i>U</i>. <i>asterias</i>, confirming its taxonomic resurrection as a valid species distinct from <i>U</i>. <i>chilensis</i> and <i>U</i>. <i>munda</i>. The geographic distribution of <i>U</i>. <i>asterias</i> spans from the tropical west coast of Mexico (including the Gulf of California) to Costa Rica, revealing that microevolutionary processes have well-defined population clades within this range. Furthermore, <i>U</i>. <i>chilensis</i> is unequivocally established as the sole <i>Urotrygon</i> species occurring south of the Guayaquil marine ecoregion. In addition, the public <i>COI</i> and <i>NADH</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>2</i>\n</sub> sequences available for <i>Urotrygon</i> hosted in the <i>ad hoc</i> online databases were found to be misidentified, emphasizing the need for rigorous taxonomic scrutiny in this group. Finally, our research underscores the significance of an integrative approach that combines morphometric, meristic, and molecular techniques with historical data to disentangle the complexities of closely related taxa.</p>","author":"Nicolás Roberto Ehemann, \nSebastían Hernández, \nRaquel Siccha‐Ramírez, \nFrancisco Javier García‐Rodríguez, \nJosé De La Cruz‐Agüero","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"2fdd299e61cef7b828a2017293e735f0bac7a1ae0f8e7265f5da504872e59aef","category":"Environment"}
