{"title":"Resting-State EEG Alterations of Practice-Related Spectral Activity and Connectivity Patterns in Depression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2337/v1","date":1722317732000,"content":"Background: Depression presents with altered energy regulation and neural plasticity. Previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies showed that practice increases power in beta range (13-30 Hz) in healthy subjects but not in those with impaired plasticity. Here, we ascertain whether depression presents with alterations of spectral activity and connectivity before and after practice. Methods: We used publicly available resting state EEG (64 electrodes) of 122 subjects. Based on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score, they were assigned to either high BDI (hBDI, BDI&amp;gt;13, N=46) or control (CTL, BDI&amp;lt;7, N=75) group. We analyzed spectral activity, theta-beta and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of EEG recorded before and after a learning task. Results: At baseline, compared to CTL, hBDI group exhibited greater beta power over fronto-parietal regions and gamma over right parieto-occipital area. After practice, increases in all frequency ranges were observed only in CTL. Theta-beta and theta-gamma PAC were greater in hBDI before the task but not after the task. Conclusions: The lack of substantial post-task growth of beta power in depressed subjects likely represents power saturation due to greater baseline values. We speculate that inhibitory/excitatory imbalance, altered plasticity mechanisms, and energy dysregulation present in depression may contribute to this phenomenon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c117125e32e88267b9f85d25c3f9998b6aff7e9384ae0ffd8f83251967d9413","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
