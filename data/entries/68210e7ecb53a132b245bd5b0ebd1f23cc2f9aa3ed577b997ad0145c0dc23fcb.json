{"title":"Real-Time Stride Length Calculation Using Inertial Measurement Unit Embedded In Shoe Sensor System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0383/v1","date":1722925927000,"content":"In the realm of physical activity and sports science, motion tracking emerges as an important tool for specialists aiming to analyze movement data, whether for daily life activities or enhancing athletic performance. This study introduces an innovative approach to motion tracking through the development of a fully embedded smart shoe sensor system, which employs an inertial measurement unit (IMU) affixed to the shoe sole, coupled with six pressure sensors, to provide real-time calculation of individual stride lengths along with other vital movement statistics. Traditional motion tracking methods, which typically rely on various body-attached sensors, often necessitate substantial post-processing, delaying the feedback loop. In contrast, our system is designed to overcome these limitations by offering high-accuracy, real-time feedback with a minimal error rate of 1.88% from our experiments. Such prompt data acquisition facilitates immediate interventions by sports performance coaches or healthcare professionals, significantly contributing to injury prevention and performance enhancement. The experimental outcomes of this study underscore the systemâ€™s capability to deliver precise stride length measurements instantaneously, marking a significant advancement in motion tracking technology and its application in sports science and healthcare.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68210e7ecb53a132b245bd5b0ebd1f23cc2f9aa3ed577b997ad0145c0dc23fcb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
