{"title":"Constructing an Early Risk Warning Model for Sequential Treatment Failure of High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy Following Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Using Random Forest","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2380/v1","date":1727686631000,"content":"Objective: This study aims to construct an early risk warning model to predict the risk of treatment failure in patients undergoing sequential High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy following mechanical ventilation weaning. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 145 patients who received HFNC treatment in the Emergency Intensive Care Unit of the Third People's Hospital of Bengbu City from June 2018 to June 2023. A wide range of indicators including general information, comorbidities, laboratory test results, vital signs, disease-related scores, and oxygenation data were collected. Data analysis was performed using R software, starting with the Lasso regression to filter features related to treatment outcomes. Patients were divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%) using random grouping software. The Random Forest algorithm was then employed to evaluate and rank the important features related to outcome indicators. The predictive efficiency and stability of the model were assessed through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis, culminating in the construction of an early risk warning nomogram. Results: The study found that the Random Forest model exhibited high predictive accuracy in the training set (AUC=0.98) and good stability in the validation set (AUC=0.84). Key feature variables identified by the model, such as APACHE II score, BNP, NLR, mROX, and SOFA, were found to significantly impact the prediction of HFNC treatment failure. Based on these variables, an early warning nomogram was further developed, providing clinicians with a convenient and effective risk assessment tool. Conclusion: This study has constructed an early risk warning model based on the Random Forest algorithm, capable of effectively predicting the risk of HFNC treatment failure. The model's high predictive efficiency and stability offer strong support for clinical decision-making, contributing to personalized treatment and improved patient outcomes. Future research should aim to expand the sample size, perform multicenter validation, and explore the integration of the model into Clinical Decision Support Systems for real-time risk assessment and intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89e225c44a4ad22e1b059e9a205e3bfb2d4a69871aa01cf3b28d13bc92f66e2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
