{"title":"Contribution of echocardiography and 2D strain in the detection of subtle myocardial involvement in group A and B patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1478/v1","date":1721288101000,"content":"Background. Myocardial involvement mediated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Conventional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters are poor in the detection of subclinical myocardial dysfunction. \nAim.To investigate the contribution of strain in the early detection of cardiac damage in stable COPD patients\nMethods. Group A and B patients with COPD were enrolled in this study. The COPD assessment test, spirometry, 6-minute walk test, and both conventional TTE and strain were performed in these patients.\nResults. 80 COPD patients, with a mean age 65.6 ± 8.9 years, were included.  The. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 60.7 ± 5.1%. Right atrium and right ventricle (RV) strain were 24.5 ± 6.6% and -19.9 ± 3.7%, respectively. Additionally, left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) was -21.1 ± 2. Forty-eight patients had impaired RV strain. Compared to COPD patient with normal RV strain, those with RV reduced starin had a lower 6meter walk distance (6MWD) (p=0.001) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (p=0.012), and a higher CAT score (p=0.012). A reduced RV strain was correlated with a higher risk of hospitalizations for acute exacerbation in the post inclusion year (55% versus 25%; p=0.024). No deaths were recorded during the follow-up period. No significant factors causing neither RA starin alteration nor LV GLS reduction were revealed. \n\nConclusion. Group A and B COPD patients having normal conventional TTE parameters, speckle tracking is a key parameter in the detection of subclinical myocardial dysfunction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82994e8c8419b90b908b8b726a476ab909733684d2da56f73e80e6c180e239cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
