{"title":"Biomechanical Insights and Strategic Applications in Ancient Combat Sports: Optimizing Stability, Power and Tactical Advantage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1796/v1","date":1719381854000,"content":"Background: Though ancient Greece preserves many pictures of combat sports, there is research in terms of biomechanics on the principles of human motion. This research aimed to investigate Pankration postures of ancient Greek athletics, expecting to bridge the gap between historical sports practices and contemporary biomechanical applications. Methods: This study employed computational tools to analyze two images from ancient Greek Pankration, constructing a static multi-segmental model. Anthropometric models simulated postures analogous to those in historical depictions. Analysis estimated joint forces and moments, along with weight distribution and ground reaction forces for these postures. Implications for training and strength development were deduced through integration with modern scientific insights. Moreover, strategic elements of these postures were assessed using game theory to explore their correspondence with contemporary theoretical constructs. Results: The findings indicated that static postures facilitate the development of tendon stiffness, joint stability, and neuromuscular control. In the \"readiness\" posture, 68% of the athlete's centre of gravity (CoG) was distributed to the hind leg, enhancing stability and power generation, while the front leg promoted agility. Analysis of the kick posture revealed delivery with a dorsiflexed ankle and pronounced heel protrusion.Conclusion: The application of the proposed model suggests that ancient athletes optimized their performance using biomechanical principles, thereby gaining a competitive advantage. This study highlights the value of integrating ancient biomechanical strategies with contemporary athletic training and injury prevention, advocating for a synthesis of historical practices and modern biomechanical analysis in combat sports.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e319b034da18b2a10da2d13fe92c8b65034af907a2e569e262ef97827d454d05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
