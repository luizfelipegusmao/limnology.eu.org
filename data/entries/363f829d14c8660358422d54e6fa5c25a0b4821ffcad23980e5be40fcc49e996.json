{"title":"Adjacency Matrix for the Graph Exponential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1667/v1","date":1716785256000,"content":"Introduced in 1967 by Lov\\'{a}sz, graph exponentiation has received little attention over the past several decades. Since graph exponentiation produces large graphs and any graph can be constructed utilizing its adjacency matrix, we provide a four step linear construction algorithm that generates the adjacency matrix for the graph exponential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"363f829d14c8660358422d54e6fa5c25a0b4821ffcad23980e5be40fcc49e996","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
