{"title":"Influence of Indirect air-Cooling on the Variation in Intrapulpal Temperature during Rapid High-Intensity Light-Curing Using a Bulk-Fill Resin Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2256/v1","date":1722332948000,"content":"Background: This study investigated the effect of indirect air-cooling on the variation in intrapulpal temperature (ΔT) during different light-curing protocols of bulk-fill resin composites in molars with class V cavities. Methods: A nonretentive class V cavity was prepared in an upper molar. The intrapulpal temperature changes with and without air-cooling were recorded with type K thermocouple. The cavity was restored with bulk-fill resin composites: Tetric PowerFlow and Filtek Bulk-Fill Flow. The tooth was exposed to different light-curing protocols (n=5) using the Valo Grand light-curing unit: (i) high-intensity light-curing of 3200 mW/cm² (3 and 6 s) and (ii) moderate-intensity light-curing of 1000 mW/cm² (10 and 20 s). The ΔT data were subjected to two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. Results: A significant increase in temperature was observed with the use of the high-intensity light-curing resin composite without indirect air-cooling. In addition, the application of air-cooling significantly decreased the temperature in all the groups except for the Tetric PowerFlow bulk-fill resin composite at 3 s of light-curing. Conclusion: Indirect air-cooling resulted in a lower increase in intrapulpal temperature during the light-curing of bulk-fill resin composites, making it an effective alternative for controlling the temperature rise in class V restorations with 1 mm of remaining dentin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad5015f56b5cba7401c20cff25ffb9a9b2dd4ec70e1c1e7a15bae45867293f34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
