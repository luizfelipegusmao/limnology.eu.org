{"title":"Pop-out effects revisited: Within-array category pop-out and novel pop-out effects with picture stimuli","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310275","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by John D. McCarthy, Phil Reed</p>\r\n\r\nPop-out effects occur when a novel or different stimulus is presented in the context of an array of otherwise familiar or similar stimuli. The effect has been studied using words extensively, but little evidence exists for humans relating to nonverbal stimuli. Although the finding has implications for understanding features of stimuli that capture attention, contradictory findings exist, and previous paradigms have limited applicability to real world situations. Given this, an experiment employed a novel procedure to investigate whether category pop-out effects, where one item is drawn from a different category to the others, could be obtained with pictorial stimulus array. It also investigated whether pop-out effects could be generated with a single continuous pre-exposure procedure, as would be experienced in a naturalistic setting, or whether they were the results of biases introduced by the repetitive pre-exposure procedures, typically used in such studies. The latter finding would undermine the use of such findings to support ecologically-valid models of attention. Both of these questions were answered in the affirmative: category pop-out effects were obtained using picture stimuli; and such effects were obtained with a single continuous pre-exposure. Further development this novel procedure may allow exploration of evolutionary and neurological aspects of selective attention effects.","author":"John D.
