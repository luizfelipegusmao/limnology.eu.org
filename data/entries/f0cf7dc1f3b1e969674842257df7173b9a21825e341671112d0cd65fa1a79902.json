{"title":"Behaviour Analysis of Beam-type Timber and Timber-concrete Composite Panels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2224/v1","date":1722323417000,"content":"This study addresses the enhancement of material efficiency and reduction of brittleness in timber-to-concrete adhesive connections for beam-type timber and timber-concrete composite panels. The research explores the potential benefits of adding longitudinal timber ribs to Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) beam-type panels. Three groups of flexure-tested specimens were analysed: (1) timber panels (1400 mm × 400 mm) with two 100 mm thick CLT panels and two 60 mm thick CLT panels reinforced with 150x80 mm timber ribs; (2) eight specimens (600 mm × 100 mm × 150 mm) with CLT members (600 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm) connected to a 50 mm concrete layer using granite chips and Sikadur-31 (AB) epoxy adhesive; (3) six CLT panels (1400 mm × 400 mm × 50 mm) bonded to a 50 mm concrete layer, with two panels containing polypropylene microfibers and two panels incorporating polyethene dowels for mechanical connection. Specimens were subjected to three-point bending tests and analysed using the transformed section method, γ-method, and finite element method with ANSYS 2023R2 software. Results indicated a 53% increase in load-carrying capacity for ribbed CLT panels with no additional material consumption, a 24.8%-41.1% increase for CLT panels strengthened with a concrete layer, and improved ductility and prevention of disintegration in timber-concrete composites with polypropylene microfibers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0cf7dc1f3b1e969674842257df7173b9a21825e341671112d0cd65fa1a79902","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
