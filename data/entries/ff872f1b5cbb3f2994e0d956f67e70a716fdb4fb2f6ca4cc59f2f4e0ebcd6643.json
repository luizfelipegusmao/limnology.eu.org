{"title":"Toxicological study of kaempferol and linearolactone as treatments for amoebic liver abscess development in Mesocricetus auratus.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0797/v1","date":1720605907000,"content":"Several studies with kaempferol (KP) and linearolactone (LL) have shown antiparasitic activities. However, the toxicity of treat-ments with both active principles is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the toxicological effects of treatments with KP and LL on the amoebic liver abscess (ALA) model in M. auratus administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). For this, ALA in-duction was carried out in male hamsters with 1.5 x105 E. histolytica trophozoites inoculated in the left hepatic lobe. The lesion evolved for four days and the i.p. of the treatments with KP (5 mg/kg body weight/day) and LL (10 mg/kg body weight/day) was carried out for four consecutive days. For histopathological evaluation, NMR studies, paraclinical analysis, and necropsy were performed. The results revealed that the inhibition of ALA by KP and LL were similar to that metronidazole (MTZ). Biochemical parameters revealed hepatic and renal alterations in all treatment groups, mainly for KP (AST and BUN). The lesions found in the organs were those that are directly linked to the pathology. In conclusion, KP and LL decrease ALA development but have few toxicological effects. Both compounds combined with MTZ could be therapeutic alternatives for amoebiasis caused by E. histolytica.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff872f1b5cbb3f2994e0d956f67e70a716fdb4fb2f6ca4cc59f2f4e0ebcd6643","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
