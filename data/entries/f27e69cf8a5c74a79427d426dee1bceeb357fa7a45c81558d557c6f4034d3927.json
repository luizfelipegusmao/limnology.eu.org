{"title":"Comparison of Full-Arch Intraoral Scans Immediately After Implant Insertion versus Healed Tissue: A Multicentric Clinical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0896/v1","date":1728646102000,"content":"Objectives: The purpose of this clinical study is to compare full-arch intraoral scans taken immediately after implant placement with those obtained after tissue healing in patients rehabilitated with implant-supported fixed prosthesis. Methods: Between September 2023 and March 2024, a total of 19 patients with compromised residual dentition (6 women, 13 men) were rehabilitated using 4 to 6 immediately loaded post-extraction implants. These implants supported fixed full-arch screw-retained prostheses in the lower jaw (9 patients) or upper jaw (10 patients). Intraoral scans were taken immediately after implant placement (termed ‘immediate scan’). After a healing period of four months, the provisional prosthesis was removed and a second intraoral scan was performed using the same scan bodies and scan pattern as the initial scan (termed ‘delayed scan’). The two scans were overlaid and discrepancies between them were measured. Results: The average discrepancy between the immediate and delayed scans was 0.1905 mm. Statistical analysis revealed larger discrepancies for implants placed in the posterior areas, with the implant in site 1.6 ( implant 1 ) showing a discrepancy of 0.2326 mm and the implant in site 2.6 (implant 4) showing 0.2124 mm (P = 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed when comparing patients treated in the upper and lower jaws. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, overlapping digital scans of post-surgical and healed tissues revealed discrepancies that could be attributed to the more difficult conditions present in the post-surgical scenario or operator factors. Further studies are needed to assess the accuracy of post-surgical scans from a clinical point of view.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f27e69cf8a5c74a79427d426dee1bceeb357fa7a45c81558d557c6f4034d3927","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
