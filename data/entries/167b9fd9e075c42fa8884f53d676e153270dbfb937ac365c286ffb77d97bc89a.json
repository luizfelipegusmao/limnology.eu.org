{"title":"Generalized 3D Model of Crosswind Concentrations and Deposition in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2358/v1","date":1722306400000,"content":"In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive solution aimed at enhancing the understanding of three-dimensional atmospheric pollutant dispersion. This innovative solution develops a generalized model that extends previous research and is applicable to all parameterization schemes of the equation, including wind speed profiles and turbulent diffusion coefficients, while incorporating the dry deposition criterion. Our methodology involves subdividing the atmospheric boundary layer into distinct sublayers, which facilitates a detailed examination of pollutant dispersion dynamics. Extensive validation with data from the Hanford experiment has demonstrated the accuracy of this solution in simulating pollutant concentrations. The results exhibit a strong correlation between projected and observed concentrations, underscoring the statistical reliability of our approach. This validation situates the statistical indices of our solution within an acceptable range, confirming its accuracy in predicting atmospheric pollutant dispersion. These findings thus establish our solution as a valid and effective method for studying complex environmental phenomena.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"167b9fd9e075c42fa8884f53d676e153270dbfb937ac365c286ffb77d97bc89a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
