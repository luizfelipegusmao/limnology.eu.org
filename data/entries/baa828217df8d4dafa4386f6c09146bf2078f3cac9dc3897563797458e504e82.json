By combining the strengths of both techniques, it enables the production of geometrically complex components such as tools with conformal cooling channels [<a href=\"#ozae044.285-B1\">1</a>] and engineering components with sensors embedded in them [<a href=\"#ozae044.285-B2\">2</a>], that were unattainable with traditional approaches. Hybrid manufacturing has also been shown to reduce overall manufacturing time [<a href=\"#ozae044.285-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.285-B4\">4</a>] compared to pure additive manufacturing followed by machining. Furthermore, it has been reported that 316L stainless steel (SS) fabricated by hybrid manufacturing has a higher elongation failure and minimal reduction of strength during tensile testing that can be compared to properties of a two-step approach for manufacturing materials. While prior research has focused on control and evolution of microstructure during additive manufacturing [<a href=\"#ozae044.285-B5\">5-8</a>], our study delves into a critical aspect of hybrid manufacturing: microstructure controll through the machining component of hybrid manufacturing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"baa828217df8d4dafa4386f6c09146bf2078f3cac9dc3897563797458e504e82","category":"Environment"}
