{"title":"The Impact of Adding Trehalose to the Diet on Egg Quality and Tibia Strength in Light Laying Hens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0965/v1","date":1723550351000,"content":"Trehalose, a disaccharide made of two D-glucose molecules, is found in various organisms like bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, and plants. It serves as an energy and carbon source in plants and has signaling functions in yeast and plants, affecting metabolic pathways and growth regulation. It also plays a role in protecting proteins and cell membranes from damage caused by stress. This study aims to determine the best level of trehalose supplementation in layer diets between 34 to 49 weeks of age, due to limited literature on its impact on laying hen productivity. Experimental diets were based on nutritional recommendations and included six trehalose levels. The study was conducted over five periods of 21 days each, evaluating various parameters such as feed intake, egg production, egg quality, and bone characteristics. The results showed that trehalose supplementation influenced the performance of laying hens, as well as some aspects of egg and bone quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd00cfd56ff373cd8536ccd73a7b2199c2a0c060e85295042fea3ebf5ecfc70b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
