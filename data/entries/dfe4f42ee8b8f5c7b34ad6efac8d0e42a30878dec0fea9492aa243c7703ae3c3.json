{"title":"Modular Microgrid Technology with a Single Development Environment per Life Cycle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1999/v1","date":1721892187000,"content":"The life cycle of a microgrid covers all the stages from idea to implementation, exploitation until its end of life, but with a lifespan of around 25 years. Covering them usually requires several software tools, which can make integration of results from different stages very difficult and may imply costs hard to estimate from the beginning of a project. This paper proposes a single platform of four modules developed in Matlab to assist all the processes a microgrid passes during its lifetime. The authors detail the architecture, functions and the development of the platform, either by using existing tools available in Matlab, or by developing new ones and designing new user interfaces linked with scripts based on its complex mathematical libraries. A proof-of-concept for this platform was presented by applying the life-cycle assessment process on a real-case study, a microgrid consisting in a photovoltaic plant, an office building as consumer and energy storage units.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfe4f42ee8b8f5c7b34ad6efac8d0e42a30878dec0fea9492aa243c7703ae3c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
