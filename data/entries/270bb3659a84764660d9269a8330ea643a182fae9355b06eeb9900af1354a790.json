{"title":"Oxidative Stress and Placental Pathogenesis: A Contemporary Overview on Potential Biomarkers and Emerging Therapeutics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0912/v1","date":1728638203000,"content":"Oxidative stress (OS) plays a crucial role in placental pathogenesis and pregnancy-related complications. This review explores OS's impact on placental development and function, focusing on novel biomarkers for early detection of at-risk pregnancies and emerging therapeutic strategies. We analyzed recent research on OS in placental pathophysiology, examining its sources, mechanisms, and effects. While trophoblast invasion under low-oxygen conditions and hypoxia-induced OS regulate physiological placental development, excessive OS can lead to complications like miscarriage, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Promising OS biomarkers, including malondialdehyde, 8-isoprostane, and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, show potential for early detection of pregnancy complications. Therapeutic strategies targeting OS, such as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, Nrf2 activators, and gasotransmitter therapies, demonstrate encouraging preclinical results. However, clinical translation remains challenging. Future research should focus on validating these biomarkers in large-scale studies and developing personalized therapies to modulate placental OS. Emerging approaches like extracellular vesicle-based therapies and nanomedicine warrant further investigation for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in pregnancy-related complications. Integrating OS biomarkers with other molecular and cellular markers offers improved potential for early identification of at-risk pregnancies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"270bb3659a84764660d9269a8330ea643a182fae9355b06eeb9900af1354a790","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
