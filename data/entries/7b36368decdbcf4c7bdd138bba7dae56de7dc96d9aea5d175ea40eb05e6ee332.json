We evaluated a pre-release version of the ARK Diagnostics immunoassay for qualitative detection of xylazine/4-hydroxyxylazine in urine. Studies were conducted using either the semi-quantitative assay application (A. Roche Cobas 503 analyzer) or the qualitative assay application (B. Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer). Study specimens consisted of deidentified patient urine samples submitted for routine drugs-of-abuse testing. Measurements of xylazine (X) were performed by LC–MS–MS to obtain X-NEGATIVE (X &lt;10 ng/mL) and X-POSITIVE (X ≥10 ng/mL). The semi-quantitative ARK assay was calibrated with a 10 ng/mL cutoff for ARK-POSITVE. For (A): among 74 X-POSITIVE samples, there was 1 ARK-NEGATIVE result (false-negative rate = 1.4%); among 78 X-NEGATIVE samples by LC–MS–MS, there were 0% ARK-POSITIVE results (false-positive rate = 0%). For (B), among 74 X-POSITIVE samples, there were 0 ARK-NEGATIVE results (false-negative rate = 0%); among 78 X-NEGATIVE samples there was 1 ARK-POSITIVE sample (false-positive rate = 1.3%). Common sources of interferences were investigated without evidence of interference. The ARK xylazine/4-OH-xylazine immunoassay was found to be suitable for routine use in screening patient urine samples for presence of xylazine &gt;10 ng/mL.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"7b36368decdbcf4c7bdd138bba7dae56de7dc96d9aea5d175ea40eb05e6ee332","category":"Environment"}
