{"title":"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Yucatan Minipigs: Assessing Changes in Approachability/Sociability and Mechanical Nociception Following Central Fluid Percussion Injury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1898/v1","date":1727169389000,"content":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global healthcare concern affecting millions, with wide-ranging symptoms including sensory and behavioral changes that can persist long-term. Due to similarities with human brain cytoarchitecture and inflammation, minipig models are advantageous for translational TBI research. However, gaps in knowledge exist regarding their behavioral and sensory sequelae following injury. Therefore, in this study, we assessed changes in approachability using a forced human approach task (FHAT) and mechanical nociception using the von Frey Test in adult male and female Yucatan minipigs for up to one week following a sham or central fluid percussion injury (cFPI). Specifically, the FHAT assessed each animalâ€™s response to a forced interaction with either a known or unknown experimenter. To evaluate changes in nociceptive sensory sensitivity, von Frey monofilaments ranging from 0.008 to 300 grams of force were applied to the pinna of the ear or base of the tail. We found that forced approachability was affected by experimenter familiarity as well as cFPI in a sex-specific manner at subacute timepoints. We also found reductions in sensitivity following cFPI on the ear in male minipigs and on the tail in female minipigs. Overall, the current study demonstrates that cFPI produces both behavioral and sensory changes in minipigs up to one-week post-injury.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56a179d6ac20cf3980bd57eb50f3ef94c3f4ed020bfcf023e8dd932d86675209","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
