{"title":"Ethylene induced AcNAC3 and AcNAC4 take part in ethylene synthesis through mediating AcACO1 during kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) ripening","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13557?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Ethylene plays a vital role in the ripening process of kiwifruit. A terrific amount of transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to regulate ethylene synthesis in various fruits.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this research, two new NAC TFs, named AcNAC3 and AcNAC4, were isolated from kiwifruit, which belonged to NAM subfamily. Bioinformatics analysis showed that both AcNAC3 and AcNAC4 were hydrophilic proteins with similar three-dimensional structures. The expression levels of <i>AcNAC3</i>, <i>AcNAC4</i> and <i>AcACO1</i> increased during kiwifruit ripening, as well as were induced by ethylene and repressed by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). Correlation analysis exhibited that ethylene production was positively correlated with the expression levels of <i>AcNAC3</i>, <i>AcNAC4</i> and <i>AcACO1</i>. Moreover, both AcNAC3 and AcNAC4 acted as transcriptional activators and could bind to and activate <i>AcACO1</i> promoter.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>All results unveiled that the ethylene-induced AcNAC3 and AcNAC4 were transcriptional activators, and might participate in kiwifruit ripening and ethylene biosynthesis through activating <i>AcACO1</i>, providing a new insight of ethylene synthetic regulation during kiwifruit ripening.
