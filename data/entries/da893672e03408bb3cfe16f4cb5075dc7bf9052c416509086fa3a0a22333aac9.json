{"title":"Optimising Ion Conductivity in NdBaInO4 Based Phases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0539/v1","date":1710119591000,"content":"Based on the previous work done by Fujii et al., NdBaInO4 compounds present modest oxide-ion conductivities. Therefore, it has been an attractive system of significant interest. In this paper, the Ca element has been attempted to partially substitute for Nd and the total electrical conductivity has been successfully improved due to the generation of oxygen vacancies. The synthesis, crystal structure, density, surface topography and electrical properties of NdBaInO4 and Ca-doped NdBaInO4 have been studied respectively. NdBaInO4, 10% and 20% molar fraction of Ca doped NdBaInO4 were synthesized through solid state reaction and they were calcined at 1000 째C for 14 hours and sintered at 1440 째C,1430 째C and 1420 째C respectively. The crystal structure of them has been obtained from Le Bail refinement of the XRD pattern, giving the result of the monoclinic structure which belongs to P21/c space group. The size of particles processed with different ball milling time and surface topography have been detected by the scanning electron microscope. The total electrical conductivities of Nd1-xCaxBaInO4-x/2 (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) were measured in the dry atmosphere by AC impedance spectroscopy and Nd0.9Ca0.1BaInO3.95 exhibited the highest total electrical conductivity and the lowest activation energy. What is more, the total conductivity of Nd0.9Ca0.1BaInO3.95 in the wet atmosphere at moderate temperature is relatively higher than that in the dry atmosphere while this phenomenon was not found in NdBaInO4. Therefore, the excess conductivity suggests that potential proton conduction may exist in wet atmospheres. In addition, Ca-doped NdBaInO4 were chosen for the oxygen isotope exchange which aims to obtain the diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient, and Nd0.9Ca0.1BaInO3.95 shows the highest diffusion coefficient and D* decreases with the increase of the molar fraction of the Ca element.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da893672e03408bb3cfe16f4cb5075dc7bf9052c416509086fa3a0a22333aac9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
