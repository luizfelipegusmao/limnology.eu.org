Earlier breeding occurred with increasing temperatures whereas late breeding occurred with invasion, doubling the length of the breeding season and leading to both reproductive and survival consequences. While less appreciated than that of climate change effects, species invasions may profoundly alter phenology of native species, such effects are distinct from climate effects, and both interact to drive population change.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Changes in phenology are occurring from global climate change, yet the impacts of other types of global change on the phenology of animals remain less appreciated. Understanding the potential for synergistic effects of different types of global change on phenology is needed, because changing climate regimes can have cascading effects, particularly on invasive species that vary in their thermal tolerances. Using 25 years of data from 5963 nests and 4675 marked individuals across the entire US breeding range of an endangered predator, the snail kite (<i>Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus</i>), we isolated the effects of an invasion of novel prey and warming temperatures on breeding phenology and its demographic consequences. Over this time period, breeding season length doubled, increasing by approximately 14 weeks. Both temperature and the establishment of invasive prey interacted to explain the timing of nest initiation. Temperature and invasive prey played distinct roles: earlier nest initiation occurred with increasing temperatures, whereas late nesting increased with invasion. Ultimately, both nest survival and juvenile survival declined later in the year, such that effects from invasive prey, but not warming temperatures, have the apparent potential for mistiming in breeding phenology by some individuals. Nonetheless, relatively few nesting events occurred during late fall when nest survival was very low, and seasonal declines in nest survival were weaker and renesting was more frequent in invaded wetlands, such that total reproductive output increased with invasion. Variation in demographic effects illustrate that considering only particular components of demography (e.g., nest survival rates) may be inadequate to infer the overall consequences of changes in phenology, particularly the potential for mistiming of phenological events. These results emphasize that species invasions may profoundly alter phenology of native species, such effects are distinct from climate effects, and both interact to drive population change.</p>","author":"Robert J.
