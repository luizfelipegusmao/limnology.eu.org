{"title":"Research on High-Dynamic Tracking Algorithms for FH-BOC Signals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1445/v1","date":1724154768000,"content":"With the development of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the quality and anti-jamming capability of satellite navigation signals are crucial. Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation faces issues of false locking due to multi-peak ambiguity in its autocorrelation function, limiting its application. This paper examines FH-BOC modulation, which integrates BOC with frequency hopping technology, significantly improving anti-jamming, anti-multipath performance, and spectral efficiency. To meet the high dynamic tracking demands of FH-BOC signals, this study explores three types of carrier tracking loops: the traditional second-order frequency-locked loop assisted a third-order phase-locked loop, a linear Kalman filter-based tracking algorithm, and an adaptive Kalman filter-based tracking algorithm. A composite code tracking loop is also proposed. Simulations show that the adaptive Kalman filter algorithm achieves high-precision carrier tracking in dynamic environments and quickly converges during transitions. The composite code tracking loop, aided by the carrier loop, ensures precise synchronization of pseudocode and frequency-hopping subcarrier phases, demonstrating the superior performance of FH-BOC modulation in dynamic environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbc914312912f875d1d4c0298479ea5329e2539a766be927e9f9c271695ef776","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
