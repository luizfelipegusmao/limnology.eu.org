{"title":"Carbon Dots Synthesis in CYTOP Optical Fiber Using IR Femtosecond Laser Direct Writing and Its Luminescence Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1320/v1","date":1711079312000,"content":"Luminescent carbon dots (CDs) were locally synthesized in the core of CYTOP fibers using IR femtosecond laser direct writing (FLDW), a one-step simple method serving as a post-treatment of the genuine fiber. This approach enables the creation of several types of modifications such as ellipsoid voids. The CDs and photoluminescence (PL) distribute at the periphery of the voids. The PL spectral properties were studied through Excitation Emission Matrix in the visible range and excitation/emission spectrum in UV/visible range. Our finding reveals the presence of at least 3 distinct luminescent species, facilitating a broad excitation range extending from UV to green, and light emission spanning from blue to red. The average laser power and dose influence the quantity and ratio of these luminescent CD species. Additionally, we measured the spatially resolved lifetime of the luminescence during and after the irradiation. We found longer lifetimes at the periphery of the laser-induced modified regions and shorter ones closer to the center, with a dominant lifetime ~ 2ns. Notably, unlike many other luminophores, these laser-induced CDs are insensitive to oxygen, enhancing their potential for display or data storage applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a9c0b737bc26f926ebea892a87104fcef589cc9b88e4ce0cfaec4b0200b1ab0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
