{"title":"On the Way to the Development of Smart Manufacturing Model in Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0612/v1","date":1712647678000,"content":"Digital technologies have been present in manufacturing and industry for a long time, and today they represent the basis for the application of the Industry 4.0 model in practice. The transformation marked by the Industry 4.0 model is based on the application of a large number of models of communication technologies, solutions for connecting entities (machines, parts, ...) in the factory within Internet of Things (IoT), as well as the possibility of big data analysis (BDA) throught the artificial intelligence tools (AI/ML). These technologies provide great opportunities to create more flexible and profitable manufacturing processes based on data, and using the Internet. As more and more factories and their equipment are IoT enabled, the volume of data will only grow, hence the application of digital technologies is inevitable. To truly pave the way forward to Industry 4.0 and beyond, manufacturing must evolve into cognitive manufacturing, which is the base model of smart manufacturing. This paper provides an overview of the development of the concept of digital manufacturing, from different aspects, with examples of application in real manufacturing. The goal is to create a good practice of digital manufacturing with the elements of Industry 4.0, as a basis for the development and application of the smart manufacturing (SM) model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4d81cdbd59ca0cff3a405baf9cbbc376cb6fcaf15904b72572a2de7223615e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
