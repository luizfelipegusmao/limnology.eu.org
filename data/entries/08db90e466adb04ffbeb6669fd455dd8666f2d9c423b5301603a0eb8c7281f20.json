We describe a method for testing Arctic charr by incorporating a T-maze into their housing, which reduced stress and improved the engagement of the tested fish in the task. We outline the phases of testing to evaluate learning efficiency and determine which orientation strategies, such as motor response versus beaconing, are prioritized by the animals. We emphasize the stress management aspects of the design, aiming to inspire other researchers tackling similar obstacles, rather than delving into the specific aspects of cognitive abilities assessment.</p>","author":"Marion Dellinger, \nLéo Suret, \nMaxime Choblet, \nChristelle Jozet‐Alves, \nDavid Benhaïm","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"08db90e466adb04ffbeb6669fd455dd8666f2d9c423b5301603a0eb8c7281f20","category":"Environment"}
