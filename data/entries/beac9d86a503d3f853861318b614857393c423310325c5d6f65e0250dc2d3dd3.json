{"title":"The Role of Regulatory T Cells and Their Therapeutic Potential in Hypertensive Disease of Pregnancy; A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1586/v1","date":1711449242000,"content":"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia (PE) and gestational hypertension (GH), are major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. This review elucidates the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the immunological aspects of HDP and explores their therapeutic potential. Tregs, known for maintaining immune tolerance, are crucial in pregnancy to prevent immune-mediated rejection of the fetus. In HDP, Treg numbers and function imbalance are observed, correlating with disease severity.\nThe review highlights that Tregs contribute to immunological adaptation in normal pregnancy, ensuring fetal acceptance and placental development. In contrast, HDP is associated with Treg dysfunction, marked by decreased numbers and impaired regulatory capacity, leading to inadequate immune tolerance and abnormal placental development. This dysfunction is particularly evident in PE, where Tregs fail to adequately modulate the maternal immune response against fetal antigens, contributing to the pathophysiology of the disorder.\nTherapeutic interventions aiming to modulate Treg activity represent a promising avenue for HDP management. Studies in animal models and limited clinical trials suggest that enhancing Treg functionality could mitigate HDP symptoms and improve pregnancy outcomes. However, the review acknowledges the complexity of translating these findings into effective clinical therapies, given the multifactorial nature of HDP and the intricate regulatory mechanisms of Tregs.\nIn conclusion, while the precise role of Tregs in HDP is still being unravelled, their central role in immune regulation during pregnancy is indisputable. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which Tregs contribute to HDP and to develop targeted therapies that can safely and effectively harness their regulatory potential for treating hypertensive diseases of pregnancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"beac9d86a503d3f853861318b614857393c423310325c5d6f65e0250dc2d3dd3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
