{"title":"A Review: Nature-Based Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1583/v1","date":1726825744000,"content":"Coastal zones, although vital for human livelihoods and environmental services, are increasingly vulnerable to climate change, especially communities dependent on marine ecosystems. These areas face significant threats from urbanization, population growth, and climate impacts, leading to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Recognizing these challenges, the United Nations declared 2021--2030 the Decade for Ecosystem Restoration, led by the UNEP and FAO, with the aim of restoring degraded ecosystems to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). The link between healthy ecosystems and disaster risk reduction (DRR) has gained global prominence, especially through the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), which emphasizes the importance of ecosystems in mitigating risks. Despite this, many tools for assessing risks in different ecosystem scenarios remain inaccessible to key stakeholders in disaster management. Advances in spatial modelling have supported ecosystem management, policy-making, and ecosystem health assessment, particularly following the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. These models have been applied in regions such as the Great Bahamas, Haiti, and the Republic of Congo, helping shape ecosystem-based approaches to development. Improving access to spatial tools and models is crucial to enabling effective ecosystem-based DRR and climate adaptation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60af23c1df655db4a59b05229a0b1383faeb73e5217f8009ac50433e044ce039","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
