{"title":"A Multi-year Investigation of Forchlorfenuron Effect on Fruit Quality in A. chinensis var. chinensis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0005/v1","date":1725275359000,"content":"CPPU (Forchlorfenuron (1-(2-chloropyridin-4-yl)-3-phenylurea), a synthetic cytokinin, is extensively used to enhance fruit size and quality size in several crops, including kiwifruit. This study examines the effects of three different CPPU application strategies on two different crop loads on the main fruit quality parameters. Our results show that a two application of CPPU significantly increased fruit weight, especially under standard crop load conditions, due to better resource allocation. Fruit firmness improved with 2 and 3-times CPPU applications, likely due to enhanced cell wall development, and was consistently affected by crop load, with higher loads resulting in softer fruits. CPPU applied twice did not significantly influence soluble solids content. This parameter was instead significantly influenced by the crop load, with standard load fruit showing higher sugar accumulation. Fruit dry weight showed similar trends, with CPPU having a more pronounced effect under standard crop loads. Overall, CPPU proved to be a cost-effective strategy to enhance fruit quality, particularly in orchards with standard crop loads, by balancing yield and sugar content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c43f27c3a05eb9d1c8bbb68bb900a72e41c0a398bc7429279503b9310776756c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
