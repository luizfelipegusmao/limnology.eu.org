{"title":"Carbon Nanodots-Based Polymer Nanocomposite: A Potential Drug Delivery Armament of Phytopharmaceuticals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1934/v1","date":1721830852000,"content":"Carbon nanodots (CNDs) have garnered significant attention as viable drug delivery vehicles in recent years, especially in the field of phytomedicine. Although there is much promise for therapeutic applications with phytomedicine, its effectiveness is frequently restricted by its low solubility, stability, and bioavailability. This paper offers a thorough synopsis of the developing field of phytomedicine drug delivery based on CND. It explores CND synthesis processes, surface functionalization strategies, and structural and optical characteristics. Additionally, the advantages and difficulties of phytomedicine are examined, with a focus on the contribution of drug delivery methods to the increased effectiveness of phytomedicine. The applications of CNDs in drug delivery are also included in the review, along with the mechanisms that underlie their improved drug delivery capabilities. Additionally, it looks at controlled release methods, stability augmentation, and phytomedicine loading tactics onto CNDs. The potential of polymeric carbon nanodots in drug delivery is also covered, along with difficulties and prospective directions going forward, such as resolving toxicity and biocompatibility issues. In summary, the present review highlights the encouraging contribution of CNDs to the field of drug delivery, specifically in enhancing the potential of phytomedicine for therapeutic purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcc0c56a08dd1d9a467b0d641397eac65beeb6ab90a8507a386a6b2fc6a37c6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
