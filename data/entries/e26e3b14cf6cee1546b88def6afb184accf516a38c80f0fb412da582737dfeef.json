{"title":"Unpacking Trastuzumab-Induced Cardiomyopathy: A Cardiac Conundrum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2073/v1","date":1717139542000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common causes of death in the United States\nof America and the sudden rise of patients having cancer are suffering from cardiovascular\nside effects of Chemotherapeutics drugs. Trastuzumab is a potent targeted agent for\nHER2-positive cancers though despite its excellent efficacy, the cardiotoxic effects of\nTrastuzumab restrict its usage globally. The most severe adverse effect is cardiotoxicity\npresents as contractile dysfunction that is reduction in left ventricular systolic function but\nthe electrophysiological side effects are still not known. Due to these severe life-threatening\nside effects, it routinely results in the cessation of Trastuzumab. This review aims to provide\na comprehensive overview of Trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy, offering insights into\nthe mechanisms through which Trastuzumab exerts its cardiotoxic effects, clinical\nmanifestations, diagnostic strategies, and potential cardioprotective interventions. By\nshedding light on the multifaceted aspects of this condition, we hope to emphasize the\nimportance of early detection and effective management, while highlighting the urgent need\nfor continued research to optimize the balance between oncological success and\ncardiovascular well-being. Cardiologists, oncologists, and researchers stand at the forefront\nof this critical intersection between oncology and cardiology, collectively striving to improve\npatient outcomes in the era of Trastuzumab therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e26e3b14cf6cee1546b88def6afb184accf516a38c80f0fb412da582737dfeef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
