Maternal separation during infancy can be most detrimental during adolescence, leading to long-term adverse effects on development and social behavior. This research study compared the effects of sibling and maternal separation in infancy on anxiety, sociability, or memory later in adolescence (postnatal day, PND, 50–58) in male and female Long-Evans Rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>). Rat pups were semi-randomly assigned into eight conditions for daily isolation (PND 1–14). The groups were separated by the duration of isolation between 15 minutes (control group) or 180 minutes (experimental group) and the sex of the rat. They were also separated by comfort conditions with the dam present in an adjoining cage versus not present and siblings present or not present during isolation. The result was a 2 (15-min vs. 180-min) x 2 (dam vs. no dam) x 2 (single vs. grouped) x 2 (male vs. female) design. Once pups had reached adolescence (PND 50), researchers tested for differences in anxiety, activity, and social behavior using elevated plus-maze, open field habituation, a three-chamber social interaction, and a social discrimination task. Results indicate that longer isolation was more stressful and caused lower body weight. The female rats showed more anxious behavior in the open field but only if they were in the shorter isolation group. Social interaction showed that the rats isolated with the dam had different effects of isolation. In males, shorter isolation with the dam increased sociability but decreased sociability in females. These complicated findings may be due to the effects of inoculation, which describes how moderate stress combined with comfort may produce adaptation or immunity to stress and affect males and females differently.","author":"Shane R.
