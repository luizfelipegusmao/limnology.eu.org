{"title":"Melatonin Takes the Edge off Dexamethasone-Induced Testicular Damage via Modulating Antioxidative Enzymes and Interactive Dialogues between Androgen (AR) and Melatonin Receptors (Mt1/Mt2)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1197/v1","date":1715954470000,"content":"The present study aims to elucidate the effect of melatonin (MEL) on dexamethasone (DEX)-induced reproductive impairments in rats. Rats were procured and acclimatized with adequate food and water ad libitum. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups (six in each) of Control, DEX (70µg/100g bw), DEX plus MEL, and MEL (200µg/100g bw) for 21 days. After completion, rats were sacrificed, and testes were dissected, weighed, and processed for biochemical, and receptor expression. Serum was collected for hormonal assay. DEX-treated rats showed a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (TBARS), a decrease in weight of the body and testes, and the level of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione oxidase (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glutathione S-transferase (GST)), total cellular protein content, serum testosterone, corticosterone, LH, FSH, melatonin levels, AR, MT1, and MT2 receptor expression. Marked cellular alterations were noted in the testis histology of the DEX group. Melatonin treated in DEX rats showed recovery and restoration in gravimetric, serum hormonal, biochemical parameters, receptor expression, and cellularity of testes. Therefore, findings suggest that melatonin improved defence against DEX-induced testicular damages suggesting its therapeutic potential for the management of male reproductive health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c04a34a8ab0193f6165ece0dd7023436a71c1ba9e1b9521abed77d8f2268712a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
