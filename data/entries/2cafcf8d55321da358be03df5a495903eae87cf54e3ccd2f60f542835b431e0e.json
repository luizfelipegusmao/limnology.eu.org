{"title":"Properties of lime peel pectin as mainly influenced by ethanol and protein‐based purification methods","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13217?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Lime peel, obtained from juice factory waste, is considered as a source of pectin. Lime peel pectin samples, extracted by three extraction procedures of 90 °C heating for 120 min, 90 °C heating for 90 min and then 32 min of ultrasound, and 80 °C heating for 60 min and then 22 min of ultrasound, and purified by two methods using ethanol and sodium caseinate (SC), were prepared and characterized.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that the purification method significantly affected the lime pectin samples properties. Pectin samples purified with SC had a transparent and film-like appearance, whereas the ethanol-purified pectin samples showed an amorphous and opaque appearance. Pectin samples purified with ethanol showed higher extraction recovery (approximately 20%), whereas the lowest pectin yield was observed for the purification with SC (approximately 10%). Although SC purification did not enhance the pectin yield, it diminished the level of ‘non-pectin’ components and resulted in purer pectin. The bands at 1045–1076 cm<sup>−1</sup>, relating to neutral sugars, had higher intensities in ethanol-purified pectin samples, indicating their higher sugar contents. Also the samples purified with SC exhibited more thermal stability, probably as a result of the presence of protein in their structure.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In the present study, under the same or varying extraction conditions, the most important element distinguishing pectins in terms of appearance, physicochemical, thermal and Fourier transform infrared characteristics was the type of purification method. Purification with SC may result in pectins with more non-esterified galacturonic acids from the homogalacturonan fraction. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fatemeh Baghdadi, \nKooshan Nayebzadeh, \nMehrnaz Aminifar, \nAmir Mohammad Mortazavian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2cafcf8d55321da358be03df5a495903eae87cf54e3ccd2f60f542835b431e0e","category":"Environment"}
