{"title":"Spatial and temporal dynamics of urban heat environment at the township scale: A case study in Jinan city, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307711","date":1726495200000,"content":"<p>by Dongchao Wang, Jianfei Cao, Baolei Zhang, Kangning Kong, Run Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThe prolonged dependence on industrial development has accentuated the cumulative effects of pollutants. Simultaneously, influenced by land construction activities and green space depletion, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in cities has intensified year by year, jeopardizing the foundation of sustainable urban development. Prudent urban spatial planning holds the potential to robustly ameliorate the persistent deterioration of the UHI phenomenon. This study selects Jinan City as a case study and employs spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression algorithms to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of urban-rural patterns at the township scale. The aim is to identify key factors driving the spatiotemporal differentiation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) from 2013 to 2022. The research reveals a trend of initially rising and subsequently falling LST in various townships, with low-temperature concentration areas in the southern mountainous region and the northern plain area. The \"West-Central-East\" main urban axis and the southeast Laiwu District exhibit high-temperature zones. Significant influences on LST are attributed to pollution levels, topographical factors, urbanization levels, and urban greenness. The global Moranâ€™s Index for LST exceeds 0.7, indicating a strong positive spatial correlation. Cluster analysis results indicate High-High (HH) clustering in the central Shizhong District and Low-Low (LL) clustering in the northern Shanghe County. Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) outperforms Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Ordinary Linear Regression (OLR), providing a more accurate reflection of the regression relationships between variables. By investigating the spatiotemporal evolution of LST and its driving factors at the township scale, this study contributes insights for future urban planning and sustainable development.","author":"Dongchao Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cc41df6b9dbf4d4d3774550dc4813f3e22bd61e822054879a3a92cca6bbb6947","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
