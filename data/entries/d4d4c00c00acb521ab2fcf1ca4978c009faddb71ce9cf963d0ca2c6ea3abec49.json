{"title":"Description of Mesoscale Static and Fatigue Analysis of 2D Woven Roving Plates with Convex Holes and Subjected to Axial Tension","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202304.1226/v2","date":1712726184000,"content":"Abstractâ€”The static and fatigue analysis of plates with holes, made of 2D woven roving composites, is conducted. The parametrization of convex holes is proposed. Experimental results of specimens without holes and with different shapes of notches are discussed. The fatigue behaviour is considered with the use of the low cycle fatigue method. The analysis is supplemented by the numerical finite element modeling.\nThe present work is an extension of the results discussed in the literature. The finite element\nmodeling of plates with holes is presented in details in Ref [1-3] including also the problems of the accuracy. The experimental results and the form of specimens are shown in Ref [4].\nTwo parametrical description of static and fatigue behaviour of plates with holes characterizes the goal and the novelty of the paper. The fuzzy approach is employed to reduce the number of experimental data [5].","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4d4c00c00acb521ab2fcf1ca4978c009faddb71ce9cf963d0ca2c6ea3abec49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
