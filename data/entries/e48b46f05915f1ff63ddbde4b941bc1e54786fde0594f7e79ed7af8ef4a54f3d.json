Sickness presenteeism was defined using a self-reported questionnaire and depressive symptoms were assessed by WHO well-being index. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to calculate the odd ratios for depressive symptoms regarding the number of days experiencing sickness presenteeism. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for depressive symptoms after categorizing participants into three groups based on the duration of experiencing sickness presenteeism, using cut-off values of 3 and 5 days.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Results</h3>\n                      <p>Workers who have experienced sickness presenteeism for more than 5 days were at highest risk for depressive symptoms than referent group (OR 2.87; 95% CI 2.17–3.76 in male, OR 3.86; 95% CI 3.02–4.91 in female). Furthermore, there was a trend of increasing risk for depressive symptom as the duration of experiencing sickness presenteeism extended.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n                      <p>This study presents the association between experiencing sickness presenteeism in the previous 12 months and depressive symptoms. Based on the results, we provide individual and organizational strategies of reducing sickness presenteeism. Also, screening for workers who have experienced sickness presenteeism are needed to ensure good mental health.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"e48b46f05915f1ff63ddbde4b941bc1e54786fde0594f7e79ed7af8ef4a54f3d","category":"Environment"}
