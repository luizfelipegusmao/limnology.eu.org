{"title":"Animal Models of Febrile Seizures: Limitations and Recent Advances in the Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1035/v1","date":1728986208000,"content":"Febrile seizures (FSs) are defined as seizures occurring in children aged 6 months to 5 years with a background of elevated body temperature. It is one of the most common neurological disorders of childhood, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causes of FSs and their impact on the developing nervous system. However, there are significant limitations to the technologies currently available for studying the etiology and pathophysiology of seizures in humans. It is currently not possible to adequately capture the subtle molecular and structural rearrangements of the nervous system that can occur after seizures in humans. The use of animal models can be invaluable for these purposes. The most commonly used models in modern research are hyperthermic models in rats and mice aged 10-12 days. While these models can reproduce many of the characteristics of FSs, they have certain limitations. This review outlines the key considerations when working with models of FSs, provides an overview of current approaches to producing seizures in different model subjects, and presents a summary of key findings regarding morphological and functional changes in the brain, as well as behavioral alterations, that have been identified in studies using animal models of FSs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"754e40e1f62533be44ef0a78698eb0ead101b48e0f98848aabb2ff13d29a3408","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
