{"title":"Transitions in metabolic syndrome and metabolic obesity status over time and risk of urologic cancer: A prospective cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311492","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Xia Wang, Runxue Jiang, Jianglun Shen, Shuohua Chen, Shouling Wu, Hailong Hu, Haifeng Cai</p>\r\nBackground and aims <p>The effects of metabolic obesity (MO) phenotypes status and their dynamic changes on urologic cancer (UC) is ignored. We aimed to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and MO status at baseline, their dynamic changes and UC risk.</p> Methods <p>This paper studied 97,897 subjects who were free of cancers at baseline (2006−2007). Individuals were classified into four MO phenotypes by MetS and obesity at baseline. Transitions in MetS and MO status from 2006–2007 to 2008–2009 were considered. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for UC were assessed by multifactorial Cox proportional risk regression models. The main limitations of this study are as follows: the ratio of men to women in the cohort is unbalanced; the impacts of MetS and MO on each cancer type (kidney cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer) have not been analyzed separately; the transition intervals of MetS and MO phenotypes are relatively short.</p> Results <p>From baseline (2006–2007) survey to December 31, 2020, during a median follow-up of 14.02 years, 554 cases of UC were diagnosed. Participants with MetS [HRs (95% CI) = 1.26 (1.06–1.49)] and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) [HRs (95% CI) = 1.49 (1.17–1.89)] had significantly higher risk of UC than those with non-MetS and metabolically healthy normal weight (MHN). Transitions in MetS and MO phenotypes over time were studied. Compared with non-MetS to non-MetS, the risks for UC in MetS to MetS [HRs (95% CI) = 1.45 (1.11–1.88)] was increased. Compared with MHN to MHN, both MUO to metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) [HRs (95% CI) = 2.65 (1.43–4.92)] and MUO to MUO [HRs (95% CI) = 1.60 (1.06–2.42)] had significantly higher UC risk.</p> Conclusions <p>MetS and MUO increased the UC risk at baseline. Transitions of MetS to MetS, MUO to MUO and even MUO to MHO over time significantly increased the risk of UC development.</p>","author":"Xia Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"166a0cd94b83c382746726943959c98ad23ca44d55c4570e0a0153c1a455f40c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
