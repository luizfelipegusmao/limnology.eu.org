{"title":"Aero-Acoustic Coupling in Rectangular Deep Cavities: Passive Control and Flow Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1838/v1","date":1721743426000,"content":"Deep cavity configurations are common in various industrial applications, including automotive windows, sunroofs, and many other applications in aerospace engineering. Flows over such a geometry can result in an Aero-Acoustic coupling between the cavity shear layer and the acoustic modes of the surrounding. This phenomenon can lead to significant noise and may cause damage to structures due to resonance caused by high-pressure fluctuations produced nearby the cavity. The aims when employing a passive control device is to disturb the cavity flow in order to reduce or eliminate the involved resonance. An experimental set up was developed to study the effectiveness of using either a cylinder or a profiled cylinder positioned upstream from the cavity. A decrease of as high as 30 dB was obtained in the Sound Pressure Levels (SPL). Additionally, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique was employed to get the kinematic fields of the flow past the cavity for both controlled and non-controlled configurations. A Snapshot Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to better understand the cavity flow dynamics in both controlled and non-controlled cases. Furthermore, the interaction of the wake of the control mechanisms with the shear layer of the cavity and its consequence on the Aero-Acoustic coupling was investigated and new flow physics is revealed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddd862b638ff530b47b2442d7bb8863af1d1a8accc3557258733ff900d8ac8ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
