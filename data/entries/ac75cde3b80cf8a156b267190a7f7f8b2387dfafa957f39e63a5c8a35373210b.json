Ultrasound is thought to expedite intravascular thrombolysis, thereby facilitating vascular recanalization. However, the impact of ultrasound on intracerebral blood clot lysis remains uncertain. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of combining ultrasound with urokinase to enhance blood clot lysis in an in vitro model of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.</p> Methods <p>The blood clots were divided into four groups: control group, ultrasound group, urokinase group, and ultrasound + urokinase group. Using our experimental setup, which included a key-shaped bone window, we simulated a minimally invasive puncture and drainage procedure for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. The blood clot was then irradiated using ultrasound. Blood clot lysis was assessed by weighing the blood clot before and after the experiment. Potential adverse effects were evaluated by measuring the temperature variation around the blood clot in the ultrasound + urokinase group.</p> Results <p>A total of 40 blood clots were observed, with 10 in each experimental group. The blood clot lysis rate in the ultrasound group, urokinase group, and ultrasound + urokinase group (24.83 ± 4.67%, 47.85 ± 7.09%, 61.13 ± 4.06%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (16.11 ± 3.42%) (<i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The blood clot lysis rate in the ultrasound + urokinase group (61.13 ± 4.06%) was significantly higher than that in the ultrasound group (24.83 ± 4.67%) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) or urokinase group (47.85 ± 7.09%) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In the ultrasound + urokinase group, the mean increase in temperature around the blood clot was 0.26 ± 0.15°C, with a maximum increase of 0.38 ± 0.09°C. There was no significant difference in the increase in temperature regarding the main effect of time interval (F = 0.705, <i>p</i> = 0.620), the main effect of distance (F = 0.788, <i>p</i> = 0.563), or the multiplication interaction between time interval and distance (F = 1.100, <i>p</i> = 0.342).</p> Conclusions <p>Our study provides evidence supporting the enhancement of blood clot lysis in an in vitro model of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage through the combined use of ultrasound and urokinase. Further animal experiments are necessary to validate the experimental methods and results.</p>","author":"Lei Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ac75cde3b80cf8a156b267190a7f7f8b2387dfafa957f39e63a5c8a35373210b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
