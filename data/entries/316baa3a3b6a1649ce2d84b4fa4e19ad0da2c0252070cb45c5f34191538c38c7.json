{"title":"DNA Vaccines: The Future of Immunization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1978/v1","date":1729778719000,"content":"This article mainly discusses the prospects of DNA vaccines as a future form of immunization. DNA vaccines, also known as nucleic acid vaccines or gene vaccines, inject genes encoding specific protein antigens directly into animals. By utilizing recombinant eukaryotic expression vectors, they activate the immune system to produce specific humoral and cellular immune responses, providing comprehensive protection against specific pathogens. Compared with traditional vaccines, DNA vaccines have shown new promise in addressing many viral infections. Although no DNA vaccines have been approved for use in humans at present, research on DNA vaccines for specific human diseases, such as prostate cancer, is ongoing. Additionally, the delivery methods of DNA vaccines, including oral vaccines and particle-mediated epidermal vaccination, as well as the challenges and directions for improvement in their clinical application, are explored. Finally, despite these challenges, the research and application prospects of DNA vaccines are broad.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"316baa3a3b6a1649ce2d84b4fa4e19ad0da2c0252070cb45c5f34191538c38c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
