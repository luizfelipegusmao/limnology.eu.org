{"title":"Lipid Metabolism in Relation to Carbohydrate Metabolism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1790/v1","date":1719373107000,"content":"Carbohydrates and lipids integrate into a complex metabolic network that is essential to maintain homeostasis. In insects, as in most metazoans, dietary carbohydrates are taken up as monosaccharides whose excess is toxic, even at relatively low concentrations. To cope with this toxicity, monosaccharides are stored either as glycogen or neutral lipids, the latter constituting a quasi-unlimited energy store. Breakdown of these stores in response to energy demand depends on insect species and on several physiological parameters. In this chapter, we review the multiple metabolic pathways and strategies linking carbohydrates and lipids that insects utilize to respond to nutrient availability, food scarcity or physiological activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a55ac8379dfc4b1195435e12baf83b6e7db809b8082807a50fae798781f419c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
