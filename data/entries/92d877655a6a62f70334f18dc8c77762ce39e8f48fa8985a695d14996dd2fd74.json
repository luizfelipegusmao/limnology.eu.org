{"title":"Resveratrol Alleviated T‐2 Toxin‐Induced Liver Injury via Preservation of Nrf2 Pathway and GSH Synthesis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24412?af=R","date":1725357863000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>T-2 toxin is a trichothecene mycotoxin and is considered as an extremely inevitable pollutant with potent hepatotoxicity. However, the approach to alleviation of T-2 toxin-triggered hepatotoxicity has been recognized as a serious challenge. Resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenol natural product isolated from various plant species, but its protective effect against T-2 toxin hepatotoxicity and detailed mechanism remains obscure. In the present study, the effect of Res against the hepatotoxicity was evaluated, and the underlying mechanisms were further revealed in mice. Functionally, Res inhibited liver injury, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by T-2 toxin. Mechanistically, Res modulated Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway and glutathione synthesis inhibition. Collectively, our findings first showed beyond doubt that Res ameliorated T-2 toxin-triggered liver injury by regulating Nrf2 pathways in mice.</p>","author":"Hong Jin, \nJun He, \nMin Wu, \nXiaohan Wang, \nLi Jia, \nLi Zhang, \nJiabin Guo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"92d877655a6a62f70334f18dc8c77762ce39e8f48fa8985a695d14996dd2fd74","category":"Environment"}
