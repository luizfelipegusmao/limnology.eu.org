{"title":"The Metallogenic Chronology and Prospecting Indication of Tiechanghe Granite and Molybdenum Polymetal in Jiulong Area, West Sichuan, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0432/v1","date":1723012418000,"content":"The Songpan-Ganze Orogenic Belt (SGOB) is bounded by the South China, North China, and Qiang-tang blocks and forms the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The Tiechanghe granite is located at the junction of the southeast margin of the SGOB and the western margin of the Yangtze Block. To elucidate the genetic relationship between the Tiechanghe granite and the surrounding molybdenum deposits in Western Sichuan, in this study, we conducted U-Pb zircon and molybdenite Re-Os isotopic dating. The results indicate that the Tiechanghe granite predominantly consists of monzogranite, with minor occur-rences of syenogranite, while the molybdenum deposits are mainly found in skarn and quartz veins. The laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb zircon ages of the Tiechanghe granite range from 162.9±0.7 Ma to 163.4±0.6 Ma, and the zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of the pegmatite veins is 164.1±0.9 Ma. These ages are consistent with the weighted average Re-Os age of the Ziershi molybdenite (160.3±1.6 Ma) within the error margins. These findings and previously ob-tained magmatic and metallogenic ages for the region suggest that a magmatic and mineralization event involving granite, molybdenum, tungsten, and copper occurred at around 162–164 Ma in the study area. This discovery broadens the exploration perspective for mineral resources in the Jiulong area of Western Sichuan and the entirety of Western Sichuan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07879d88b96ee16e2fc2e98a6e84f0a423ed14d9e8eb7ceeef9dbd9af90c1acf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
