They are also important habitats for biodiversity conservation. Tanegashima Island is significantly influenced by the Kuroshio Current. Although nearby Yakushima Island has been recognized as a World Natural Heritage site and information on many species has been collected, there is little information on species inhabiting the river estuaries of Tanegashima Island. In this study, the river estuarine ichthyofauna of 26 small and medium-sized rivers on Tanegashima Island was surveyed and a total of 2758 individuals of 29 species and one genus belonging to 15 families were collected. The fish fauna of the river estuaries of Tanegashima Island were classified into three groups, namely the river estuaries where coastal terraces are underdeveloped and drowned valleys are formed, the river group where the riverbed gradient at the mouth is high, and other river groups. Environmental factors selected as being important for ordination of fish fauna were the altitude of the headstreams at the watershed scale, the gradient of the river estuarine area, and the presence or absence of rapids in the estuary. The importance of the geohistorical factor of drowned valley formation, in addition to habitat and watershed scale environmental factors, as a factor on river estuarine fish fauna is an important finding for future conservation of local biota diversity.</p>","author":"Rei Itsukushima, \nYuichi Kano","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"f1a32444690f7f0f0ac80796f82ef2f81469c5c3c54bc643c5f2e20ed49c4bb2","category":"Environment"}
