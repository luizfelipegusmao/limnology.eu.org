{"title":"Research on Delamination Damage Localization of CFRP Bending Plate Using Lamb Wave","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1308/v1","date":1713781376000,"content":"Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) are extensively employed in the aerospace industry due to their excellent properties. Delamination damage occurring at critical locations in CFRP can seriously reduce the safety of in-service components. The detection and localization of delamination damage using Lamb waves hold significant potential for widespread application in non-destructive testing. However, the choice of damage localization algorithm may produce different delamination damage localization results. This research presented an IRAPID (improved reconstruction algorithm for probabilistic inspection of defects) method derived from the ORAPID (original reconstruction algorithm for probabilistic inspection of defects) method, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of delamination damage localization. Three CFRP bending plates, including a healthy bending plate and two bending plates with delamination damage sizes of Φ20 mm and Φ40 mm, were prepared in the experiment, respectively. The detection experiment of the CFRP bending plate using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as a transducer to excite and receive Lamb waves was conducted, and the influence of excitation signal frequency on the performance of the proposed method was discussed. Under the condition of excitation signal frequency of 220 ~ 320 kHz and step size of 10 kHz, the accuracy of the delamination damage localization method proposed in this paper was compared with that of the existing methods. The experimental results indicate that the IRAPID algorithm exhibits good stability in the localization of delamination damage across the frequency variations range considered. The localization error of the IRAPID algorithm for delamination damage is significantly lower than that of the DaS (delay-and-sum) algorithm and the ORAPID algorithm. As the size of the delamination damage increases, so does the localization error. The accuracy of delamination damage localization is lower in the X-axis direction than in the Y-axis direction. By averaging the localization results across various frequencies, we can mitigate the potential localization errors associated with single-frequency detection to a certain extent. For the localization of delamination damage, Lamb waves at multiple frequencies can be employed for detection, and the detection results at each frequency are averaged to enhance the reliability of localization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c3e3752bb801680d500a1e9ba16fc683f3059b3a9bd8b4ad4ea75ef90ec3e6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
