{"title":"Protic Processes in an Extended Pyrazinacene: The Case of Dihydrotetradecaazaheptacene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1383/v1","date":1713774560000,"content":"Pyrazinacenes are linearly fused heteroaromatic rings, with N atoms replacing all apical CH moieties. Component rings may exist in a reduced state having NH groups instead of N, causing cross-conjugation. These compounds have interesting optical and electronic properties, including strong fluorescence in the near infrared region and photocatalytic properties, leading to diverse possible applications in bio-imaging, organic synthesis as well as obvious molecular electronic uses. In this study, we have investigated the behaviour of seven-ring pyrazinacene 2,3,11,12-tetraphenyl-7,16-dihydro-1,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18-tetradecaazaheptacene (Ph4H2N14HEPT) with emphasis on protic processes including oxidation, tautomerism, deprotonation and protonation, and the species resulting from those processes. We have used computational methods to optimize the structures of the different species and generate/compare molecular orbital structures. Aromaticity of species generated by the different processes has been assessed using the nucleus independent chemical shifts, and trends in the values have been associated with the different transformations of the pyrazinacene core. The computational data was compared with experimental data obtained from synthetic samples of the molecule tBu8Ph4H2N14HEPT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f44c1656f05b38b00120c3182a62db24cde641a7fe57ea9af680dfd70b78ca4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
