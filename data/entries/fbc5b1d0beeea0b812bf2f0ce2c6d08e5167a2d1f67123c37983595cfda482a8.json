{"title":"Synthesis, Characterization and Analytical Prospects of Cellulose-Derived Nanoparticles of Ferric-Oxide (Fe2O3/Cellulose) and Copper-Oxide (CuOx)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1909/v1","date":1714378877000,"content":"Our environment has been significantly impacted by man-made pollutants, primarily due to industries make substantial use of synthetic chemicals, resulting in significant environmental consequences. In this research investigation, the co-precipitation approach was employed for the synthesis of cellulose-based ferric oxide (Fe2O3/cellulose) and copper oxide nanoparticles (CuOx-NPs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were conducted to determine the properties of the newly synthesised nanoparticles. Furthermore, the synthesized nanoparticles were employed for eliminating chromium from aqueous media under various conditions, including temperature, contact time, adsorbent concentration, adsorbate concentration, and pH. Additionally, the synthesised materials were used to recover Cr(VI) ions from real samples, including tap water, seawater, and industrial water, and the adsorptive capacity of both materials evaluated under optimal conditions. The synthesis of Fe2O3/cellulose and CuOx-NPs proved to be effective, as indicated by the outcomes of the study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbc5b1d0beeea0b812bf2f0ce2c6d08e5167a2d1f67123c37983595cfda482a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
