{"title":"SIK2 Controls the Homeostatic Character of POMC Secretome Acutely in Response to Pharmacological ER Stress Induction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0611/v1","date":1723113164000,"content":"The neuronal etiology of obesity is centered around diet-induced inflammatory state in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus which impairs the functionality of pro-opiomelanocortine neurons (POMCs) responsible for whole-body energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. Intriguingly, systemic salt inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) knockout mouse demonstrated reduced food intake and energy expenditure along with modestly dysregulated metabolic parameters suggesting a causal link between the absence of SIK2 activity in POMCs and the observed phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comparative secretomics study from POMC neurons following pharmacologically induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction, a hallmark of metabolic inflammation and POMC dysregulation in diet induced obese (DIO) mice. Our data provide significant in vitro evidence for the POMC specific SIK2 activity in controlling the energy metabolism and feeding in DIO mice by regulating the nature of related POMC secretome. Our data also suggests that under physiological stress conditions SIK2 may act as a gatekeeper for the secreted inflammatory factors and signaling molecules critical for cellular survival and energy homeostasis. On the other hand, in the absence of SIK2 gate opens leading to surge of inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic cues concomitant with the dysregulation of POMC neurons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c4e9be08440cd1e284438637adaa6ced4c58c98be257e55eab0e8b7c6ed38a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
