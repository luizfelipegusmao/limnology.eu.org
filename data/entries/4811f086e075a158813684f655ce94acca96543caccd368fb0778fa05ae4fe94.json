{"title":"Exploring Causal Association Between Intestinal Flora and Colorectal Cancer Based on Mendelian Randomization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1972/v1","date":1724840832000,"content":"Objective: To investigate the causal relationships between intestinal microbiome biomarkers and colorectal cancer (CRC) and its subtypes.  Method:  The meta-analysis method was used to integrate the largest genome-wide association study data from the MiBioGen consortium (n=18,340). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with intestinal microbial relative abundance were extracted as instrumental variables (IVs). Based on the Finnish database (R9 version) with 326,322 participants, the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was adopted to explore the causal relationships between intestinal microbes and CRC and its specific subtypes, such as colon cancer and rectal cancer.  Result: A total of 3,310 SNPs were screened as IVs. The MR analysis revealed significant associations between various microbial traits and CRC, including its subtypes. Specific microbes, such as Erysipelotrichaceae, exhibited protective effects, while others, like Orato, were demonstrated as risk factors. Notably, specific biomarkers (e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus) for CRC were determined. This study provides new insights and potential targets for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of CRC.  Conclusion: Significant causal relationships exist between intestinal microbes and CRC and its pathological types. Specific microbes, such as Erysipelotrichaceae, play a protective role, whereas others, like Orato, serve as risk factors. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenesis of CRC and provide a foundation for future prevention and treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4811f086e075a158813684f655ce94acca96543caccd368fb0778fa05ae4fe94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
