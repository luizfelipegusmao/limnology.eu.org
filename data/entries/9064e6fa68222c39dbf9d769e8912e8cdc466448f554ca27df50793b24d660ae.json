{"title":"Pyrolysis kinetics behavior and pyrolysate compositions analysis of agriculture waste toward the production of sustainable renewable fuel and chemicals","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14357?af=R","date":1705732784000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This work deals with the characterization of feed, kinetic, and compositional study of sugarcane baggage (SCB) using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), Py-GC-MS, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer. XRF analyzer was used to determine the mineral of ash content, and Py-GC-MS was employed to determine the hot vapor composition produced during fast pyrolysis. Cots-Redfrem (CR) methods and master plots were utilized to determine the kinetic parameters. Studies on the physicochemical properties of SCB have demonstrated its potential for use as a bioenergy feedstock. The average activation energy was found to be 25.44 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> at (<i>n</i> = 1) and 31.21 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> at <i>n</i> ≠ 1 using the CR model. The master plot study suggested that pyrolysis occurred with various mechanisms, while kinetic results of SCB demonstrated that activation energy varied with conversion value. XRF examination revealed significant mineral materials that aided in the pyrolysis process. Finally, the introduction of ZSM-5 at 20 wt % results increased hydrocarbons (~3 wt %), furfurelas (~4 wt %) and reduced the phenols (~15 wt %), acid (~9 wt %) and oxygnetaed compounds. The present study showed that introducing zeolite catalysts improved pyrolysis products' properties.</p>","author":"Ranjeet Kumar Mishra, \nKaustubha Mohanty, \nXianhua Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"9064e6fa68222c39dbf9d769e8912e8cdc466448f554ca27df50793b24d660ae","category":"Environment"}
