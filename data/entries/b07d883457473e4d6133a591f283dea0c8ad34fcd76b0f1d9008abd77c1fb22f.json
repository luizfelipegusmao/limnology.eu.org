The primary aim of this retrospective study was to ascertain the efficacy of EEN used as induction therapy for children with newly di-agnosed CD resident in the South Island of NZ over a ten-year period (2010 – 2021). Secondary aims were to assess the clinical impact of EEN therapy on anthropometry, biochemistry, the pro-gression to medical therapies over three time periods, and to identify positive predictors of re-sponse to EEN therapy. Methods: This retrospective clinical case review collected data from children diagnosed with CD at Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand, and prescribed EEN as induction therapy between the years January 1st, 2010 – December 31st, 2021. Descriptive statistics, Spearman’s correlation coefficient, multivariate logistic regression test and standard t-tests were used for analyses. Results: Data were collected for total of 161 children, 128 (80%) children were offered EEN as induction therapy and were included in this analysis. One hundred and twenty-one (94.5%) children successfully completed an eight-week course of EEN, and a de-crease in PCDAI scores ≥ 15 points from baseline to the end of week 8 of EEN treatment was seen in 119 (98.3%). L1 and L4 disease location were positive predictors of response (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b07d883457473e4d6133a591f283dea0c8ad34fcd76b0f1d9008abd77c1fb22f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
