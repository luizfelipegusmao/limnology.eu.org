{"title":"Biomarkers and Rehabilitation for Functional Neurological Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1728/v1","date":1721711662000,"content":"Functional neurological disorder, or FND, is widely misunderstood, particularly when considering recent research that suggests that the illness has a biological rather than a psychiatric basis. Nonetheless, the long-held view that FND is a purely psychiatric disorder without biological basis, or even a contrived (malingered) illness, remains pervasive both in modern medical care and general society. This is because FND involves an intermittent course of involuntary disability that rapidly alternates with improved neurological control. This has in turn caused shaming, low self-efficacy, and social isolation of the patients. Little research has examined the numerous biomarkers that are shared between FND and canonical neurological disorders and the encouraging outcomes that can follow conventional neurological rehabilitation, modified for this disorder. This review summarizes current research on FND biomarkers and physical rehabilitation results. General healthcare providers would benefit their care for their patients through their improved understanding the illness and recourses for support and treatment that are provided in this review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6ca8824504029c55480d83aab06e79639b8d332702e413a618bf6e5006f8348","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
