Consequently, research efforts have shifted towards developing new antibiotics and improving the efficacy of existing ones. In the present study, novel core shell graphene oxide@platinum nanoparticles (GRO@Pt-NPs) and their unchanging form have been synthesized using the two-step pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) technique. The first step involved using the graphene target to create graphene nanoparticles (GRO-NPs), followed by the ablation of GRO-NPs inside platinum nanoparticles (Pt-NPs). To characterize the nanoparticles, various methods were employed, including UV-VIS, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), mapping tests, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm properties of the nanoparticles were investigated. TEM data confirm the creation of GRO@Pt-NPs. The average particle size was 11 nm for GRO-NPs, 14 nm for Pt-NPs, and 26 nm for GRO@Pt-NPs. The results demonstrate that the created GRO@Pt-NPs have strong antibacterial properties. This pattern is mostly produced through the accumulation of GRO@Pt-NPs on the bacterial surface of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (<i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i>) and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (<i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i>). The inhibition zones against <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> and <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i> when GRO-NPs were used alone were found to be 11.80 mm and 11.50 mm, respectively. For Pt-NPs, the inhibition zones of <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i> and <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> were 20.50 mm and 16.50 mm, respectively. The utilization of GRO@Pt-NPs resulted in a significant increase in these values, with inhibitory rates of 25.50 mm for <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i> and 20.45 mm for <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i>. The antibacterial results were more potent in the coreâ€“shell structure than the GRO-NPs alone or Pt-NPs alone. The current work uses, for the first time, a fast and effective technique to synthesize the GRO@Pt-NPs by PLAL method, and the preparation has high clinical potential for prospective use as an antibacterial agent.","author":"Buthenia A.
