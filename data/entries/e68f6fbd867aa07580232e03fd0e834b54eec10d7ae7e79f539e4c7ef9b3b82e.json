This study aimed to provide a muscle physiology-based approach for quantifying TL in resistance exercises (RE). Methods: Following individual torque-velocity profiling, fifteen participants performed isokinetic leg extension exercise sessions at low (C1), moderate (C2), and high (C3) intensities. Systemic and local physiological responses were measured, and sessions were volume-equated according to the \"volume-load\" (VL) method. Results: Significant differences were found between sessions in terms of mechanical work (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e68f6fbd867aa07580232e03fd0e834b54eec10d7ae7e79f539e4c7ef9b3b82e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
