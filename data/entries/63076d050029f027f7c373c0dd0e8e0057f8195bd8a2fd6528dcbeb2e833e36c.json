{"title":"Assessment of the status of selected heavy metals in water, sediments and a fish species (Oreochromis niloticus) of commercial value in Lake Nakuru with a focus on human health risks","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lre.12452?af=R","date":1710387966000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present study presents selected water quality parameters and the levels of heavy metals in water, sediments and Nile tilapia <i>(Oreochromis niloticus</i>) of Lake Nakuru. Nine sediments and nine water samples, as well as 30 specimens of Nile tilapia, were collected from the northern part of the lake. Physical parameters were measured in situ using multiple probes and metres. Heavy metals were analysed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, salinity and electrical conductivity ranged from 9.52 to 9.72, 4.58 to 8.62 mg/L, 23.40°C to 25.7°C, 2.39‰ to 2.81‰ and 4470–5226 μs/cm, respectively. Heavy metal levels (mean ± SD) were generally low in the water samples. Chromium values ranged between 7.16 and 9.19 mg/kg dw in sediment samples, and between 3.7 and 13.06 mg/kg dw in fish samples. Lead values ranged between 12.5 and 31.04 mg/kg dw in sediment samples and 4.06 and 9.95 mg/kg dw in fish samples. Arsenic values ranged between 9.5 and 21.7 mg/kg dw in sediments and below detectable limit to 2.11 mg/kg dw in fish samples. Mercury values ranged between .14 and .31 mg/kg dw in sediment samples and .12 and .35 mg/kg dw in fish samples. Cadmium was the only heavy metal concentration that was below the detection limit in the three matrices. Significant differences were observed for some heavy metal concentrations in water, sediments and fish across sites (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). The levels of lead and chromium in fish were above the East African Standard, World Health Organization and European Union limits. The results of the present study recommend a possible reclassification of the lake, an immediate ban on fish harvesting and consumption from Lake Nakuru and a policy intervention on the fishery and pollution management.</p>","author":"Mary Florence Nantongo, \nJoseph Edebe, \nElick O.
