{"title":"Direct Solar Thermal Water Splitting Using Iron Electrodes at High Temperatures - A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1069/v1","date":1720786456000,"content":"Green hydrogen is a fuel that in the coming years will play a very important role in the energy transition process in developed countries, especially those seeking to reach a level of zero emis-sions, for which reason its demand is expected to increase significantly. This article analyzes the fundamentals to produce hydrogen, with a focus on the oxidation reaction of a thermochemical solar cycle for the dissociation of water vapor. Solar thermochemical cycles have been extensively investigated, but it is still in the development stage by groups of researchers who have focused on finding the right materials and conditions to improve the efficiency of the process, especially at high temperatures. The theoretical foundations are analyzed, compiled from exhaustive scientific investigations related to the oxidation of iron in water vapor, the relationship with the activation energy of the corrosive process, thermodynamic aspects and the kinetic model according to a heterogeneous reaction. In addition, some high temperature oxidation mechanisms, pH effects, reactors and materials (fluidized beds) used are presented. The scientific review indicates that the production of hydrogen through a thermochemical cycle is more efficient than electrochemical processes (electrolysis), if the limitations of the reduction stage of the cycle are overcome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"feb6f0a6461ad1c8528becd4f1d8404bbf4a1028beb9673d920672f1d80c0a49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
