{"title":"Evaluation of CI engine characteristics using Jatropha‐Camphor oil blends with diethyl ether as an additive","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14414?af=R","date":1719730800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The compression-ignition properties of crude Jatropha and camphor oil blends with di ethyl ether (DEE) added is covered in this research. Six fuel samples are made based on volume: 90% C70J30 with 10% diethyl ether (C70J30 + 10% DEE), 90% C30J70 with 10% di-ethyl ether (C50J50 + 10% DEE), 70% Camphor oil with 30% crude Jatropha oil (C70J30), 50% Camphor oil with 50% crude Jatropha oil (C50J50), 30% Camphor oil with 70% crude Jatropha oil (C30750). A four-stroke, one-cylinder, naturally aspirated, compression-ignition engine operating at a constant 1500 rpm with a load range of 0%–100% with a 25% interval is used for the experiment. According to test findings, the C70J30 + 10% DEE has the lowest brake-specific energy consumption of 11.68 kJ/kWh, the maximum energy efficiency of 62.56%, and the highest thermal efficiency of 30.81%. Compared to the other biofuels examined, this puts it more in line with diesel. Additionally, blends of crude Jatropha oil and camphor oil showed at least 4.46 g/kWh of CO, 0.259 g/kWh of HC, and 74% of smoke opacity when DEE was added. However, it raises CO<sub>2</sub> to 0.792 kg/kWh and NO to 9.54 g/kWh. The greatest peak pressure and quickest heat release are produced by adding more DEE as a fuel additive and using a larger percentage of camphor oil. It also increases the coefficient of variation of the peak pressure throughout 100 cycles. All things considered, the C70J30 + 10% DEE's CI engine features are better.</p>","author":"Manikandaraja Gurusamy, \nMalarmannan Subramaniyan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"00cd8a0c0d0c18cec78e212c92a2dfa7d42dd719bdc45d2eb334eb169f466f9d","category":"Environment"}
