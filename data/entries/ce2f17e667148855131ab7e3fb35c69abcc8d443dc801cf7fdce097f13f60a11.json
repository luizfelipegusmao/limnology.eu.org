{"title":"Beyond the 95s: What happens when uniform program targets are applied across a heterogenous HIV epidemic in Eastern and Southern Africa?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003723","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Rachael H.

Nevertheless, as proportional targets, the outcome of reaching the 95-95-95 targets will vary greatly across, and within, countries owing to the geographic diversity of the HIV epidemic. Countries and subnational units with a higher initial prevalence and number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) will remain with a larger number and higher prevalence of virally unsuppressed PLHIVâ€”persons who may experience excess morbidity and mortality and can transmit the virus to others. Reliance on achievement of uniform proportional targets as a measure of program success can potentially mislead resource allocation and progress towards equitable epidemic control. More granular surveillance information on the HIV epidemic is required to effectively calibrate strategies and intensity of HIV programs across geographies and address current and projected health disparities that may undermine efforts to reach and sustain HIV epidemic control even after the 95 targets are achieved.","author":"Rachael H.
