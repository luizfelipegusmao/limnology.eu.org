{"title":"Advance care planning as perceived by marginalized populations: Willing to engage and facing obstacles","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301426","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Shigeko (Seiko) Izumi, Ellen Garcia, Andrew Kualaau, Danetta E. Sloan, Susan DeSanto-Madeya, Carey Candrian, Elizabeth Anderson, Justin Sanders</p>\r\nBackground <p>Health disparities exist in end-of-life (EOL) care. Individuals and communities that are marginalized due to their race, ethnicity, income, geographic location, language, or cultural background experience systemic barriers to access and receive lower quality EOL care. Advance care planning (ACP) prepares patients and their caregivers for EOL decision-making for the purpose of promoting high-quality EOL care. Low engagement in ACP among marginalized populations is thought to have contributed to disparity in EOL care. To advance health equity and deliver care that aligns with the goals and values of each individual, there is a need to improve ACP for marginalized populations.</p> Aim <p>To describe how patients from marginalized populations experience and perceive ACP.</p> Methods <p>We used an interpretive phenomenological approach with semi-structured qualitative interviews. Participants were recruited from four primary care clinics and one nursing home in a US Pacific Northwest city. Thirty patients from marginalized populations with serious illness participated in individual interviews between January and December 2021. Participants were asked to describe their experiences and perceptions about ACP during the interviews.</p> Results <p>The mean age of 30 participants was 69.5; 19 (63%) were women; 12 (40%) identified as Asian/Pacific Islanders, 10 (33%) as Black; and 9 (30%) were non-native English speakers. Our three key findings were: 1) patients from marginalized populations are willing to engage in ACP; 2) there were multiple obstacles to engaging in ACP; and 3) meaningful ACP conversations could happen when clinicians listen. Although participants from marginalized populations were willing to engage in ACP, a fragmented and restrictive healthcare system and cliniciansâ€™ biased behaviors or lack of interest in knowing their patients were obstacles. Participants who felt their clinicians took time and listened were encouraged to engage in ACP.</p> Conclusion <p>Patients from marginalized populations are willing to engage in ACP conversations despite a common belief otherwise. However, obstacles to meaningful ACP conversations with healthcare providers exist. Clinicians need to be aware of these obstacles and <i>listen</i> to build trust and engage marginalized patients in mutually meaningful ACP conversations.</p>","author":"Shigeko (Seiko) Izumi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7882b953a523420de7e3f8646a8422036d9cd89ebbb8c060ccf0b1e0577c7563","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
