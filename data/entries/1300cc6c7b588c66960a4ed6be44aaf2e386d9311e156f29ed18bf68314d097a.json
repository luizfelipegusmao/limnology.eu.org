{"title":"Implementing a social prescribing program in primary care units in Portugal: A qualitative study exploring enablers, barriers and lessons learned from the perspectives of stakeholders involved in the program implementation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306404","date":1719583200000,"content":"<p>by Louíse Viecili Hoffmeister, Ana Gama, Barbara Gonçalves, Cristiano Figueiredo, João V. Cordeiro, Marie Polley, Gisela Souto de Moura, Sónia Dias</p>\r\n\r\nSocial prescribing (SP) is a promising intersectoral strategy of integrated and person-centered care that can improve individual health and well-being by going beyond medical treatment, potentially reducing overall disease burden on health system. SP addresses health and social determinants of health by linking patients to community responses, i.e. services and initiatives fostering social interaction, physical activity and creativity, among other health-promoting aspects, provided by local public, private, and non-profit entities. There is limited research on the implementation processes of SP beyond the UK, hindering improvement and scale-up. This study aims to identify enablers and barriers of implementation of an SP program conducted in Portugal. A participatory and qualitative approach was used to assess the implementation of an SP program in health units. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with family doctors, social workers and representatives of community partners who participated in SP implementation. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to conduct thematic analysis. The main enablers of SP implementation included its recognition as an evolution towards a holistic model of health, the personal characteristics of professionals as being proactive, motivated, and concerned with social determinants of health, and the communication strategy used to engage the stakeholders. Perceived challenges included raising users’ awareness of SP and ensuring intervention adherence. Lack of preparedness for intersectoral working processes, including insufficient communication channels, limited community responses and the need for a more systematic collection of data on activities adherence and progress were also highlighted as barriers to SP implementation. SP implementation seems simple, but the results show that in practice, we are facing a complex intervention with multiple stakeholders, diverse community responses and factors influencing project success. A deeper understanding of SP specificities, local context, enablers, and barriers is vital to develop strategies for improvement and successful implementation, ensuring scalability and sustainability.","author":"Louíse Viecili Hoffmeister","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1300cc6c7b588c66960a4ed6be44aaf2e386d9311e156f29ed18bf68314d097a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
