{"title":"Determinants of dropout from the maternal continuum of care in Ethiopia, multilevel analysis of the 2016 demographic and health survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003641","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Abraham Sahilemichael Kebede, Geremew Werkeshe Wana, Lire Lemma Tirore, Minyahil Tadesse Boltena</p>\r\n\r\nOver the past two decades (2000â€“2020), Ethiopia achieved significant reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality, with a 72% and 44%, respectively. However, low maternal health service utilization and dropout from the maternal continuum of care remain major health system challenges. This study aimed to investigate individual and community-level determinants of dropout from the maternal continuum of care. We used the recent, 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. In the maternal continuum of care pathway, i) less than four antenatal care (ANC) attendance, ii) subsequent dropout from skilled birth attendance (SBA) after 4 or more ANC, and iii) dropout from postnatal care (PNC) after attendance of facility delivery were the outcomes for dropout. A Multilevel logistic regression analysis of individual and community level factors (e.g., place of residence, geographical regions) were included in the model. The variation in the outcomes were presented by odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC). In the maternal continuum of care pathway higher dropouts were observed from SBA to PNC (85%) and from 4+ ANC to SBA (43.4%). Poorest wealth quantile (AOR = 2.31, 95% [CI = 1.69,3.16]), having no health insurance coverage (AOR = 1.44, 95% [CI = 1.01,2.06]), and high community poverty (AOR = 1.28, 95% [CI = 1.01,1.63]) were associated with having &lt; 4 ANC attendance. Perceived distance from health facility as a big problem (AOR = 1.45, [95% = CI, 1.12,1.88), lower community media exposure (AOR = 1.6, 95% [CI = 1.14,2.23]) and rural residency (AOR = 3.03, 95% [CI = 1.75,5.26]) increased the odds of dropout from SBA after 4+ ANC visits. The dropout from the maternal continuum of care was higher in Ethiopia and postnatal care were the most affected maternal care. Oromia and Somali regions were associated with dropouts from all levels of care. Policy strategies should prioritize geopolitical regions with higher dropout levels. In addition to improving access and quality of institutional health services, designing an alternative strategy for targeted outreach for ANC visits and postnatal checkups is recommended.","author":"Abraham Sahilemichael Kebede","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"25e450a9dfefd732b529d30eb62b054874648ddf6afcca9ce19b8aa31abc9d2b","category":"Environment"}
