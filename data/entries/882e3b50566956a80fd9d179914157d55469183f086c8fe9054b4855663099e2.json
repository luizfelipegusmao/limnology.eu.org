{"title":"Effects of Titanate on Brake Wear Particle Emission using Brake Material Friction Test Dynamometer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0356/v1","date":1728067966000,"content":"We investigated the effect of lepidocrocite-type layered titanate, which we have been using to reduce brake-particle emissions in an environmentally friendly manner. The effect of titanate on reduction was evaluated using a small-scale inertia brake-material-friction-test dynamometer. We suggested that brake-particle emissions are related to the microphysical structure of the pad surface, such as the uniformity of friction film and secondary-plateau formation, and that friction materials containing titanate contribute significantly to the reduction in both particle mass (PM) and particle number (PN) emissions of brake particles for both non-asbestos organic (NAO) and low-steel (LS) pads. In our experiments, the PM- and PN-emission levels of brake particles from LS pads with the addition of titanate were comparable to those of NAO pads.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"882e3b50566956a80fd9d179914157d55469183f086c8fe9054b4855663099e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
