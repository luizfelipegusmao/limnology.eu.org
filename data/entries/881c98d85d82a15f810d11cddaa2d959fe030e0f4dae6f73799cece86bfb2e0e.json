{"title":"Impact of Dispersion Methods on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotube (CNT)/Iron Oxide (Fe3O4)/Epoxy Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0519/v1","date":1717769348000,"content":"Integrating nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) into epoxy composites has significant interest due to their potential to enhance mechanical properties. This study evaluates the impact of dispersion quality on the mechanical performance of CNT/Fe3O4/Epoxy composites, comparing stirring and sonication methods at three different loadings: 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt.%. Tensile testing revealed that sonicated composites consistently outperformed stirred composites, with a significant increase in elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). However, fracture strain decreased in both composite types compared to pure epoxy, with sonicated composites experiencing a more significant reduction than stirred composites. These results underscore the importance of high-quality dispersion for optimizing mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"881c98d85d82a15f810d11cddaa2d959fe030e0f4dae6f73799cece86bfb2e0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
