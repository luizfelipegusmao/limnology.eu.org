MSW were collected from different locations in Kano metropolis, mixed together and then subjected to different treatment methods (pyrolysis, composting and untreated). Products of this treatment methods were applied to soil at different rate of 0, 5, 10 and 15ton ha-1. Effect of MSW treatment methods on the performance of amaranths was assessed by sowing amaranths seed in the amended soil in field and pot trial phases using RCBD and CRD respectively. Result from plant trials shows significant differences (p≤0.05) on plant height and number of leaves with highly significant difference (p≤0.01) on leaf area of amaranths in the pot trial. Significant differences (P≤0.05) were observed on the number of leaves as well as fresh and dry weight of amaranths in the field trial. From the study, it was concluded that municipal solid waste treatment methods affect the growth and performance of amaranths. There was an observed significant increase in the performance of amaranths following biochar application. Untreated (raw) wastes are relatively easier and less expensive to be used but has less pronounced effect on plant growth when compared with the control treatment. The recommended treatment method for municipal solid wastes depends on the overall purpose of application. It is therefore recommended that stakeholders be involved in the recycling of municipal solid wastes through composting as that may reduce expenses for procurement of inorganic fertilizer and provide waste management solution as well as increased crop yield for small holder farmers.</span></p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pages</strong></td>\n<td>01-05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Year</strong></td>\n<td>2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Issue</strong></td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Volume</strong></td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n<div></div><div><h3><span></span><span>Download</span></h3></div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n<div><div><div><div><a href=\"https://jcleanwas.com/download/1875/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><i></i>  PDF File<br /><span>Download</span></span></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href=\"https://jcleanwas.com/xml/1jcleanwas2024/1jcleanwas2024-01-05.xml\" target=\"_blank\"><span><i></i>  XMLFile<br /><span>Download</span></span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","author":"Natasha","siteTitle":"Journal Clean WAS (JCleanWAS)","siteHash":"7859c995592d7cda6b131545def19e0f3fa20c610e301572944054fc53efdaaa","entryHash":"1073420a4b17f2157166386eae1c18f2cf5c3647c68d0641bced139001b7d4b9","category":"Environment"}
