{"title":"First Responders on Ships: Technological and Legislative Developments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0783/v1","date":1723459173000,"content":"The use of fuel material and different sources of ignition causes unwanted fires, producing and spreading in different spaces. Fire fighting. systems are measures taken to minimize the effects of fire. This struggle is not only on land, but also in the maritime world, through maritime security that has become a very important element for the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Therefore, maritime accidents caused by fire are one of the challenges to be taken into account, because they require immediate control and response. This article presents a historical interpretation of the concept of maritime safety through first responders on ships. It will be demonstrate how the technological advances of such equipment have been very important for their arrival on ships. In addition, the article reveals the legislative changes of International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which reflects the IMO requirements to prevent fire risks on board, requiring a reading of the primary documents. Finally, the importance of the evolution of first intervention equipment for safety on board has been shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b840db908fbcdf41477e34fb151818c9cc1a99e7ef2307b0465ef021a0b5a45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
