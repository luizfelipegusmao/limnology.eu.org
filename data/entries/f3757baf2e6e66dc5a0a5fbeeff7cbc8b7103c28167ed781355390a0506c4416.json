{"title":"Novel Metabolites Associated with Decreased Gfr: A 12-Year Follow-Up of the METSIM Cohort","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1834/v1","date":1724664408000,"content":"Identification of the individuals having impaired kidney function is essential in preventing the complications of this disease. We measured 1 009 metabolites at the baseline study in 10 159 Finnish men of the METSIM cohort and associated the metabolites with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A total of 7 090 men participated in the 12-year follow-up study. Non-targeted metabolomics profiling was performed at Metabolon, Inc. (Morrisville, NC, USA) on EDTA plasma samples obtained after overnight fasting. We applied Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the metabolites (the Metabolon DiscoveryHD4 platform). We performed association analyses between the eGFR and metabolites using linear regression adjusted for confounding factors. We found 108 metabolites significantly associated with a decrease in eGFR, and 28 of them were novel including 12 amino acids, 8 xenobiotics, 5 lipids, 1 nucleotide, 1 peptide, and 1 partially characterized molecule. The most significant associations were with five amino acids, N-acetylmethionine, N-acetylvaline, gamma-carboxyglutamate, 3-methylglutaryl-carnitine, and pro-line. We identified 28 novel metabolites associated with decreased eGFR in the 12-year follow-up study of the METSIM cohort.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3757baf2e6e66dc5a0a5fbeeff7cbc8b7103c28167ed781355390a0506c4416","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
