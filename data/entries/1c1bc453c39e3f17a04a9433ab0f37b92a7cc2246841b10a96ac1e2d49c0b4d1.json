Recently, sensitization of <b>Ar</b>\n<sub>\n   <b>2</b>\n</sub>\n<b>I</b>\n<sup>\n   <b>+</b>\n</sup>\n<b>X</b>\n<sup>\n   <b>−</b>\n</sup> has gained importance owing to the escalating demand for high-sensitive initiators with longer wavelength absorption such as 365 and 436 nm. However, the mechanism of photolysis of <b>Ar<sub>2</sub>I<sup>+</sup>X<sup>−</sup>\n</b> has not been strictly elucidated. This paper shows discussions of the details of its mechanism. Herein, we analyzed the photosensitization of <b>Ar<sub>2</sub>I<sup>+</sup>X<sup>−</sup>\n</b> with 2–isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) based on transient absorption techniques. As a result, it was revealed that electron transfer occurred from a triplet excited state of ITX to <b>Ar<sub>2</sub>I<sup>+</sup>X<sup>−</sup>\n</b> with an electron transfer rate constant of 4.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, high performance liquid chromatography measurements found the quantum yield of the photolysis was determined to be 0.48.</p>","author":"Mayu Masuda, \nAtsushi Shiraishi, \nAyumi Kobayashi, \nKohei Iritani, \nTakashi Yamashita","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"1c1bc453c39e3f17a04a9433ab0f37b92a7cc2246841b10a96ac1e2d49c0b4d1","category":"Environment"}
