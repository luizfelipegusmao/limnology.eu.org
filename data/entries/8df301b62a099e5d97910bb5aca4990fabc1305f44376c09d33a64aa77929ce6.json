{"title":"Anti‐aging effect of peptides on Caenorhabditis elegans: a meta‐analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13522?af=R","date":1712661596000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Peptides have been studied in Caenorhabditis elegans for anti-aging research recently. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence, we conducted this meta-analysis focusing on the anti-aging effect of peptides in C. elegans to provide more convincing evidence.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A literature search in PubMed, SCOUPUS, and Web of Science databases yielded 2879 articles. After removing duplicates and based on inclusion criteria and STAIR checklist quality assessment, 9 articles were selected. Data extraction and analysis showed that, compared to the control group without peptide intervention, peptide supplementation significantly reduced nematode mortality risk (HR= 0.54, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.62; p &lt; 0.05), significantly increased the pharyngeal pumping rate (SMD = 1.64, 95% CI = 0.87, 2.41; p &lt; 0.05), bending frequency (SMD = 1.67, 95% CI =1.16, 2.18; p &lt; 0.05), and significantly decreased the accumulation of lipofuscin levels within nematodes (SMD = -4.48, 95% CI = -6.85, -2.12; p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that doses ranging from 0.1–1 kg m<sup>3</sup> ^-1 (HR= 0.50, 95% CI = 0.38, 0.65; p &lt; 0.05) displayed better anti-aging effects compared to other dose ranges.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The findings suggest that peptides can significantly extend the lifespan of C. elegans under normal circumstances and improve three indicators of healthylife. More importantly, subgroup analysis revealed that a dosage of 0.1–1 kg m<sup>3</sup> ^-1 demonstrated superior anti-aging effects. This meta-analysis provides more convincing evidence that peptides can play an anti-aging role in C. elegans.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
