{"title":"Anti‐aging effect of peptides on Caenorhabditis elegans: a meta‐analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13522?af=R","date":1714395276000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Recently, peptides have been studied in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> for anti-aging research. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence, we conducted this meta-analysis focusing on the anti-aging effect of peptides in <i>C. elegans</i> to provide more convincing evidence.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A literature search in PubMed, SCOUPUS, and Web of Science databases yielded 2879 articles. After removing duplicates and based on inclusion criteria and STAIR checklist quality assessment, nine articles were selected. Data extraction and analysis showed that, compared to the control group without peptide intervention, peptide supplementation significantly reduced nematode mortality risk [hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47, 0.62; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05], significantly increased the pharyngeal pumping rate [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.64, 95% CI = 0.87, 2.41; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05], bending frequency (SMD = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.16, 2.18; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and significantly decreased the accumulation of lipofuscin levels within nematodes (SMD = −4.48, 95% CI = −6.85, −2.12; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that doses ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg/mL (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.38, 0.65; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) displayed better anti-aging effects compared to other dose ranges.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The findings suggest that peptides can significantly extend the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> under normal circumstances and improve three indicators of healthy life. More importantly, subgroup analysis revealed that a dosage of 0.1–1 mg/mL demonstrated superior anti-aging effects. This meta-analysis provides more convincing evidence that peptides can play an anti-aging role in <i>C. elegans</i>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chao Huang, \nLing Zhu, \nHui Zhang, \nTongtong Liu, \nLi Wang, \nGangcheng Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8df301b62a099e5d97910bb5aca4990fabc1305f44376c09d33a64aa77929ce6","category":"Environment"}
