{"title":"Quantitative Approach to Explore Regulatory T Cell Activity in Immuno-Oncology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0325/v1","date":1728039812000,"content":"The failure of immunotherapies in cancer patients is being widely studied due to the complexities present in the tumor microenvironment (TME), where regulatory T cells (Treg) appear to actively participate in providing an immune escape mechanism for tumors. Therefore, therapies to specifically inhibit tumor-infiltrating Treg represent a challenge because Treg are distributed throughout the body and provide physiological immune homeostasis to prevent autoimmune diseases. Characterization of immunological and functional profiles could help to identify the mechanisms that need to be inhibited or activated to ensure Treg modulation in the tumor. To address this, quantitative in-silico approaches based on mechanistic mathematical models integrating multi-scale information from immune and tumor cells and the effect of different therapies have allowed the building of computational frameworks to simulate different hypotheses, some of which have subsequently been experimentally validated. Therefore, this review presents a list of diverse computational mathematical models that examine the role of Treg as a crucial immune resistance mechanism contributing to the failure of immunotherapy. In addition, this review highlights the relevance of certain molecules expressed in Treg that are associated with the TME immunosuppression, which could be incorporated into the mathematical model for a better understanding of the contribution of Treg modulation. Finally, different pre-clinical and clinical combinations of molecules are also included to show the trend of new therapies targeting Treg.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"531edd149200ef985f1ab1c0926a31ba8c56bb26b97932bf80fa71a7eb3c4cb9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
