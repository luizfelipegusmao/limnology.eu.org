{"title":"Three-Dimensional, Digital Reconstruction of Bacterial Enzymatic Megacomplexes for Antibiotic Biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.345/7720459?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>This project focuses on understanding how biosynthetic pathways assemble within bacterial cells for efficient synthesis and export of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites. The cellular organization of biosynthetic enzymes has not been systematically addressed for secondary metabolism. It is not known how bacteria adapt central metabolism and cellular structures to meet the metabolic demands for antibiotic biosynthesis. We use 3-Dimensional reconstructions of biosynthetic megacomplexes in whole cells to determine how bacteria build biosynthetic pipelines for antibiotics and other secondary metabolites. Using serial (cryo)-FIB-SEM and cryo-ET imaging of bacteria, including filamentous cells, and their subcellular structures, we are mapping biosynthetic complexes onto membrane regions that support export of the product metabolites. Using both high-resolution and meso-scale imaging data enables downstream interpretation of targeted biochemical and genetic experiments that reveal how biosynthetic enzymes assemble and coordinate with export machinery. In concert with EM, we use multi-photon fluorescence microscopy and FLIM to track label-free metabolites and tagged biosynthetic proteins, respectively, to identify the regions of biosynthetic activity in filamentous bacteria [<a href=\"#ozae044.345-B1\">1</a>]. The goal of the project is to advance knowledge of bacterial secondary metabolism beyond individual enzyme complexes to whole-cell networks. This knowledge will enhance the discovery of new antibiotics and reveal new avenues for genetically engineering microbes to produce improved antibiotics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5b469964991b851fc6f0e0eba8ea3a24cc3a2b4e15d92b442ba79eef6677ea07","category":"Environment"}
