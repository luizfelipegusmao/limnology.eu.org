{"title":"293 Effects of Saccharmyces yeast postbiotics on pig feed performance and carcass characteristics when included in an elevated protein diet","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/229/7664744?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The study objective was to determine effects of <span>Saccharmyces</span> yeast postbiotics (CT; celluTEIN; Puretein Bioscience LLC, Minneapolis, MN, USA) on growth performance and carcass characteristics of pigs fed an increased protein diet during growing and finishing. Pigs [PIC Camborough×PIC 337; n = 51 barrows; 57 gilts; initial body weight (BW) 28.3 ± 0.1 kg] were weighed, stratified by BW within sex, and within each two-pig strata, randomly assigned to a pen (n = 18; n = 6 pigs/pen). Pens were randomly assigned one of two dietary treatments (Diet) consisting of 0 or 100 ppm CT mixed in a four-phase dietary regimen (phase1 d 0 to 21, phase2 d 22 to 42, phase3 d 43 to 63, phase4 d 64 to 84). Weekly, feed consumption and pigs were weighed to calculate performance. On d 91, 98, and 105, the heaviest male and female from each pen was harvested and carcass data were collected. Performance data were analyzed as a completely randomized design, carcass data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design, and pen was the experimental unit). Statistical significance was determined at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05 and tendencies were declared between 0.05&lt; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.10. At all four phases, there was no Diet effect on BW, average daily gain (ADG), and average daily feed intake (ADFI; <span>P</span> &gt; 0.12), except CT pigs consumed less (<span>P =</span> 0.04) feed during phase4. There was no Diet effect on Phase2 gain to feed ratio (G:F), but CT pigs had greater Phase1 and 4 G:F and smaller Phase 3 G:F (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.04). From d 0 to 84, there were no Diet effects on ADG and ADFI (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.13), but CT pigs had greater (<span>P = 0</span>.02) G:F. celluTEIN carcasses tended to have greater (<span>P = 0</span>.09) weight and had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) dressing percent than control carcasses. There were no Diet effects for 10<sup>th</sup> or last rib fat thickness, but CT carcasses tended to have less (<span>P</span> = 0.07) first rib fat thickness. There were no Diet effects on loin eye area, National Pork Board (NPB) color score, Japanese color score, and L*, a*, and b* values (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.24). celluTEIN carcasses had smaller NPB marbling and Japanese marbling color scores than control carcasses (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.02). When supplemented to an increased protein diet, <span>Saccharmyces</span> yeast postbiotics improve feed conversion while positively affecting several important carcass measures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0215d8e1060eb82ecba7305081c6a841522ab0ac1436cfe420f29fdf618bec35","category":"Environment"}
