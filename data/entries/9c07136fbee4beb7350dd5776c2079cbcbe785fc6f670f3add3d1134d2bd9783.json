{"title":"Guinea Pigs in Balance: Impact of Diet on pH, Microbiota and Intestinal Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0241/v1","date":1725360971000,"content":"The study assessed the impact of different diets on gastrointestinal pH, intestinal microbiota, digestive tract morphometry, and productive performance in guinea pigs. A total of 160 improved genotype guinea pigs were used, distributed into three groups with different diets: alfalfa (T1), alfalfa + concentrate (T2), and concentrate (T3), to which a mixture of probiotics combined with vitamins, minerals was added and amino acids in T2 and T3. Gastrointestinal pH showed significant differences between treatments in the various segments of the digestive tract. The intestinal microbiota varied according to the diet, with Escherichia coli being the predominant bacterium in weaned guinea pigs. Intestinal morphometry was significantly altered with the addition of a reinforced probiotic mixture, improving the length and density of intestinal villi. Productive parameters such as weight gain, feed consumption, and feed conversion were better in guinea pigs fed a mixed diet with 0.5% probiotic mixture. These results indicate that intestinal pH may influence microbial composition, which impacts productive efficiency and immune health, highlighting the importance of balanced nutrition and supplementation to optimize the health and performance of guinea pigs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c07136fbee4beb7350dd5776c2079cbcbe785fc6f670f3add3d1134d2bd9783","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
