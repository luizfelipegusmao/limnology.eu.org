{"title":"A Comprehensive Overview of Malignant Lymphomas: Classification, Epidemiology, and Clinical Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0678/v1","date":1725875891000,"content":"Malignant lymphomas, encompassing Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), represent a significant category of hematological malignancies with diverse presentations and prognoses. This review synthesizes current understanding of malignant lymphomas, focusing on their classification, incidence, epidemiology, staging, histopathology, and evolving treatment strategies. Malignant lymphomas are broadly classified into HL and NHL, with NHL further subdivided into B-cell, T-cell, and NK-cell neoplasms. The emergence of grey zone lymphomas, which exhibit overlapping features and heightened aggressiveness, underscores the complexity of diagnosis and treatment. Epidemiologically, HL predominantly affects younger individuals, while NHL incidence increases with age, reflecting a global rise in both incidence and mortality rates. Advances in diagnostic techniques and treatments have led to improved outcomes, yet challenges persist, particularly in distinguishing between overlapping lymphoma types and managing increasing incidence rates. The management of HL and NHL involves a variety of treatment options tailored to the disease stage and individual patient characteristics. After diagnosis and staging, treatment regimens may include radiotherapy, chemotherapy (either alone or in combination), and immunotherapy. Monitoring patient response is crucial, with adjustments made in cases of therapeutic failure. Achieving remission—either partial or complete—depends on the normalization of biomarkers and imaging results, reduction of lymphoid organ size, and resolution of symptoms. Despite therapeutic advances, treatment complications, including short-term effects like myelosuppression and long-term issues such as cardiomyopathy and secondary cancers, remain significant. The future of HL and NHL treatment lies in refining these approaches, minimizing adverse effects, and enhancing efficacy through innovative therapies and personalized medicine strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72de297eda8999155859954ec1198d8001f7f5b77d33ceeaab033dd5130175b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
