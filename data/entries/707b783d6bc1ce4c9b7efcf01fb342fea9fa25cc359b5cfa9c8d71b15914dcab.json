{"title":"Perturbed FLRW Metric Explains the Difference in Measurements of the Hubble Constant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0626/v3","date":1726221147000,"content":"The expansion of the universe yields two consistent differing values of a Hubble constant depending on the methods of measurement. The aim of this work was to explain the Hubble tension by properties of space corresponding to a radially inhomogeneous metrics. A cosmological model described by this perturbed FLRW metric has zero pressure and exponentially expanding space. But the observed space appears to be compressed in the radial direction. We consider the dependence of the change rate of photon energy on the direction of its motion. It is found applying the principle of the photon's energy integral extremum and the relationship between it and the energy of a material particle obtained using Lagrange mechanics. The change rate of a photon's energy varies depending on whether it moves in a radial direction or has an angular component. The metric coefficients are determined by the difference in measurements of the Hubble constant using gravitational lensing and a distance ladder.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"707b783d6bc1ce4c9b7efcf01fb342fea9fa25cc359b5cfa9c8d71b15914dcab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
