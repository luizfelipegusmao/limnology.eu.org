{"title":"Surface Engineering of Ti6Al4V: Impact of Rhenium-Carbon Coatings with Molybdenum Anchors on Biocompatibility and Corrosion Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1211/v1","date":1723784988000,"content":"Titanium alloys, notably Ti6Al4V, are frequently employed in biomedical applications due to their high mechanical strength and biocompatibility. But improving their surface qualities like biocompatibility and resistance to corrosion remains a crucial topic of study. This study investigates the effects of rhenium-carbon coatings deposited on Ti6Al4V substrates using magnetron sputtering technique with a molybdenum anchoring layer. Despite successful formation of rhenium carbides, elemental rhenium, and rhenium oxides confirmed by EDS and XRD analysis, the coatings exhibited poor adhesion, resulting in significant delamination as observed in SEM images. Corrosion resistance tests revealed that the coatings adversely affected the Ti6Al4V substrate, as indicated by increased corrosion current densities and more negative corrosion potentials in potentiodynamic polarization tests. Biocompatibility assessments using PK15 cells showed a notable reduction in cell viability and metabolic activity, particularly with coatings of higher surface roughness. These findings underscore the need for improved surface preparation and coating processes to enhance adhesion and biocompatibility of rhenium-carbon coatings on Ti6Al4V substrates. Future research should focus on optimizing coating adhesion, investigating cytotoxicity mechanisms related to surface roughness, and expanding biocompatibility evaluations to various cell types and biological environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fba1aa0b16af3ef2b010eb04bda719235d78d612299057c99d47bfcb2b01de2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
