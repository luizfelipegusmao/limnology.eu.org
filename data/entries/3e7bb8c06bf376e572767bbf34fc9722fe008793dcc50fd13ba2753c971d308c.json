{"title":"Novel Acid-Assisted Polymerization Technique for Synthesis of Polyaniline Films at Room Temperature: Morphological Study and Supercapacitor Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1903/v1","date":1727231883000,"content":"This study presents polyaniline (PANI) synthesis and characterization using a novel acid-assisted polymerization technique. Two PANI suspensions with different ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) concentrations were synthesized at room temperature, i.e. the ratio of aniline to APS was 10:1 for PANI1 and 5:1 for PANI2. SEM measurements revealed distinct structures: a porous nanofibrillar structure for PANI1 and a densely packed structure for PANI2. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated PANI/glassy carbon (GC) electrodes was evaluated using a three-electrode cell configuration in the scan rates of 10 mV/s and 30 mV/s. The PANI1/GC heterostructure exhibited a specific capacitance of 160 F/g, while this value increased to 407 for the PANI2/GC. This research contributes not only to the understanding of PANI synthesis at room temperature but also to its potential applications in electrochemical energy storage devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e7bb8c06bf376e572767bbf34fc9722fe008793dcc50fd13ba2753c971d308c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
