{"title":"RNAi-Mediated Knockdown of CYP321A7 and CYP321A8 in Fall Armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Enhances Susceptibility to Chlorantraniliprole and Thiamethoxam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1644/v1","date":1726891941000,"content":"Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, has been causing significant crop losses and has now become the most economically important pest of corn globally. With the challenges arising from the extensive use of synthetic chemicals such as reports that FAW gained resistance to various insecticides, researchers are developing environmentally sound control measures to address these issues. An example is the application of the RNA interference in managing FAW populations. RNA interference is a biological process where dsRNA molecules silence specific gene of interest. Here, dsRNA fragments were generated to target Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP321A7 and CYP321A8 in FAW. Mortality and phenotypic effects of RNAi-mediated knockdown of essential genes of target CYP450s through RNAi in FAW were analyzed. Results showed that RNA in vitro transcription yielded ~14 μg/μL of dsCYP321A7 and dsCYP321A8. The mortality rate of dsCYP321A7- and dsCYP321A8-fed larvae following exposure to insecticide with dual active ingredient of Chlorantraniliprole and Thiamethoxam increased by 90% and 80%, respectively as compared to dsGFP-fed larvae with 40% at 2 days post insecticide exposure. This study provided evidence for the potential of RNAi for FAW management strategies particularly for insecticide-resistant populations, including the potential for biopesticide development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e29f27121ea8aacc52e63f39a6597f98b3a1c4f1ed8f8693938168377f972b21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
