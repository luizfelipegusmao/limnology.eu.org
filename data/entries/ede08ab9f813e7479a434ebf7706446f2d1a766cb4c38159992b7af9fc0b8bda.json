{"title":"Sound-Evoked Neural Activity in Normal Hearing Tinnitus: The Effect of Frequency and Simulation Side","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1172/v1","date":1713358229000,"content":"Tinnitus is a common phantom auditory percept, believed to be related to plastic changes in the brain due to hearing loss. However, tinnitus can also occur in absence of any clinical hearing loss. Then, since there is no hearing loss, the mechanisms that drive plastic changes remain largely enigmatic. Previous studies showed subtle differences in sound-evoked brain activity associated with tinnitus in subjects with tinnitus and otherwise, normal hearing, but the results are not consistent across studies. Here, we aim to investigate those differences using monaural rather than binaural stimuli. Sound-evoked responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in participants with and without tinnitus. All participants had clinically normal audiograms. The stimuli were pure tones with frequencies between 353 and 8000 Hz, presented monaurally. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the response in the auditory cortex revealed no difference in tonotopic organization, which confirmed earlier studies. A GLM analysis showed hyperactivity in the lateral areas of the bilateral auditory cortex. Consistent with the tonotopic map, this hyperactivity mainly occurred in response to low stimulus frequencies. This may be related to hyperacusis, which was associated with tinnitus found in the parahippocampus. This may reflect an interference between tinnitus and spatial orientation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ede08ab9f813e7479a434ebf7706446f2d1a766cb4c38159992b7af9fc0b8bda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
