{"title":"Circular Economy in the Agri‚ÄêFood System at the Country Level. Evidence from European Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0460/v1","date":1728292253000,"content":"The circular economy is a tangible paradigm in response to the unsustainable model of production and consumption of resources in the agri-food system. The circular economy allows for a reduction in the environmental impact through the minimization of food waste or the maximal generation of renewable energy from waste. Despite the relevance, the extant literature is scat for indications on how to apply circular business models in agri-food systems. Hence, the paper aims to analyze the circular economy implementation level in the agri-food system in 29 European countries focusing on specific circular economy strategies. Selected indicators were analyzed to evaluate the level of circular economy implementation in the agri-food system (e.g., production values, energy sharing from renewable sources, and total waste emission) using a Panel data analysis method. The required variables were gained from the global databases within the recent five years (2014-2018). Results reveal an overall lack of circular economy implementation in the agri-food systems among European countries. A set of 12 managerial propositions was suggested to foster the implementation of the circular business models by interacting the recycling, extending, intensifying, and dematerializing strategies with aspects of the production process, waste emission, and renewable energy sharing in the agri-food system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88cd6b5d041a3472de832179fe8b2c8ab527c586b825be5d4b401346e954c670","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
