{"title":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: An Overview of Mechanisms and Therapeutic Uses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1755/v1","date":1721725422000,"content":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, has been an innovative method of demure neuromodulation. This paper aims to delve into the different forms of its existence and to evaluate the use of TMS in five psychiatric disorders; Parkinsonâ€™s disease, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, and major anxiety disorder. Literature pertaining to the use of TMS in treating these specific diseases will be analyzed, and its efficacy and mechanisms will be explored. The literature will be evaluated through sources with established facts and research studies demonstrating function, potency, or inefficacy. TMS poses a method to have a more explicit effect on the regions of the brain, and the exploration of its use in the treatment of psychiatric diseases poses new possibilities in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Venturing into the options it could have in a sole or combinatorial setting could provide penetrating insight into innovative forms of treatment and research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26e8ea14938e152a2ce73cd8c38edd3b9ed2d51e153cf0c1ee8c2c7e25d0f15b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
