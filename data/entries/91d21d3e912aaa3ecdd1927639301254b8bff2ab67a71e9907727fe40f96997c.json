Magnetic imaging in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.505-B1\">1</a>], has proven extremely valuable for unveiling the details of these magnetic solitons even in 3D [<a href=\"#ozae044.505-B2\">2</a>]. Hall effect measurements on such spin textures are usually conducted on samples, whose size and morphology differ substantially from those investigated in a TEM. Since the stability of skyrmions is highly sensitive to the sample geometry, the correlation of magneto-transport and TEM data is problematic if not conducted on identical samples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"91d21d3e912aaa3ecdd1927639301254b8bff2ab67a71e9907727fe40f96997c","category":"Environment"}
