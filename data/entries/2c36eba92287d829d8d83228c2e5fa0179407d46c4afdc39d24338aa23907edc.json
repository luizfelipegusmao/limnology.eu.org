This is incorrect as high strength Loctite is 638. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Loctite was confirmed to be counterfeit by Henkel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8378\" srcset=\"https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-scaled-960x1280.jpg 960w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200703_134404-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The photograph above shows the counterfeit Loctite.
