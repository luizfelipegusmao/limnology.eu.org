{"title":"Bio-Morphological, Reproductive and Ecological-Physiological Characteristics of Endangered Amberboa moschata (Asteraceae) and Some Aspects of Its Ex Situ Conservation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0123/v1","date":1722563325000,"content":"The article presents data on bio-morphological, reproductive and ecological-physiological features of endangered ornamental species Amberboa moschata (Asteraceae) in natural habitats of the Ararat valley of Armenia and cultivated under ex situ conditions in the Yerevan Botanical Garden. According to conducted exploration, the plants cultivated have satisfactory adaptive capacity, a complete development cycle, the ability to form mature seeds and self-renewal by seeds, and higher parameters of total moisture, transpiration intensity and photosynthesis compared to natural ones. The diploid cytotype of the species A. moschata has been found to be 2n=32. The karyotype is asymmetric, with chromosomes ranging in size from 0.77 to 1.91 µm. The average pollen fertility of A. moschata is high, 96.7–96.9% in both natural and cultivated samples. A scale of ornamental properties of A. moschata has been compiled, including 15 characteristics of the inflorescence, shoot, leaf, fruit and plant. The total duration of plant ornamental period under cultivation is about 98 days, the maximum ornamental effect is observed during the flowering period of 68–70 days. The studied species is recommended for creating living collections in botanical gardens and utilization in ornamental horticulture and landscaping as measures for its ex situ conservation. The article is illustrated with a map, original photographs and tables.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c3c00255ab27f0a705d7d6032c28707983fed38cd00d3b1f8e18ab0c34056ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
