{"title":"Evaluating Exploitation of White Crappie and Black Crappie in Three Southeast Kansas Reservoirs","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/7632622?af=R","date":1713855600000,"content":"<p>White Crappie (<i>Pomoxis annularis</i>) and Black Crappie (<i>P. nigromaculatus</i>) were studied in three southeast Kansas reservoirs to assess exploitation and determine if current regulations were conducive for sustainable populations. Trap nets were used to sample crappie in Elk City Reservoir, Big Hill Reservoir, and Parsons City Lake. Crappie measuring 210â€‰mm and greater received Floy FD-94 tags that served as entries for rewards to encourage tag reporting. Harvest and angler demographic information were collected when tags were reported. Postcard surveys and motion-sensed cameras were used in conjunction to estimate angler effort and reporting rate on Parsons City Lake. Annual exploitation rates (i.e., percent of fish harvested) determined by tag returns and corrected for nonreporting and tag loss were 28.3%, 21.8%, and 3.9% on Elk City Reservoir, Big Hill Reservoir, and Parsons City Lake, respectively. Overfishing was not occurring, so current statewide regulations were likely appropriate, and no changes may be necessary.</p>","author":"Danci L. Guiot, \nSeth A.
