{"title":"Compression After Impact Response of Kevlar Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1391/v1","date":1718870725000,"content":"Boeing and Airbus developed a special testing procedure to investigate the compressive response of laminates that have been impacted (following standards ASTM D 7137 and DIN 65561). This study focuses on both experimental and numerical analysis of Kevlar plates subjected to compression after impact. To ensure high quality and appropriate mechanical properties, the composite plates were manufactured using autoclaving. The DIN 65561 protocol was followed for all three test systems. Initially, ultrasonic C-scanning was performed on all plates before testing to confirm they were free of any significant defects arising from the manufacturing process. Subsequently, low-energy impact testing was conducted at levels ranging from 0 to 8 Joules. Three specimens were tested at each energy level. After the impact, all specimens underwent ultrasonic C-scanning again to assess the internal delamination damage caused by the impactor. Finally, both pristine and impacted specimens were subjected to compressive testing using the special jig specified in DIN 65561. The compressive impact strength results obtained from these tests were plotted against the delamination area measured by C-scanning. This data was then compared to results obtained from specimens with artificial damage. Semi-empirical equations were used to fit both sets of curves. The same procedure (impact testing, C-scanning, and data analysis) was repeated to investigate the relationship between impact energy and total delamination area. Lastly, finite element modeling was employed to predict the buckling stresses that develop under compression in the impacted systems studied. These modelling approaches have demonstrated good accuracy in reproducing experimental results for CAI tests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"879f94a5bc7141230e26f618b581593db87240b3a03bc967e3d92e65b6c4f77b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
