{"title":"Optimal Design and Analysis of Wide-band Near-infrared Hybrid Dielectric Gratings with High Transmission Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0324/v1","date":1725459620000,"content":"Since surface relief transmission gratings have very strict requirements on operators and use environment, according to the semiconductor laser external cavity spectral beam combining system, this paper proposes a design scheme of semiconductor laser array spectral beam combining system based on grating-external cavity. The finite element approach was used to create a wideband, high-efficiency fill-in multilayer dielectric transmission grating structure for a high-power spectrum beam combining system. The incidence angle, ridge height, duty cycle, and sidewall inclination angle of the transmission grating were tuned and evaluated, and a link between the transmission grating's diffraction efficiency and grating characteristics was discovered. The calculated design of the high-power fused silica transmission grating has a negative first-order peak diffraction efficiency of 99.5% in the 800nm range. In the spectral region of 765-872 nm, the transmission grating's diffraction effectiveness exceeds 92%. The filled ultra-high diffraction efficiency multilayer dielectric transmission grating design addresses the issue of resistance to high-power lasers under complicated operating settings, it’s intended to maintain a high diffraction efficiency even after several cleaning cycles, and it’s an ideal component for high-power spectrum beam combining systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8bec18e52e8cc40d5643af6c08d0fba52f9710195491cdbe5ce7f7db025f754b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
