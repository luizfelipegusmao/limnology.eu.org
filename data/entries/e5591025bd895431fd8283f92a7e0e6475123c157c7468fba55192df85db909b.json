{"title":"Challenges and Security Risks in the Red Sea: Impact of Houthi Attacks on Maritime Traffic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0053/v1","date":1727785347000,"content":"This study delves into the significant impact of Houthi insurgent activities on maritime traffic within the strategic Red Sea and Suez Canal routes, crucial conduits for global trade. It explores the correlation between regional instability, as exemplified by Houthi actions from 1st attack to a merchant vessel (November 19, 2023) to February 5, 2024, and alterations in maritime traffic patterns, alongside the operational efficiency of these vital maritime arteries. Employing descriptive statistics, qualitative, and geospatial analytical methods, the research examines recent trends in maritime traffic and incident reports, shedding light on the spatial and geopolitical challenges faced by one of the world's most critical trade routes. The findings reveal a marked decline in maritime activity in the Gulf of Aden and Suez Canal, attributed to security concerns stemming from Houthi attacks, with a significant shift towards alternative routes, notably around the Cape of Good Hope. This shift underscores the broader implications of regional instability on global trade dynamics and the critical nature of maintaining uninterrupted maritime flow. The study also highlights the economic ramifications, including increased operational costs and freight rates due to longer transit times and enhanced security measures. It concludes with a call for improved maritime security protocols and international cooperation to safeguard these strategic maritime pathways. This research contributes to the discourse on transport geography by quantifying the direct impacts of regional conflicts on maritime logistics and proposing strategies for future resilience, emphasizing the intertwined nature of global trade, security, and the urgent need for collective action in the face of evolving geopolitical challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5591025bd895431fd8283f92a7e0e6475123c157c7468fba55192df85db909b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
