{"title":"253 Effect of dietary straw withdrawal in high-concentrate diets on efficiency, carcass performance, rumen characteristics and seized livers in dairy beef crossbred bulls housed with straw bedding","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/354/7757240?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary straw withdrawal in high-concentrate diets on efficiency, carcass performance, rumen characteristics and seized livers in dairy beef crossbred bulls housed with straw bedding. Bulls [n = 93; 335 ± 9.0 kg body weight (BW); 218 ± 4.0 d age] were group-housed in 6 straw-bedded pens according to 3 different feeding programs (2 pens/treatment): 1) CTR (n = 32), concentrate (13.1% CP, 5.9% fat content, 16.1% NDF, 40.8% starch content) and straw ad libitum fed in two separate feeders; 2) TSW (n = 32), like CTR, however, dietary straw withdrawal took place the first 84 study days; and 3) NSS (n = 29), concentrate with a reduced starch content (12.2% CP, 4.6% fat content, 22.0% NDF, 39.6% starch content) without dietary straw for the whole study. The study lasted 155 d divided into eleven 14-d periods. Individual concentrate intake was recorded daily, and dietary straw consumption was recorded per pen biweekly, as was individual BW. Carcass performance, rumen characteristics and seized organs were recorded at the slaughterhouse. Data were analyzed with a mixed-effects model. The first period was an adaptation where a dietary straw bale per pen was offered in all treatments; thereafter, only in CTR, and in TSW, after period 6. Treatment by period interactions (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) in efficiency parameters were observed. Specifically, BW was greater in CTR than in TSW and NSS bulls while straw withdrawal periods; however, TSW bulls increased BW compared with NSS bulls when dietary straw was reintroduced, with final BW greater in CTR and TSW than in NSS bulls (569, 557 and 536 ± 8.0 kg, respectively). Regarding feed consumption, while dietary straw withdrawal for the first 6 periods, concentrate and straw intake were less in TSW and NSS than in CTR bulls, regardless the type of concentrate; after period 7, concentrate intake did not differ among treatments, and straw intake was greater in CTR and TSW than in NSS bulls, except in period 7, just after dietary straw reintroduction, that was greater in TSW than in CTR bulls. Hot carcass weight was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) in CTR than in TSW and NSS bulls (314, 296 and 299 ± 6.0 kg, respectively); dressing percentage was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) in CTR and NSS than in TSW bulls (55.1, 55.9 and 53.2 ± 0.65%, respectively); and carcass conformation tended (<span>P</span> = 0.06) to have greater classification in CTR bulls, and reduced classification in TSW bulls. Number of sized livers tended (<span>P</span> = 0.07) to be greater in NSS than in CTR and TSW bulls (22, 3 and 9%, respectively). In conclusion, short and long-term dietary straw withdrawal decreased animal and carcass performance regardless concentrate’s starch content in dairy beef crossbred bulls fed high-concentrate diets housed with straw bedding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1072bd70d86cf31ddb040887f1bfdc3f91f427552b2519a31f0b88d4dd75c829","category":"Environment"}
