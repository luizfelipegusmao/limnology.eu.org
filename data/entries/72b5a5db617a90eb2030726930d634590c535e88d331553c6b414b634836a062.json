{"title":"Atomic-Scale Structural and Magnetic Coupling Properties of Twin Boundaries in LiFe5O8 Film","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1300/v1","date":1718794674000,"content":"It is of great academic significance to understand how the atomic structure of interfaces and boundaries in materials impacts the magnetic coupling nature across the boundaries and encourage development of state-of-the-art magnetic devices. Here, we carry out a systematic investigation of the atomic and electronic structures of twin boundaries (TBs) in LiFe5O8 thin films and determine their concurrent magnetic couplings using atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomistic first-principles calculations. The results show ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling can exist across the different TBs in LiFe5O8 (LFO) thin films and electrical structures within a few atomic layers directly rely on the TB atomic core structures. Uncovering one-to-one relationship between the magnetic properties of individual TB and the local atomic structures will clarify a thorough comprehension of numerous fascinating magnetic properties of commonly utilized magnetic materials, which will undoubtedly encourage the progress of sophisticated magnetic materials and devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72b5a5db617a90eb2030726930d634590c535e88d331553c6b414b634836a062","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
