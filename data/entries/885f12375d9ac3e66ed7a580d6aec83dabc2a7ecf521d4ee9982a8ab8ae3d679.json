{"title":"Morphology of the Veins in Healthy Individuals in the Area of the Sapheno-Femoral Junction during Normal Breathing, Valsalva Maneuver and Ujjayi Breath","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1290/v1","date":1724150902000,"content":"Objectives: Valsalva maneuver is performed during strength physical exercises, because it stabilizes the torso through increased intra-abdominal pressure. By contrast, yoga practitioners are discouraged from Valsalva. Instead, they use ujjayi breath, which consists of unstopped breathing through the narrowed glottis. Methods: This study was an observational research performed in healthy participants. The aim of this study was to evaluate veins in the groin area during different types of breathing. We examined 10 healthy people in the standing body position during: a) normal breathing b) Valsalva maneuver c) ujjayi breath. We measured the cross-sectional areas of the femoral and the great saphenous veins in the proximity to the sapheno-femoral junction. Results: In comparison with normal breathing, there were only slight dilatations of examined veins during Valsalva and ujjayi. The cross-sectional area of femoral vein increased by 7-9% during Valsalva, and 2-4% during ujjayi; cross-sectional area of the great saphenous vein increased by 17-18% during Valsalva and 15-16% during ujjayi. In all participants the terminal and preterminal valves of the great saphenous vein were competent. However, Valsalva maneuver was associated with complete closure of the terminal valve, while during ujjayi breath this valve was opening and closing, following the breathing. Conclusions: In the standing body position both Valsalva and ujjayi breath have minimal effect on cross-sectional areas of the veins in the groin. On the other hand, ujjayi breath allows for undisturbed flow through the sapheno-femoral junction, while Valsalva interrupts this flow, with blood stagnation distally from the terminal valve.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"885f12375d9ac3e66ed7a580d6aec83dabc2a7ecf521d4ee9982a8ab8ae3d679","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
