{"title":"Developing a Comprehensive Framework for Assessing Airport Sustainability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1918/v1","date":1716961154000,"content":"The background of this research is the environmental sustainability assessments in the aviation ecosystem, particularly concerning airports, are getting significant attention from the industry, regulators, and researchers. A standardized and comprehensive approach is essential for uniformly addressing the global impacts of these assessments across the industry. The main objective of this study is to develop a unique framework that encompasses the requirements of aviation regulators as well as industry and academic metrics, aiming for a standardized approach to environmental sustainability assessments at airports. The methodology used the Sum of Ranking Method to evaluate each environmental indicator precisely. It was applied to five airports globally, providing a diverse testing ground to assess the proposed metricsâ€™ applicability and effectiveness and validate the framework. The results showed that applying the framework across these varied airport environments demonstrated its viability and effectiveness, indicating that it can be successfully applied to different airport realities. The conclusion shows that the developed framework can be successfully applied globally, suggesting that it can be a valid method for international adoption in environmental airport sustainability analysis, offering a standardized approach that could be accepted and utilized worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d164ed116eb5624d732ade92e053806defba54eb0fbe5e6024441ceb82f6011d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
