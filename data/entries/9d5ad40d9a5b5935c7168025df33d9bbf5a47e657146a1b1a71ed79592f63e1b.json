{"title":"Additive intercropping system or acaricides: which one is more efficient to prevent population buildup of two-spotted spider mite?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/425/7630434?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Habitat manipulation such as intercropping can be used as a simple and common cultural practice in pest management. This method is based on the principle of reducing pest populations by increasing the diversity of an ecosystem. This study has been carried out to evaluate the influence of additive series intercropping common bean with some aromatic plants (AP), and 2 acaricides on the different life stages (egg, immature mobile stages, and adult) of <span>Tetranychus urticae</span> Koch (Trombidiformes: Tetranychidae), over 2 yr of experimentation (2020 and 2021). This experiment was conducted following a randomized complete block design with 7 treatments including common bean monoculture, common bean sprayed by spiromesifen or Dayabon, and common bean + companion plants (coriander, ajwain, basil, or dill). Each treatment was replicated 3 replicates. The lowest and highest number of eggs, immature mobile stages, and adults were observed in common bean + spiromesifen and the common bean monoculture, respectively. Additionally, the common bean + Dayabon supported significantly different <span>T. urticae</span> life stage densities compared to common bean monoculture. Also, among intercropped treatments, common bean + basil showed the lowest number of <span>T. urticae</span> (eggs, immature mobile stages, and adults). The highest yield and land equivalent ratio were recorded in common bean + basil and common bean + spiromesifen, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that additive intercropping with these AP can effectively decrease the <span>T. urticae</span> population density, which is useful for the safe production of common bean.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"9d5ad40d9a5b5935c7168025df33d9bbf5a47e657146a1b1a71ed79592f63e1b","category":"Environment"}
