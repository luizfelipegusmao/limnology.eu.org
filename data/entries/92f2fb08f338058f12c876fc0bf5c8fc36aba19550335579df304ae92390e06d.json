{"title":"Exploring the past to discern the present: The role of historico‐geographical study in differentiating natural river channels from artificial canals","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.73?af=R","date":1705657393000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The historical background of a watercourse, whether it be a natural river or an artificial canal, holds great importance in understanding hydrological heritage, landscape evolution, planning processes, and making informed predictions for the future. This study focuses on the case study of the Churni River, which has been regarded as an artificial canal in the local literature, history, and geography research papers. The objective of this study is to investigate the authenticity of the claims and explore whether the Churni River is a natural river or an artificially constructed canal. Through an examination of existing literature and the present channel morphology, it becomes apparent that the alleged myths and rumors surrounding the origin of the Churni River, proposing its deliberate construction as a man-made canal by Maharaja Krishnachandra, lack substantial evidence. Conversely, a more plausible scenario emerges, suggesting that the Maharaja's endeavors were likely focused on rejuvenating the degraded and silt-laden course of an already existing river. Additionally, no evidence is found to support the claim that the name “Churni” was assigned by Maharaja Krishnachandra, and the alternative name “Kangkana” lacks substantiation as a name for the river. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the historical and geographical context of the Churni River, shedding light on its origin and nature while emphasizing the significance of historical analysis in distinguishing natural river channels from artificial canals and will widen the avenue of future research on river heritage of like situation.</p>","author":"Balai C.
