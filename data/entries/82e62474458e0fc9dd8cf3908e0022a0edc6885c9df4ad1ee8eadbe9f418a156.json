This study investigated and evaluated the effects of an inoculation dose of the acid-reducing yeast <i>Issatchenkia terricola</i> WJL-G4 on several aspect such as physicochemical properties, chromaticity, active substances, and antioxidant capacity. A sensory evaluation was also conducted.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results indicated that, when the inoculation dose increased from 2% to 12%, the total phenol, total flavonoid, and total anthocyanin content, and antioxidant capacity in currant juice decreased. A low inoculation dose (2–4%) was beneficial for preserving the total phenol and total flavonoid content. Although the levels of most phenolic compounds decreased, the concentrations of caffeic acid, <i>p</i>-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, rutin, and epicatechin were significantly higher than the control after fermentation. Overall acceptability and taste scores of fermented currants improved compared with those of the control group.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This experiment provided an effective solution, with a theoretical basis, to the problems of the sour taste and harsh flavor of currant juice. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Liping Gao, \nYunhan Li, \nShuo Yang, \nYihong Bao, \nTing Luo, \nJinling Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"82e62474458e0fc9dd8cf3908e0022a0edc6885c9df4ad1ee8eadbe9f418a156","category":"Environment"}
