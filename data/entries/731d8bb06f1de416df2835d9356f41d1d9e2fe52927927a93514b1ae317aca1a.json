Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCTA) was performed before and after PPV. Area, perimeter, and circularity of superficial foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were analyzed preoperatively in both eyes using OCTA. Preoperative CCP was also analyzed with binarized en-face OCTA images. Measurements of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT) by OCT were conducted at the baseline and 6 months following the surgery. The correlations of preoperative OCT parameters with postoperative BCVA and CFT reduction were analyzed.</p> Results <p>CCP was significantly lower (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and FAZ had shrunk (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in eyes with iERM compared to unaffected fellow eyes before surgery. BCVA and CFT became significantly improved after surgery (<i>p</i> = 0.001, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that preoperative CCP was significantly related with BCVA improvement (β = 0.185, <i>p</i> = 0.005), postoperative BCVA (β = 0.108, <i>p</i> = 0.023) and ratio of post- to preoperative CFT (β = 0.106, <i>p</i> = 0.044).</p> Conclusions <p>Preoperative CCP is a biomarker for poor functional and anatomical prognosis after surgery in iERM.</p>","author":"Gee-Hyun Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"731d8bb06f1de416df2835d9356f41d1d9e2fe52927927a93514b1ae317aca1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
