{"title":"Relationship Between Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase and Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency With New Generation Inflammation Biomarkers of in Term Newborns With Prolonged Neonatal Jaundice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1649/v2","date":1719462955000,"content":"Aim: To evaluate the clinical findings of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase(G6PD) and pyruvate kinase(PK) deficiency in prolonged jaundice. To determine whether systemic-immune-inflammation index(SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) can be used in the diagnosis of neonatal prolonged jaundice. Methods: In full term neonates with hyperbilirubinemia who were admitted to Medicine Hospital between January 2019 and January 2024 with the complaint of jaundice, 167 infants with a serum bilirubin level above 10 mg/dL, whose jaundice persisted after the 10th day, were included in the study. Results: G6PD was negatively correlated with NLR, SII, age, and Hct. There was a negatively poor correlation between G6PD and NLR and a negatively moderate correlation between G6PD and SII when adjusted for age and Hct. PK showed no significant correlation with G6PD, NLR, PLR, SII, age, and Hct.  A linear relationship was observed between G6PD and SII and NLR. Conclusions: NLR and SII can be easily calculated in the evaluation of prolonged jaundice in G6PD deficiency has a considerable advantage. NLR and SII levels may contribute by preventing further tests for prolonged jaundice and regulating its treatment. It may be useful to form an opinion in emergencies and in the early period.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f10d7494ab86e9c45a20f2be76366dcb9e991882951ef105ba92d083ddfbee11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
