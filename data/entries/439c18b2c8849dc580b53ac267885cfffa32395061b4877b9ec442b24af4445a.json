{"title":"Psychological capital and social class: A capital approach to understanding positive psychological states and their role in explaining social inequalities","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310031","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Deborah De Moortel, Mattias Vos, Bram Spruyt, Christophe Vanroelen, Joeri Hofmans, Edina Dóci</p>\r\n\r\nPsychological capital (PsyCap) is a multidimensional concept entailing hope, self-efficacy, optimism, and resilience. This paper argues that it can be considered a form of “capital” explaining social inequality. We test whether PsyCap can be integrated into the Bourdieusian capital framework by assessing its relationship with social, economic, and cultural capital. We also identify different types of social positions based on the volume and composition of psychological, economic, cultural, and social capital. We use cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey of 2012 (N = 35,313 respondents; 29 countries). To test the associations with the Bourdieusian capital types, we calculated multilevel spearman rank correlations and performed confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Latent Class Analysis identified different types of social positions. We found positive weak correlations between PsyCap and the indicators of cultural capital (<i>r</i> ≤ .14) and positive moderate correlations with the indicators of economic and social capital (<i>r</i> ≤ .24). The results of the CFA showed that the fit of the 4-capital model was superior to that of the 3-capital model. We identified six types of social positions: two deprived types (with overall low capital levels); two well-off types (with overall high capital levels) and two types with high psychological and social capital in combination with varying levels of cultural and economic capital. Including PsyCap in the Bourdieusian capital framework acknowledges the power of positive psychological states regarding processes of social mobility and social inequality on the one hand and calls for understanding PsyCap as a social and group-level phenomenon on the other hand. As such, integrating PsyCap into the Bourdieusian framework can help to address the longstanding issue of understanding the relationship between social and individual differences in the study of social inequalities.","author":"Deborah De Moortel","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"439c18b2c8849dc580b53ac267885cfffa32395061b4877b9ec442b24af4445a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
