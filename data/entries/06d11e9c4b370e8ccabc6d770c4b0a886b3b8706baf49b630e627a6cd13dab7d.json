{"title":"A systematic review of drying in aquatic products","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12820?af=R","date":1702540257000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Drying is an essential method for the process and storage of aquatic products. With the removal of water, the occurrence of oxidation, hydrolysis and browning reaction also accompanies it. This article reviews the applications of emerging drying methods in aquatic products, emphasising high-quality drying. In addition, it summarises the effects of the drying process on the quality of aquatic products, including appearance, nutritional components, flavour and microorganisms. Especially, non-destructively monitoring technologies are introduced and discussed, including near-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and computer vision system, which are applied to detect and predict the quality of aquatic products. A comprehensive review of recent advances in the research of the drying process of aquatic products is presented, and some perspectives are made for future research.</p>","author":"Junpeng Zeng, \nYu Song, \nPeixu Cong, \nYunrui Cao, \nJie Xu, \nChanghu Xue","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"06d11e9c4b370e8ccabc6d770c4b0a886b3b8706baf49b630e627a6cd13dab7d","category":"Environment"}
