{"title":"Incidence trends of gastric cancer in the United States over 2000–2020: A population-based analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310040","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Armin Aslani, Amirali Soheili, Seyed Ehsan Mousavi, Ali Ebrahimi, Ryan Michael Antar, Zahra Yekta, Seyed Aria Nejadghaderi</p>\r\nBackground <p>Gastric cancer ranks among the top cancers in terms of both occurrence and death rates in the United States (US). Our objective was to provide the incidence trends of gastric cancer in the US from 2000 to 2020 by age, sex, histology, and race/ethnicity, and to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Methods <p>We obtained data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 22 program. The morphologies of gastric cancer were classified as adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, signet ring cell carcinoma, and carcinoid tumor. We used average annual percent change (AAPC) and compared pairs using parallelism and coincidence. The numbers were displayed as both counts and age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100000 individuals, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p> Results <p>Over 2000–2019, most gastric cancers were among those aged ≥55 years (81.82%), men (60.37%), and Non-Hispanic Whites (62.60%). By histology, adenocarcinoma had the highest incident cases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a remarkable decline in ASIRs of gastric cancer in both sexes and all races (AAPC: -8.92; 95% CI: -11.18 to -6.67). The overall incidence trends of gastric cancer were not parallel, nor identical.</p> Conclusions <p>The incidence of gastric cancer shows notable variations by age, race, and sex, with a rising trend across ethnicities. While the overall incidence has declined, a noteworthy increase has been observed among younger adults, particularly young Hispanic women; however, rates decreased significantly in 2020.</p>","author":"Armin Aslani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8d408cd5c447e3b37d89acced041f01dceb973ba926e4e459228abbfda86dfcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
