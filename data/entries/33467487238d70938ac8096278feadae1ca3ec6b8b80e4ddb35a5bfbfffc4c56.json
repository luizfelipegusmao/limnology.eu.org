The specific impacts of N input on soil organic matter (SOM) pools differing in microbial availability remain debatable. For the first time, we used a much-improved approach by effectively combining the <sup>13</sup>C natural abundance in SOM with 21 years of C<sub>3</sub>–C<sub>4</sub> vegetation conversion and long-term incubation. This allows to distinguish the impact of N input on SOM pools with various turnover times. We found that N input reduced the mineralization of all SOM pools, with labile pools having greater sensitivity to N than stable ones. The suppression in SOM mineralization was notably higher in the very labile pool (18%–52%) than the labile and stable (11%–47%) and the very stable pool (3%–21%) compared to that in the unfertilized control soil. The very labile C pool made a strong contribution (up to 60%) to total CO<sub>2</sub> release and also contributed to 74%–96% of suppressed CO<sub>2</sub> with N input. This suppression of SOM mineralization by N was initially attributed to the decreased microbial biomass and soil functions. Over the long-term, the shift in bacterial community toward <i>Proteobacteria</i> and reduction in functional genes for labile C degradation were the primary drivers. In conclusion, the higher the availability of the SOM pools, the stronger the suppression of their mineralization by N input. Labile SOM pools are highly sensitive to N availability and may hold a greater potential for C sequestration under N input at global scale.</p>","author":"Huadong Zang, \nImran Mehmood, \nYakov Kuzyakov, \nRong Jia, \nHeng Gui, \nEvgenia Blagodatskaya, \nXingliang Xu, \nPete Smith, \nHaiqing Chen, \nZhaohai Zeng, \nMingsheng Fan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"33467487238d70938ac8096278feadae1ca3ec6b8b80e4ddb35a5bfbfffc4c56","category":"Environment"}
