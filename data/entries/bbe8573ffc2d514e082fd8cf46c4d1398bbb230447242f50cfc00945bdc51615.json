{"title":"Physical Activity and Oxidative Stress in Aging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0293/v1","date":1712137702000,"content":"The biological aging, characterized by changing in metabolism and physicochemical properties of cells, has an impact on public health. Environment and lifestyle including factors like diet and physical activity seems to play a key role in healthy ageing. Several studies have shown that regular physical activity can enhance antioxidant defence mechanisms, including the activity of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. However, intense or prolonged exercise can also lead to an increase in ROS production temporarily, re-sulting in oxidative stress. This phenomenon is referred as \"exercise-induced oxidative stress\". The relationship between physical activity and oxidative stress in aging is complex and depends on various factors such as the type, intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise, as well as in-dividual differences in antioxidant capacity and adaptation to exercise. In this review, we ana-lyzed what is reported from several authors regarding the role of physical activity on oxidative stress in aging process as well as the role of hormesis and physical exercise as tools for preven-tion and treatment of sarcopenia, an aging related disease. Finally we reported what has recently been studied in relation to the effect of physical activity and sport on aging in women","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbe8573ffc2d514e082fd8cf46c4d1398bbb230447242f50cfc00945bdc51615","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
