To answer this question, we analyzed aggregated yearly data on PhD graduates and tenure-track/tenured faculty members across all engineering disciplines from 2006 to 2021, obtained from the American Society of Engineering Education. The average likelihood for securing a tenure-track faculty position for engineering overall during this 16-year period was 12.4% (range = 10.9â€“18.5%), implying that roughly 1 in 8 PhD graduates attain such positions. After a significant decline from 18.5 to 10.9% between 2006 and 2014 (<span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.62; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), a trend consistent with a period of rising competition, the outlook has since stabilized between 11.3 and 12% (<span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.04; <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Given that most engineering PhD graduates will never secure a tenure-track faculty position, emphasizing alternative career tracks during doctoral training could align expectations better with reality.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"4f14a66d38278936a08dcc7538a38db8b9a75f80fcfd240d81a63c0043ffd7b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
