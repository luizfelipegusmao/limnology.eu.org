{"title":"Evaluation of the Potential of Urinary Volatilomic Patterns of COVID-19 Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 for Disease Diagnosis. An Exploratory Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0355/v1","date":1712211030000,"content":"To assess if SARS-CoV-2 infection induces changes in the urinary volatilomic fingerprint able to be used in the non-invasive COVID-19 diagnosis and management, urine samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (62), recovered COVID-19 patients (30), and non-infected individuals (41) were analysed using solid-phase microextraction technique in headspace mode, combined with gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). In total, 101 volatile organic metabolites (VOMs) from 13 chemical families were identified, being terpenes, phenolic compounds, norisoprenoids, and ketones the most represented groups. Overall, a decrease in the levels of terpenes and phenolic compounds was observed in the control group, whereas norisoprenoids and ketones showed a significant increase. In turn, a remarkable increase was noticed in norisoprenoids and ketones and a milder increase in alcohols, furanic, and sulfur compounds in the recovery group than in the COVID-19 group. Multivariate statistical analysis identified sets of VOMs with the potential to constitute volatile signatures for COVID-19 development and progression. These signatures are composed of D-carvone, 3-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)aniline (MTA), 1,1,6-trimethyl-dihydronaphthalene (TDN), 2-heptanone, and 2,5,5,8a-tetramethyl-1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8-octahydro-1-naphthalenyl ester acetate (TONEA) for COVID-19 infection and nonanoic acid, α-terpinene, β-damascenone, α-isophorone, and trans-furan linalool for patients recovering from the disease. This study provides evidence that changes in the urinary volatilomic profile triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection constitute a promising and valuable screening and/or diagnostic and management tool for COVID-19 in clinical environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8582fa7403c28edc284c53a0989f420e5a88520c90380797e63825dc25fd69f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
