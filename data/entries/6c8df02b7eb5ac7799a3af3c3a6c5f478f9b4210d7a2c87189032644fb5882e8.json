{"title":"The fruit quality and nutrient content of kiwifruit produced by organic versus chemical fertilizers","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13511?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Currently, organic farming has become a feasible approach for the production of high-quality fruits. To evaluate the response of fruit quality and mineral nutrition contents of Hayward Kiwifruit affected by different organic and inorganic fertilizers, the present study was conducted in Citrus and Subtropical Fruits Research Center, Iran, in 2017–2021, as a randomized block design with three replications. The studied treatments were organic fertilizers (cow, vermicompost and Azolla) and chemical fertilizers. After 4 years of fertilization, the fruit's nutritional elements content and some fruit bioactive compounds were evaluated after 3 months of cold storage and then analyzed by the principal component analysis (PCA) method.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The use of organic amendments boosted the calcium, phosphorus, potassium and iron content of the kiwifruits compared to chemical fertilizers. The highest fruit potassium and phosphorus content were recorded in the cow manure treatment. The lowest amount of nitrate and the highest calcium, zinc, copper and manganese accumulation were recorded in the fruits treated with vermicompost. In addition to mineral nutrients, the dry matter, total soluble solids, total phenolic and antioxidant capacity of kiwifruit were improved by the application of vermicompost amendment compared to the other fertilizer sources. However, the highest fruit vitamin C and total soluble carbohydrates were measured in the cow manure treatment. The PCA results of the fruit quality indices indicated that fertilization treatments were ranked as vermicompost (1.88) &gt; cow manure (1.63) = chemical (1.60) &gt; Azolla (1.54).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>It is concluded that the application of 40 kg of vermicompost or 40 kg of cow manure in the next rank in Hayward kiwifruit orchards in March (growth stage beginning of bud swelling) may be a more suitable approach for improving the nutritional quality of the fruit. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tahereh Raiesi, \nMohammad Ali Shiri, \nSeyed Majid Mousavi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6c8df02b7eb5ac7799a3af3c3a6c5f478f9b4210d7a2c87189032644fb5882e8","category":"Environment"}
