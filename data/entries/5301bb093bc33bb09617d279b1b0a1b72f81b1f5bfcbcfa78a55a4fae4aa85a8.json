{"title":"Effect of Sleep Duration on Autonomic Nervous System Regulation in Patients with Plausible Alzheimer: A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1233/v1","date":1710941432000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep duration, dementia severity, age, and ANS regulation. This cross-sectional pilot study included 27 older patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease, hospitalized at a psychiatric center. We measured heart rate variability to assess ANS regulation at night, evaluated dementia severity using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and obtained sleep duration data from sleep diaries maintained by psychiatric nurses. The data were analyzed using repeated-measures generalized linear models with age, sex, dementia severity, and medication (antipsychotics) as covariates. A sleep duration of 7–8 h per night was associated with better ANS regulation than other sleep durations, as indicated by sympathovagal balance (p = 0.005). ANS dysregulation was characterized by a 20.7% increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and a 14.8% decrease in parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) activity. We found a significant correlation between dementia severity and PSNS activity (p = 0.04) and observed an inverted U-shaped association between sleep duration and ANS regulation. This pilot study demonstrated that a sleep duration of 7–8 h per night may be critical in maintaining optimal ANS regulation. Bidirectional associations between sleep duration, inadequate sleep duration, aging, and ANS regulation warrant further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5301bb093bc33bb09617d279b1b0a1b72f81b1f5bfcbcfa78a55a4fae4aa85a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
