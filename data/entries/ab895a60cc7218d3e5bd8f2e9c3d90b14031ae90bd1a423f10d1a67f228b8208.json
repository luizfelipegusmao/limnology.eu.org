{"title":"MEGF11 Activates RAD52‐Dependent ALT through the NELL2‐PAX7 Transcriptional Cascade during Malignant Transformation of MPNSTs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1142/v1","date":1728979990000,"content":"Backgroud\nIn eukaryotes with a double-stranded linear DNA genome, the loss of terminal DNA during replication is inevitable due to an end-replication problem and telomeres serve as a buffer against DNA loss. Cumulative telomere attrition leads to replicative senescence and the Hayflick limit. Thus, activation of the telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) is a prerequisite for malignant transformation. We show that extracellular, but not intracellular, signals activate RAD52-dependent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) during malignant transformation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). \nMethods\nWe compared neurofibroma (NF, benign) and MPNST occurring in the same patient with type-1 neurofibromatosis, where each NF-MPNST pair shares the same genetic background and differentiation lineage minimizing genetic bias and contrasts only changes related to malignant transformation. \nResults\nWe found that the MEGF11 and the MEGF11-dependent ephrin signaling pathways (EFNA5-EPHPA6-PDZD9/PARD6B) activate the NELL2-PAX7 transcriptional cascade, which sequentially activates RAD52, the recombinase of RAD52-dependent ALT, resulting in telomere elongation, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In contrast, H2AFX, a DNA damage marker and intracellular signal, activates RAD51-dependent ALT to determine the MPNST grade. \nConclusions\nWe demonstrated the extracellular signals that activate RAD52-dependent ALT and distinguished the biological and clinical manifestations of RAD51 and RAD52-dependent ALT during malignant transformation of MPNSTs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab895a60cc7218d3e5bd8f2e9c3d90b14031ae90bd1a423f10d1a67f228b8208","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
