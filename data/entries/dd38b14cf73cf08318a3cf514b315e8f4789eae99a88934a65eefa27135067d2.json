{"title":"Expression of GLOD4 Gene in the Testis of Qianbei Ma Goats and Its Effect on Testicular Leydig Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1602/v1","date":1719209756000,"content":"The objective of this paper was to study the expression pattern of the GLOD4 gene in the testis and its regulatory effect on testicular cells. Currently, the regulated mechanism through are unclear. Here, we explored how GLOD4 functions in goat leydig cells to enhance our understanding of spermatogenesis and improve reproduction in breeding rams. In this study, we demonstrated that the localization of GLOD4 in testicular cells using immunohistochemistry and subcellular localization analyses. Subsequently, we analyzed the GLOD4 expression pattern in 4 age-based groups (0, 6, 12, and 18 months old) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR) and protein blotting. Finally, we performed GLOD4 gene silencing and overexpression studies in testicular cells from goats and explored the effects of GLOD4 on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, steroid hormone secretion and the expression of candidate testosterone hormone-regulated genes. GLOD4 was mainly expressed in testicular leydig cells, and the subcellular localization results showed that the GLOD4 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Silencing of GLOD4 significantly suppressed the mRNA expression levels of the testosterone secretion-related genes CYP11A1, 3β-HSD and CYP17A1 and the mRNA expression levels of cell-cycle related genes CDK6, PCNA, and Cyclin E. Moreover, the cell cycle was blocked at the G2/M phase after GLOD4 silencing, which significantly suppressed testosterone secretion. In contrast, GLOD4 overexpression significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of the testosterone secretion-related genes CYP11A1, 3β-HSD, and CYP17A1 and increased the expression of the cell-cycle related genes CDK6, PCNA, and Cyclin E. Moreover, GLOD4 overexpression promoted the cell cycle from G0/G1 phases to enter the S phase and G2/M phases,promoted the secretion of testosterone. Taken together, our experimental results indicate that GLOD4 may affect the development of cells in Qianbei Ma goats of different ages by influencing the cell cycle, Proliferation and testosterone hormone synthesis. These findings enhance our understanding of the functions of GLOD4 in the cells of goats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd38b14cf73cf08318a3cf514b315e8f4789eae99a88934a65eefa27135067d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
