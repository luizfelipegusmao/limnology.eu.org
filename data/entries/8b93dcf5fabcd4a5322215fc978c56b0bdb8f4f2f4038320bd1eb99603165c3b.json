{"title":"The Nexus of Global Risks and Higher Education&mdash; A Transdisciplinary Master&rsquo;s Programme for a Technical University","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1257/v1","date":1724044429000,"content":"The issue of climate change represents a significant global risk that demands immediate attention. However, higher education frequently fails to incorporate global perspectives and intricate transdisciplinary matters. In order to integrate global and transdisciplinary aspects into the curriculum of a technical university with a focus on computer science, a Master's programme has been developed. The programme's objective is to situate global risk at the core of the curriculum, thereby encouraging scientists to work beyond the boundaries of their respective disciplines. The paper considers the challenges that science and higher education must address to facilitate pathways towards a peaceful and sustainable future. It argues for a shift in focus from short-term and localised issues to a more holistic approach, emphasising the importance of considering universal problems. The curriculum, as developed, may be regarded as a guide for future university efforts in the fields of global risk and climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b93dcf5fabcd4a5322215fc978c56b0bdb8f4f2f4038320bd1eb99603165c3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
