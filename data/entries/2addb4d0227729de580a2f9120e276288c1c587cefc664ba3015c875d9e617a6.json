{"title":"Bacterial Community Structure Modulates Soil Phosphorus Turnover at Early Stages of Primary Succession","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GB008174?af=R","date":1728300838000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Microbes are the drivers of soil phosphorus (P) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems; however, the role of soil microbes in mediating P cycling in P-rich soils during primary succession remains uncertain. This study examined the impacts of bacterial community structure (diversity and composition) and its functional potential (absolute abundances of P-cycling functional genes) on soil P cycling along a 130-year glacial chronosequence on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Bacterial community structure was a better predictor of soil P fractions than P-cycling genes along the chronosequence. After glacier retreat, the solubilization of inorganic P and the mineralization of organic P were significantly enhanced by increased bacterial diversity, changed interspecific interactions, and abundant species involved in soil P mineralization, thereby increasing P availability. Although 84% of P-cycling genes were associated with organic P mineralization, these genes were more closely associated with soil organic carbon than with organic P. Bacterial carbon demand probably determined soil P turnover, indicating the dominant role of organic matter decomposition processes in P-rich alpine soils. Moreover, the significant decrease in the complexity of the bacterial co-occurrence network and the taxa-gene-P network at the later stage indicates a declining dominance of the bacterial community in driving soil P cycling with succession. Our results reveal that bacteria with a complex community structure have a prominent potential for biogeochemical P cycling in P-rich soils during the early stages of primary succession.</p>","author":"Yuhan Wang, \nHaijian Bing, \nDaryl L.
