{"title":"Site Feasibility Study for Deployment of Offshore Seaweed Aquaculture Prototype System in Open Sea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1979/v1","date":1716992623000,"content":"Metocean data of a certain region can assist in determining the design criteria of offshore or nearshore infrastructures which can prevent structural failure and even overdesigning. The common method of using met ocean data to forecast the wave and climatic conditions of a coastal region is by utilizing the hindcast approach. In collaboration with a project that plans to design a nearshore structure for seaweed cultivation, this study focuses on the collection and analysis of met ocean data of potential sites in Malaysia to prevent under-designing and over-designing of the structure. The study and analysis of met ocean data are essential in predicting future environmental conditions. The study investigates the met ocean environment for the spatial design and monitoring of a seaweed aquaculture farm at the following potential sites; Western Coast near Langsuir Cave, Pulau Langkawi, Eastern Coast near Bachok, Kelantan, Eastern Coast near Setiu Wetland or River, Terengganu, Western Coast near Bidong Island, Terengganu.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57853d3e109df9d2b61a27123ba101cd5154adf14ada49bebd4ddf8cfd2ca1b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
