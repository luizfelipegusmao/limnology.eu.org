{"title":"Local and Nonlocal Biophysical Effects of Historical Land Use and Land Cover Changes in CMIP6 Models and the Intermodel Uncertainty","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004220?af=R","date":1718362165000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) can influence surface temperature through local and nonlocal biophysical processes, which remain inadequately addressed. In this study, we separate the local and nonlocal effects of historical (1850–2014) LULCCs based on model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. We also attempt to explore the sources of intermodel differences in the effects of LULCCs. The multimodel mean shows a cooling effect of −0.05°C (with an intermodel range of −0.24–0.06°C) at the global scale due to cropland and pastureland expansion, consisting of dominant nonlocal cooling of −0.06°C (with an intermodel range of −0.26–0.06°C) and slight local warming of 0.01°C (with an intermodel range of −0.01–0.05°C). The modeling results show some clear consistency in the effects of LULCCs despite considerable intermodel uncertainties. The local effects cause warming at low latitudes and cooling in boreal regions via changes in upward shortwave radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes. The nonlocal effects mainly cause cooling via decreases in downward longwave radiation and increases in upward shortwave radiation. Intermodel differences in the total effects are dominated by those in the nonlocal effects, which are further attributed to divergent changes in downward longwave radiation and sensible heat flux across the models. This study highlights the importance of the nonlocal effects of LULCCs in terms of strength and intermodel uncertainty, with implications for designing land-based solutions aimed at climate change mitigation.</p>","author":"Xing Luo, \nJun Ge, \nYipeng Cao, \nYu Liu, \nLimei Yang, \nShiyao Wang, \nWeidong Guo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"32fc126532ac5774c0ebeaa417f79757a9fc5108a83205cfdcb75d924f6b86f9","category":"Environment"}
