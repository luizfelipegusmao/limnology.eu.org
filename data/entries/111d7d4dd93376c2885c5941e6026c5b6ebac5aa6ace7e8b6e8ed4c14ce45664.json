{"title":"A review of the use of rice husk silica as a sustainable alternative to traditional silica sources in various applications","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14451?af=R","date":1724310266000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Rice husk silica (RHS) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to traditional sources of silica in various applications, offering eco-friendly attributes, cost-effectiveness, and versatility. This review explores the potential of RHS as a substitute for conventional silica sources, highlighting its alignment with sustainable development objectives and its appeal to industries seeking environmental responsibility. Among the extraction methods, acid leaching is identified as yielding higher purity silica. In contrast, among the novel techniques, the hydrothermobaric process stands out for producing high purity and yielding nanosilica. Despite challenges like limited access to high-quality rice husks and variations in silica content, RHS extraction methods show promising avenues for sustainable silica production, addressing waste management, and environmental concerns. Further development and optimization of extraction techniques are essential for widespread acceptance, with future research focusing on nanoparticle synthesis and incorporating green chemistry principles. This comprehensive review of RHS provides a valuable resource for researchers seeking to explore sustainable alternatives in their respective fields, aiming to foster adopting more sustainable practices and materials across various industries.</p>","author":"Mustapha Abdullateef Taiye, \nWahia Hafida, \nFangong Kong, \nCunshan Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"111d7d4dd93376c2885c5941e6026c5b6ebac5aa6ace7e8b6e8ed4c14ce45664","category":"Environment"}
