{"title":"Five Steps to Understand the Mental State: A Contribution from the Economics of Emotions to the Theory of Mind","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0741/v1","date":1710326273000,"content":"In recent years, the economics of emotions (EoE) field, which aims to create models of the human mind, has grown quickly. EoE models work well with simulation theory (ST), which is one of the main theories of mind. EoE models show how people's behavior and emotions change based on their knowledge and perception of others. It is hoped that by developing this model, it will be possible to quantitatively analyze not only the mental states of real others, but also the subtleties of the minds of characters in novels in the future. Until now, the decision-making or the factual-reasoning mechanisms have been a black box in ST. This study analyzes how EoE models add to the understanding of ST.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ebe0bb074e5de94c30b6201952c5c78a9ac353bcc84281f5248cc811a4f08539","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
