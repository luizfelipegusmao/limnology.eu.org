{"title":"Metrics used in quality improvement publications addressing environmental sustainability in healthcare: A scoping review protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309417","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Colin Sue-Chue-Lam, Sezgi Yanikomeroglu, Doulia Hamad, Brian Wong, Karen Born</p>\r\n\r\nQuality improvement approaches are increasingly being used to address the problem of healthcareâ€™s climate and ecological impact. While sustainability is increasingly recognized as a domain of quality, consensus is lacking on the most appropriate measures and metrics for those looking to reduce ecological impacts through quality improvement initiatives. We propose a scoping review to summarize approaches for selecting and quantifying ecological impacts in the published quality improvement literature. We will search multiple electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus) from 2000 onwards, to identify published quality improvement initiatives in the human healthcare setting intended to address ecological impact with at least one quantitative measure of ecological impact, such as kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas. Two independent reviewers working in parallel will screen studies for inclusion and abstract study data, including publication, study, and ecological impact characteristics. Charted data will be synthesized narratively as well as with descriptive tables, figures, and summary statistics. In doing so, we will map areas of relative focus as well as gaps in the measurement of ecological impact across quality improvement initiatives. This map can in turn be used to raise awareness of ecological impacts requiring broader consideration, encouraging holistic and clinically relevant approaches to measuring ecological impact in future quality improvement work.","author":"Colin Sue-Chue-Lam","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"488b049285fe2fae27632d96a76430ca1da7aee84936f16eb4daffc04ae18a9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
