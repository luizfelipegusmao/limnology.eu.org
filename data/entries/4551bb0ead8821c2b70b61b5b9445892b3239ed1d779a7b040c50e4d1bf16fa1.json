{"title":"Towards Atomic Imaging and Spectroscopy of Er defects in ZnO","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.775/7719910?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Defects in crystals play a crucial role in determining the physical, chemical and electrical properties of materials. Among these, point defects have been recognized as one of the most promising platforms for quantum network applications and quantum sensing [<a href=\"#ozae044.775-B1\">1</a>]. Rare earth ions (REIs) have emerged as a potential platform for these applications given their long optical and spin coherence time [<a href=\"#ozae044.775-B2\">2</a>]. Within REIs, Erbium (Er) shows great potential for quantum and optoelectronic devices such as solar cells due to its unique shell transitions that can produce photoemission and a capability of up-converting infrared to visible light [<a href=\"#ozae044.775-B3\">3</a>]. Numerous materials have been considered as hosts for Er, and in recent years ZnO has become one of the most attractive semiconductor candidates due to its wide direct bandgap of 3.4 eV. It is also a rare material system in which parts-per-billion impurity concentrations can be grown almost nuclear spin free using isotopically pure Zn [<a href=\"#ozae044.775-B4\">4</a>]. ZnO can naturally host few extrinsic defects, but it is more challenging to host REIs due to a mismatch in the atomic size [<a href=\"#ozae044.775-B5\">5</a>]. Therefore, it is evident that a successful doping of REIs in ZnO devices and their processes requires a wide understanding over the formed defects in its structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4551bb0ead8821c2b70b61b5b9445892b3239ed1d779a7b040c50e4d1bf16fa1","category":"Environment"}
