{"title":"Posterior Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy: An Anatomical Essay and Surgical Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0057/v1","date":1727776732000,"content":"Posterior retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (PRLA) has emerged as a revolutionary minimally invasive technique for adrenal gland surgery, offering significant advantages over traditional open approaches. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive update on PRLA, focusing on its anatomical foundations, surgical technique, and clinical implications. We conducted an extensive review of the current literature and surgical practices to elucidate the key aspects of PRLA. The procedure leverages a unique \"backdoor\" approach, accessing the adrenal glands through the retroperitoneum, which necessitates a thorough understanding of posterior abdominal wall and retroperitoneal anatomy. Proper patient selection, meticulous surgical planning, and adherence to key technical principles are paramount for successful outcomes. The surgical technique is described step-by-step, emphasizing critical aspects such as patient positioning, trocar placement, and adrenal dissection. PRLA demonstrates reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times compared to open surgery, while maintaining comparable oncological outcomes for appropriately selected cases. However, the technique presents unique challenges, including a confined working space and the need for surgeons to adapt to a posterior anatomical perspective. We conclude that PRLA, in the right clinical setting, offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional adrenalectomy approaches. Future research should focus on expanding indications and refining techniques to further improve patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fd93f49d61f912eed432bb05b65523a709b9fc8245b37a44cc1dc2dc4bd84c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
