{"title":"Considering Multiple Parameters beyond BMI Alone Provides a Better Understanding of Cardiometabolic Risks Associated with Severe Obesity in Children","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1466/v1","date":1724153443000,"content":"Background: The increasing prevalence of severe obesity among children and adolescents poses\na significant challenge for pediatricians and general practitioners. This study aimed to investigate\nthe relationships between biochemical results, anthropometry, blood pressure measurements and\nbioimpedance analysis (BIA)-derived parameters, to identify potential cardiometabolic\ncomplications associated with severe obesity. Methods: The study included 347 children (162\nboys, 185 girls) aged 0-19 years, meeting criteria for severe obesity based on BMI thresholds for\ndifferent age groups. Patients were recruited in four pediatric endocrinology centers in Poland\n(Zabrze, Cracow, Rzeszow, Szczecin). Each participant underwent anthropometric\nmeasurements, pubertal stage assessment, blood pressure measurement, biochemical and\nhormonal tests and BIA. Results: BMI showed significant associations with fat mass percentage\n(FM%) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), but not waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). The relationship\nbetween BMI and FM% was stronger in girls and prepubertal children. Metabolic syndrome (MetS)\nZ-score showed a strong positive correlation with BMI in pubertal children. Negative correlation\nbetween HDL and triglycerides was observed only in boys. Prepubertal children exhibited more\nsignificant correlations despite a smaller sample size and shorter duration of obesity.\nConclusions: Considering multiple parameters beyond BMI alone provides a better\nunderstanding of cardiometabolic risks associated with severe obesity in children. MetS Z-score\nwas not a reliable indicator of increased cardiometabolic risk in younger children. Early-onset\nsevere obesity was associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications. Early intervention is\ncrucial to mitigate metabolic complications in this population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d0b9119716448e2c2ca785167e39c233a066ce0ee6e2094186acf7f050de57e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
