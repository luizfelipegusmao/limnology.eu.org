{"title":"Genome Sequencing Reveals the Potential of Enterobacter sp. strain UNJFSC003 for Hydrocarbon Bioremediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0926/v1","date":1726130955000,"content":"The bioremediation induced by bacteria offers a promising alternative for the contamination of aromatic hydrocarbons, due to their metabolic processes suitable for the removal of these pollutants, as many of them are carcinogenic molecules and dangerous to human health. Our research focused on isolating a bacterium from the rhizosphere of the tara tree with the ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, using draft genomic sequencing and computational analysis. Enterobacter sp. strain UNJFSC 003 possesses 4,460 protein‚Äêcoding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 77 tRNA genes, and a GC content of 54.38%. A taxonomic analysis of our strain revealed that it has an average nucleotide identity of 87.8% &lt;95%, indicating that it is a new endemic enterobacterium. Additionally, pangenomic analysis with 15 strains demonstrated that our strain has a phylogenetic relationship with strain FDAARGOS 1428 (E. cancerogenus), with a total of 381 core genes and 4,778 accessory genes. Orthologous methods predicted that strain UNJFSC 003 possesses genes with potential for use in hydrocarbon bioremediation. Genes were predicted in the subpathways for the degradation of homoprotocatechuate and phenylacetate, primarily located in the cytoplasm. Studies conducted through molecular modeling and docking revealed the affinity of the predicted proteins in the degradation of benzo[a]pyrene in the homoprotocatechuate subpathway, specifically hpcB, which has enzymatic activity as a dioxygenase, and hpcC, which functions as an aldehyde dehydrogenase. This study provides information on native strains from the Lomas de Lachay with capabilities for the bioremediation of aromatic hydrocarbons and other compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a82f371609a8db78277c9517ad01e2e08618f4e3d92ef1e69d384d4d91721a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
