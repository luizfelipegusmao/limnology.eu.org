{"title":"Determinants of Innovation in Work Teams: A Viewpoint from the Public Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0231/v1","date":1714973389000,"content":"The study of innovation in the public sector has attracted increasing interest in the last decade. Contributions of the literature concerning its possible innovation drivers and inhibitors have primarily had a theoretical or documentary perspective; empirical studies are scarce, as are work-team studies in organizations of this sector. The present study therefore focuses on identifying and understanding those variables or factors that induce or inhibit innovative activity in work teams in public organizations in a developing country. The research focus is qualitative, and 16 directors of 13 public Costa Rican institutions were interviewed for the study. A set of coding methods allowed to identify 19 thematic categories of variables linked to the capacity to generate innovations in these work teams.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e89a535330f3c465ccff457887721e04aefae7eca9a98042eaea554183c3dd61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
