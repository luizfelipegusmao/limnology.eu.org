{"title":"22 Effects of trace mineral source and chromium propionate supplementation on rumen fermentation, growth performance, and carcass characteristics in finishing beef steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/71/7757143?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Crossbred beef steers [n = 400; body weight (BW) = 370 Â± 8 kg] were used to evaluate the effects of trace mineral (TM) source and chromium propionate (Cr) on rumen fermentation characteristics, plasma glucose and mineral concentrations, performance, and carcass characteristics in feedlot steers fed a steam-flaked corn-based finishing diet. Steers were blocked by initial BW and randomly assigned within block to 1 of 4 treatments (10 steers/pen) with 10 pens per treatment. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors included: 1) TM source [sulfate or hydroxychloride (IntelliBond] Cu, Mn, and Zn TM supplemented at 18, 40, and 90 mg/kg DM, respectively) and 2) with or without supplemental Cr (KemTRACE) at 0.0 or 0.25 mg/kg DM. Steers were individually weighed on d -1 and 0 and every 28 d throughout the experiment. Jugular blood samples and rumen contents were collected from 10 steers per treatment on d 28 and 84 of the experiment for plasma glucose and TM concentration and volatile fatty acid analysis, respectively. On d 154 of the experiment, steers were harvested at a commercial abattoir and carcass data was collected. Data were analyzed on a pen mean basis for a randomized complete block design using PROC MIXED of SAS. There was no TM source by Cr supplementation interactions for any of the response variables measured, therefore only main effects are reported. Overall ADG (<span>P</span> = 0.03) and gain:feed (<span>P</span> = 0.02) were greater in steers receiving supplemental Cr when compared with steers not supplemented with Cr. Hot carcass weight (<span>P</span> = 0.04), dressing percentage (<span>P</span> = 0.01), longissimus muscle area (<span>P</span> = 0.03), and USDA yield grades (<span>P</span> = 0.04) were greater in steers receiving hydroxychloride TM compared with steers receiving sulfate TM. Steers supplemented with Cr had a greater dressing percentage (<span>P</span> = 0.01) and longissimus muscle area (<span>P</span> = 0.04) compared with steers not supplemented with Cr. On d 28 of the experiment, ruminal acetate concentrations were lesser (<span>P</span> = 0.01) and ruminal propionate concentrations tended to be greater (<span>P</span> = 0.12) in steers receiving hydroxychloride TM compared with steers receiving sulfate TM. Steers supplemented with Cr had greater ruminal acetate concentrations (<span>P</span> = 0.04) and plasma glucose concentrations (<span>P</span> = 0.05) on d 28 of the experiment when compared with non-supplemented controls. These data indicate the Cr supplementation and TM source can influence feedlot steer performance, carcass characteristics, and rumen fermentation characteristics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dbd7fb17dcac453b3214dd3b1f6540b6f496d5fa3217040ef4d728b527fcf01c","category":"Environment"}
