A set of 15 international standard SSR markers was assumed as universal cacao genotyping system. Recently, different SNPs and SNP genotyping techniques have been exploited in cacao. However, a consensus on which to use has not been reached yet, driving the search for new approaches. To validate a new ddRADseq protocol for cacao genotyping, we compared the performances for population analysis of a dataset with 7,880 SNPs obtained from ddRADseq and the genotypic data from the aforementioned SSR set, using 158 cacao plants from productive farms and gene bank. Four genetic groups were identified with STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE softwares using SSR and SNP data, respectively. Similarities of cacao ancestries among these groups allowed the identification of analogous pairs of groups of individuals, referred to as: G1<sub>SSR</sub>/G1<sub>SNP</sub>, G2<sub>SSR</sub>/G2<sub>SNP</sub>, G3<sub>SSR</sub>/G3<sub>SNP</sub>, G4<sub>SSR</sub>/G4<sub>SNP</sub>, whether SSRs or SNPs were used. Both marker systems identified Amelonado and Criollo as the most abundant cacao ancestries among all samples. Genetic distance matrices from both data types were significantly similar to each other according to Mantel test (p &lt; 0.0001). PCoA and UPGMA clustering mostly confirmed the identified genetic groups. AMOVA and F<sub>ST</sub> pairwise comparison revealed a moderate to very large genetic differentiation among identified groups from SSR and SNP data. Genetic diversity parameters from SSR (H<sub>obs</sub> = 0.616, H<sub>exp</sub> = 0.524 and PIC = 0.544) were higher than that from SNP data (0.288, 0.264, 0.230). In both cases, genetic groups carrying the highest Amelonado proportion (G1<sub>SSR</sub> and G1<sub>SNP</sub>) had the lowest genetic diversity parameters among the identified groups. The high congruence among population analysis results using both systems validated the ddRADseq protocol employed for cacao SNP genotyping. These results could provide new ways for developing a universal SNP-based genotyping system very much needed for cacao genetic studies.","author":"Angel Rafael Ramirez-Ramirez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"172b73a58f0d5beb27b2a6d26e8e0534bfbe2e751bc0d32ac1751c3d385787c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
