{"title":"Dynamic Output Feedback of Second-Order Systems: An Observer-Based Controller with LMI Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0526/v1","date":1715238128000,"content":"This paper presents an observer-based dynamic output feedback controller design procedure using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) optimization for second-order systems with uncertainty and persistent perturbation in the states. Using linear-quadratic criteria, cost functions are minimized in a two-stage procedure to compute optimal state feedback gains, and observer gains are coupled into a dynamic output feedback optimal controller. The LMI set used in the two stages is matrix inversion-free, a key issue for polytope formulation when uncertainty is present. The approach is tested in a mobile inverted pendulum robotic platform, and the effectiveness is verified in this underactuated and undesensed case.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca769415e28e4ebfd38ec1a968eabaa6dbf6262c5f1456cd417538a46ff26d43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
