{"title":"The impact of light and thioredoxins on the plant thiol-disulfide proteome","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1536/7517388?rss=1","date":1705017600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Thiol-based redox regulation is a crucial posttranslational mechanism to acclimate plants to changing light availability. Here, we conducted a biotin switch–based redox proteomics study in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) to systematically investigate dynamics of thiol–redox networks in response to temporal changes in light availability and across genotypes lacking parts of the thioredoxin (Trx) or NADPH-Trx-reductase C (NTRC) systems in the chloroplast. Time-resolved dynamics revealed light led to marked decreases in the oxidation states of many chloroplast proteins with photosynthetic functions during the first 10 min, followed by their partial reoxidation after 2 to 6 h into the photoperiod. This involved <span>f</span>, <span>m</span>, and <span>x</span>-type Trx proteins showing similar light-induced reduction–oxidation dynamics, while NTRC, 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, and Trx <span>y</span>2 showed an opposing pattern, being more oxidized in light than dark. In Arabidopsis <span>trxf1f2</span>, <span>trxm1m2</span>, or <span>ntrc</span> mutants, most proteins showed increased oxidation states in the light compared to wild type, suggesting their light-dependent dynamics were related to NTRC/Trx networks. While NTRC deficiency had a strong influence in all light conditions, deficiencies in <span>f</span>- or <span>m</span>-type Trxs showed differential impacts on the thiol–redox proteome depending on the light environment, being higher in constant or fluctuating light, respectively. The results indicate plant redox proteomes are subject to dynamic changes in reductive and oxidative pathways to cooperatively fine-tune photosynthetic and metabolic processes in the light. The importance of the individual elements of the NTRC/Trx networks mediating these responses depend on the extent of light variability, with NTRC playing a crucial role to balance protein–redox states in rapidly fluctuating light.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f0b38c9d6632a7ec776754034c7d869ba5ac697652cbc33c3ffd0bc90fecc054","category":"Environment"}
