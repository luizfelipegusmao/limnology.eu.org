{"title":"MPK4-mediated phosphorylation of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 controls thermosensing by regulating histone variant H2A.Z deposition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4535/7727726?rss=1","date":1722816000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants can perceive a slight upsurge in ambient temperature and respond by undergoing morphological changes, such as elongated hypocotyls and early flowering. The dynamic functioning of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) in thermomorphogenesis is well established, although the complete regulatory pathway involved in thermosensing remains elusive. We establish that an increase in temperature from 22 to 28 °C induces upregulation and activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 4 (MPK4) in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), subsequently leading to the phosphorylation of PIF4. Phosphorylated PIF4 represses the expression of <span>ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6</span> (<span>ARP6</span>), which is required for mediating the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z at its target loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in <span>ARP6</span> expression in PIF4 phosphor-null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings affect hypocotyl growth at 22 and 28 °C by modulating the regulation of ARP6-mediated H2A.Z deposition at the loci of genes involved in elongating hypocotyl cells. Interestingly, the expression of <span>MPK4</span> is also controlled by H2A.Z deposition in a temperature-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings highlight the regulatory mechanism of thermosensing by which MPK4-mediated phosphorylation of PIF4 affects ARP6-mediated H2A.Z deposition at the genes involved in hypocotyl cell elongation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"36d660ef7b77299510284424f560c0649085ec65e396d638a59502b6be560faa","category":"Environment"}
