{"title":"The surface morphology of Atractylodes macrocephala polysaccharide and its inhibitory effect on PCV2 replication","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13246?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Porcine infection with Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) causes immunosuppression, which is easy to cause concurrent or secondary infection, making the disease complicated and difficult to treat, and causing huge economic losses to the pig industry. Total polysaccharide from the rhizoma of <i>Atractylodes macrocephala</i> Koidz. (PAMK) is outstanding in enhancing non-specific immunity and cellular immunity, and effectively improving the body's disease resistance, indicating its potential role in antiviral immunotherapy.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>PAMK had the characteristics of compact, polyporous and agglomerated morphology, but does not have triple helix conformation. PCV2 infection led to the increase in LC3-II, degradation of p62 and the increase of viral Cap protein expression and viral copy number. PAMK treatment significantly alleviated PCV2-induced autophagy and inhibited PCV2 replication. Moreover, PAMK treatment significantly attenuated the increase of PINK1 protein expression and the decrease of TOMM20 protein expression caused by PCV2 infection, alleviated Parkin recruitment from cytoplasm to mitochondria and intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, restored mitochondrial membrane charge, alleviated viral Cap protein expression.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>PAMK alleviates PCV2-induced mitophagy to suppress PCV2 replication by inhibiting the Pink 1/Parkin pathway. These findings may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of PCV2.
