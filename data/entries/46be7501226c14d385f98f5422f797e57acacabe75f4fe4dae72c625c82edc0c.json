{"title":"Antiproliferative Effect of 7- Ketositosterol in Breast and Liver Cancer Cells: Possible Impact of Ceramide, ERK and NF-kB Signaling Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1884/v1","date":1716902217000,"content":"Background: This study aimed to examine the effect of 7-Ketositosterol (7-KSS), on sphingomyelin/ceramide metabolites and apoptosis in human breast MCF-7 and human liver HepG2 cancer cells. Methods: Anti-proliferative effects of 7-KSS treatment were assessed at different concentrations and periods. Cell viability was assessed through MTT analysis, whereas the levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), sphingomyelins (SMs), and ceramides (CERs) were measured using LC-MS/MS. Phosphorylated 44/42 ERK1/2 and NF-kB p65 (Ser536) protein levels were measured by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining and flow cytometric assessment of annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) labeling. Results: Treatment with 7-KSS significantly decreased cell survival, S1P, p-44/42 ERK1/2, and p-NF-κBp65 protein levels in cancer cells compared to controls. A substantial rise was detected in intracellular amounts of C16-C24 CERs and apoptosis in cancer cells incubated with 7-KSS. Conclusions: 7-KSS stimulated ceramide accumulation and apoptosis while decreasing cell proliferation via downregulating S1P, p-44/42 ERK1/2  and p-NF-κBp65 protein levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46be7501226c14d385f98f5422f797e57acacabe75f4fe4dae72c625c82edc0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
