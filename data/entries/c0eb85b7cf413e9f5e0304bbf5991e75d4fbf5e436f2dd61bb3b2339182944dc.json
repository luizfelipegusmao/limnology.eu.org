{"title":"The sweet tabaiba or there and back again: phylogeographical history of the Macaronesian Euphorbia balsamifera","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/5-6/883/7514051?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Biogeographical relationships between the Canary Islands and north-west Africa are often explained by oceanic dispersal and geographical proximity. Sister-group relationships between Canarian and eastern African/Arabian taxa, the ‘Rand Flora’ pattern, are rare among plants and have been attributed to the extinction of north-western African populations. <span>Euphorbia balsamifera</span> is the only representative species of this pattern that is distributed in the Canary Islands and north-west Africa; it is also one of few species present in all seven islands. Previous studies placed African populations of <span>E. balsamifera</span> as sister to the Canarian populations, but this relationship was based on herbarium samples with highly degraded DNA. Here, we test the extinction hypothesis by sampling new continental populations; we also expand the Canarian sampling to examine the dynamics of island colonization and diversification.<div>Methods</div>Using target enrichment with genome skimming, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships within <span>E. balsamifera</span> and between this species and its disjunct relatives. A single nucleotide polymorphism dataset obtained from the target sequences was used to infer population genetic diversity patterns. We used convolutional neural networks to discriminate among alternative Canary Islands colonization scenarios.<div>Key Results</div>The results confirmed the Rand Flora sister-group relationship between western <span>E. balsamifera</span> and <span>Euphorbia adenensis</span> in the Eritreo-Arabian region and recovered an eastern–western geographical structure among <span>E. balsamifera</span> Canarian populations. Convolutional neural networks supported a scenario of east-to-west island colonization, followed by population extinctions in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura and recolonization from Tenerife and Gran Canaria; a signal of admixture between the eastern island and north-west African populations was recovered.<div>Conclusions</div>Our findings support the Surfing Syngameon Hypothesis for the colonization of the Canary Islands by <span>E. balsamifera</span>, but also a recent back-colonization to the continent. Populations of <span>E. balsamifera</span> from northwest Africa are not the remnants of an ancestral continental stock, but originated from migration events from Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. This is further evidence that oceanic archipelagos are not a sink for biodiversity, but may be a source of new genetic variability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"c0eb85b7cf413e9f5e0304bbf5991e75d4fbf5e436f2dd61bb3b2339182944dc","category":"Environment"}
