{"title":"Polystyrene microplastic‐induced endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to growth plate endochondral ossification disorder in young rat","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24182?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Previous studies on the effects of microplastics (MPs) on bone in early development are limited. This study aimed to investigate the adverse effects of MPs on bone in young rats and the potential mechanism.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Three-week-old female rats were orally administered MPs for 28 days, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor salubrinal (SAL) and ER stress agonist tunicamycin (TM) were added to evaluate the effect of ER stress on toxicity of MPs. The indicators of growth and plasma markers of bone turnover were evaluated. Tibias were analyzed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Histomorphological staining of growth plates was performed, and related gene expression of growth plate chondrocytes was tested.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>After exposure of MPs, the rats had decreased growth, shortened tibial length, and altered blood calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Trabecular bone was sparse according to micro-CT inspection. In the growth plate, the thickness of proliferative zone substantial reduced while the thickness of hypertrophic zone increased significantly, and the chondrocytes were scarce and irregularly arranged according to tibial histological staining. The transcription of the ER stress-related genes <i>BIP</i>, <i>PERK</i>, <i>ATF4</i>, and <i>CHOP</i> dramatically increased, and the transcription factors involved in chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and matrix secretion were aberrant according to RT-qPCR and western blotting. Moreover, the addition of TM showed higher percentage of chondrocyte death. Administration of SAL alleviated all of the MPs-induced symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These results indicated that MPs could induce growth retardation and longitudinal bone damage in early development. The toxicity of MPs may attribute to induced ER stress and impaired essential processes of the endochondral ossification after MPs exposure.</p>","author":"Qingqing Zhang, \nYuanyuan Lang, \nXiaomin Tang, \nWenshu Cheng, \nZugen Cheng, \nMohammad Rizwan, \nLixin Xie, \nYanling Liu, \nHengyi Xu, \nYang Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"b53a1f6a19d2f5e1a8bc233061401b905b5606e3d616cb2d0a69781df1ee0ca1","category":"Environment"}
