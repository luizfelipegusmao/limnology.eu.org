The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between enteric methane emissions, feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), and feed efficiency of implanted and nonimplanted finishing steers. Cattle (n = 62) were housed at the Climate Smart Research pens at Colorado State University and blocked by body weight (BW) into two pens and randomly assigned to treatment. Each pen was equipped with GreenFeed automated head chambers and SmartFeed feed intake measurement (C-Lock, Rapids City, SD). The study was a completely randomized block design. Animals within each block were then randomly assigned a treatment: implanted with Component TE200 (IMP; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) or not implanted (CON). Enteric emissions, dry matter feed intake, BW, and BW gain (ADG) were collected from each individual animal from the light and heavy blocks for 80 and 52 d, respectively. Data were analyzed in JMP Pro with the linear model function and significance was declared a <span>P</span> â‰¤ 0.05. IMP cattle had a greater average ADG (2.40 kg/d vs 1.77 kg/d, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) compared with CON cattle. A difference was observed in total methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions between treatments (200.83 g CH<sub>4</sub>/d IMP and 187.45 g CH<sub>4</sub>/d CON, <span>P</span> = 0.02). Dry matter intake (DMI) was not different between treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.17). Methane emissions intensity for each treatment was 84.89 (IMP) and 106.90 g/kg of ADG (CON) was different (<span>P</span> = 0.0002), while CH<sub>4</sub> yield (CH<sub>4</sub> per kg of DMI) was not different (<span>P</span> = 0.12). Overall feed efficiency between treatments resulted in IMP animals having a greater feed efficiency (4.74 kg DM/kg ADG) compared with CON animals (6.32 kg DM/kg ADG, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). In summary, growth promotants decrease CH<sub>4</sub> emissions intensity in finishing steers and increase animal feed efficiency without affecting daily DMI.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f6a88b96c74a8f43d6b26f2b481f0d7d22db2575278351a00b1ec1c43cc008cb","category":"Environment"}
