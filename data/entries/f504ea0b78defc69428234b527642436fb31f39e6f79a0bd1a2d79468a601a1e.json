{"title":"Flavonoids with lipase inhibitory activity from lemon squeezing waste: isolation, multispectroscopic and in silico studies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13600?af=R","date":1716383769000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Obesity is recognized as a lifestyle-related disease and the main risk factor for a series of pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. <i>Citrus limon</i> is an important medicinal plant, and its fruits are rich in flavonoids investigated for their potential in managing obesity. In the present work, a green extraction applied to lemon squeezing waste (LSW) was optimized to recover pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitors.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The microwave-assisted procedure yielded an extract with higher lipase inhibitory activity than those obtained by maceration and ultrasound. The main compounds present in the extract were identified by high-performance liquid chromatographic–mass spectrometric analysis, and hesperidin, eriocitrin and 4′-methyllucenin II were isolated. The three compounds were evaluated for <i>in vitro</i> PL inhibitory activity, and 4′-methyllucenin II resulted in the most promising inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.1 μmol L<sup>−1</sup>; <i>K</i>\n<sub>i</sub> = 62.2 μmol L<sup>−1</sup>). Multispectroscopic approaches suggested the three flavonoids act as competitive inhibitors and the binding studies indicated a greater interaction between PL and 4′-methyllucenin II. Docking analysis indicated the significant interactions of the three flavonoids with the PL catalytic site.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present work highlights flavonoid glycosides as promising PL inhibitors and proposes LSW as a safe ingredient for the preparation of food supplements for managing obesity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Nunzio Cardullo, \nDamiano Calcagno, \nLuana Pulvirenti, \nClaudia Sciacca, \nMaria Gaetana Giovanna Pittalà, \nAnna Elisabetta Maccarronello, \nFernanda Thevenard, \nVera Muccilli","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f504ea0b78defc69428234b527642436fb31f39e6f79a0bd1a2d79468a601a1e","category":"Environment"}
