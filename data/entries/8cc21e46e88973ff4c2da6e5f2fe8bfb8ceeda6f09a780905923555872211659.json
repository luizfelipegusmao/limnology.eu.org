{"title":"Bimetallic dioxomolybdenum(VI) Complex Based on bis(2-Pyridinecarboxamide) Ligand As Effective Catalyst for Fuel Desulfurization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1336/v1","date":1713781876000,"content":"A dioxomolybdenum catalyst [(MoO2Cl2-O-MoO2Cl2)(L)] (1) (with L (1S,2S)-N,NÂ´-bis(2-pyridinecarboxamide)-1,2-cyclohexane) was prepared and used as catalyst for the desulfurization of a multicomponent model fuel containing the most refractory sulfur compounds in real fuels. This complex showed to have a high efficiency to oxidize the aromatic benzothiophene derivative compounds present in fuels, mainly using a biphasic 1:1 model fuel/MeOH system. This process conciliates catalytic oxidative and extractive desulfurization, occurring the oxidation of the sulfur compounds in the polar organic solvent. The oxidative catalytic performance of (1) showed to be influenced by the presence of water in the system. Using 50% aq. H2O2 it was possible to reuse the catalyst and the extraction solvent MeOH during ten consecutive cycles without loss of desulfurization efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cc21e46e88973ff4c2da6e5f2fe8bfb8ceeda6f09a780905923555872211659","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
