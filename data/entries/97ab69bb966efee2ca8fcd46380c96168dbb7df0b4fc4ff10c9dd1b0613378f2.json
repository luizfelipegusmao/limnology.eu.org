{"title":"The Mitochondrial Genome of Ylistrum japonicum (Bivalvia, Pectinidae) from South China Sea and Its Phylogentic Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2376/v1","date":1722317430000,"content":"The Ylistrum japonicum is a commercially valuable scallop known for its long-distance swimming abilities. Despite its economic importance, genetic and genomic research on this species is limited. This study presents the first complete mitochondrial genome of Y. japonicum. The mitochondrial genome is 19,475 bp long and encompasses 13 protein-coding genes, 3 ribosomal RNA genes, and 23 transfer RNA genes. By selecting 15 Pectinidae species and additional outgroup taxa, we have constructed phylogenetic trees to elucidate the evolutionary placement of Ylistrum within the family Pectinidae. Our analysis reveals that Ylistrum is a basal lineage to the Pectininae clade, distinct from its previously assigned tribe, Amusiini. This study offers critical insights into the genetic makeup and evolutionary history of Y. japonicum, enhancing our knowledge of this economically vital species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97ab69bb966efee2ca8fcd46380c96168dbb7df0b4fc4ff10c9dd1b0613378f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
