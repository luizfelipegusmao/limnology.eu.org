This study was conducted in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India, and aimed to assess local communities' awareness of the species and their potential role in its conservation. From August 2023 to January 2024, we conducted surveys in four villages, interviewing 65 individuals from Pahadi and Nepali communities. Results revealed limited familiarity with the squirrel, highlighting the need for targeted conservation education. Despite extensive camera trap surveys, conclusive evidence of the species' presence was not found, prompting concerns about its population status in the study area. Our findings show the importance of further research and community engagement for effective conservation. This study emphasises the need to align conservation efforts with community involvement for sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>羊绒鼯鼠（<i>Eupetaurus cinereus</i>）在被认为灭绝七十年后被重新发现，它也是被研究最少的哺乳动物物种之一。这项研究在印度北阿坎德邦的乌塔卡什（Uttarkashi）地区进行，目的是评估当地社区对该物种的认识及其在保护中的作用。在2023年8月至2024年1月对四个村庄进行的调查中，来自帕哈迪和尼泊尔社区的65人接受了采访。结果显示，人们对羊绒鼯鼠的了解有限，这表明需要开展有针对性的保护教育工作。我们还进行了红外相机调查，以记录该地区的羊绒鼯鼠。尽管我们做出了努力，但仍未找到该物种存在的确凿证据，这引发了人们对该地区羊绒鼯鼠种群状况的担忧。进一步的研究和社区参与对于有效的保护至关重要。本研究也强调了将保护工作与社区参与相结合的重要性。 【审阅：周聪】</p>","author":"Hiranmoy Chetia, \nMurali K.
