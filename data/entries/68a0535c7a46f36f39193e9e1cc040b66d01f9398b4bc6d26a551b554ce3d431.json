{"title":"An S-locus F-box protein as pollen S determinant targets non-self S-RNase underlying self-incompatibility in Citrus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/3891/7629183?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Self-incompatibility (SI) is a crucial mechanism that prevents self-fertilization and inbreeding in flowering plants. <span>Citrus</span> exhibits SI regulated by a polymorphic <span>S</span>-locus containing an <span>S-RNase</span> gene and multiple <span>S</span>-locus <span>F-box</span> (<span>SLF</span>) genes. It has been documented that <span>S-RNase</span> functions as the pistil <span>S</span> determinant, but there is no direct evidence that the <span>SLF</span> genes closely linked with <span>S-RNase</span> function as pollen <span>S</span> determinants in <span>Citrus</span>. This study assembled the genomes of two pummelo (<span>Citrus grandis</span>) plants, obtained three novel complete and well-annotated <span>S</span>-haplotypes, and isolated 36 <span>SLF</span> or <span>SLF-like</span> alleles on the <span>S</span>-loci. Phylogenetic analysis of 138 SLFs revealed that the <span>SLF</span> genes were classified into 12 types, including six types with divergent or missing alleles. Furthermore, transformation experiments verified that the conserved S<sub>6</sub>-SLF7a protein can lead to the transition of SI to self-compatibility by recognizing non-self S<sub>8</sub>-RNase in ‘Mini-Citrus’ plants (<span>S</span><sub><span>7</span></sub><span>S</span><sub><span>8</span></sub> and <span>S</span><sub><span>8</span></sub><span>S</span><sub><span>29</span></sub>, <span>Fortunella hindsii</span>), a model plant for citrus gene function studies. <span>In vitro</span> assays demonstrated interactions between SLFs of different <span>S</span> haplotypes and the Skp1–Cullin1–F-box subunit CgSSK1 protein. This study provides direct evidence that <span>SLF</span> controls the pollen function in <span>Citrus</span>, demonstrating its role in the ‘non-self recognition’ SI system.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"68a0535c7a46f36f39193e9e1cc040b66d01f9398b4bc6d26a551b554ce3d431","category":"Environment"}
