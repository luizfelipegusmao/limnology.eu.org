A Micro-Macro Threshold?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202307.0731/v2","date":1720600958000,"content":"According to Quantum Mechanics a narrow wave-package of the center of mass of macroscopic objects, due to their heavy mass, remains stable over astronomical times. However Quantum Mechanics allows and energetically even prefers largely smeared out c.m. states that never been seen. Why is this the real state of the world we know? Does it suggest a micro-macro threshold with different theoretical descriptions?","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98e6e73f158c8f2cced0f81c8454ae9e451e3eee9bf09aa46c705d5061d2ad6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
