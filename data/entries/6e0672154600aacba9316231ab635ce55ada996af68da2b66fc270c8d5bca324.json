This study analyzes parts of Arabic Wikipedia offline by linking article pages and page edit histories to user profiles of known genders.</p> Results <p>This study reported that a gender gap exists in Arabic Wikipedia. The results reported differences over the past five years between both genders in terms of tasks and user behavior.
