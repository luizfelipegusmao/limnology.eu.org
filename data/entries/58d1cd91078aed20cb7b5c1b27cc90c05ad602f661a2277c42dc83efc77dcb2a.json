{"title":"Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of Rayleigh and Leaky-Sezawa Waves Propagating in ZnO/Fused Silica Substrates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1804/v1","date":1719388857000,"content":"Piezoelectric c-axis oriented zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films, from 1.8 up to 6.6 µm thick, have been grown by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique onto fused silica substrates. A delay line consisting in two interdigital transducers (IDTs) with wavelength λ = 80 µm was photolith-ographically implemented onto the surface of the ZnO layers. Due to the IDTs split finger con-figuration and metallization ratio (0.5), the propagation of both the fundamental, third and nineth harmonic Rayleigh waves is excited; also, three leaky surface acoustic waves (SAWs) were detected travelling at velocity close to that of the longitudinal bulk wave in SiO2. The acoustic waves propagation in ZnO/fused silica was simulated by using 2D finite-element method (FEM) tech-nique to identify the nature of the experimentally detected waves. It turned out that, in addition to the fundamental and harmonic Rayleigh waves, also high-frequency leaky surface waves are ex-cited by the harmonic wavelengths; such modes are identified as leaky-Sezawa (LS) waves under cut-off. The velocity of all the modes was found in good agreement with the theoretically calcu-lated values. The existence of a low-loss region for the Sezawa wave below the cut off was theo-retically predicted and experimentally assessed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58d1cd91078aed20cb7b5c1b27cc90c05ad602f661a2277c42dc83efc77dcb2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
