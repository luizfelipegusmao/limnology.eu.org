It gives scientists a more information-rich opportunity to study behavior, purpose and functionality based upon structure. Given that biological materials are notoriously radiation sensitive, it is difficult to get information at the nanometer scale at the same time as the wide field of view (FoV) necessary to understand the environment and cellular context needed by biologists and clinicians. Using TEM imaging, the resolution is inherently linked to the FoV by the Nyquist frequency, making high-resolution ultrastructural studies currently possible on smaller âˆ¼800 nm x 800 tiles or volumes. Proximity to the surrounding environment is possible using correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM) or FIB and SEM approaches.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e59ee43672e1536f113459494dbf3297239cf83013c8b89f6ff4069a6bc00b7b","category":"Environment"}
