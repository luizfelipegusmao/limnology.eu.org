{"title":"Intimate partner violence types are differentially associated with substance use among young, urban, sexual minority men of color","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309958","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Joshua A. Rusow, Ankur Srivastava, Bethany C. Bray, Jeremy T. Goldbach, Michele D. Kipke</p>\r\n\r\nSexual minority men of color report intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance use at elevated rates compared to heterosexual peers, but little is known about how types (physical/sexual, controlling, monitoring, emotional) of perpetration and victimization are connected to types of substance use. Associations between past-6-month IPV experiences and substance use (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, poppers, cocaine) were examined among sexual minority men (N = 414; 18â€“27 years). IPV victimization and perpetration were reported by 22% and 14% of the sample. Any victimization and controlling victimization were positively correlated with tobacco use, physical victimization was positively correlated with cocaine and poppers use, and monitoring victimization was negatively correlated with cannabis and poppers use. Any perpetration was positively correlated with tobacco use and binge drinking, and emotional perpetration was positively correlated with binge drinking. Understanding and addressing IPV victimization and perpetration experiences are critical for understanding risk conferred by IPV in this population.","author":"Joshua A.
