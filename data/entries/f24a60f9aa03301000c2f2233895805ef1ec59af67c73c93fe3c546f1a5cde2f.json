{"title":"Nutritional guide to feeding wheat and wheat co-products to swine: a review","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae106/7714550?rss=1","date":1721088000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Inclusion of wheat grain can offer feeding opportunities in swine diets because of its high starch, crude protein (CP), amino acid (AA), and phosphorus (P) content. High concentrations of starch within wheat grain makes it a good energy source for swine. Mean energy content of wheat was 4,900 and 3,785 kcal/kg dry matter (DM) for digestible energy and metabolizable energy, respectively. CP concentration can vary based on the class of wheat which include hard red winter, hard red spring, soft red winter, hard white, soft white, and durum. The average CP of all wheat data collected in this review was 12.6% with a range of 8.5% to 17.6%. The AA concentration of wheat increases with increasing CP with the mean Lys content of 0.38% with a standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of 76.8%. As CP of wheat increases, the SID of AA in wheat also increases. Mean P of wheat was 0.27% and median P was 0.30%. Off-quality wheat is often associated with sprouts, low-test weight, or mycotoxin-contamination. Sprouted and low-test weight wheat are physical abnormalities associated with decreased starch within wheat kernel that leads to reductions in energy. The assumed energy value of wheat grain may need to be reduced by up to 10% when the proportion of sprouted to non-sprouted wheat is up to 40% whereas above 40%, wheat’s energy may need to be reduced by 15% to 20%. Low-test weight wheat appears to not influence pig performance unless it falls below 644 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and then energy value should be decreased by 5% compared to normal wheat. Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination is most common with wheat grain. When content is above the guidance level of 1 mg/kg of DON in the complete diet, each 1 mg/kg increase in a DON-contaminated wheat-based diet will result in a 11% and 6% reduction in ADG and ADFI for nursery pigs, and a 2.7% and 2.6% reduction in ADG and ADFI, in finishing pigs, respectively. Wheat co-products are produced from the flour milling industry. Wheat co-products include wheat bran middlings, millrun, shorts, and red dog. Wheat co-products can be used in swine diets, but application may change because of differences in the final diet energy concentration due to changes in the starch and fiber levels of each wheat co-product. However, feeding wheat co-products are being evaluated to improve digestive health. Overall, wheat and wheat co-products can be fed in all stages of production if energy and other nutrient characteristics are considered.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"f24a60f9aa03301000c2f2233895805ef1ec59af67c73c93fe3c546f1a5cde2f","category":"Environment"}
