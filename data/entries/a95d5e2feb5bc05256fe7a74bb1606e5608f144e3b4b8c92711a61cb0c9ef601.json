We investigated the current dosing of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban by monitoring drug plasma concentration (PC) and coagulation activity.\nMethods and Results: This multicenter clinical study monitored the drug PC levels and two coagulation biomarkers (fibrinogen: FIB, and fibrin monomer complex: FMC) at peak and trough timing in 268 outpatients receiving rivaroxaban (n = 72), apixaban (n = 71), and edoxaban (n = 125) for NVAF. Doses were adjusted according to the dose adjustment criteria of each drug. Based on our previous study, each peak drug PC remained below the cut-off level for predicting bleeding events except in eight patients (three on rivaroxaban, two on apixaban and three on edoxaban) in whom bleeding events occurred; among them, two (one each on rivaroxaban and edoxaban) had a peak drug PC below the cut-off level. Drug PCs widely varied from peak to trough, whereas FMC levels remained within the normal range (&lt; 6.1 Âµg/ml) regardless of PC variation. These finding suggested that the anticoagulant effects of these drugs persisted throughout the day regardless of the drug PC levels, dosage, and frequency of dosing. Regarding the change in peak drug PC levels over time, rivaroxaban tended to accumulate more than edoxaban (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a95d5e2feb5bc05256fe7a74bb1606e5608f144e3b4b8c92711a61cb0c9ef601","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
