{"title":"Comparison of Lupus and Lymphoma B-Cells Using Novel Immune Imbalance Transcriptomics Algorithm Reveals Potential Therapeutic Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1672/v1","date":1721633619000,"content":"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus) and B-cell lymphoma (lymphoma) are serious diseases. Lupus and lymphoma co-occur at higher-than-expected rates and primarily depend on B-cells for their pathology, implicating shared inflammation-related B-cell molecular mechanisms as a potential cause of co-occurrence. We consequently implemented a novel Immune Imbalance Transcriptomics (IIT) algorithm and applied IIT to lupus, lymphoma, and healthy B-cell RNA-seq data to find shared- and contrasting mechanisms potentially targetable for treatment. We observed 8,562 genes significantly dysregulated in both lupus and lymphoma. Of those genes, we found 5,335 to have a significant immune imbalance, defined as significant dysregulation by both diseases, as determined by IIT. Gene Ontology (GO) term and pathway enrichment of IIT genes yielded immune-related “Neutrophil Degranulation” and “Adaptive Immune System”, validating that the IIT algorithm isolates biologically relevant genes in immunity and inflammation. We found that 389 IIT gene products are drug-targetable with established or repurposed drugs. Among our results, we found 40 known and 349 novel lupus targets, along with 151 known and 238 novel lymphoma targets. Known disease drug targets in our IIT results further validate that IIT isolates genes with disease-relevant mechanisms. We anticipate the IIT algorithm and shared and contrasting gene mechanisms uncovered here will contribute to the development of immune-related therapeutic options for lupus and lymphoma patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80ea974f23e010aa91623cae00b8f26cb7f1609cf63d25aef2e8465264736442","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
