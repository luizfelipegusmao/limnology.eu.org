{"title":"Electro-Hydraulic Variable-Speed Drive Network Technologyâ€“ First Experimental Validation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0807/v1","date":1715579866000,"content":"The improvement of energy efficiency of hydraulic systems remains to be an essential challenge for the industry, and the demand for more sustainable solutions is increasing. A main focus in this endeavor is the ability to eliminate or strongly reduce the use of throttle control valves which have been the preferred control element in industrial hydraulic systems for decades. Components have been subject to continuous evolution, and current industrial grade hydraulic pumps and motors are both efficient and reliable. Even though few percentages of energy efficiency can still be achieved, the main achievements in terms of efficiency is associated with novel system designs rather than further development of components. An area subject to increasing attention is the field of variable-speed displacement control, allowing to avoid the main control valve throttle losses. Systems using this technology are, however, mainly developed as standalone drive systems, necessitating maximum force, speed and power installed in each axis, with limited hydraulic power distribution capability as compared to valve controlled systems. An emerging field addressing this challenge is so-called electro-hydraulic variable-speed drive networks which allow to completely eliminate the use of control valves and enables power sharing both electrically and hydraulically, potentially reducing the necessary installed power in many cases. The idea of such a technology was first proposed in 2022, and so far developments reported in literature have mainly been of theoretical nature. This article presents the first ever experimental results for a dual cylinder electro-hydraulic variable-speed drive network prototype. The prototype has been developed for an industrial application, but has initially been implemented in a laboratory testbench. Extensive data acquisition has been conducted while subject to the associated industrial motion cycle, under different load conditions. The data is further used in combination with models to predict the total efficiency of the drive network prototype under higher loads than what could be achieved in the laboratory, suggesting a total efficiency from the electric supply to the cylinder pistons of 68 %. Re-configuring the prototype to a known standalone drive system structure implies comparable efficiencies. Finally, the drive network is theoretically compared to a valve drive solution, generally suggesting the prototype drive network to provide efficiency improvements of at least 40 % in comparison.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8b0fd35371afa59c6cb290d3da64039b717b7aa669c5388bb86a1087d311888","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
