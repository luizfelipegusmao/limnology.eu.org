{"title":"An Entire Approach for Infectious Disease Modelling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1136/v1","date":1723727577000,"content":"This research paper is divided into two aspects: first part describes the modelling techniques which are referred for handling infectious diseases in public health domain, second part describes the modelling techniques which are referred for building epidemiology cases in public health domain. To illustrate further, first part helps in understanding various modeling ordinary differential equations have been defined to develop the definition, described to know the terminologies involved in developing the equations and henceforth established to understand the end-to-end process. Second part helps in understanding various aspects of epidemiology in public health domain and how they help in addressing the public health domain policy-making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28af8d41be3dc1bcfdf1d3e1aedb9e7f5e9c09df71afbca3142cf95d739709e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
