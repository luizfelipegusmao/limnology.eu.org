Many studies have shown that the distribution of allele frequencies across a species' range is often influenced by specific genetic loci associated with local environmental variables. This association reflects local adaptation and allele changes at those loci could thereby contribute to the evolutionary response to climate change. However, predicting how species will adapt to climate change from this type of data alone remains challenging. In the present study, we combined exome capture sequences and environmental niche reconstruction, to test multiple methods for assessing local adaptation and climate resilience in two widely distributed conifers, Norway spruce and Siberian spruce. Both species are keystone species of the boreal forest and share a vast hybrid zone. We show that local adaptation in conifers can be detected through allele frequency variation, population-level ecological preferences, and historical niche movement. Moreover, we integrated genetic and ecological information into genetic offset predictive models to show that hybridization plays a central role in expanding the niche breadth of the two conifer species and may help both species to cope better with future changing climates. This joint genetic and ecological analysis also identified spruce populations that are at risk under current climate change.</p>","author":"Piyal Karunarathne, \nQiujie Zhou, \nMartin Lascoux, \nPascal Milesi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"2f1b6c281e1be2792bff2854813f1368a51a419c87e816728e76c1812ce816cf","category":"Environment"}
