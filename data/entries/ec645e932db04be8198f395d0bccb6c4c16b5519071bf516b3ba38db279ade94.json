{"title":"Effects of periodic heat events on the reproduction and longevity of female and male Agasicles hygrophila (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/374/7628927?rss=1","date":1710374400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Alternanthera philoxeroides</span> (Amaranthaceae), commonly known as alligator weed, is a globally invasive and detrimental perennial weed. <span>Agasicles hygrophila</span> serves as an important biocontrol agent for alligator weeds. However, during mid-summer, when temperatures increase, <span>A. hygrophila</span> populations experience a significant decline, leading to ineffective weed control. This study has examined the impact of periodic heat events on the reproduction and survival of <span>A. hygrophila</span> females and males using various mating combinations and durations of temperature treatments. The results demonstrated significant effects on all of the studied parameters across mating combinations when compared with the control. Under the same temperature combination, the fecundity and survival rates of females, as well as the egg-hatching rate, decreased significantly with increasing repeated heat exposure. Furthermore, the egg-hatching rate varied significantly among different temperatures and time-interval combinations. In addition, the females displayed greater sensitivity to heat stress than males in terms of fecundity. These findings enhance our understanding of <span>A. hygrophila</span> population dynamics during summer and provide insights into the release of biocontrol agents in diverse regions with varying climates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"ec645e932db04be8198f395d0bccb6c4c16b5519071bf516b3ba38db279ade94","category":"Environment"}
