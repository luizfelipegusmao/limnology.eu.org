{"title":"Homeostasis - Resiliance and Susceptibility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1624/v2","date":1726980011000,"content":"There are many features of homeostasis worth investigating such as how it works (information pathways, set point processing), where its command and control processors are located in the cell, the language used and how homeostasis interacts with all effectors (all aspects of an organism's functional maintenance and development such as cell differentiation). All are necessary and valid inquiries, but this paper examines the implications of ignoring it as a factor of disease causation. Alternatively when properly understood the homeostasis profile becomes a rational explanation for any individualâ€™s range of health; where some areas are very resistant to disease (resilient) and other areas of homeostasis are dysfunctional leading to minor, moderate or very susceptible tendencies to disease (a lack of resilience in homeostasis). An understanding of this phenomenon, its interactions with gene expression (epigenetics) is necessary in order to evaluate the solutions for acute and chronic diseases. By this method diseases can be defined more precisely as specific susceptibilities in homeostasis, leading to a method to restore specific homeostasis functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2376e202d4600569671e4195f32bc891da59820e2c1e3c1c0b44cfee560c2218","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
