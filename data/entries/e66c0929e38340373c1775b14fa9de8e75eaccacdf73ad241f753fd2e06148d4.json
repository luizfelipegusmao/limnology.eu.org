It begins with an overarching introduction, which draws some general themes from our selection of cases, focussing on the scope of environmental law, connections between private and public law disputes, and the standard of review in the public law context. It then addresses 12 significant cases concerning statutory trusts over land under section 164 of the Public Health Act 1875 and section 10 of the Open Spaces Act 1906, public rights on Dartmoor Commons, private nuisance, climate change, insurance, environmental impact assessment, delay in judicial review, forestry, contaminated land, and habitats. It ends with some final thoughts on this year’s cases and the year ahead.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Environmental Law Current Issue","siteHash":"d0caeee440a105ac55789e8609e0b01f5d84cefdaed670832b152a3f460f0e91","entryHash":"e66c0929e38340373c1775b14fa9de8e75eaccacdf73ad241f753fd2e06148d4","category":"Environment"}
