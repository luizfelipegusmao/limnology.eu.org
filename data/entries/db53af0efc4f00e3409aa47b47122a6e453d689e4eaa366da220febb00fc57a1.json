{"title":"Advances in Room Temperature of Indium Aluminum Nitride InAlN Deposition via Co-Sputtering DC for Solar Energy Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0994/v1","date":1726138725000,"content":"The study addresses the fabrication of indium aluminum nitride (InAlN) layers by DC co-sputtering at room temperature, highlighting their potential in optoelectronic and solar cell applications. Experiments were carried out with different powers for the aluminum target, observing changes in the stoichiometry and material properties. XPS and AES analysis confirmed the variation in indium and aluminum concentration, directly affecting bandgap and electrical properties such as mobility and free carrier concentration. The layers showed smooth surfaces with low roughness, suitable for high efficiency interfaces. This method promises to reduce costs and improve the accessibility of efficient solar technologies based on InAlN semiconductor alloy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db53af0efc4f00e3409aa47b47122a6e453d689e4eaa366da220febb00fc57a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
