The study of internal structure, structures and composition is widely used for a range of expertise and inspections. Examples include investigating the causes of industrial accidents and explosions, accidents in aviation and automobile transport, investigating the causes of fires, etc. However, similar methods are also used in the analysis of suspected forgeries of art objects (paintings, plaques, sculptures). . One of the options is the use of robotic scanners with various multimodal detectors. The system is currently being developed and integrates the existing X-ray scanner with other analytical modalities (XRD, XRF, multispectral imaging and others). System is based on Radalytica’s multi-robot imaging platform. System measures nearly all conventional 2D and 3D trajectories of X-ray imaging with precisely calibrated and repeatable geometrical accuracy leading to a spatial resolution of up to 50 µm.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0eb3cd703ddbe6d4da74e732450e5a7400d3266f09588008d1e824c525efdf8f","category":"Environment"}
