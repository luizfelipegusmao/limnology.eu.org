{"title":"Initial Experience with the 4D Mini-TEE Probe in the Adult Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1032/v1","date":1726149304000,"content":"Introduction: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a vital diagnostic tool in clinical prac-tice, particularly in transcatheter interventions where it aids in both pre-operative planning and intra-operative guidance. Traditional TEE probes often require general anesthesia due to patient discomfort. However, the development of miniaturized TEE probes presents a promising alter-native, enabling routine examinations and interventions with minimal sedation. This study evaluates the feasibility of performing a complete 2D/4D TEE protocol with the new 4D-mini-TEE probe in echocardiography departments and its application in transcatheter interventions. \nMethods: This prospective, observational study included 30 consecutive patients from two high-volume European hospitals (Interbalkan Medical Center, Thessaloniki, Greece, and Rennes University, France) undergoing TEE or transcatheter interventions. The new 4D-mini-TEE 9VT-D probe (GE Healthcare) was utilized. The quality of the images and the tolerance of the probe were assessed in the Cath lab during interventions and in the echocardiography department during routine TEE examinations. \nResults: Direct comparison of the 4D-mini-TEE probe with the standard 6VT-D probe, confirmed the excellent image quality of this new pediatric probe. Most of the patients required minimal sedation or local oropharyngeal anesthesia, with satisfactory tolerance reported. Most of the transcatheter procedures did not require general anesthesia and intubation, resulting in shorter procedural time. Both 2D and 4D imaging modalities offered adequate intra-operative guidance for transcatheter procedures.\nConclusions: The 4D-mini-TEE probe delivers exceptional imaging capabilities for routine ex-aminations and transcatheter interventions without needing sedation. Its use reduces esophageal trauma and the need for general anesthesia, enhancing patient comfort and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d019d949aac1ddbb5f92222fbd9e1fcfa72362079122352865bc82f6e628a6b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
