{"title":"Kelp dissolved organic carbon release is seasonal and annually enhanced during senescence","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13483?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Macroalgae influence local and global biogeochemical cycles through their production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Yet, data remain scarce and annualized estimates are typically based on high growth periods without considering seasonal variability. Although the mechanisms of active exudation and passive leakage need clarifying, ecophysiological stress is known to enhance DOC release. Therefore, DOC leakage from seasonally senescent macroalgae may be overlooked. This study focuses on the annual kelp <i>Saccharina japonica</i> var. <i>religiosa</i> (class Phaeophyceae) from Oshoro Bay, Hokkaido, Japan. Three years (2020–2022) of seasonal data were collected and analyzed, with least squares mean DOC release rates established for kelp (<i>n</i> = 88) across 16 incubation experiments (<i>t</i> ≥ 4 d, DOC samples ≥1 · d<sup>−1</sup>) under different photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) treatments (200, 400, 1200, or 1500 μmol photons · m<sup>−2</sup> · s<sup>−1</sup>). Differences in PAR, dry weight biomass (g DW), sea surface temperature, or salinity could not explain DOC release-rate variability, which was high between individual kelp. Instead, there were significant intra-annual differences, with mean DOC release rates (mg C · g<sup>−1</sup> DW · d<sup>−1</sup> ± standard error between <i>n</i> kelp) higher during the autumn “late decay” period (0.71 ± 0.10, <i>n</i> = 27) compared to the winter “early growth” period (0.14 ± 0.025, <i>n</i> = 10) and summer “early decay” period (0.25 ± 0.050, <i>n</i> = 24). This relationship between seasonal senescence and macroalgal DOC release is further evidence that long-term, place-based studies of DOC dynamics are essential and that global extrapolations are premature.</p>","author":"Andrew Kalani Carlson, \nTakeshi Yoshimura, \nIsao Kudo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"2db65eb428d597b36c9f208676da798804719d1170ef19e37e6d02de8f5cac0f","category":"Environment"}
