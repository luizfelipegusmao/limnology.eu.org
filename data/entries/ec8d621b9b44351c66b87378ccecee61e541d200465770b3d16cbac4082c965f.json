{"title":"The Impact of Green Space on PM2.5 Concentration: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0568/v1","date":1720422347000,"content":"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can enter the lungs and cause premature death in millions of people worldwide every year. More and more international scholars are paying attention to the potential harm of PM2.5 and how to reduce its negative impact. Reducing air pollution and its negative impacts is an important function of green spaces. Many scholars have conducted research on the impact of green spaces on PM2.5. This article attempts to comprehensively review past related research. This is undoubtedly beneficial for people to better understand the impact of green spaces on PM2.5 and optimize green spaces accordingly to reduce PM2.5 concentration. This article first provides a detailed introduction to the impact of plants on PM2.5 pollution from the perspective of the mechanism of action. Then, this article provides a review of the different impacts of green space types and morphological factors on the surrounding environment PM2.5. In addition, this article outlines the range of the impact of green spaces on PM2.5 in the environment. This article categorizes green spaces into different types such as road green spaces, commercial and residential green spaces, and parks and squares, and explores the impact of green spaces on PM2.5 in the environment. This article analyzes the impact of various parts of a single plant on PM2.5 in the environment from a single plant perspective. Finally, this article analyzes which factors in the surrounding environment can affect the impact of green spaces on PM2.5 pollution in the environment. A review of relevant research is also beneficial for people to have a more comprehensive understanding of current research progress and guide future research to better carry out.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec8d621b9b44351c66b87378ccecee61e541d200465770b3d16cbac4082c965f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
