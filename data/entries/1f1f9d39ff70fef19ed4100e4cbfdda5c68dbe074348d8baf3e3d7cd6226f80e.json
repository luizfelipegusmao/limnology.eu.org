{"title":"Investigating the physicochemical properties, sensory profile and consumer acceptability of beetroot dark chocolate","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13785?af=R","date":1722501899000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The incorporation of functional food ingredients in chocolate that seek to eliminate, if not completely, most of the added sugar content, as well as the use of alternative chocolate production techniques, have gained popularity in recent years. This study aimed to incorporate red beetroot powder into dark chocolate and investigate the effect of red beetroot powder concentration and processing time in a melanger on the physicochemical properties, sensory profile and consumer acceptability of beetroot dark chocolate.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The addition of red beetroot powder increased the moisture content, particle size distribution and hardness of the chocolates, while the opposite was true for processing time with no effect on the colour. Except for taste, which had an average score of 3.2 ± 1.8 on the 7-point hedonic scale, consumers scored all the other sensory attributes of the chocolates above 4.0. Among the chocolates with red beetroot powder, samples with a 15% red beetroot powder addition had a high average overall acceptability score of &gt;5, while the 30% sample scored &lt;4.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Red beetroot powder can be used to replace sugar in dark chocolate without affecting its physicochemical properties, sensory profile or consumer acceptability. However, the target market should be considered when determining the level of red beetroot powder incorporation in terms of chocolate taste. This research has the potential to improve the overall health-promoting properties of dark chocolate by eliminating added sugar (partially or completely). It would also help to diversify beetroot utilization, allow small-scale processors to venture into chocolate production and expand the small-scale chocolate value chain. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"John Edem Kongor, \nMargaret Owusu, \nSonia de Pascual‐Teresa, \nMaria Dolores Álvarez, \nVincent Owusu Kyei‐Baffour, \nCharlotte Oduro‐Yeboah, \nCharles Tortoe","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1f1f9d39ff70fef19ed4100e4cbfdda5c68dbe074348d8baf3e3d7cd6226f80e","category":"Environment"}
