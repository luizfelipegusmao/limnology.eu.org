{"title":"Effect of Biodiesel Produced from Sunflower Oil on Engine Emissions Characteristics","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-57054-4_25","date":1735689600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Biodiesel has an impact on exhaust gas emissions in compression ignition engines as it reduces exhaust emissions that pollute the environment and contribute to global warming. Additionally, biodiesel fuel is considered a renewable energy source, unlike fossil diesel, which pollutes the environment and is non-renewable. The current experimental study aims to examine biodiesel production from sunflower oil and its effect on the exhaust emissions of compression ignition engines. The esterification technique was used in the preparation, and the biodiesel yield percentage reached 92%. A biodiesel-to-diesel blend in the proportions of B0, B10, B20, B30, and B40 was utilized. The experiment used a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and a variable torque range from 0 to 10 Nm. The results indicate the following changes compared to fossil diesel: a 0.067% decrease in HC emissions, a 0.022% decrease in CO emissions, a 1.40% increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, and a 0.433% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Additionally, there was a 9.75 °C increase in EGT due to changes in the properties of biodiesel, such as density, high viscosity, and low calorific value compared to normal diesel properties.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"55ccf5495e3ea89b384cee69554eeb2b450d0ceeb60b61597bedfbd30b1e4fb9","category":"Environment"}
