{"title":"Tweets Classification for Digital Epidemiology of Childhood Health Outcomes Using Pre-Trained Language Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0860/v1","date":1718264533000,"content":"This paper presents our approaches for the SMM4H’24 Shared Task 5 on the binary classification of English tweets reporting children’s medical disorders. Our first approach involves fine-tuning a single RoBERTa-large model, while the second approach entails ensembling the results of three fine-tuned BERTweet-large models. We demonstrate that although both approaches exhibit identical performance on validation data, the BERTweet-large ensemble excels on test data. Our best-performing system achieves an F1-score of 0.938 on test data, outperforming the benchmark classifier by 1.18%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67d944f1436855b83db9b6a4142aa192f3bbe7d118666c5542047d6e652053ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
