{"title":"Geochemical characteristics and detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Yimin Formation, Kelulun Depression, Hailar Basin and constraints on uranium mineralization","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309433","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Fanmin Meng, Fengjun Nie, Fei Xia, Zhaobin Yan, Da Sun, Wenbo Zhou, Xin Zhang, Qing Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThe sandstone uranium deposits in the Kelulun Depression are the first commercially viable uranium deposits discovered in the Hailar Basin and the ore-bearing strata corresponding to the Lower Cretaceous Yimin Formation. However, the source of sedimentary matter, uranium source conditions, and uranium mineralization processes in the region have not been characterized. Accordingly, we analyzed the lithology, whole-rock geochemistry, zircon U-Pb ages, and trace elements of the Yimin Formation sandstones. The Yimin Formation sandstones were primarily composed of detrital grains with low compositional maturity. A geochemical analysis indicated that the parent rocks are felsic igneous rocks formed at an active continental margin with a moderately high degree of weathering. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Yimin Formation 215–287 Ma with a peak at 230–260 Ma. Based on chronological, geochemical, and lithological data, we conclude that the Yimin Formation matter is derived from the Adunchulu Uplift on the western side of the Kelulun Depression and its parent rocks are Triassic granites. The Adunchulu uplift since the late Early Cretaceous and weathering and denudation of its uranium-rich granites provided ample matter and uranium. Therefore, the Kelulun Depression is a promising area for the exploration of sandstone uranium deposits.","author":"Fanmin Meng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b072609092f3d80810cdf4d90d3c1f592713e384474cf47da9afb4805202e50f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
