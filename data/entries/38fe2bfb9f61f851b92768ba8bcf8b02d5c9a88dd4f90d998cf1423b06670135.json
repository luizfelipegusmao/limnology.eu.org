{"title":"The attitude towards the forest and satisfaction with life of Polish students","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302247","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Anna Koprowicz, Robert Korzeniewicz, Wojciech Pusz, Marlena Baranowska</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of the study is to determine the connection between the attitude towards the forest and life satisfaction of students. The study was conducted on a sample of 650 students from Polish universities using The Satisfaction With Life Scale and an original questionnaire measuring the approach towards the forest–LAS scale. There are 3 subscales which measured: the perceived benefits from spending time in the forest; the degree of involvement in exploring the forest and working to its advantage; fears connected with the forest. The scale indicated good psychometric properties. Its reliability expressed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is at the level of 0.90 (0.93 for Benefits scale; 0.87 for Involvement and 0.79 for Fears). The results of the statistical analysis have led to conclusions confirming the relationship between life satisfaction and the results of LAS scale. People satisfied with their lives are more involved in exploring the forest, they enjoy more benefits connected with forest recreation and express fewer fears. Forestry students are characterised by the highest involvement and the lowest level of fears connected with the forest. As far as life satisfaction is concerned, they are in the lead among Polish students just behind students of medical and artistic studies.","author":"Anna Koprowicz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"38fe2bfb9f61f851b92768ba8bcf8b02d5c9a88dd4f90d998cf1423b06670135","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
