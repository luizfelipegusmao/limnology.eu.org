{"title":"Environmental Impact Assessment of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions during Trenchless Cured-in-Place Pipe Installation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0136/v1","date":1717489113000,"content":"Cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining is a widely adopted method for pipeline renewal, offering advantages such as rapid installation and cost-effectiveness. However, concerns regarding the environmental impacts of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions during the installation process have raised issues regarding the CIPP method. The literature review conducted in this paper indicated the need for stringent monitoring and management practices to mitigate adverse effects, emphasizing the importance of safe installation protocols. This paper presents the initial results of a case study focusing on VOC emissions, specifically investigating non-styrene polyester resins and water curing. To capture emissions from CIPP activities, the methodology involved air sampling using various equipment, including photoionization detectors (PID), summa canisters, passive worker sampler sorbent tubes, and method 13 cartridges. The preliminary findings indicate that non-styrene polyester resins do not exceed the exposure limits set out by the OSHA and USEPA. The future phases of this project will explore different resins and curing methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25e8200074bd6f89c11586fa5e293dad42b59cbf3f4d7a42d17e6093cafcfb9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
