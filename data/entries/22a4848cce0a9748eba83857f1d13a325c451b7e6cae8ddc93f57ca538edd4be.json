{"title":"GW0742 Attenuates Behavioral Abnormalities and Gene Expression Changes of Microglial and Astroglial Proteins in Rat Brain in a Lithium-Pilocarpine Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1221/v1","date":1723794821000,"content":"The role of astro- and microglial cells in the pathogenesis of epilepsy is currently under active in-vestigation. It is proposed that the activity of these cells may be regulated by agonists of peroxi-some proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (PPARs). The objective of this study was to investi-gate the effects of the PPAR β/δ agonist GW0742 (Fitorine) on the behavior and gene expression of astro- and microglial proteins involved in the regulation of epileptogenesis in rat brain in a lithi-um-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). A seven-day administration of GW0742 at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day has been shown to suppress TLE-related behavioral hyperactivity in the Open Field test and to attenuate the TLE-induced increase in gene expression and protein levels of astro- and microglial activation markers Gfap and Aif1 in the dorsal hippocampus and temporal cortex. Furthermore, GW0742 reversed the TLE-related increase in Lcn2 gene expression (a marker of the A1 phenotype of astrocytes) in the temporal cortex, the increase in the ratio of Nos2/Arg1 gene expression (markers of the M1/M2 phenotypes of microglia), and the decrease in Arg1 gene ex-pression in the dorsal hippocampus. The results suggest that GW0742 may mitigate behavioral and biochemical abnormalities in a lithium-pilocarpine model of TLE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22a4848cce0a9748eba83857f1d13a325c451b7e6cae8ddc93f57ca538edd4be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
