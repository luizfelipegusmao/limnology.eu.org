{"title":"Temporal Assessment of Phosphorus Speciation in a Model Ramsar Lake System in Asia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0412/v1","date":1715118696000,"content":"Phosphorus (P) concentration in rivers and lakes receives greater attention due to its significance in contributing to eutrophication. This study aimed at profiling phosphorus species in Vembanad lake (Ramsar site) and its adjoining rivers. Four phosphorus fractions (total reactive phosphorus (TRP), total acid hydrolysable phosphorus (TAHP), total organic phosphorus (TOP) and total phosphorus (TP)) were monitored according to premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. Meenachil river mouth is a hotspot for eutrophication with high values of most of the phosphorus fractions. Among the four fractions TRP, TOP and TP were recorded maximum concentration during the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. Each fraction of TRP, TAHP, TOP, and TP had an average concentration of more than 300 µgL-1 P throughout two seasons, which is highly eutrophic. The result reveals that the surface water of Vembanad lake is highly polluted with phosphorus input and it may trigger algal growth and consequent destruction of the biodiversity rich wetland system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ddd432d721cff498940f628c1bd977200e8329771eeb6fed464d8bdc3e69484","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
