{"title":"New approaches on composite designs for Response Surface Methodology","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301049","date":1712066400000,"content":"<p>by Despina E. Athanasaki, Stelios D. Georgiou, Stella Stylianou</p>\r\n\r\nRecent attention has increasingly focused on the significance of Definitive Screening Designs (DSDs), originally introduced by Jones and Nachtsheim (2011), as a compelling alternative to traditional designs bib Response Surface Methodology (RSM). This paper introduces two novel composite techniques aimed at enhancing design efficiency and elevating D-values. By utilizing orthogonal matrices and integrating axial components from either simple orthogonal designs or the block orthogonal designs detailed in the work of Alrweili et al. (2020), new design matrices are constructed based on established composite design principles. Notably, the novel designs presented in this manuscript surpass previously documented designs in the existing literature in terms of design efficiency and robustness.","author":"Despina E.
