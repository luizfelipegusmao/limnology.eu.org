{"title":"Deep Learning and Knowledge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1221/v1","date":1729042931000,"content":"This paper considers the question of what kind of knowledge is produced by deep learning.  Ryleâ€™s concept of knowledge how is examined and is contrasted with knowledge with a rationale.  It is then argued that deep neural networks do produce knowledge how, but, because of their opacity, they do not in general, though there may be some special cases to the contrary, produce knowledge with a rationale.  It is concluded that the distinction between knowledge how and knowledge with a rationale is a useful one for judging whether a particular application of deep learning AI is appropriate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"976c858d3a599cd4bef267fe5f3e9783cf799fbaa8e19ef6ff1fdc2b44c2041f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
