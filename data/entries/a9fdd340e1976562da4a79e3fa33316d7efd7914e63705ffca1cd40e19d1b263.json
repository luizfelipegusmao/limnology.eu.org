{"title":"Route of exposure to veterinary products in bees: Unraveling pasture's impact on avermectin exposure and tolerance in stingless bees","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae068/7618477?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Deforestation rapidly increases in tropical regions, primarily driven by converting natural habitats into pastures for extensive cattle ranching. This landscape transformation, coupled with pesticide use, are key drivers of bee population decline. Here, we investigate the impact of pasture-dominated landscapes on colony performance, pesticide exposure, and insecticide sensitivity of the stingless bee <span>Tetragonisca angustula</span>. We monitored 16 colonies located in landscapes with varying proportions of pasture. We collected bee bread for pesticide and palynological analysis. We found a positive correlation between pollen diversity and colony growth, with no effect of the proportion of pasture in the landscape. In contrast, we detected prevalent and hazardous concentrations of the insecticide abamectin (9.6–1,856 µg/kg) in bee bread, which significantly increased with a higher proportion of pasture. Despite the abamectin exposure, the bee colonies displayed no adverse effects on their growth, indicating a potential tolerance response. Further investigations revealed that bees from sites with higher proportions of pasture showed significantly reduced mortality when exposed to a lethal concentration of abamectin (0.021 µg/µL) after 48 h. Since abamectin is scarcely used in the study area, we designed an experiment to track ivermectin, a closely related antiparasitic drug used in cattle. Our findings uncovered a new exposure route of bees to pesticides, wherein ivermectin excreted by cattle is absorbed and biotransformed into abamectin within flowering plants in the pastures. These results highlight that unexplained exposure routes of bees to pesticides remain to be described while also revealing that bees adapt to changing landscapes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"a9fdd340e1976562da4a79e3fa33316d7efd7914e63705ffca1cd40e19d1b263","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
