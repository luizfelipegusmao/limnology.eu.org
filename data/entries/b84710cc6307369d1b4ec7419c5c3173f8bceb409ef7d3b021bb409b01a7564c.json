{"title":"Professional-Oriented Education Approach In Mechanics Physics Course for Future Career Track","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0936/v1","date":1718282122000,"content":"The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a professional-oriented education approach to traditional teaching methods among high school secondary students in Kazakhstan in aligning students to their suitable career education track. The study utilised a mechanics physics course to assess both approaches and involved two groups of students over 26 months - a control group (n=58) and an experimental group (n=57). Quantitative data was collected through a Mechanics Physics Test administered before and after the teaching and learning class. In Kazakhstan, students will be aligned directly with either secondary vocational education, the initial vocational education track, or the general education track, which relies on the final performance of their secondary school. The findings indicated that both teaching methods improved the student's performance, but the experimental group exhibited a significantly higher level of improvement than the control group. This study shows that a professional-oriented education approach can clearly align students with their interests and strengths and help them pursue their desired careers confidently. This approach enables students to make informed decisions about their future studies and career paths, reducing costs and saving time for schools and governmentsâ€”implications and, to a further extent, the study is also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b84710cc6307369d1b4ec7419c5c3173f8bceb409ef7d3b021bb409b01a7564c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
