Although several methods have been proposed previously, including those using geometry based and machine learning techniques, their accuracy is considered to be still insufficient. In this study, we introduce an approach that leverages a graph transformer neural network to rank the results of a geometry-based pocket detection method. We also created a larger training dataset compared to the conventionally used sc-PDB and investigated the correlation between the dataset size and prediction performance. Our findings indicate that utilizing a graph transformer-based method alongside a larger training dataset could enhance the performance of ligand binding site prediction.","author":"Ryuichiro Ishitani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"458eec8854ad0595f7532ff1cac5daee56cecb198752038fd6679a65e3885584","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
