{"title":"Quantum-Systems at Escape Velocities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0960/v3","date":1719849064000,"content":"This article briefly shows how particleâ€™s moving at escape velocity can be described in a quantum mechanical frameworks, this is achieved by deriving quantum mechanical equations that puts escape velocity into consideration. The equations are derived from Hamiltonians and Hamiltonian operators formulated from classical kinetic and potential terms which are then quantized. Equations were also presented for specific situations of the particle at escape velocity. Situations such as free-particles at escape velocity, Self-gravitating situations of a charged or neutral particle even while free of the gravitational influence of the large massive body due to its escape velocity, leaving only the self-gravitation as the only gravitational influence on the particle which in the case of a massless, charge less particle reduces back to the equation of free-particle at escape velocity. Other very brief expositions on trajectories and more are also present in this brief article.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df497d89ecf25e4995c6bc13d387dad9a8076349a3bed66d3c1f1f612dd62029","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
