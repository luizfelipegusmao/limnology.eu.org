{"title":"Study of the Properties of Ethylene-Propylene Copolymers and Polymers with Functional Groups of a Mixture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0492/v1","date":1723012702000,"content":"In this work, the properties of a composition based on synthetic rubber ethylene-propylene ter-polymer and polymers with functional groups of the mixture are studied. Low efficiency of some compositions based on ethylene and propylene copolymer limits their use in the production of tires and rubber products. Therefore, we conducted a study to improve the disadvantages of SREPT-60 using butyl rubber +  choro polyisoprene + butadiene-nitrile + butadiene styrene rubber and adding a plasticizer to the composition = α, methacrylate-(bis-diethylene glycol phthalate) -(btegf-9) The data obtained showed that a number of its indicators of rubber based on them were improved. Tear resistance, resistance to repeated stretching increased, adhesion of the composition to metal, chemical resistance increased, the degree of swelling in benzene and gasoline-benzene mixture decreased. Compositions based on the mixture SREPT-60 using butyl rubber + choro polyisoprene + butadiene-nitrile + butadiene styrene rubber and adding a plasticizer to the composition = α, methacrylate-(bis-diethylene glycol phthalate) -(btegf-9) +Dioctyl phthalate: (70:20:10) have high resistance to swelling in an aggressive environment (Benzene, gasoline, alcohol, acid, oil, etc.) mixture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7786cc3969aef84ce3430c3169aafc71f10ea7bde9435462514885656cfecaec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
