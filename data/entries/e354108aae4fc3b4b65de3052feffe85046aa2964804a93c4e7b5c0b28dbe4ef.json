To better explore interactions between microorganisms it is important to establish the ideal conditions that ensure survival of all species involved. In this study, we sought to identify the ideal biotic and abiotic factors that would result in high co-culture viability of two interkingdom species, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i>, two soil dwelling microbes. There have been limited studies showing long-term interactions between these two organisms as co-culture can result in high mortality for one or both organisms suggesting a predator-predator interaction may exist between them. In this study, we identified biotic and abiotic conditions that resulted in a high viability for both organisms in long-term co-culture, including optimizing temperature, nutrient concentration, choice of bacterial strains, and the initial ratio of interacting partners. These two species represent ideal partners for studying microbial interactions because amoebae act similarly to mammalian immune cells in many respects, and this can allow researchers to study host-pathogen interactions <i>in vitro</i>. Therefore, long-term interaction studies between these microbes might reveal the evolutionary steps that occur in bacteria when subjected to intense predation, like what occurs when pathogens enter the human body. The culture conditions characterized here resulted in high viability for both organisms for at least 14-days in co-culture suggesting that long-term experimental studies between these species can be achieved using these culture conditions.","author":"Rhiannon E.
