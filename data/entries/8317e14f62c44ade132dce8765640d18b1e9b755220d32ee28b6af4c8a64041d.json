Fundraising has been revolutionized by the emergence of donation-based crowdfunding platforms. This study explores the various factors influencing individuals' attitudes towards these platforms, particularly focusing on perceived usefulness, ease of use, credibility, and self-efficacy. The study examines how these factors affect donation intentions and electronic word-of-mouth intentions, utilizing data from 326 college students. The findings confirm that perceived usefulness, ease of use, credibility, and self-efficacy play crucial roles in shaping attitudes. Furthermore, these attitudes significantly impact both donation intentions and electronic word-of-mouth intentions.
