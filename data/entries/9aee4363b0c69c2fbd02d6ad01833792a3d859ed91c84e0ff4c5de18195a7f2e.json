{"title":"Detection of Mpox Virus Using a Wastewater Surveillance Approach in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0571/v1","date":1715231421000,"content":"Sewage surveillance can be used as an effective complementary tool for detecting pathogens in local communities, providing insights into emerging threats and aiding in the monitoring of outbreaks. In this study using qPCR and whole genomic sewage surveillance, we detected Mpox virus along with other viruses, in municipal and hospital wastewaters in Belo Horizonte, Brazil over a 9 months period (from July 2022 till March 2023). MPXV DNA detection rates varied in our study, with 19.6% (11 out of 56 samples) detected through the hybrid capture method of whole genome sequencing and 20% (12 out of 60 samples) through qPCR. In hospital wastewaters, the detection rate was higher at 40% (12 out of 30 samples), compared to 13.3%(4 out of 30 samples) in municipal wastewaters. This variation could be attributed to the relatively low number of MPXV cases reported in the city, which ranged from 106 to 341 cases during the study period, and to dilution effects, given that each of the two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) investigated serves approximately 1.1 million inhabitants. Additionally, nine other virus families were identified in both hospitals and municipal wastewaters including Adenoviridade, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridade, Polyomaviridae, Coronaviridae (which includes SARS-CoV-2), Herspesviridae, Papillomaviridae and Flaviviridae (notably including Dengue). These findings underscore the potential of genomic sewage surveillance as a robust public health tool for monitoring a wide range of viruses circulating in both community and hospitals environments including MPXV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9aee4363b0c69c2fbd02d6ad01833792a3d859ed91c84e0ff4c5de18195a7f2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
