Bierman</p>\r\n\r\nHIV can be successfully suppressed to undetectable levels by antiretroviral therapy (ART) in most people with HIV (PWH). However, a small proportion continues to have persistent low-level viremia (LLV) during ART. A presumed source of LLV is production or replication from viral reservoirs, which are maintained in the presence of ART. It is unknown whether the oral cavity can be considered an HIV reservoir. As periodontal inflammation is a common problem in PWH, we hypothesize that periodontal inflammation in the oral cavity activates (latently) infected cells and thus might be associated with LLV. We included 11 individuals with HIV LLV, and compared HIV-RNA levels in saliva and plasma at baseline and at week 24 after switch of ART. We compared the LLV-group at baseline with 11 age-matched controls with suppressed viremia. To investigate the severity of periodontitis we used Periodontal Inflamed Surface Areas (PISA) by measuring probing depth, gingival recession, bleeding on probing and clinical attachment level. Severity of periodontitis was classified according to the CDC-AAP case definition. Additional insights in periodontal inflammation were obtained by comparing immune activation markers and the presence of periodontal pathogens. In four individuals of the LLV group, residual levels of HIV-RNA were detected in saliva at baseline (N = 1) or at week 24 (N = 2) or both (N = 1). Of the four individuals with LLV, three had residual levels of HIV-RNA in saliva. All 22 individuals had moderate to severe periodontitis. PISA was not significantly different between cases with LLV and controls. Similarly, periodontal pathogens were frequently observed in both groups. Total activated HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly higher in the LLV group than in the control group (p = &lt;0.01). No immune markers were associated with LLV. In conclusion, periodontal inflammation is an unlikely driver of HIV LLV compared to HIV suppressed individuals.","author":"Arjen J.
