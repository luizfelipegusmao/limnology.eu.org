{"title":"Cell Culture and Animal Models of Nanoparticle Toxicity on the Airway Barrier","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1674/v1","date":1719222324000,"content":"The production of nanoparticles has recently surged due to their varied applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, textile, and electronic sectors. However, this rapid increase in nanoparticle manufacturing has raised concerns about environmental pollution, particularly due to their potential adverse effects on human health. Among the various concerns, inhalation exposure to nanoparticles poses significant risks, especially affecting the respiratory system. Airway epithelial cells play a crucial role as the primary defense against inhaled particulate matter and pathogens. Studies have shown that nanoparticles can disrupt the airway epithelial barrier, triggering inflammatory responses, generating reactive oxygen species, and compromising cell viability. However, our understanding of how different types of nanoparticles specifically impact the airway epithelial barrier remains limited. To investigate nanoparticle-induced cellular responses and barrier dysfunction, both in vitro cell culture models and in vivo murine models are commonly utilized. In this review, we discuss the methodologies frequently employed to assess nanoparticle toxicity and barrier disruption. Furthermore, we analyze and compare the distinct effects of various nanoparticle types on the airway epithelial barrier. By elucidating the diverse responses elicited by different nanoparticles, we aim to provide insights that can guide future research endeavors in assessing and mitigating the potential risks associated with nanoparticle exposure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfd99f0dcebaf4100ba2f2150948049b63176cbbf4616ed54fa02f88c3208eba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
