{"title":"The Muon g-2 in a Regularized Electrodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0161/v1","date":1719906035000,"content":"The present paper reports exact results for the muon self-energy and anomalous g-factor. A unique to the muon cut-off terms that remove the radial singularity in the system and regularize the corresponding electrodynamics are presented. Equations of motion and a transcendental equation satisfied by the muon anomalous g-factor are derived, with solution a_m=0.001165920162(198). The obtained value matches the latest experimental one found in the literature to about 0.43 ppb ruling out a possible tension between theory and experiment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2cdefe8fbe80500124ce6ec45d0557c88a20d56b634f5e310b91573e3c92be8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
