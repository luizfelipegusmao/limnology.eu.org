{"title":"Transplantation of Mature Argan Trees (Argania spinosa L. Skeels): Recovery Rate Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1747/v1","date":1724426200000,"content":"The present study deals with the transplantation of mature Argan trees (Argania spinosa L. Skeels) and focuses on optimizing survival rates depending on the seasons, the type of shoot pruning applied to the trees and preconditioning treatments consisting of root pruningand watering for a few months before transplanting. So far, the transplantation of this species at the adult stage has not received enough attention in spite of its ecological and socio-economic importance for the regions where it thrives. The results obtained show that transplanting in summer, autumn and winter resulted in survival rates exceeding 50%. The Argan trees transplanted in spring hardly achieved 10% survival. However, the total cutback of the crown induced survival improvement that reached a rate greater than 70% for summer, autumn and winter, and 50% for spring. Watering alone or combined with root pruning for 6 months helped improve the recovery rate but only when carried out in autumn with transplantation in spring. On the other hand, when these pre-treatments were applied in the spring to transplant the trees in summer, the recovery rate was not improved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c7e2d73775c2c617b8e674d14fa7bf3f96f9d083d8b261e72bfe6be977e52bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
