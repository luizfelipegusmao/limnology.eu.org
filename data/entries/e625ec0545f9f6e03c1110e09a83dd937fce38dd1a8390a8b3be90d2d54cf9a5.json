{"title":"Calculation of Trusses System in MATLAB - Multibody","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0003/v1","date":1727776577000,"content":"The present paper focuses on the practical application of software tools for calculating and verifying trusses systems. It covers externally and internally statically indeterminate trusses systems and compares results from two software tools. The MATLAB Simscape â€“ Multibody simulation tool, specially designed for mechanical systems, is utilized to calculate the trusses system. The model is optimized to minimize errors compared to theoretical calculations. By using blocks, it is possible to build a system, including repeating parts quickly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e625ec0545f9f6e03c1110e09a83dd937fce38dd1a8390a8b3be90d2d54cf9a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
