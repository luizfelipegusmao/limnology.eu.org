This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with FI in Indigenous families in the state of Alagoas. It was a population-based cross-sectional survey using a probabilistic sample (n=1270 families) representing the 11 ethnic groups present in the state. FI was defined according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Factors associated with moderate and severe FI were determined through multivariable analysis using Poisson regression with robust variance adjustment (prevalence ratio â€“ PR and 95% CI). The prevalence of FI was 69.1%, with 29.5% in moderate (23.2%) and severe (6.3%) forms.
