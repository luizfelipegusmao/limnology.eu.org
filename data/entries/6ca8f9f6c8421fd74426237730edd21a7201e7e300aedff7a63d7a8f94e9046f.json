Wiens</p>\r\n\r\nSub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the global burden of maternal and newborn deaths. Adverse outcomes among postpartum women and newborns occurring in the first six weeks of life are often related, though data co-examining patients are limited. This study is an exploratory analysis describing the epidemiology of postnatal complications among postpartum women and newborns following facility birth and discharge in Mbarara, Uganda. This single-site prospective cohort observational study enrolled postpartum women following facility-based delivery. To capture health information about both the postpartum women and newborns, data was collected and categorized according to domains within the continuum of care including (1) social and demographic, (2) pregnancy history and antenatal care, (3) delivery, (4) maternal discharge, and (5) newborn discharge. The primary outcomes were readmission and mortality within the six-week postnatal period as defined by the WHO. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. Among 2930 discharged dyads, 2.8% and 9.0% of women and newborns received three or more postnatal visits respectively. Readmission and deaths occurred among 108(3.6%) and 25(0.8%) newborns and in 80(2.7%) and 0(0%) women, respectively. Readmissions were related to sepsis/infection in 70(88%) women and 68(63%) newborns. Adjusted analysis found that caesarean delivery (OR:2.91; 95%CI:1.5–6.04), longer travel time to the facility (OR:1.54; 95%CI:1.24–1.91) and higher maternal heart rate at discharge (OR:1.02; 95%CI:1.00–1.01) were significantly associated with maternal readmission. Discharge taken on all patients including maternal haemoglobin (per g/dL) (OR:0.90; 95%CI:0.82–0.99), maternal symptoms (OR:1.76; 95%CI:1.02–2.91), newborn temperature (OR:1.66; 95%CI:1.28–2.13) and newborn heart rate at (OR:1.94; 95%CI:1.19–3.09) were risk factors among newborns. Readmission and death following delivery and discharge from healthcare facilities is still a problem in settings with low rates of postnatal care visits for both women and newborns. Strategies to identify vulnerable dyads and provide better access to follow-up care, are urgently required.","author":"Yashodani Pillay","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"6ca8f9f6c8421fd74426237730edd21a7201e7e300aedff7a63d7a8f94e9046f","category":"Environment"}
