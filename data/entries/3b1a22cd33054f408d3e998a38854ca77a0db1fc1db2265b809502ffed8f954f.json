{"title":"Imaging of Traumatic and Non-Traumatic Cystic Artery Bleeding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1397/v1","date":1718873782000,"content":"Cystic artery bleeding (CAB), a relatively uncommon entity, can arise from both traumatic and non-traumatic etiologies. This pictorial essay aims to elucidate the computed tomography (CT) findings associated with CAB in these distinct contexts.\nIn traumatic CAB, particularly blunt or penetrating trauma, a cystic artery lesion is the culprit behind the hemoperitoneum characteristically located within the gallbladder fossa. Prompt diagnosis is crucial. Fortunately, trans-arterial embolization offers a successful treatment option for traumatic cystic artery lesions, especially in settings where non-operative management is preferred.\nNon-traumatic CAB, on the other hand, often stems from inflammation in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system, gallbladder tumours, or iatrogenic injuries. The underlying mechanism typically involves cystic artery wall damage, either due to inflammation or procedural complications, leading to the formation of a cystic artery pseudoaneurysm (CAP). Notably, CAP bleeding can manifest long after the causative event, posing a diagnostic challenge with a variable clinical presentation.\nThis pictorial essay serves to illustrate the CT signs and features of CAB in both traumatic and non-traumatic scenarios. Additionally, it will delve into the characteristic CT appearance of CAP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b1a22cd33054f408d3e998a38854ca77a0db1fc1db2265b809502ffed8f954f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
