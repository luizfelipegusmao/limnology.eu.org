This is a significant disadvantage compared to for example scanning tunneling microscopy, where the microscopic investigation is directly integrated as a part of the same experimental setup where the samples are grown and manipulated. There is however no fundamental reason why TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) could not be similarly integrated into more comprehensive system, as we have previously demonstrated [<a href=\"#ozae044.547-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f7cdc2130d2b54eac9a68894e27710f873510fb582cd65e7d2f61d28b1b39fa2","category":"Environment"}
