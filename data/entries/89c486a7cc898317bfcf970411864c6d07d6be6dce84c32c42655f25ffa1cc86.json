{"title":"Personality in motion: How intuition and sensing personality traits relate to lower limb rebound performance","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310130","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Cyrille Gindre, Aurélien Patoz, Bastiaan Breine, Thibault Lussiana</p>\r\n\r\nEmbodied cognition asserts a symbiotic relationship between cognitive processes and the physical body, raising an intriguing question: could personality traits be intertwined with the biomechanical performance of the lower limb? This study aimed to explore this connection by examining how personality traits, assessed using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), relate to lower limb rebound power (RP) measured through the five-repetition rebound jump test. Eighty participants completed two sessions: a biomechanical analysis of hopping using an Optojump<sup>®</sup> system to measure contact time, flight time, and RP, and a personality traits assessment categorizing traits across four MBTI axes: extraversion-introversion (favorite world); sensing-intuition (information processing preference); thinking-feeling (decision making); and judging-perceiving (structure). Participant characteristics did not significantly differ across MBTI axes (<i>p</i>≥0.07), minimizing potential confounding factors. Notably, individuals classified as intuitive showed significantly longer flight times (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and larger RP (<i>p</i> = 0.007) compared to sensing individuals, suggesting a greater reliance on the fast stretch-shortening cycle and showcasing superior use of their lower limb structures as springs. This suggests potential implications for sports performance, with intuition individuals possibly excelling in plyometric sports. However, no significant associations were found between biomechanical performance and the other three MBTI axes (<i>p</i>≥0.12), challenging the initial hypothesis. This research provides initial insights into the nuanced relationship between personality traits and movement patterns, indicating the potential for tailored physical interventions to enhance adherence and optimize responses in training programs.","author":"Cyrille Gindre","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"89c486a7cc898317bfcf970411864c6d07d6be6dce84c32c42655f25ffa1cc86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
