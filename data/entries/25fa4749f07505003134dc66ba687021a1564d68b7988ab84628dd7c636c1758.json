{"title":"Best practices for collecting and preserving marine mammal biological samples in the ‘omics era","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13148?af=R","date":1728664220000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The recent rise of ‘omics and other molecular research technologies alongside improved techniques for tissue preservation have broadened the scope of marine mammal research. Collecting biological samples from wild marine mammals is both logistically challenging and expensive. To enhance the power of marine mammal research, great effort has been made in both the field and the laboratory to ensure the scientific integrity of samples from collection through processing, supporting the long-term use of precious samples across a broad range of studies. However, identifying the best methods of sample preservation can be challenging, especially as this technological toolkit continues to evolve and expand. Standardizing best practices could maximize the scientific value of biological samples, foster multi-institutional collaborative efforts across fields, and improve the quality of individual studies by removing potential sources of error from the collection, handling, and preservation processes. With these aims in mind, we summarize relevant literature, share current expert knowledge, and suggest best practices for sample collection and preservation. This manuscript is intended as a reference resource for scientists interested in exploring collaborative studies and preserving samples in a suitable manner for a broad spectrum of analyses, emphasizing support for ‘omics technologies.</p>","author":"Amy M.
