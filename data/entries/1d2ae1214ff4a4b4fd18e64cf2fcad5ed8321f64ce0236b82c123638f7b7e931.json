{"title":"Glutathione: a key modulator of plant defence and metabolism through multiple mechanisms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/15/4549/7659248?rss=1","date":1714176000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Redox reactions are fundamental to energy conversion in living cells, and also determine and tune responses to the environment. Within this context, the tripeptide glutathione plays numerous roles. As an important antioxidant, glutathione confers redox stability on the cell and also acts as an interface between signalling pathways and metabolic reactions that fuel growth and development. It also contributes to the assembly of cell components, biosynthesis of sulfur-containing metabolites, inactivation of potentially deleterious compounds, and control of hormonal signalling intensity. The multiplicity of these roles probably explains why glutathione status has been implicated in influencing plant responses to many different conditions. In particular, there is now a considerable body of evidence showing that glutathione is a crucial player in governing the outcome of biotic stresses. This review provides an overview of glutathione synthesis, transport, degradation, and redox turnover in plants. It examines the expression of genes associated with these processes during pathogen challenge and related conditions, and considers the diversity of mechanisms by which glutathione can influence protein function and gene expression.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"1d2ae1214ff4a4b4fd18e64cf2fcad5ed8321f64ce0236b82c123638f7b7e931","category":"Environment"}
