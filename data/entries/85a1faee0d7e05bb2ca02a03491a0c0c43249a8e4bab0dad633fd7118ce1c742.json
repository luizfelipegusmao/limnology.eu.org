{"title":"Placental Lesions in Birth Asphyxia and Hypoxic-Ischemic Syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0830/v1","date":1710408234000,"content":"Introduction: Birth Asphyxia is a severe condition that includes many potential pathways of occurrence both in utero and during childbirth. We aimed to identify and describe specific macroscopic and microscopic placental injuries in birth asphyxia to serve as a quick tool to stratify a newborn’s potential further evolution, as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy can be responsible for neonatal death or severe neurologic sequelae further compromising the affected persons’ quality of life. \nMaterials and methods: We conducted an observational prospective study over 3 years. 62 patients diagnosed with birth asphyxia which had placental histopathological examination performed were enrolled. The control group consisted of 69 term newborns that required neonatal intensive care for at least three days, in the same period, for any other reason and that also had available placental exams. In our study, placental histopathological lesions identified in birth asphyxia have been classified according to Amsterdam Criteria. \nResults: We analysed data gathered from both groups by applying specific statistical tests for each type of variable and hypothesis. Thus, umbilical cord abnormalities were associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in a statistically significant manner when comparing the birth asphyxia group of newborns with the control group. Also, we identified a high statistical level of significance for maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion and the occurrence of hypoxic-ischemic syndrome when comparing the two groups (p = .00). \nConclusion: The macroscopic and microscopic placental examination can provide important information on the evolution of the disease in selected newborns according to the identified lesions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85a1faee0d7e05bb2ca02a03491a0c0c43249a8e4bab0dad633fd7118ce1c742","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
