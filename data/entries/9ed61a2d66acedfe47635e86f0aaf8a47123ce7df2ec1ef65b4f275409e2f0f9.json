At the finest-resolution spatial scale, that is, field sampling locations, distributional aggregation level of different species would be determined by various factors, for example spatial autocorrelation or environmental filtering. However, few studies have quantitatively measured the importance of these factors.\n\nIn this study, inspired by the statistical properties of a Markov transition model, we propose a novel additive framework to partition local multispecies distributional aggregation levels for sequential sampling-derived field biodiversity data. The framework partitions the spatial distributional aggregation of different species into two independent components: regional abundance variability and the local spatial inertia effect.\n\nEmpirical studies from field amphibian surveys through line-transect sampling in southwestern China (Minya Konka) and central-southern Vietnam showed that local spatial inertia was always the dominant mechanism structuring the local occurrence and distributional aggregation of amphibians in the two regions with a latitudinal gradient from 1200 to nearly 4000 m. However, regional abundance variability is still nonnegligible in highly diverse tropical regions (i.e. Vietnam) where the altitude is not higher than 2000 m.\n\nIn summary, we propose a novel framework that shows that the multispecies distributional aggregation level can be structured by two additive components. The two partitioned components could be theoretically independent. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of the local community structure from the perspective of both spatial distribution and regional diversity patterns. The partitioning framework might have potential applications in field ecology and macroecology research.\n</p>","author":"Na Wu, \nHoang Van Chung, \nShengchao Shi, \nXiaoqin Shi, \nFangyao Liu, \nJianping Jiang, \nYouhua Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"9ed61a2d66acedfe47635e86f0aaf8a47123ce7df2ec1ef65b4f275409e2f0f9","category":"Environment"}
