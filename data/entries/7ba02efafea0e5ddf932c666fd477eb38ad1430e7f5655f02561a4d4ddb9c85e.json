{"title":"Power law of path multiplicity in complex networks","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae228/7688134?rss=1","date":1717545600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. As a fundamental concept of graph theory, the path connecting nodes and edges plays a vital role in network science. Rather than focusing on the path length or path centrality, here we draw attention to the path multiplicity related to decision-making efficiency, which is defined as the number of shortest paths between node pairs and thus characterizes the routing choice diversity. Notably, through extensive empirical investigations from this new perspective, we surprisingly observe a “hesitant-world” feature along with the “small-world” feature and find a universal power-law of the path multiplicity, meaning that a small number of node pairs possess high path multiplicity. We demonstrate that the power-law of path multiplicity is much stronger than the power-law of node degree, which is known as the scale-free property. Then, we show that these phenomena cannot be captured by existing classical network models. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the path multiplicity and existing typical network metrics, such as average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, assortativity coefficient, and node centralities. We demonstrate that the path multiplicity is a distinctive network metric. These results expand our knowledge of network structure and provide a novel viewpoint for network design and optimization with significant potential applications in biological, social, and man-made networks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"7ba02efafea0e5ddf932c666fd477eb38ad1430e7f5655f02561a4d4ddb9c85e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
