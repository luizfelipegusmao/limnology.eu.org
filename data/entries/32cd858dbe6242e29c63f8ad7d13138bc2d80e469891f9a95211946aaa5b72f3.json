{"title":"Exploring the Dual Benefits of Fermented and Non-fermented Garlic on Growth, Antioxidative Capacity, Immune Responses, and Histology in Grey Mullet (Liza ramada)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0533/v1","date":1725613907000,"content":"This study investigated the effects of dietary garlic powder and fermented garlic powder supplementation at 1% and 2% levels on growth performance, digestive tract efficacy, blood biochemistry, immunity, and antioxidant status of Liza ramada (n=225 fish; 86.00Â±0.42 g) over a 60-day period. Fish fed diets supplemented with both forms of garlic at both levels exhibited significantly improved final body weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio compared to the control group. Digestive enzyme activities (amylase, lipase, and protease) were significantly enhanced in all supplemented groups. Blood biochemical analysis revealed reduced glucose levels and increased total protein in garlic-supplemented groups, with no adverse effects on liver or kidney function markers. Immune parameters, including lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity against Streptococcus agalactiae, alternative complement pathway (ACP), and, respiratory burst (NBT) were significantly enhanced in garlic-supplemented groups, with fermented garlic showing more pronounced effects. Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GPx) were also significantly increased in all supplemented groups, particularly in those fed fermented garlic. No significant differences in survival rates were observed among treatments. The results suggest that both garlic powder and fermented garlic powder supplementation, especially at the 2% level, can effectively improve growth, feed utilization, immune function, and antioxidant status in L. ramada. Fermented garlic generally demonstrated superior effects, indicating its potential as a beneficial feed additive in aquaculture. Based on these findings, it is recommended to incorporate fermented garlic powder at a 2% level in L. ramada diets to optimize growth performance and health status. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of this supplementation strategy in commercial aquaculture settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32cd858dbe6242e29c63f8ad7d13138bc2d80e469891f9a95211946aaa5b72f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
