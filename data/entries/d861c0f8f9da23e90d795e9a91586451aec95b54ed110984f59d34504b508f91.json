Beyond vaccines, nanotechnology holds promise in fields such as immunotherapy and targeted drug delivery. Yet, while nanoparticles have opened new avenues for therapy, understanding their cellular uptake and drug release mechanisms remains a challenge. Investigating these processes at the microscopic level is crucial for advancing our knowledge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d861c0f8f9da23e90d795e9a91586451aec95b54ed110984f59d34504b508f91","category":"Environment"}
