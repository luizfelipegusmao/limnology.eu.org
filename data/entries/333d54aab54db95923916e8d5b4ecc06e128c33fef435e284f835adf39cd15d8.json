{"title":"AI&rsquo;s Role in Fortifying Cyber Defenses: A 2024 Perspective on Machine and Deep Learning Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0550/v1","date":1725874640000,"content":"By 2024, artificial intelligence (AI) will have had a revolutionary impact on cyber security, putting the sector at a critical turning point. This article explores the significant influence AI has had on cyber security procedures, outlining the progress made as well as the difficulties faced. artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed threat detection and response systems, allowing for proactive security tactics against a constantly changing array of cyber threats. By utilizing neural networks and machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) systems can predict possible security breaches, detect unusual trends, and automatically reduce risks in real-time. These capabilities are unparalleled. Nevertheless, despite these impressive advancements, worries about data privacy, adversarial attacks, and ethical ramifications remain significant. Moreover, the never-ending game of cat and mouse between cyber attackers and defenders continues, requiring constant innovation and adaptability in cyber security strategies driven by Artificial Intelligence. In addition to providing insights into its implications for protecting digital assets and bolstering resilience against cyber threats in the changing cyber security scenario of 2024, this paper summarizes the current state of the artificial intelligence revolution in cyber security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"333d54aab54db95923916e8d5b4ecc06e128c33fef435e284f835adf39cd15d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
