{"title":"Unlocking the Future of Drug Development: Generative AI, Digital Twins, and Beyond","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0919/v1","date":1710526267000,"content":"This article delves into the intersection of generative AI and digital twins within drug discovery, exploring their synergistic potential to revolutionize pharmaceutical research and development. Through various instances and examples, we illuminate how generative AI algorithms, capable of simulating vast chemical spaces and predicting molecular properties, are increasingly integrated with digital twins of biological systems to expedite drug discovery. By harnessing the power of computational models and machine learning, researchers can design novel compounds tailored to specific targets, optimize drug candidates, and simulate their behavior within virtual biological environments. This paradigm shift offers unprecedented opportunities for accelerating drug development, reducing costs, and, ultimately, improving patient outcomes. As we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape, collaboration between interdisciplinary teams and continued innovation will be paramount in realizing the promise of generative AI and digital twins in advancing drug discovery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f640dcacda83ee2421d5221f56360096edd3eb9551f6b3594a55cf2c88d66782","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
