{"title":"Upscaling and Risk Evaluation of the Synthesis of the 3-5-Diamino-1H-Pyrazole, Disperazol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1657/v1","date":1716795994000,"content":"This paper presents the work done to transition the lab scale synthesis (1 g) to a large scale (400 g) synthesis of the 3-5-diamino-1H-Pyrazole Disperazol; a new pharmaceutical for treatment of antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections. The potentially hazardous diazotisation step in the lab scale synthesis was transformed to a safe and easy to handle flow chemistry step. Additionally, the paper presents an OSHA recommended safety assessment of the active compound E, performed by Fauske and Associates, LLC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4f3337a455afdbf3129fc71e93c97fe5d0a7a8dcad0932a857a342f1e789868","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
