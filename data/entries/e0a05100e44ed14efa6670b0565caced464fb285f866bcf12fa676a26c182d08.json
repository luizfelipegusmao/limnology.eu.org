{"title":"Evaluation of variability in performance and paw placement patterns by dogs completing the dog walk obstacle in an agility competition","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299592","date":1709906400000,"content":"<p>by Juli K.

It was hypothesized that dogs would demonstrate defined sets of paw placement patterns as they complete the dog walk obstacle and that those could be classified based on end contact behavior. Videos of 296 dogs attempting the dog walk obstacle at the 2021 UK Agility International (UKI) US Open were reviewed online. Data observed from video evaluation included front and rear limb paw placement across the dog walk and time to complete the obstacle. Results showed a high variability in obstacle performance. Mean time to complete the entire obstacle was 2.26 seconds (sd = 1.03). Mean and median completion times were qualitatively similar across all height classes. A slight majority of dogs hit the up ramp with their right foot first indicating running on their left lead (n = 185, 63%) with some variation observed between heights. Likewise, a slight majority (58%) of dogs hit the down ramp with their right front foot first (151/262). Given the high variation in completion times and paw placements, we could not identify clear patterns of dog walk performance. The large amount of variation observed with the dog walk obstacle suggests a need for future studies to employ alternative methods for objective gait analysis and to strategically select dogs to reflect the large variety in obstacle performance observed here.","author":"Juli K.
