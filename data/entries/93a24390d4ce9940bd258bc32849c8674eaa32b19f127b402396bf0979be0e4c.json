{"title":"MicroRNA397 promotes rice flowering by regulating the photorespiration pathway","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2101/7444905?rss=1","date":1700697600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The precise timing of flowering plays a pivotal role in ensuring successful plant reproduction and seed production. This process is intricately governed by complex genetic networks that integrate internal and external signals. This study delved into the regulatory function of microRNA397 (miR397) and its target gene <span>LACCASE-15</span> (<span>OsLAC15</span>) in modulating flowering traits in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). Overexpression of miR397 led to earlier heading dates, decreased number of leaves on the main stem, and accelerated differentiation of the spikelet meristem. Conversely, overexpression of <span>OsLAC15</span> resulted in delayed flowering and prolonged vegetative growth. Through biochemical and physiological assays, we uncovered that miR397-<span>OsLAC15</span> had a profound impact on carbohydrate accumulation and photosynthetic assimilation, consequently enhancing the photosynthetic intensity in miR397-overexpressing rice plants. Notably, we identified that OsLAC15 is at least partially localized within the peroxisome organelle, where it regulates the photorespiration pathway. Moreover, we observed that a high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration could rescue the late flowering phenotype in <span>OsLAC15</span>-overexpressing plants. These findings shed valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms of miR397-<span>OsLAC15</span> in rice flowering and provided potential strategies for developing crop varieties with early flowering and high-yield traits through genetic breeding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"93a24390d4ce9940bd258bc32849c8674eaa32b19f127b402396bf0979be0e4c","category":"Environment"}
