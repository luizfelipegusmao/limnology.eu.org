{"title":"Hybrid Machine Learning for Stunting Prevalence: A Novel Comprehensive Approach to Classification, Prediction, and Clustering Optimization in Aceh, Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0485/v1","date":1725608012000,"content":"Stunting is a major public health issue in Aceh, Indonesia, requiring advanced analytical techniques for effective interventions. This study presents a novel hybrid machine learning framework designed to enhance the analysis of stunting through improved classification, predic-tive modeling, and clustering optimization. The framework utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Sigmoid kernels for classification. The RBF kernel achieved an accuracy of 91.3%, significantly outperforming the Sigmoid kernel's 85.6%. Linear Regression was employed for predictive modeling, yielding a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.137, which indicates strong predictive accuracy. In clustering, the optimized K-Medoids method, in-corporating a weight product approach, demonstrated superior efficiency by requiring only 3 iterations for convergence, compared to 7 iterations for the conventional K-Medoids method. Additionally, it achieved a higher Calinski Harabasz Index of 93.7, compared to 85.2 for the conventional method. This comprehensive approach enhances accuracy and efficiency across classification, prediction, and clustering tasks, providing valuable insights for targeted interventions and policy development to address stunting in Aceh.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad6d40b938e53c90aee90224b27579a26b759a774797868f5d08b4e5875edf9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
