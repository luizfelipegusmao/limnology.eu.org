{"title":"In situ microscopy techniques for understanding Li plating and stripping in solid-state batteries","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/2/184/7458743?rss=1","date":1701734400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Solid-state batteries have potential to realize a rechargeable Li-metal anode. However, several challenges persist in the charging and discharging processes of the Li-metal anode, which require a fundamental understanding of Li plating and stripping across the interface of solid-state electrolytes (SEs) to address. This review overviews studies on Li-metal anodes in solid-state batteries using <span>in situ</span> observation techniques with an emphasis on Li electrodeposition and dissolution using scanning electron microscopy and SEs such as lithium phosphorus oxynitride and garnet-type compounds such as Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. The previous research is categorized into three topics: (i) Li nucleation, growth and dissolution at the anode-free interface, (ii) electrochemical reduction of SE and (iii) short-circuit phenomena in SE. The current trends of each topic are summarized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"b413942e022b7e8a702a976eca112aa9d2a2e1aec71c98fb549b579c4dd185ab","category":"Environment"}
