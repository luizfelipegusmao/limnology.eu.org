{"title":"Bacterial abscesses in whitespotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) in managed care","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13917?af=R","date":1705722877000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Sixteen whitespotted bamboo sharks (<i>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</i>) with histologically similar bacterial abscesses were submitted to Northwest ZooPath from nine zoo and aquarium institutions over a 17-year period. These abscesses were characterized by inflammatory cell infiltrates and necrosis with intralesional small, Gram-positive, acid-fast negative, cocci bacteria. The clinical presentation, histologic findings, and culture results indicate that <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is a relatively common cause of these lesions in whitespotted bamboo sharks. This organism also provides a treatment challenge due to its inherent antibiotic-resistant properties and ability to form biofilms, confounding the host's immune response. <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> represents an important cause for abscess formation and cellulitis in captive whitespotted bamboo sharks.</p>","author":"Alexandra K.
