{"title":"Sociodemographics and Lifestyle Cancer Risk Factors among a Population of Caribbean Immigrants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2275/v1","date":1727686832000,"content":"Abstract: Aim: The aim in this study was to conduct a prospective survey regarding the socio-demographics and lifestyle risk factors for cancer of a population of Caribbean immigrants living in the U.S. Materials and Methods: The data were processed and analysed using SPSS software 27 and Excel. Crosstabulations were performed. The chi-square test was used to evaluate differ-ent hypotheses. Statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05. Results: Statistically significant differences in the country of birth of the Caribbean immigrants were found for sex (p = 0.038) and the cleanness of their neighbourhoods (p = 0.045). We found differences in occupations between men and women (p = 0.001). Men were less unemployed than women (p = 0.011). Sex also showed statistically significant differences in how easily the immigrants balanced their work and per-sonal life (p = 0.044). Age groups depicted differences in the physical health of the immigrants (p = 0.001). The use of alcohol and tobacco was not an important risk factor among participants (p = 0.529). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the sociodemographics risk factors for cancer among a population of Caribbean immigrants were significantly different between the sexes. However, the use of tobacco and alcohol showed insignificant differences among the immigrants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfcd2dafb4cd147cae633d3c486f717ad3e124b5c90efb12005650d9f5b53f29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
