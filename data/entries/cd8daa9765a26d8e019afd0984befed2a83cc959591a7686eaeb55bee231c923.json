{"title":"Measuring cancer driving force of chromosomal aberrations through multi-layer Boolean implication networks","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301591","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Ilaria Cosentini, Daniele Filippo Condorelli, Giorgio Locicero, Alfredo Ferro, Alfredo Pulvirenti, Vincenza Barresi, Salvatore Alaimo</p>\r\n\r\nMulti-layer Complex networks are commonly used for modeling and analysing biological entities. This paper presents the advantage of using COMBO (Combining Multi Bio Omics) to suggest a new role of the chromosomal aberration as a cancer driver factor. Exploiting the heterogeneous multi-layer networks, COMBO integrates gene expression and DNA-methylation data in order to identify complex bilateral relationships between transcriptome and epigenome. We evaluated the multi-layer networks generated by COMBO on different TCGA cancer datasets (COAD, BLCA, BRCA, CESC, STAD) focusing on the effect of a specific chromosomal numerical aberration, broad gain in chromosome 20, on different cancer histotypes. In addition, the effect of chromosome 8q amplification was tested in the same TCGA cancer dataset. The results demonstrate the ability of COMBO to identify the chromosome 20 amplification cancer driver force in the different TCGA Pan Cancer project datasets.","author":"Ilaria Cosentini","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cd8daa9765a26d8e019afd0984befed2a83cc959591a7686eaeb55bee231c923","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
