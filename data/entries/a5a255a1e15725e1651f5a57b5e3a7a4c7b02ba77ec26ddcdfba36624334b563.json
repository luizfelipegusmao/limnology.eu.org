{"title":"Understanding Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Neurochemical Changes using Alzheimer’s Disease Biofluid, PET, Postmortem Pathology Biomarkers and APOE Genotype","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1848/v1","date":1724696057000,"content":"In vivo proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a powerful noninvasive method which can measure Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related neuropathological alterations at the molecular level. AD biomarkers include amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles. These biomarkers can be detected via postmortem analysis, but also in living individuals through positron emission tomography (PET) or biofluid biomarkers of Aβ and tau. This review offers an overview of biochemical abnormalities detected by 1H MRS within the biologically defined AD spectrum. It includes a summary of earlier studies that explored the association of 1H MRS metabolites with biofluid, PET, and postmortem AD biomarkers, and examined how apolipoprotein e4 allele carrier status influences brain biochemistry. Studying these associations is crucial for understanding how AD pathology affects brain homeostasis throughout the AD continuum and may eventually facilitate to develop potential novel therapeutic approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5a255a1e15725e1651f5a57b5e3a7a4c7b02ba77ec26ddcdfba36624334b563","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
