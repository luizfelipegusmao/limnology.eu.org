Eleven ruminally cannulated steers [body weight (BW) = 352 kg ± 27] were blocked into 3 groups based on initial BW. Before the start of the experiment, animals were consuming a forage-based diet as well as adapted to the headbox style respiration chambers. Additionally, before the experiment, gas emission data were collected over a 24-h period when cattle received an ad libitum forage-based diet for use as a covariate in the statistical analysis. For the experiment, steers were moved into headboxes at the conclusion of a 24-h fast and subsequently received 1 of 2 treatment diets: control (CON), forage-based diet or acidosis (AC), concentrate-based diet. Steers remained in the headboxes for 48 h. Gas concentrations from each headbox were collected hourly and analyzed with an infrared photoacoustic gas analyzer. Ruminal pH, fecal pH, volatile fatty acids, and lactate were also measured during the acidosis challenge. Data were analyzed with the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4. A treatment × day effect (<span>P</span> = 0.03) was observed for dry matter intake with intake being similar for both CON and AC steers on d 1 but AC steers consuming 2.02 kg less on d 2. Treatment affected ruminal pH (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) as CON steers had a greater ruminal pH than AC steers. Greater total volatile fatty acids (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) were observed for steers on AC treatment compared with CON. A treatment × time interaction (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) was observed for ruminal lactate concentration with AC steers having greater concentrations from h 16 to 36. Fecal pH was affected by a treatment × time interaction (<span>P</span> = 0.05) as AC steers had lower fecal pH from h 24 to h 32. Over the 48-h observation period, there was a treatment × time interaction (<span>P</span> = 0.04) for carbon dioxide production as AC steers produced less CO<sub>2</sub> after h 24. No treatment × time interaction was detected for oxygen consumption. However, there was a time effect (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Respiratory quotient was not affected by treatment, day, or their interaction (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.19). Heat production tended (<span>P</span> = 0.06) to be different between treatments, with AC having less heat production than CON. Thus, the effects of ruminal acidosis on gas emissions and energetics may be more transient during the time course of an acidotic bout or have a longer duration even after ruminal pH has recovered.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2ba67eff1c58d8c4479814a807f03d517ace4f93bf199b63aa46ac677cab1472","category":"Environment"}
