{"title":"Review of Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Technology for Renewable Methanol (e-MeOH): Recent Developments, Emerging Trends and Prospects for the Cement Plant Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0956/v1","date":1726121855000,"content":"The cement industry is a significant contributor (around 8 %) to CO2 global emissions. About 60 % of emissions come from limestone calcination, essential for clinker production, while 40 % result from fuel combustion. Reducing these emissions is challenging due to limestone’s role as the primary raw material for cement. Cement plants are required to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, as outlined in the 13th United Nations Sustainable Goals. One strategy to achieve this goal, involves Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU). Among the options for CO2 utilisation, the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) strategy offers a means to mitigate CO2 emissions. In PtL, CO2 captured from cement industrial flue gas is combined with hydrogen generated by renewable electrolysis (green hydrogen) and catalytically converted into renewable methanol (e-MeOH). In this sense, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the worldwide existing pilot and demonstration units, and projects funded by EU across several industries. It specifically focuses on PtL technology worldwide within cement plants. This work covers 18 locations worldwide, detailing technology existent at plants of different capacities, location, and project partners. Finally, the review analyses techno-economic assessments related to e-MeOH production processes, highlighting the potential impact on achieving carbon neutrality in the cement industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cc90e76390591889ee50dfcf79ac4859413e855c1b82ca59eb4e21ca84121a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
