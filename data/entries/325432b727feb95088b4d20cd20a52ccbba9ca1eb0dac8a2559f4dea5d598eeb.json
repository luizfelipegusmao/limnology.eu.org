{"title":"Carbazolyl-Modified Neutral Ir(III) Complexes for Efficient Detection of Picric Acid in Aqueous Media","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1461/v1","date":1716425729000,"content":"Based on the electron-deficient property of picric acid (PA), two neutral Ir(III) complexes 1 and 2 modified with the electron-rich carbazolyl groups were synthesized and characterized. Both 1 and 2 exhibit aggregation-induced phosphorescence emission (AIPE) properties in THF/H2O. Among them, 2 is extremely sensitive for detecting PA with a limit of detection of 0.15 Î¼M in THF/H2O. Furthermore, the selectivity for PA is significantly higher compared to other analytes, enabling efficient detection of PA in four common water samples. The density functional theory calculations and the spectroscopic results confirm that the sensing mechanism is photo-induced electron transfer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"325432b727feb95088b4d20cd20a52ccbba9ca1eb0dac8a2559f4dea5d598eeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
