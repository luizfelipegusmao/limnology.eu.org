{"title":"Recent Updates of PET in Lymphoma: FDG and Beyond","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0867/v1","date":1726043905000,"content":"Lymphoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide, categorized into Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) has become an essential imaging tool for evaluating patients with lymphoma in terms of initial diagnosis, staging, prognostication, and treatment response assessment. Recent advancements in imaging technology and methodologies, along with the development of artificial intelligence, have revolutionized the evaluation of complex imaging data, enhancing the diagnostic and predictive power of PET in lymphoma. However, FDG is not cancer-specific, but it primarily reflects glucose metabolism, which has prompted the investigation of alternative PET tracers to address this limitation. Novel PET radiotracers, such as fibroblast activation protein inhibitors targeting the tumor microenvironment, have recently shown promising results in evaluating various malignancies compared to FDG PET. Furthermore, with the rapid advancements in immunotherapy and the favorable imaging properties of 89Zr, immunoPET has emerged as a promising modality, offering insights into the functional and molecular status of the immune system. ImmunoPET can also facilitate the development of new antibody therapeutics and radioimmunotherapy by providing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. This review provides comprehensive insights into the current clinical applications of FDG PET in lymphoma, while also exploring novel PET imaging radiotracers beyond FDG, discussing their mechanisms of action and potential impact on patient management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"319d6a5a46c854b04ff34574b134a12dfd54b1ab2b5b496e092d40ebacbd6aea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
