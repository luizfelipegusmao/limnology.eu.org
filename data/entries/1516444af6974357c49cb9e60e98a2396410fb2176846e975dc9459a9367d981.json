In a scanning electron microscope (SEM), usually the backscattered and emitted electrons from the sample surface are recorded by the available detectors. The used electron energy is typically at 30keV or lower. If a thin sample is to be measured in transmission, single cell or multi-channel STEM diodes are used to collect STEM images at a fixed distance below the sample, as there is no optical lens between the sample and the detector. This allows for basic bright field (BF) or differential phase contrast (DPC) signatures to be measured.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1516444af6974357c49cb9e60e98a2396410fb2176846e975dc9459a9367d981","category":"Environment"}
