A concrete method to use ‘SOMRE’ and ‘VED’ as ‘the earth medicine’ is proposed. Part 1 describes ‘SOMRE’ helping the growth of vegetables, grains, flowers, herbs, endangered and native plants in the Gobi Desert. It increased plant-based food and achieved greening a part of the Gobi Desert. Part 2 explains ‘VED’, increasing the production of cashmere wool in goats, dramatically improving their reproductivity and their meat production. In humans, it demonstrated to eliminate the itchiness, skin spots, and acne scars, improved wound healing and ED, etc. It has the potential to be used as a treatment for dementia and osteoporosis. Part 3 is the experimental part. Following the described procedures, readers can get hold of ‘SOMRE’, ‘VED’ and related compounds which are a treasure trove of pharmacologically active substances and new ideas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfda950aacc1f1e83dbdc14d7df380d8e80563685424c1ddea428776830e1af4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
