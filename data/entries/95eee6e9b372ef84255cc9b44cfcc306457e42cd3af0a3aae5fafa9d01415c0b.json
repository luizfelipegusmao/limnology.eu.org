{"title":"Light Distortion Analyzer and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0908/v1","date":1720694304000,"content":"This narrative review synthesizes recent basic and clinical research on visual disturbances in low-light environments, highlighting evaluation techniques for these conditions. It focuses on the degradation of visual acuity under dim lighting, exacerbated by pupil dilation, known as night vision disturbances (NVD). Key contributors to NVD include optical scattering, intraocular diffraction, ocular aberrations, and uncorrected refractive errors, all significantly impacting quality of life and functional abilities. The review also examines the effects of aging, eye disorders, surgical interventions, and corneal irregularities on NVD. It details the definitions, distinctions, and measurement methodologies for various optical phenomena, using both objective and subjective approaches, such as visual function questionnaires, simulators, and the Light Distortion Analyzer (LDA). The LDA is validated for clinical characterization and quantification of light distortion, proving useful in both clinical and research settings. The review advocates for continued innovation in therapeutic interventions to improve patient outcomes and alleviate the impact of visual disturbances.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95eee6e9b372ef84255cc9b44cfcc306457e42cd3af0a3aae5fafa9d01415c0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
