{"title":"Modulation of fried spring roll wrapper quality upon treatment of batter with maltogenic amylase, transglutaminase and bromelain","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13470?af=R","date":1711602251000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Fried foods are favored for their unique crispiness, golden color and flavor, but they also face great challenge because of their high oil content, high calories and the existence of compounds such as acrylamide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Long-term consumption of fried foods may adversely affect health. Therefore, it is necessary to explore fried foods with lower oil contents and a high quality to meet the demand.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A method of enzyme treatment was explored to investigate the effects of maltogenic amylase (MA), transglutaminase (TG) and bromelain (BRO) on the physicochemical properties of the batter and the quality of fried spring roll wrapper (FSRW). The results showed that the MA-, TG- or BRO-treated batters had a significant shear-thinning behavior, especially with an increase in viscosity upon increasing TG contents. FSRW enhanced its fracturability from 419.19 g (Control) to 616.50 g (MA-6 U g<sup>−1</sup>), 623.49 g (TG-0.75 U g<sup>−1</sup>) and 644.96 g (BRO-10 U g<sup>−1</sup>). Meanwhile, in comparison with BRO and MA, TG-0.5 U g<sup>−1</sup> endowed batter with the highest density and thermal stability. MA-15 U g<sup>−1</sup> and TG-0.5 U g<sup>−1</sup> displayed FSRW with uniform and dense pores, and significantly reduced its oil content by 18.05% and 25.02%, respectively. Moreover, compared to MA and TG, BRO-50 U g<sup>−1</sup> improved the flavor of FSRW.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>MA, TG or BRO played a key role in affecting the physicochemical properties of the batter and the quality of FSRW. TG-0.5 U g<sup>−1</sup> remarkly reduced the oil content of FSRW with a great potential in practical application. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jia‐Lin Wang, \nMeng‐Jin Sun, \nZheng‐Meng Pei, \nZhi Zheng, \nShui‐Zhong Luo, \nYan‐Yan Zhao, \nXi‐Yang Zhong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"db5c9d39df713e242ea8d51e15799fcc872eff06699f05706e0cc4bc2c97796d","category":"Environment"}
