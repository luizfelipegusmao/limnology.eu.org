{"title":"A Benefaction of Flavonoids as EpigeneticÂ Modulators for Effective Cancer Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0980/v1","date":1720694329000,"content":"Histone changes that are adjustable and transmitted without altering the DNA sequence are part of epigenetic control. In many disorders, most famously malignancy, abnormal genetic information is seen as a result of mismanagement of typical epigenetic mechanisms. A paradigm change in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer has been brought about by recent discoveries about the processes of epigenetic modifications, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNAs implicated in the changed expression patterns of tumor cells. There is a significant increase in the search for drugs that could alter the epigenetic environment altered by tumor cells and benefit from their therapeutic potential. Phytochemicals with a high concentration of naturally produced phenol molecules known as flavonoids can regulate genomic processes. Understanding the precise epigenetic alterations brought on by flavonoid-mediated mechanisms is necessary to develop combination therapy techniques and genomic therapies for cancer. This article aims to thoroughly examine the epigenetic modifications of flavonoids, including their anticancer properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d01027c2ba3a54109cf3e9a2a10b015fed8d7fa17150126476b64153f6b8d6ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
