However, this burden has not been well characterised in adults. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of self-reported diagnosed asthma and associated factors in urban and rural adults in Malawi, Southern Africa. Within a cross-sectional population-based survey to determine the burden and risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the city of Lilongwe and rural Karonga district, we collected information on self-reported previously diagnosed asthma and asthma-related symptoms using an interviewer-led questionnaire. Other data collected included: demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status indicators, NCD comorbidities, environmental exposures, and anthropometric measurements. We used multivariable logistic regression models to explore factors associated with self-reported asthma adjusting for variables associated with the outcome in univariable analysis. Findings were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. We analysed data from 30,483 adult participants (54.6% urban,45.4% rural and 61.9% female). A prior asthma diagnosis was reported in 5.1% of urban and 4.5% of rural participants. In urban females, being obese (&gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with greater odds of asthma (OR = 1.59, 95% CI [1.26–2.01], p&lt;0.001), after adjusting for confounders. We observed associations between previously diagnosed heart disease and asthma in female participants which remained significant in rural females after Bonferroni correction (OR = 2.30,95%CI [1.32–4.02], p = 0.003). Among rural males, current smokers had reduced odds of diagnosed asthma (OR = 0.46,95%CI [0.27–0.79], p = 0.004) compared to those who had never smoked. In Malawi the prevalence of self-reported diagnosed asthma was greatest in females and urban dwellers. Notably, our findings indicate relationships between excess body weight as well as comorbidities and diagnosed asthma in females. Future investigations using longitudinally collected data and clinical measurements of asthma are needed to better understand these associations.","author":"Abena S.
