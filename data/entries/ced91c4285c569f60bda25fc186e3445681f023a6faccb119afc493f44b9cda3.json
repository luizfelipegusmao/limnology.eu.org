{"title":"Evaluation of Combining Plasma COX-2/PGE2 Ratio and Anti-nucleosome Autoantibodies as Possible Biomarkers for Clinically Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0811/v1","date":1720599274000,"content":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by re-stricted and repetitive behaviors as well as difficulties with social interaction. Nu-merous studies have revealed aberrant lipid mediators and autoimmunity as a recog-nized etiological cause of ASD that is amenable to therapeutic intervention. \nMethods: In this study, the relationship between the relative cyclooxygenase-2, / pros-taglandin E2 ratio (COX-2/PGE2) as lipid mediator marker and anti-nucleosome au-toantibodies as autoimmunity marker of ASD was investigated using multiple regres-sion and combined receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. The study also sought to identify the linear combination of these variables that optimizes the partial area under the ROC curves. There were forty ASD children and forty age- and sex-matched controls included in the current study.\nResults: Using combined ROC curve analysis, a notable increase in the area under the curve was seen. Additionally, it was reported that the combined markers had improved specificity and sensitivity.\nConclusions: This study shows that using a ROC curve analysis to measure the predictive value of specific biomarkers linked to lipid metabolism and autoimmunity in children with ASD should improve our understanding of the etiological mechanism of ASD and how it is related to metabolism. Early diagnosis and intervention may be facilitated by this knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ced91c4285c569f60bda25fc186e3445681f023a6faccb119afc493f44b9cda3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
