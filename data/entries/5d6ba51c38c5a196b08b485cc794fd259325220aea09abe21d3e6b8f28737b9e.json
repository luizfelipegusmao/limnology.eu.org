{"title":"Spatio-temporal Evolution and Drivers of High-quality Utilization of Urban Land in Chinese Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0493/v1","date":1715160573000,"content":"This study constructs an evaluation system of high-quality utilization of urban land (HUUL) and comprehensively adopts the entropy method, the kernel density estimation, and the geodetector model to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution and driving factors of the HUUL levels of 284 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2020. The measurement results show that during 2006-2020, the HUUL level showed an obvious upward trend, and the eastern region &gt; the central region &gt; the overall region &gt; the western region &gt; the northeastern region. According to the kernel density map, except for the region of the west, there is a trend of different degrees of enlargement of the difference in the main peak position of the HUUL level among cities in the other three regions, and there are individual cities in the eastern and western regions with much higher HUUL levels than the others; According to the results of factor detection, it can be seen that innovative utilization and open utilization are the endogenous dominant factors that promote the improvement of HUUL level, and the level of economic development is the exogenous dominant factor that supports the im-provement of high-quality utilization of urban land.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d6ba51c38c5a196b08b485cc794fd259325220aea09abe21d3e6b8f28737b9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
