Three small-scale hybrid subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSFCWs) planted with <i>Arundo donax</i> and one unplanted HSFCW were constructed near a water resource recovery facility at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. The purpose of the study was to determine the correlation between soil enzymatic activities and the removal of contaminants from domestic wastewater. Enzyme activity of phosphatase, protease, urease, and cellulase increased with an increase in temperature. A strong correlation between enzyme activities and TKN and surfactant removal was observed, whereas moderate correlation was observed with phosphate in planted HSFCW during the study. The correlation between COD removal and enzyme activities was low to moderate. In unplanted HSFCW, the correlation between enzyme activities and COD removal was negative, negligible to moderate to strong in the case of TKN, low to moderate in the case of phosphate, and negligible to low in the case of surfactants. The increased removal efficiency of the planted system compared with that of the unplanted system indicated a positive impact on enzyme activities with the growth of plants and their roots.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>Protease, urease, and cellulase activities:\nPlanted HSFCW exhibited higher protease, urease, and cellulase activities than unplanted, signifying enhanced breakdown.\nJuly displayed maximum enzyme activities, correlating with heightened biological breakdown in both systems.\nFluctuations in enzyme activities reflected seasonal changes, influencing nutrient degradation rates.\nPlanted HSFCW consistently showed higher enzymatic activities across protease, urease, and cellulase than unplanted.\n</p>","author":"Neetu Rani, \nKaruna N.
