{"title":"Mesoscale spatial variability of ichthyoplankton in the Southwest Atlantic during the autumn–winter period","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12660?af=R","date":1707108047000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying spatial heterogeneity in ichthyoplankton communities in the SW Atlantic, we examined for the first time the latitudinal and continental shelf–slope gradients in ichthyoplankton structure and oceanographic features in the Campos Basin during the relaxation phase of coastal upwellings (late autumn to early winter). This region, located on SE Brazil's continental margin, is the most productive offshore oil basin in the country and has ecological relevance owing to the existence of areas that experiences mesoscale (tens to hundreds of kilometers) processes (eddies, filaments, and upwelling) caused by the interaction of continental shelf and slope circulation with deep water masses. The present study collected a total of 3892 fish eggs and 10,030 larvae from 36 sampling stations, averaging 22 eggs per 100 m<sup>3</sup> and 56 larvae per 100 m<sup>3</sup>. A total of 250 taxa (5 for fish eggs and 248 for larvae) were identified, encompassing 80 families and 145 genera. Species distribution exhibited a considerable degree of spatial variability, which was related mostly to hydrological characteristics. In general, greater densities were associated with higher nutrient concentrations areas. Through distance-based Redundancy Analysis, some discriminating species were found to associate with certain areas of the continental shelf characterized by colder temperatures. The ichthyoplankton distribution patterns suggested a potential influence from mesoscale oceanographic fronts, specifically those that induce upwelling of the cold and nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water. Nonetheless, the methodologies used in this study faced challenges in distinctly identifying these processes.</p>","author":"Régis Santos, \nCristina Falcão, \nElisabeth Cabral","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"8d68b1b441a86205146d29b3f1d9ae3c73f11921240db9d7c1cbdcf8c42533e0","category":"Environment"}
