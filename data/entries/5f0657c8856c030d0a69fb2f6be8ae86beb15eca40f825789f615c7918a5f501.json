{"title":"Effect of Vehicle Cyclic Loading on the Failure of Canal Embankment on Soft Clay Deposit","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0249/v1","date":1712153253000,"content":"The rehabilitation of the road embankments alongside the irrigation canal, which is constructed on a Bangkok soft clay foundation, has resulted from land use growth for several decades. As a result, the embankment is always confronted with the problem of instability. Numerous articles have demonstrated that rapid drawdown of the water level in the canal could be one of the most significant reasons, whereas vehicle cyclic loading may potentially contribute to some effect of the embankment failure. To explore and assess the effects of the influence factors, the finite element method (FEM) and conventional and dynamic triaxial approaches were employed. The study also investigated the consequences of varying thicknesses of soft clay and cyclic loading with different magnitudes and frequencies. Consequently, cyclic loading can lead to an augmentation in strain distribution and excess pore water pressure. Likewise, more significant deformation and excess pore water pressure were induced by a lower frequency and deeper thickness of soft clay compared to a higher frequency and thinner thickness. In brief, vehicle repetitive loading is one of the primary factors contributing to embankment failure, with the threshold stress being approximately three-fourths of the undrained shear strength. In contrast, threshold strain is approximately one to two-fold of the monotonic strain condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f0657c8856c030d0a69fb2f6be8ae86beb15eca40f825789f615c7918a5f501","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
