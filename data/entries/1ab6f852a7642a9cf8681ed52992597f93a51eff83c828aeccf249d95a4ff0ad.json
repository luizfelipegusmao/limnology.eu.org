Co catalysts modified with Mn oxides are catalyst candidates of interest since they exhibit high C-C coupling activity in similar CO hydrogenation reactions [<a href=\"#ozae044.793-B2\">2</a>]. In general, CoO reduction under H<sub>2</sub> occurs at ∼400°C. However, the addition of Mn can shift the CoO reduction to higher temperatures allowing for controlled Co speciation with Mn concentration and reduction temperature. Therefore, an investigation of the Co species in Co-Mn oxide system is appealing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1ab6f852a7642a9cf8681ed52992597f93a51eff83c828aeccf249d95a4ff0ad","category":"Environment"}
