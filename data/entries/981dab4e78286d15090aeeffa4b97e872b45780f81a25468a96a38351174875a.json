{"title":"Image-Guided Radiation Therapy Is Equally Effective for Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0569/v1","date":1728387745000,"content":"Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are highly prevalent and a significant cause of morbidity. Image-guided su-perficial radiation therapy (IGSRT) uses integrated high-resolution dermal ultrasound to improve lesion visualization, but it is unknown whether efficacy varies by histology. This large retro-spective cohort study was conducted to determine the effect of tumor histology on freedom from recurrence in 20,069 biopsy-proven NMSC lesions treated with IGSRT, including 9,928 BCC (49.5%), 5,294 SCC (26.4%), 4,648 SCCIS (23.2%), and 199 lesions with â‰¥2 NMSCs (1.0%). Freedom from recurrence at 2, 4, and 6 years was 99.60%, 99.45%, and 99.45% in BCC; 99.58%, 99.49%, and 99.49% in SCC; and 99.96%, 99.80%, and 99.80% in SCCIS. Freedom from recurrence at 2, 4, and 6 years following IGSRT did not differ significantly comparing BCC vs. non-BCC or SCC vs. non-SCC but were slightly lower among SCCIS vs. non-SCCIS (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in freedom from recurrence when stratifying lesions by histologic subtype. This study demonstrates that there is no significant effect of histology on freedom from recurrence in IGSRT-treated NMSC except in SSCIS. These findings support IGSRT as a first-line therapeutic option for NMSC regardless of histology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"981dab4e78286d15090aeeffa4b97e872b45780f81a25468a96a38351174875a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
