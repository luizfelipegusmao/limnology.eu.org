{"title":"Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair of the Mitral Valve in Four Dogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1912/v1","date":1721816491000,"content":"Mitral valve disease is a common heart disease in dogs. The aim of this study was to describe the cases of dogs who underwent mitral valve repair using a v-clamp device and to provide their long-term follow-up data on cardiac function after mitral valve repair. Four dogs with mitral valve regurgitation who experienced coughing and dyspnea underwent surgical mitral valve repair between December 2023 and June 2024. The patients were evaluated by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Echocardiography revealed mitral valve leaflet regurgitation. Mitral valve repair was performed under general anesthesia using a v-clamp device introduced through an introducer wire guide. Echocardiography was conducted at baseline and the 6-month follow-up. Blood analysis results after surgical repair were normal. Follow-up echocardiography revealed no complications related to the procedure, with all dogs demonstrating improved respiratory signs and quality of life after repair. No adverse reactions were reported after surgery. A v-clamp device was used to repair mitral valve regurgitation in four dogs. Mitral valve repair using a v-clamp device is another treatment option for mitral valve disease in dogs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"601c66fea1621f65d967c39687eb2aa0a89d0745bc55f9fee687fe2fab51a121","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
