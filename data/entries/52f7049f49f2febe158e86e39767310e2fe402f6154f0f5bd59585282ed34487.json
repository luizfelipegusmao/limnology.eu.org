{"title":"Origin of Light","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1388/v1","date":1729231272000,"content":"Light is too important to say. It can be said that light fills the universe, and light also creates the universe. However, what is the origin of the light? What is the real essence of the light? In fact, these questions have not been answered clearly until now. This paper introduces an answer to these questions based on a novel understanding of the light, that is, the photon is composed of a pair of a positron and an electron, and so the photon is an extremely tiny electric dipole. The introduced electric dipole model of the photon has strong supports by observed phenomena, and can explain electromagnetic wave property of the light simply and accurately. In addition, many observed phenomena of the light, which have confused people for a long time, can also be explained by this novel understanding easily and effectively, such as “wave-particle duality of the photon”, “light bending”, “wavelength redshift”, “light pressure” and so-called “Light speed in vacuum is constant”, and so on. The author wrote this paper for helping to fine the natural truth earlier.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52f7049f49f2febe158e86e39767310e2fe402f6154f0f5bd59585282ed34487","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
