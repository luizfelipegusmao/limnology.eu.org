{"title":"Help or Hinder: Protein Host Factors That Impact HIV-1 Replication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1995/v1","date":1721891493000,"content":"Interactions between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the host factors or restriction factors of its target cells determine the cell’s susceptibility to, and outcome of, infection. Factors intrinsic to the cell are involved at every step of HIV-1’s replication cycle, contributing to productive infection and replication, or severely attenuating HIV-1’s chances of success. Furthermore, factors unique to certain cell types contribute to the differences in infection between these cell types. Understanding the involvement of these factors in HIV-1 infection is a key requirement for the development of anti-HIV-1 therapies. As the list of factors grows, and the dynamic interactions between these factors and the virus are elucidated, comprehensive and up-to-date summaries that recount the knowledge gathered after decades of research are beneficial to the field, displaying what is known so that researchers can build off the groundwork of others to investigate what is unknown. Herein, we aim to provide a review focusing on protein host factors, both well-known and relatively new, that impact HIV-1 replication in a positive or negative manner at each stage of the replication cycle, highlighting factors unique to HIV-1’s various target cell types where appropriate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7557d5a53e14430048228b78a5a6ba4d263326c73e4e6afe9bc76c41ee08c99c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
