Land use and land cover were quantified in the drainage area of streams located in the subtropical portion of the Atlantic Forest. We incubated <em>Nectandra megapotamica</em> leaves in streams and, after 30Â days, collected decomposing litter to analyze associated aquatic hyphomycetes and invertebrates. Dissolved oxygen was associated with the distribution of aquatic hyphomycetes. On the other hand, 4,068 aquatic invertebrates were found, assigned into five functional feeding groups (FFG). Native vegetation and water temperature were the variables responsible for structuring the invertebrate assemblages associated with detritus. Native vegetation, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved nitrogen were responsible for the structuring of FFGs. Streams that showed high rates of agriculture and urbanization in the drainage area showed low leaf mass loss. Our study demonstrated that the presence of anthropic uses and reduced native vegetation in the drainage area affected the assemblages of aquatic hyphomycetes and shredders, which are key players in the process of leaf decomposition in streams.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"391e9452344b03af13cb83b277d0eca66e2e1267a90aada05cdfa078e4ac54aa","category":"Environment"}
