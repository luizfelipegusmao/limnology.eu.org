{"title":"Mathematical Model of Tapered Thread Profile Made by Turning from Different Machinability Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0719/v1","date":1710249562000,"content":"High-precision conical threads are widely used in responsible joints in the drilling of oil and gas wells. Difficult underground drilling conditions due to the occurrence of significant mechanical loads and an aggressive environment in wells require the use of workable materials that are often difficult to machine. The huge need for such connections dictates the use of high-performance cutting tools, which means that high demands are placed on their effective geometric performance. The study describes the theoretical dependence of the profile precision of the tapered drill-string tool-joint threads of all standard sizes on the complex of a cutting tool geometric parameters and cutting tool setting accuracy. The experiments include an assessment of the geometric accuracy of the profile of the obtained NC23 thread connector, depending on the values of the installation angles and the declared tangential displacement of the standard threaded carbide insert.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d45ba80715c41b1fcfa5386bed27bd8219ce9c2fbc668e2cc7afd0a0925f23c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
