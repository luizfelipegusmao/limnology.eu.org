{"title":"Effect of a State-of-the-Art Thermal Massage System on Biomechanical Muscle Properties, Pain, and Disability in Individuals with Low Back Pain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1183/v1","date":1721125667000,"content":"Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions, resulting in continuous pain and disability. However, reliable evidence exists for only a few existing therapies for LBP. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a newly designed cutting-edge massage device that uses a mechanical sequential ascending method. Fifteen individuals with LBP underwent mechanical sequential ascending massage method with thermal therapy (AM-TH), thermal therapy (TH), rotating roller massage method with thermal therapy (RM-TH), and clinical assessments. We analysed the participants’ biomechanical muscle properties, pain, satisfaction, and disability measured immediately before and after treatment. There was a significant decline in tone and stiffness in the upper and lower regions of the paraspinal muscles when AM-TH was administered on three or more occasions (p &amp;lt; 0.05). AM-TH was more effective than RM-TH in reducing pain, with a significant reduction in pain over time (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Participants were most satisfied with RM-TH; over time, RM-TH was effective in improving participants’ disabilities (p &amp;lt; 0.05). AM-TH has been demonstrated to be effective in individuals with LBP, improving muscle tone and stiffness and reducing pain. Therefore, it may be a useful treatment for LBP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36931d2af690c3a4177ac6bc2979778686d064082ae531d7f0cd9ca1dc10c099","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
