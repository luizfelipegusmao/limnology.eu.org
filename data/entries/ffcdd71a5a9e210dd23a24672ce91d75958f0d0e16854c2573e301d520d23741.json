{"title":"PSXI-17 Comparison of enteric methane production between the respiration chamber and the CO2 method in Holstein heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/760/7757913?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to validate the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) method (CO<sub>2</sub>T) in comparison with the respiration chamber (RC) method for the measurement of enteric methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission. The study was conducted over 108 d with Holstein heifers [n = 10; initial body weight (BW) = 178 kg; and age, 7.7 mo). The study consisted of 3 consecutive measurement periods and each period consisted of 21 d of feed adaptation followed by 15 d of CH<sub>4</sub> measurement using the CO<sub>2</sub>T (3 d) and the RC method (12 d). The 55% timothy hay and 45% concentrate were fed twice daily at 1.2% to 1.5% of BW on an as-fed basis. The CO<sub>2</sub>T was used for 3 d during the morning and afternoon feeding. For the CO<sub>2</sub>T, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of exhaled breath from each animal were continuously analyzed by gas analyzers and recorded every 10 sec for 10 min per animal. The CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of the data were calculated and multiplied by daily CO<sub>2</sub> production of each animal to determine daily CH<sub>4</sub> production. Right after the CO<sub>2</sub>T measurement, CH<sub>4</sub> emission was measured using the RC method by the difference between the inlet and outlet CH<sub>4</sub> concentration of the RC. Statistical analyses were performed using the software R version 4.0.4. Differences in dry matter intake (DMI), CH<sub>4</sub> production, and CH<sub>4</sub> yield between the two methods were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. DMI was not different between the RC method and the CO<sub>2</sub>T measurements. The CH<sub>4</sub> production (L/d, L/kg BW<sup>0.75</sup>) and yield (L/kg DMI) determined by two methods were similar (127 vs 120 L/d, 2.05 vs 2.16 L/kg BW<sup>0.75</sup>, and 23.5 vs 21.6 L/kg DMI for RC vs CO<sub>2</sub>T, respectively). There was a positive relationship between DMI (kg/d) and CH<sub>4</sub> production (L/d) for both of the RC method (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and the CO<sub>2</sub>T (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Linear regression analysis of CH<sub>4</sub> production (L/d) between the RC method and the CO<sub>2</sub>T showed a moderate positive relationship (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Pearson correlation analyses showed a strong relationship between the RC method and the CO<sub>2</sub>T for CH<sub>4</sub> production (L/d; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the CH<sub>4</sub> production of Holstein heifers estimated by the CO<sub>2</sub>T did not differ from that measured by the RC method, and method agreement indices showed moderate positive correlations. The CO<sub>2</sub> method could be used as one of the alternative CH<sub>4</sub> measurement techniques comparable to the respiration chamber method.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ffcdd71a5a9e210dd23a24672ce91d75958f0d0e16854c2573e301d520d23741","category":"Environment"}
