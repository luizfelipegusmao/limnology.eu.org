{"title":"Advances in Connection Techniques for Raw Bamboo Structures â€“ A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1044/v1","date":1710774003000,"content":"While bamboo's sustainability and impressive mechanical properties make it suitable for structural use, its application is hindered by challenges in connection systems. Bamboo's hollow, thin-walled nature, dimensional variations, and anisotropic properties complicate connection design. Despite numerous studies and proposed connection types, a consensus on preferred bamboo connections remains elusive. Ideal connections for raw bamboo structures should be robust, economical, practical, simple, and easy to assemble. This paper reviews 62 scientific papers from the Scopus database published between 2003 and 2024, along with additional relevant references. It identifies research gaps, recommending further studies on bamboo connections considering factors like species, harvest age, treatment type, and node location. Analysis of failure modes and long-term behavior is essential to anticipate and mitigate risks associated with bamboo connections, ensuring durability, and minimizing maintenance needs. Lastly, developing universally accepted standards and codes for bamboo and bamboo connections is crucial for widespread adoption in the construction industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"527320595bb0528db9b5ae3e0ffc1bbb506f480028c5e5363d4cbe815c03e1e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
