{"title":"Beneficial Plant-Microbe Interactions and Stress Tolerance in Maize","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0306/v1","date":1717594193000,"content":"Beneficial microbes are crucial for improving crop adaptation and growth under vari-ous stresses. They enhance nutrient uptake, improve plant immune responses, and help plants tolerate stresses like drought, salinity, and heat. The yield potential of any crop is significantly influenced by its associated microbiomes and their potential to im-prove growth under different stressful environments. Therefore, itâ€™s crucial and excit-ing to understand the mechanisms of plant-microbe interactions. Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the primary staple foods worldwide, in addition to wheat and rice. Maize is also an industrial crop globally, contributing 83% of its production for use in feed, starch, and biofuel industries. Maize requires significant nitrogen fertilization to achieve opti-mal growth and yield. Maize plants are highly susceptible to heat, salinity, and drought stresses and require innovative methods to mitigate the harmful effects of environmental stresses and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. This review summarizes our current understanding of the beneficial interactions between maize plants and specific microbes. These beneficial microbes improve plant resilience to stress and in-crease productivity. For example, they regulate electron transport, downregulate cata-ase, and upregulate antioxidants. We also review the roles of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enhancing stress tolerance in maize. Additionally, we explore the application of these microbes in maize production and identify major knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to utilize the potential of beneficial microbes fully.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3111322590b3210d61b40553160688ce3512d47e594dd971621742378df6e09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
