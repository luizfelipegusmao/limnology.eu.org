{"title":"Assessing substrate degradation and bioconversion efficiency of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae: effect of diet composition on growth and development temperature.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1268/v1","date":1711017090000,"content":"Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) can use food by-products or residues as a growth substrate, and their use is considered a strategic solution to improve the sustainability and efficiency of animal production. BSFL need to be reared under controlled environmental conditions, as temperature can affect the welfare of the larvae and the efficiency of their bioconversion. The goal of this experiment was to test different diets: control, vegetable, carnivorous, omnivorous and to assess their effect on larval growth performance, chemical composition, and substrate temperature. BSFL (6-days-old) were randomly selected and allocated to one of the four diets for the entire experiment (8 days). The temperature in each container was measured twice daily using a thermal imaging camera. The vegetable diet led to significantly lower growth performance (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3caf3840f5f7084097af7045be10b0adbe1a099eca3b4467530ebc2fc5e4efd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
