{"title":"Limiting heterogeneity in cross-border data flow: Impact on domestic value chains stability and the role of innovation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308716","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Yang Liu, Yuan Zhang, Rui Jiang, Jing Cheng, JingJing Dai</p>\r\n\r\nAmidst growing skepticism towards globalization and rising digital trade, this study investigates the impact of Restrictions on Cross-Border Data Flows (RCDF) on Domestic Value Chains (DVCs) stability. As global value chains participation declines, the stability of DVCs—integral to internal economic dynamics—becomes crucial. This study situates within a framework exploring the role of innovation and RCDF in the increasingly interconnected global trade. Using a panel data fixed effect model, our analysis provides insights into the varying effects of RCDF on DVCs stability across countries with diverse economic structures and technological advancement levels. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between digital trade policies, value chain stability, and innovation. RCDF tend to disrupt DVCs by negatively impacting innovation, which necessitates proactive policy measures to mitigate these effects. In contrast, low-income countries experience a less detrimental impact; RCDF may even aid in integrating their DVCs into Global Value Chains, enhancing economic stability. It underscores the need for dynamic, adaptable policies and global collaboration to harmonize digital trade standards, thus offering guidance for policy-making in the context of an interconnected global economy.","author":"Yang Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0b82055a730c56d4ccb00624418d72b6946691d0084d05df79e471de1e364575","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
