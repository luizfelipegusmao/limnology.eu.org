It has proven particularly helpful in revealing the molecular detail of membrane proteins and protein complexes that have been refractory to investigation by crystallographic techniques. Many of these molecules, including GPCRs, ion channels and neuropathy-associated fibrils are important drug targets. As a result, there has been a rapid expansion in the use of cryoEM in biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and a concomitant drive for higher throughput and efficiency. There have been a range of developments across sample preparation, data collection and processing to meet this demand.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0696cd6186909446311e492bd0dddd7a943015eb5990eee662a08c3da20d39de","category":"Environment"}
