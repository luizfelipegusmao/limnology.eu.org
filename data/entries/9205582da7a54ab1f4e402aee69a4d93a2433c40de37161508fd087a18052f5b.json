{"title":"Effector Cs02526 from Ciboria shiraiana induces cell death and modulates plant immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/579/7675301?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sclerotinia disease is one of the most devastating fungal diseases worldwide, as it reduces the yields of many economically important crops. Pathogen-secreted effectors play crucial roles in infection processes. However, key effectors of <span>Ciboria shiraiana</span>, the pathogen primarily responsible for sclerotinia disease in mulberry (<span>Morus</span> spp.), remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized the effector Cs02526 in <span>C. shiraiana</span> and found that Cs02526 could induce cell death in a variety of plants. Moreover, Cs02526-induced cell death was mediated by the central immune regulator brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1, dependent on a 67-amino acid fragment. Notably, Cs02526 homologs were widely distributed in hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic phytopathogenic fungi, but the homologs failed to induce cell death in plants. Pretreatment of plants with recombinant Cs02526 protein enhanced resistance against both <span>C. shiraiana</span> and <span>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</span>. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of <span>C. shiraiana</span> was diminished upon spraying plants with synthetic dsRNA-<span>Cs02526</span>. In conclusion, our findings highlight the cell death-inducing effector Cs02526 as a potential target for future biological control strategies against plant diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"9205582da7a54ab1f4e402aee69a4d93a2433c40de37161508fd087a18052f5b","category":"Environment"}
