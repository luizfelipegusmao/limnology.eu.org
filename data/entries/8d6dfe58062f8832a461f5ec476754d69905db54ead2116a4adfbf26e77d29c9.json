{"title":"The movement patterns and foraging resources of Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) in Franz Josef Land archipelago and connectivity with the Kara‐Barents Sea population","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13103?af=R","date":1705387769000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Franz Josef Land population of the Atlantic walrus (<i>Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus</i>) remains one of the least studied. Here, 26 walruses were tagged with satellite-linked radio transmitters in Franz Josef Land archipelago and Victoria Island in summer-autumn 2020 and 2021 to assess movements patterns and area utilization. In addition, 65 grab samples were taken to evaluate macrobenthic foraging resources. The mean duration of data records was 53 ± 27 days. The walruses traveled on average 29 ± 13.5 km/day with a mean speed of 1.2 ± 0.6 km/hr. The travel speed and distance were statistically different for male, female, and immature walruses. The individuals tagged on Victoria Island remained in the vicinity of the island, while walruses tagged within the Franz Josef Land archipelago moved between the islands, utilizing the entire area for foraging trips. One walrus migrated from Franz Josef Land to Novaya Zemlya in late November, providing evidence of connectivity with the Kara-Barents Sea population. The area was characterized by high average biomass of macrobenthos. Bivalve mollusks, <i>Hiatella arctica</i>, were dominating macrobenthic biomass, likely being the main foraging resource for the walruses. Further observations are needed to better understand winter behaviors of Franz Josef Land walruses and possible impacts of climate change on movement patterns.</p>","author":"Maria Solovyova, \nAnna Gebruk, \nSvetlana Artemyeva, \nViatcheslav V.
