{"title":"Preliminary Report of Nationwide COVID-19 Vaccine Compensation in Taiwan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0338/v1","date":1715094394000,"content":"The potential adverse effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations raise public concerns. Data from Taiwan’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) can provide valuable insights. This study analyzed preliminary application data for COVID-19 vaccine compensation in Taiwan’s VICP, focusing on applicants receiving vaccines between March 2021 and June 2022. Among the 2941 adverse events, 113 cases (3.8%) were deemed causally associated with vaccination, 313 (10.6%) were indeterminate, and 2515 (85.5%) had no causal association. Nearly half (47.6%) of applicants were over 60 years old, and 76.6% had a history of preexisting chronic dis-eases. Among the 426 vaccine-associated or indeterminate cases, the most common causes were hematological diseases and thrombosis. There were 920 mortality cases reported, and 97.4% were unassociated with vaccination. Only five deaths were judged to be associated with the COVID-19 vaccination, all involving the adenovirus vector vaccine and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. In conclusion, most compensation applications were not causally linked to vaccination. Compared to other countries, the number of applications in Taiwan’s VICP is relatively high. These findings may indicate a need to adjust the application requirements for compensation in Taiwan’s program.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b993d500da98d0d3802204dc6565ce16f71290a971df0dfcce37b3116c45b476","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
