{"title":"Working horse welfare in Senegal is linked to owner’s socioeconomic status, their attitudes and belief in horse sentience","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309149","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Mactar Seck, Gemma Carder, Jennifer Wathan, Marcela Randau, Kate Fletcher, Leanne Proops</p>\r\n\r\nThe role that working equids play in both rural and urban communities in low and middle-income countries is invaluable. They contribute to daily tasks such as carrying food, water and people, support income generation, and are of social and cultural importance. Despite their importance, global standards of working equid welfare are low. Many variables can impact the welfare status of animals under human care, but often specific factors are explored in isolation. Factors can include, but are not limited to an owner’s socioeconomic status and their attitudes and beliefs towards animals. In this study we assessed the relationships between 1.) Attitudes and belief in horse sentience, 2.) Owner’s socioeconomic status (including household income, coverage of needs and education) and 3.) Horse welfare status. The study, consisting of an owner questionnaire and a welfare assessment of their horses, was conducted in three regions in Senegal; participants included 299 owners and their horses. Overall, our findings show that a more positive attitude towards horses, stronger belief in horse sentience, a higher standard of living and a greater ability to cover the needs of the household was associated with more positive horse welfare. A stronger belief in horse sentience was a significant predictor of horse’s body condition, larger households and those with a higher income were more likely to own a horse in good general health. Our findings demonstrate a complex relationship between working horse welfare, their owner’s attitudes, and their socioeconomic status. It is the first study we are aware of that has explored the relationships between these different variables. The findings from this study provide valuable insights into the interconnected factors which impact upon working equid welfare in Senegal and potentially more widely.","author":"Mactar Seck","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6386a914b29b628fab131134597fd64c99732f80fee838d6957d4e0229e2624c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
