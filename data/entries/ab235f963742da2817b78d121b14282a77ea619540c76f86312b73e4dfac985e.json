{"title":"Open-Source Indoor Horizontal Grow Structure Designs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2001/v1","date":1724834657000,"content":"Agrivoltaic agrotunnels are currently designed for high density grow walls that are not amenable to bush berries or root crops. Commercial grow bins provide deeper substrates for produce with more root systems but have high costs per unit growing area. To overcome the economic limitations of grow bins, this study applies the distributed manufacturing open-source design paradigm to develop four designs for low-cost open source structures. The designs target root vegetables and bush fruit specifically to be adopted by remote communities with limited or no outdoor growing environment to offset the market price for imported fresh produce. The indoor growing designs provide the necessary structure for supporting grow light and grow bins and enabled the transplanted berry plants to flower and produced fruits. They provide a comparable amount (110L) or more of grow volume from 106 to 192 L. The water reservoir volume for the commercial system (62 L) and grow area (0.5 m³) is surpassed by all new designs that range from 64 to 192 L and 0.51 to 0.76 m³, respectively. These superior properties are possible with material costs for all four designs that save more than 90% of the economic cost of the commercial systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab235f963742da2817b78d121b14282a77ea619540c76f86312b73e4dfac985e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
