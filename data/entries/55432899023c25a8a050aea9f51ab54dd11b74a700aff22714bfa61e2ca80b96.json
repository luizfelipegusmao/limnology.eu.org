{"title":"Implementation of Portable Digital Chest X-Ray Machine for Tuberculosis Contact Tracing in Oyo and Osun States, Nigeria: A Formative Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1768/v1","date":1716812888000,"content":"This paper presents the formative assessment to implement mobile portable chest X-ray (PDX) machines for Tuberculosis (TB) contact tracing in Oyo and Osun States, Nigeria. This descriptive qualitative study was carried out in 8 Local Government Areas, and 24 FGDs and 33 KIIs were conducted using a 4-stage sampling technique to select participants. Validated transcribed notes were entered and analysed using Nvivo. The respondents' ages ranged from 17-85 years, with a mean age of 42.08Â±14.9 years, and 4.0% had a postgraduate degree. The majority of the government officials stated that deploying the PDX machine intervention at the community level is the best means as it offers a level of convenience to the community members in the sense that there will be limited disruption to their daily activities as well as zero concerns about the cost of transportation to the health facility. The portable X-ray machine intervention should be implemented at the community level for contact tracing to allow more TB contacts living with the index patient to be screened. However, the PDX machine can also be set up in a special location, and the TB contacts can be invited for the screening.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55432899023c25a8a050aea9f51ab54dd11b74a700aff22714bfa61e2ca80b96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
