This might serve as a method for early detection of HABs. There has been no report of the detection of behavioral abnormalities of fish exposed to harmful algae using machine learning. In this study, the behavior of <i>Oryzias javanicus</i> (Java medaka) exposed in a stepwise manner to the HAB species <i>Karenia mikimotoi</i> at densities of 0 cells mL<sup>−1</sup> (control), 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> (nonlethal), and 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> (sublethal) was recorded for 30 min at each cell density using two digital cameras connected to a software that tracked behavioral metrics of fish. The level of anomaly in the behavior of Java medaka was then analyzed using one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) to determine whether the behavioral changes could be considered abnormal. The results revealed abnormal swimming behavior evidenced by an increase of swimming speed, a decrease of shoaling behavior, and a greater depth of swimming in Java medaka exposed especially to the sublethal <i>K</i>. <i>mikimotoi</i> density. The medaka exposed to <i>K</i>. <i>mikimotoi</i> also displayed physical deformities of their gills that were thought to have caused their abnormal behavior. This supposition was confirmed by further analysis using OC-SVM because the behavior of groups exposed to nonlethal and sublethal densities of <i>K</i>. <i>mikimotoi</i> were considered abnormal compared with that of the control groups. The results of this study show the possibility of using this system for early and real-time detection of HABs.</p>","author":"Abrianna Elke Chairil, \nYuki Takai, \nYosuke Koba, \nShinya Kijimoto, \nYukinari Tsuruda, \nIk‐Joon Kang, \nYuji Oshima, \nYohei Shimasaki","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Methods: Table of Contents","siteHash":"1f94d009c9004887a6eb995bba0123a0db9011ce2034714a79b9376dbd1edfea","entryHash":"aa2ed6b10c97c9eea4bcc7c9a6e26a80602a4e49794a552a5201e2166b79fce2","category":"Environment"}
