This study aimed to explore how sadness and fear in the context of public emergency influence moral judgments. This research first induced feelings of sadness and fear by videos about public events and music, and then used moral scenarios from the CNI model to assess participants’ moral thinking. In Study 1, participants were divided into sadness group and neutral group, while in Study 2, participants were divided into fear group and neutral group. During the experiment, participants were exposed to different videos related to public events to induce the corresponding emotions, and emotional music was continuously played throughout the entire experiment. Participants were then asked to answer questions regarding moral judgments. The results showed that based on CNI model, sadness induced in the context of public events significantly increased C parameter, without affecting N or I parameter. Fear increased I parameter, without affecting C or I parameter. That is, sadness and fear induced in the context of public events can influence moral judgments. Specifically, sadness increases individuals’ sensitivity to consequence, and fear increases the general preference for inaction in moral judgments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db75262d907997244eb6428f987ef32fc14fc06ee63a94e7e720284ec42ed3cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
