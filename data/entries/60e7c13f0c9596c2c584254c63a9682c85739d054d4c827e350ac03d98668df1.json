Investors, facing an increasingly complex landscape, require detailed insights to make informed decisions and navigate market volatility. Moreover, amid the ongoing digital transformation, understanding the operational dynamics of technology companies is critical for policymakers and regulatory bodies to create frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring market stability. In the current context, characterized by rapid technological advancements, market uncertainties, and evolving consumer demands, the need for a comprehensive study on the operational efficiency of NASDAQ-listed technology companies is more pertinent than ever.\nObjective of our study is to identify relationships and patterns among selected financial metrics to assess the operational efficiency of NASDAQ-listed technology companies between 2011 to 2023. Financial metrics used in the study include following variables namely revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, research, and development expenses, selling and general administrative expenses, and operating income. Johansen's cointegration methodology is employed to unveil long-term relationships and equilibrium adjustments among the considered variables. Results of our study underscore the paramount importance of efficiently managing the cost of goods sold (COGS) for achieving superior operating performance among these leading technology firms. The findings point to a nuanced interplay among these operational metrics, highlighting the interconnectedness and sustained relationships among them. This suggests that the top technology companies exhibit a sophisticated understanding of the dynamics between these variables, allowing them to navigate the complexities of the industry with strategic finesse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60e7c13f0c9596c2c584254c63a9682c85739d054d4c827e350ac03d98668df1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
