{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Rapid and Less Invasive Methods for A2A2 Dairy Cattle Genotyping and A2 Milk Purity Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0912/v1","date":1723547609000,"content":"This study analyzed methodologies for identifying β-casein genotypes in dairy cows and the purity of A2 fermented milk. The research was justified by the need for quick and accurate techniques for herd screening and A2 milk quality control. The methodology included the development of an ELISA test to detect β-casein A1 in fermented milk and the evaluation of a commercial Lateral Flow Immuno Assay (LFIA) to identify A2A2 genotypes and the purity of A2 milk. The results showed that the ELISA test had high sensitivity and specificity (100%) in detecting β-casein A1. The LFIA test was 100% effective in identifying A2A2 genotypes and verifying the purity of A2 milk with a minimum detectable contamination of 5% for raw milk and 10% for fermented milk. Compared to traditional genotyping, these methods proved to be highly reliable and more practical for large-scale screening. It was concluded that the ELISA and LFIA were valuable tools for ensuring the quality and authenticity of A2 milk, meeting the demands of producers and consumers for safe and healthy dairy products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"429d0553f00d1c6a5aa24977af35645ec9029f62926fa1208c0c8fe70782be6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
