Very little is known about the role snow plays in the thermal dynamics of dystrophic lakes. We conducted a whole lake experiment on a small, 8 m deep dystrophic bog lake in northern Wisconsin, where we removed all snowfall over two consecutive winters. Due to weather variability, only 1 year had predominantly black ice. Under these conditions, the lake rapidly cooled in early and mid-winter, compared to snow covered conditions that insulated the lake from heat loss. The lake also rapidly gained heat in late winter resulting in isothermal conditions well in advance of ice-off. These results show how water clarity modulates the influence of snow on under-ice thermal dynamics, which is relevant to futures with snow droughts.</p>","author":"H. A. Dugan, \nR. Ladwig, \nP.
